    <summary>The context provided is a code snippet of "Hello, world!" and a link to a question related to Bitcoin transaction version on Bitcoin Stackexchange. The author shares an example of how transaction version can be used to bet on something that involves two outcomes without any involvement of centralized server or trusting third parties. The approach involves creating a multisig address using two public keys, one entered by the user and the other from mempool, followed by a funding transaction that uses version bits to indicate if Alice wants to bet on India or Australia. The author seeks confirmation if everything looks okay until the funding transaction and asks if others think more numbers in transaction version should be allowed. A link to Github with the full example is also shared.</summary>
