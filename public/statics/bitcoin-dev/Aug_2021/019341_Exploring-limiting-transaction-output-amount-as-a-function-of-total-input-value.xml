    <summary>In an email exchange between Zac and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss a proposal for the ability to control some coin with two private keys, where spending is limited over time for one key while spending is unrestricted for the other. Zac expresses concerns about ZmnSCPxj's counterproposal, which uses `nSequence` in relative-locktime mode but has disadvantages due to its obviousness and limits on the number of windows. Zac believes that implementing consensus changes in order to support the proposed functionality would be preferable over ZmnSCPxj's counterproposal. However, ZmnSCPxj argues that the proposed functionality can be implemented today without any consensus change using `nSequence`-in-relative-locktime-mode and suggests that wallets should use it as an alternate anti-fee-sniping mechanism. They agree that the functionality is desirable, but there are gaps between their proposals that need to be addressed.</summary>
