    <summary>In order to visually distinguish different addresses, a norm of using the checksum for bright colors, weights, sizes, capitalizations, and/or spacing of the characters of the address could work well. Although Ethereum uses mixed case to differentiate addresses, there is an opportunity to add another digest by making the checksum more visually distinctive, which would reduce collisions and errors. The checksum at the end of the address is currently sufficient for differentiating error.</summary>
