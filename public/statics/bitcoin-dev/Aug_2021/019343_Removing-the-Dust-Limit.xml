    <summary>The email suggests mitigations to the dust problem in Bitcoin, particularly regarding the scalability of the UTXO set and corresponding Merkle proofs/witnesses. The author suggests separating dust UTXOs, along with burned and non-standard UTXOs, into secondary storage with their hashes in a separate Merkle accumulator design. This idea was first suggested in a previous draft and supported in a research paper proposing a two-tier data structure for UTXOs. The email also recommends selecting existing dust UTXOs with large UTXOs whenever possible and choosing the smallest UTXO that doesn't create dust when there are no dust UTXOs available and the user is not willing to leave the dust as a fee. The author concludes by thanking the recipient for their time and apologizes if they missed any regulations.</summary>
