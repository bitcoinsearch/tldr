    <summary>Alekos Filini, a member of the Bitcoin development community, announced the launch of bip174.org, a PSBT viewer and editor that runs in the browser. The Airgapped Wallet Community has requested the addition of output of UR-based animated QRs to the website, as an increasing number of advanced hardware and software wallets are now supporting Airgapped UR/QR PSBT signing. There are multiple libraries in multiple languages available to support these UR QRs, making it easy to output them from the site. Additionally, some major web-based transaction coordinator services are planning to add browser scanning of PSBTs on laptops with cameras. Christopher Allen provided a video example of this in action between the Foundation Devices hardware wallet and Blue Wallet.</summary>
