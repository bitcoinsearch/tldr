    <summary>A PSBT viewer and editor that runs in the browser called bip174.org has been launched, according to an email announcement. The website allows users to paste a PSBT to see its content, and whenever a change is made to one of the various fields the PSBT is automatically updated. There are a few examples built in if users just want to quickly try it out. Daniela Brozzoni and Alekos have been working on this tool because they felt the need for something that would allow them to easily dump/modify the PSBTs they work with in their day-to-day job. They decided to build this webapp taking inspiration from the great bip32.org. The webapp is made entirely in Rust compiled to WASM. Contributions, feedback, and bug reports are all welcome, and the source code is available on GitHub.</summary>
