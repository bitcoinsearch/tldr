    <summary>A developer has posted a question on the Bitcoin Core mailing list, inquiring about the functionality of the InterruptHTTPRPC function in src/httprpc.cpp. The developer is using Bitcoin Core's HTTP RPC server as the basis for their own application and noticed that the function only calls LogPrint() without doing anything else. They are curious if this method is just a stub or if the HTTP RPC server supports interrupting the event loop at this time. Another user suggested that the developer open an issue on Github to get a more detailed response.</summary>
