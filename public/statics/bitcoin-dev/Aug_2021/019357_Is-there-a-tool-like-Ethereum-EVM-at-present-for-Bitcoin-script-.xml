    <summary>A user on the bitcoin-dev mailing list asked if there is a tool similar to Ethereum's EVM that allows users to write Bitcoin scripts in a syntax like Python and translate them into Bitcoin original scripts. They felt that Bitcoin script programming is not friendly to programmers due to its reverse Polish expression and unfriendly opcode expression ability, which has affected the promotion of Bitcoin in the technical community. In response, Gijs van Dam suggested using higher-level languages like Miniscript, Min.sc, Simplicity, or Sapio, which all compile to Bitcoin Script. The user spent some time learning Miniscript and wondered if it is a brand new Bitcoin scripting language and whether they need to compile it into a Bitcoin OP_CODE script. They also found a compiler implemented in C++ on GitHub by sipa, which translates the policy language into Miniscript. Overall, the discussion centers around ways to make Bitcoin script programming more accessible and programmer-friendly.</summary>
