    <summary>A new Romanian wordlist for Bip-0039 has been created and updated files have been attached. The list was reviewed by s7r who suggested that the words be uniquely identified using the first 4 letters, which has been done. They also removed words starting with the letters Q, W, X, and Y because most of the words used in Romanian were borrowed from other languages (mostly English). Additionally, they removed incorrect or non-Romanian words such as _adesiv_ (changed to *adeziv*), _topmodel_, _walkman_, _web_, _yachting_, and _acvaplanare_. Between _acvatic_ and _acvaplanare_, only _acvatic_ remains in the list. The entire word list and some statistics about the word distribution can be found in the attached file. The wordlist is now complete and correct.The given context consists of a list of 2048 words, ranging from three to twelve characters in length. The first four characters of the words are all distinct groups. The number of words with each length is as follows: 42 (3 characters), 186 (4 characters), 595 (5 characters), 549 (6 characters), 383 (7 characters), 199 (8 characters), 53 (9 characters), 34 (10 characters), 5 (11 characters), and 2 (12 characters). Words starting with the letter 'A' make up 7.86% of the list, with a total of 161 words. Among these words, there are 3 three-letter words (1.86%), 10 four-letter words (6.21%), 41 five-letter words (25.47%), 37 six-letter words (22.98%), 35 seven-letter words (21.74%). The rest of the context consists of a random collection of words with no particular pattern or topic. It includes words related to various fields such as science, literature, technology, and many others.The context provides information about the frequency of words starting with different letters. It includes the number of words and percentage of words for each letter in the English alphabet ranging from A to H. The data is presented in a table-like format with separate entries for each letter and word length. For example, the entry for letter A shows that there are 26 words (16.15%) starting with this letter, with only 1.27% of them being in the dictionary. Similarly, the entry for letter B shows that there are 112 words starting with it, with the majority (39.29%) being 5 characters long. The data also includes the percentages of words that are in the dictionary for each letter and word length. For instance, the entry for letter C shows that 33.33% of its 5-character words are in the dictionary, while only 0.15% of its 10-character words are. Overall, the context provides a quantitative analysis of the frequency and dictionary usage of words starting with different letters and word lengths in the English language.At 09:07:05 on August 5th, a log was recorded detailing the frequency of words starting with various letters. The log includes the number of words and percentage of those words that start with each letter, as well as the number of characters in those words and the percentage of those words that are present in a given dictionary. In total, there were 80 words starting with "I", with 25 words containing seven characters and making up 1.22% of the dictionary. There were also 19 words starting with "J", with six words containing five characters and making up 0.29% of the dictionary.

Finally, there were 160 words starting with "P", with 47 containing five or six characters and making up 4.60% of the dictionary.The given context lists the frequencies of words starting with each letter of the alphabet.

The letter 'R' has the highest number of words starting with it, followed by 'S', 'T', 'Z', 'U', 'V', 'P', 'Q', 'W', 'X', and 'Y'. The word length ranges from 3 to 12 characters.
