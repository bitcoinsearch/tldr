    <summary>The email suggests that it is possible to achieve unconditional soundness with the use of El-Gamal commitment scheme. It also proposes a softforkable design for Bitcoin that maintains a non-CT block and a separately-committed CT block. The use of "burn" transactions would allow funds to be transferred between the legacy non-CT block and the CT block, while keeping the total amount of funds in all CT outputs known in the legacy non-CT block. This approach would ensure unconditional privacy and computational soundness, with the first person to break it only being able to steal the CT coins, not all Bitcoin coins. The dust limit is suggested to still make sense to keep for now.</summary>
