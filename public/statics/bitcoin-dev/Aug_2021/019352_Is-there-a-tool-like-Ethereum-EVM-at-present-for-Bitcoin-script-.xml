    <summary>The author of a post on an online forum is seeking information about a tool similar to Ethereum EVM. The tool would allow users to write bitcoin scripts in a syntax similar to Python or other programming languages and translate them into the original bitcoin scripts. The author suggests that this would be like inventing a new programming language.However, the author also notes that bitcoin script programming is based on reverse Polish expression, which may not be friendly to programmers. Despite the rich opcode expression abilities of bitcoin, its unfriendly nature has hindered its promotion in the technical community.The author ends the post with a request for feedback on this topic.</summary>
