    <summary>The context discusses the tradeoff between unconditional soundness and unconditional privacy in cryptocurrency transactions. It is stated that Monero has chosen the alternate tradeoff path with unconditional privacy but only computational soundness. The advantage of unhidden amounts, as with current bitcoin, is that there is unconditional soundness. However, it is believed that there is a fundamental tradeoff between unconditional soundness and unconditional privacy. The discussion also touches on the issue of proofs being twice as big in the swap tree version, but newer UTXOs would have substantially shorter proofs. The point is made that there may be a point where there are so many old UTXOs that proofs would be smaller on average in the swap tree version versus the dead-leaf version. Two links are provided for further information: one to a paper that claims CT (confidential transactions) can be made computationally hiding and binding, and another to a discussion about tradeoffs between different accumulator designs in utreexo. In the discussion, it is noted that with a swap tree, old things that never move more or less naturally "fall leftward", although there are reasons to prefer alternative designs.</summary>
