    <summary>LifeHash is a visual hashing algorithm that is open-source and has various desirable qualities. It includes a visual indicator as well as a readable fingerprint value, making it an alternative worth considering. LifeHash has high complexity, good aesthetics, printer-friendly color gamut, and robustness when transformed to grayscale. BlockchainCommons uses LifeHash for all their projects. The company's Principal Architect, Christopher Allen, has shared links to the LifeHash overview and reference code, a YouTube explainer, and their LifeHash UX best practices. The Object Identity Block is the focus of their best practices.</summary>
