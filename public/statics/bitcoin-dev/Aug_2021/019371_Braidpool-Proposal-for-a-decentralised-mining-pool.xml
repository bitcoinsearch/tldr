    <summary>The Pool2Win team has been working on developing a decentralized mining pool called Braidpool, which aims to overcome the issues faced by P2Pool and facilitate building a futures market for hashrate. The full proposal for Braidpool can be found on GitHub. Braidpool offers several key features, including lower variance for smaller miners even when large miners join the pool, miners building their own blocks just like in P2Pool, payouts requiring a constant size blockspace independent of the number of miners in the pool, and providing building blocks for enabling a futures market of hash rates. The developers note that Bitcoin P2Pool's usage has steadily declined over the years, negatively impacting Bitcoin's decentralization. They propose a solution that uses a DAG of shares replicated at all miners, which is then used to compute rewards for miners. Rewards are paid out using one-way payment channels by an anonymous hub communicating with the miners using Tor's hidden services. This construction ensures that neither the hub nor the miners can cheat. According to a blog post on the Pool2Win website, the team also provides details on trading hashrate. The team's ultimate goal is to provide a more efficient and fair mining experience for all participants while also contributing to the decentralization of Bitcoin.</summary>
