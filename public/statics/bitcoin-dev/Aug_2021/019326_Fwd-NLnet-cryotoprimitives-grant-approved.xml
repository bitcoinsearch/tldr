    <summary>NLnet has approved the EUR 50,000 grant for Libre-SOC to research and develop Draft cryptographic primitives and instructions for the newly-open Power ISA. Unlike RISC-V, the OpenPOWER initiative is a much less crowded space and does not require non-transparent membership of OPF in order to submit ISA RFCs. This transparent process allows Libre-SOC to take apart strategic cryptographic algorithms back to their mathematical roots, apply Vector ISA design analysis, and create a resultant ISA ideally suited to the experimental development of future cryptographic algorithms for use in securing wallets and other purposes related to blockchain management. The aim is to design instructions suitable for "big integer math" that would be better suited to a general-purpose Vector Supercomputer ISA, which is what they are developing. Libre-SOC is looking for participation or collaboration on this project and has funding available.</summary>
