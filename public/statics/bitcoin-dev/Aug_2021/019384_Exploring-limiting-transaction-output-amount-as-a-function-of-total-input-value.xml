    <summary>In this email exchange, Zac and ZmnSCPxj discuss the potential reduction of privacy in a proposal due to the introduction of a new type of transaction that is different from a standard transaction. This would reduce the anonymity set for everyone and cause identifiable payment and change outputs. The specifics of how the output is encumbered must be visible on-chain, further reducing privacy. Zac suggests that some clever MAST-fu could help resolve these issues, but he lacks the technical skills to determine if it's possible. ZmnSCPxj points Zac towards covenant efforts with MAST-integration, developed by people such as aj and RubenSomsen. He notes that there are numerous proposals and cannot point to one that seems most likely to gain traction.</summary>
