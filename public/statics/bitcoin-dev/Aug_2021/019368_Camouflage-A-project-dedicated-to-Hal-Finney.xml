    <summary>A developer named Prayank has initiated a project to improve privacy in Bitcoin, which he hopes will be useful for users and developers alike. The project includes an issue and pull request tracking system related to privacy in different Bitcoin projects, a blog section for Prayank's opinions on privacy issues, and a "Hall of Fame" section to recognize the contributions of developers working on privacy-related improvements. The project is not intended to become a paid newsletter or have sponsors, but contributions to make the website better are welcome. Prayank has also provided links to a discussion/issue on Github and an email he sent about privacy-related topics in July. The project's website is currently hosted on Github pages and will be moved to a new repository over the weekend.</summary>
