    <summary>On August 28th, 2021, ts via bitcoin-dev proposed the idea of adding an additional text-based checksum to Bitcoin addresses and requested feedback from the community on the feasibility of implementing it. However, Pieter, a member of the community, expressed confusion about the need for such a feature. Pieter argued that random typos are already automatically protected against through the checksum, and comparing a few characters of the address is just as effective as any other method. Pieter also pointed out that maliciously constructed addresses could easily have the external checksum collide and suggested that adding another checksum might actually make it easier for attackers. Finally, Pieter noted that adding a visual or color-coding checksum might be more useful than another text-based one, but even then, getting the ecosystem to adopt such changes would be difficult.</summary>
