    <summary>In a recent email sent to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user asked if there was a tool available that allows users to write Bitcoin scripts in a syntax similar to Python. They suggested that Bitcoin script programming is based on reverse Polish expression which is not friendly to programmers and has affected the promotion of Bitcoin in the technical community. In response to this, Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, provided a list of higher-level languages that can compile to Bitcoin Script, including Miniscript, Min.sc, Simplicity, and Sapio. While these are not virtual machines, they offer simpler ways to write Bitcoin scripts. Sapio, specifically, is "just" Rust and may be the best fit for some users. However, Simplicity is another extension to Bitcoin Script that offers more simplicity. It should be noted that these extensions are not currently part of the consensus code and therefore are not widely used. The email also includes links to resources such as the Bitcoin Stackexchange, which can be helpful for answering questions related to Bitcoin development.</summary>
