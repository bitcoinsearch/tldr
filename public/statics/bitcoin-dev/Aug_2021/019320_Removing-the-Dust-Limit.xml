    <summary>There is a paper available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf which claims to make CT computationally hiding and binding. This can be found in section 4.6 of the document. If you are interested in utreexo, there is a discussion available at https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/discussions/249?sort=new which talks about the tradeoffs between different accumulator designs. One design discussed is the swap tree, where old items that never move tend to "fall leftward". However, there are reasons why alternative designs might be preferred.</summary>
