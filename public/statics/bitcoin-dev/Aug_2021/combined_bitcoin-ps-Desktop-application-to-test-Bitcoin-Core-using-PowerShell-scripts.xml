    <summary>The author has been working on an intern project related to Bitcoin Core and .NET projects, which is almost ready for its first release. Seeking feedback from developers in those areas, the project repository can be found at https://github.com/prayank23/bitcoin-ps. The project is inspired by Burp Suite and aims to test privacy and security of Bitcoin Core RPC using GUI. The author used WPF instead of Avalonia to save time but plans to use it in the future to make bitcoin-ps cross-platform. A proof of concept shared in milestones link works fine on Ubuntu with no pwsh installed, but there is an issue that the author hopes will be resolved soon at https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/4361.There are four default scripts included in the project: CPU_RAM_sendtoaddress.ps1, onlynet_i2p.ps1, lock_unspent.ps1, and custom_change_rbf.ps1. These scripts check CPU and RAM usage, make outbound connections to onion peers while onlynet=i2p is used without any proxy, check if locked UTXOs are unlocked on restart, and compare the inputs for Tx1 and Tx2 where Tx1 is RBF transaction with 1 input, 2 outputs (custom change address with label), and Tx2 is a replacement transaction, respectively.The author chose to use PowerShell as they have worked on similar projects in the past. Using different languages locally doesn't impact Bitcoin Core or require any changes, and PowerShell is easier to write. Developers who use PowerShell scripts in their projects could relate to it, find interesting and maybe start contributing to Bitcoin Core. Additionally, it can be done using bash or maybe python scripts as well.For the author, using PowerShell in this project is like meeting a college friend and exploring new places. Lastly, the author expresses gratitude to everyone involved in Blockchain Commons and suggests starting with "Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line" if readers have recently started reading about Bitcoin. The author wishes to work on DEX and OfflineTx even after the internship ends to complete by the end of this year.</summary>
