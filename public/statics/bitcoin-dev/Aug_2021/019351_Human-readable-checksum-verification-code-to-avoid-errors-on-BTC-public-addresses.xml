    <summary>In an email exchange between Karl and TS, Karl suggested that using a checksum for bright colors, weights, sizes, capitalizations, and/or spacing of the characters of the address could be a good way to make different addresses more visually distinct. He provided an example of Ethereum which uses mixed case to differentiate addresses. TS agreed with Karl but also pointed out that while the visual checksum might be more interesting and useful at times, the technically simpler solution would be more likely to be adopted and less prone to error. They suggested that having another digest in addition to the existing checksum could reduce collisions.</summary>
