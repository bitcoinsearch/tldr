    <summary>The article discusses a softforkable design for Bitcoin that maintains a non-CT block and a separately-committed CT block. The transfer of funds can be done through a "burn" transaction on the legacy non-CT block, which creates the same amount in the CT block. To move from the CT block back to legacy non-CT, matching one of those "burn" TXOs is required, and proof that the amount being removed from the CT block is precisely the same value as the "burn" TXO being spent. The total amount of funds in all CT outputs is known in the legacy non-CT block. However, individual CT-block TXOs cannot have their values known, allowing the CT block to use an unconditional privacy and computational soundness scheme.If the computational soundness is broken, then the first one to break it would be able to steal all the CT coins but not all Bitcoin coins due to insufficient "burn" TXOs on the legacy non-CT blockchain. This may be sufficient for practical privacy. The article also briefly mentions the Mimble Wimble Extension Block (MWEB) design for Litecoin, which follows a similar concept and may activate by the end of this year.</summary>
