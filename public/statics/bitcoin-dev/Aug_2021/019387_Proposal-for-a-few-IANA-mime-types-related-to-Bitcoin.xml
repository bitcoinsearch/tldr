    <title>Proposal for a few IANA mime-types related to Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The Blockchain Commons is encouraging the registration of bitcoin/psbt+ur, which would support the UR encoded version of PSBTs. This would create better QR and Airgap solutions and leverage CBOR, an IETF standard. The community of Airgap wallet developers can be found on GitHub, as well as libraries for UR. The proposal was brought up in the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Peter D. Gray, who suggested registering MIME media types with the IANA such as bitcoin/psbt, bitcoin/txn, and bitcoin/uri. These types would be useful for web servers and other applications, including NFC (NDEF records) where a shorter length is crucial. Gray noted that he has no idea how easily IANA will accept these proposals, but it could potentially lead to further discussions within the community.</summary>
