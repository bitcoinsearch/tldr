    <summary>In a conversation between Zac and ZmnSCPxj, Zac proposed functionality to limit the amount that can be spent from an address within a certain timeframe. This would prevent theft of large amounts while still allowing small transactions. He suggested implementing consensus changes to support this functionality. ZmnSCPxj countered by suggesting the use of covenant opcodes instead of Zac's proposal. These opcodes would enable implementation without requiring presigning or offline keysets. However, there are several proposals with overlapping abilities and different tradeoffs, which could lead to bikeshed-painting. Zac requested more information on what would be required to implement his unmodified proposal so the community could assess the cost and weigh it against the benefits. He also acknowledged that a consensus change takes years but believed it should not stop exploring the appetite for the proposed functionality and possible technical solutions.</summary>
