    <summary>Libre-SOC has been granted â‚¬50,000 by NLnet to research and develop draft cryptographic primitives and instructions for the newly-open Power ISA. Unlike RISC-V, the OpenPOWER initiative does not require non-transparent membership of OPF in order to submit ISA RFCs. This transparent process allows Libre-SOC to take apart strategic cryptographic algorithms back to their mathematical roots, apply Vector ISA design analysis, and create a resultant ISA ideally suited to the experimental development of future cryptographic algorithms for use in securing wallets and other purposes related to blockchain management. The project aims to design instructions suitable for "big integer math" that would be better suited to a general-purpose Vector Supercomputer ISA, which is what they are developing. Libre-SOC is looking for participation or collaboration on this project and has funding available. By participating in the project, interested parties can contribute to the development of future cryptographic algorithms that can be used for securing wallets and other blockchain-related applications. The aim is to create an ISA that is well-suited for such applications, considering big integer math. Moreover, the OpenPOWER initiative is a less crowded space than RISC-V, which makes it easier for Libre-SOC to submit its ISA RFCs without any non-transparent membership requirements. Overall, this grant will help Libre-SOC to further its research and development efforts and to attract more participants and collaborators. With the funding provided, Libre-SOC can continue to work on experimental development of future cryptographic algorithms using the new Power ISA and create a resultant ISA that is better suited for blockchain management applications.</summary>
