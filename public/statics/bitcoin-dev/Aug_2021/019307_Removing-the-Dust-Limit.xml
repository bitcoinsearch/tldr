    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin Core contributor, has proposed the removal of dust limit from Bitcoin. He has stated five reasons for this proposal. Firstly, it's not their business to decide what outputs people want to create. Secondly, dust outputs can be used in various authentication/delegation smart contracts. Thirdly, dust sized htlcs in lightning force channels to operate in a semi-trusted mode which has regulatory implications. Fourthly, thinly divisible colored coin protocols might make use of sats as value markers for transactions. Lastly, if confidential transactions are done, it cannot be prevented without compromising privacy/allowed transfers.The main reasons against dust creation are that it is considered spam and dust fingerprinting attacks. Jeremy believes that the first reason is not valid given the five reasons above, and the second reason can be prevented by well-behaved wallets to not redeem outputs that cost more in fees than they are worth.</summary>
