    <summary>The author of the message is considering the role of dust limits in keeping UTXO sets down. They suggest that channel factories could achieve this on the Lightning Network by allowing multiple channels to be backed by a single UTXO. While this may help, it also introduces a greater set of participants who would have differing opinions on appropriate feerates. Therefore, the dust limit may become less important to higher layers than actual onchain feerates. The author proposes using "one-shot" factories which do not allow changing the topology of the subgraph inside the factory, but have the advantage of not requiring either `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` or an extra CSV constraint that is difficult to weigh in routing algorithms.</summary>
