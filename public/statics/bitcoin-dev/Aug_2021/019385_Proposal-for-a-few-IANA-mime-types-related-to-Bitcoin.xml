    <title>Proposal for a few IANA mime-types related to Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The author is proposing to register three new MIME media types with IANA under RFC 2046. These media types include bitcoin/psbt, bitcoin/txn and bitcoin/uri. The bitcoin/psbt media type refers to a BIP-174 file in binary format, which makes no claims about signed or unsigned status. The bitcoin/txn media type refers to a wire-ready fully-signed transaction in binary format. Lastly, the bitcoin/uri media type refers to BIP-21, which can encode amounts and comments in URL arguments. It could be used as a response to 402 - Payment required.The author notes that some other mime-types are proposed in BIP-71 but those are unrelated to the above and never seem to have been registered. The media types can be encoded in base64 or hex, which can be indicated in the optional parameters. Although these new media types are useful for web servers, they also find use elsewhere such as NFC (NDEF records) where shorter length is critical. The author acknowledges that it's unclear how easily IANA will accept these proposals. The author concludes with an invitation for thoughts from the list members. They have provided their contact information and signature in the attachment.</summary>
