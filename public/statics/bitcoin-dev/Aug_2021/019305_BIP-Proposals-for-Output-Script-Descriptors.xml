    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Sjors Provoost expressed a desire to add a birth date, or minimum block height, to the BIP 32 and BIP 88 standards for Hierarchical Deterministic Path Templates. He suggested using a metadata format to track this information alongside descriptors. The Airgap Wallet Community supports metadata in their UR standards, which use CBOR's tagging capability. The UR standards also provide efficient transport via QR codes or URLs. Interested parties can learn more about these standards by watching a video on Blockchain Commons Technology Overview or reading articles on URs, including guides for key material and SSKRs, as well as UR Request &amp; Response. Additionally, there are specs available on Uniform Resources (UR) and HD Keys. For further questions, individuals can visit the Airgapped Wallet Community on GitHub.</summary>
