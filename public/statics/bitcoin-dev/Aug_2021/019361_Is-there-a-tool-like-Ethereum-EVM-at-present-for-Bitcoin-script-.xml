    <summary>The "No Taproot" section of the Sapio docs needs updating, and there have been questions about Sapio and CTV on Libera equivalents of Freenode channels #sapio and ##ctv-bip-review. The person who asked the question wondered what plans there were to take advantage of Taproot with Sapio. Although it would have been interesting to see what a Taproot emulator would have looked like, it seems that there is no need for it now. Additionally, people have been curious about whether or not the developers plan to join and claim those channels. Jeremy responded to the question by stating that this has never been true, as Sapio assumes extensions. If the extensions are not present, they can be stubbed out with a signing federation instead, configurable as flags, and many contracts can be written that do not use the CTV-based components at all. The protocol for emulation is clever, ensuring that contract compilation is completely offline and the oracles are completely stateless.
