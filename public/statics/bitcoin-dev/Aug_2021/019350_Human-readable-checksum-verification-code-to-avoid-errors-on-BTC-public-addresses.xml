    <summary>In response to a comment by Christopher Allen, TS expresses their interest in the LifeHash visual hashing algorithm and acknowledges its usefulness as a visual verification for wallet addresses. However, they state that it may not be suitable for their proposal of a human-readable checksum or verification code to avoid errors due to certain disadvantages. Firstly, having only one standard could complicate the implementation process, and secondly, a simpler 3-4 digit code would be easier to implement and communicate verbally. TS suggests that the simpler the solution, the more likely it is for developers to adopt it.Christopher Allen suggests LifeHash as an alternative to TS's proposal, which includes both a visual indicator and a readable fingerprint value. LifeHash is an open-source visual hashing algorithm with desirable qualities such as high complexity, good aesthetics, and robustness when transformed to grayscale. Christopher provides links to reference code, an explainer video on YouTube, and best practices for LifeHash UX on The Object Identity Block. He is the Principal Architect at Blockchain Commons.</summary>
