    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev post, Raymo addressed s7r's concerns about the Sabu protocol. He clarified that there is no relation between the main transaction and guarantee transaction except for the output amounts of the latter which are calculated relatively based on the former to ensure a higher transaction fee. However, s7r questioned whether Bob would receive an error when he tries to broadcast the guarantee transaction due to double-spending transactions. Raymo suggested seeking clarification from Bitcoin core developers on this matter. S7r also raised concerns about the Sabu protocol's feasibility as it requires Bob to be online 24/7 to ensure that Alice does not commit fraud. Raymo acknowledged this concern but noted that major creditors must always be online to protect their money. He also explained how normal transactions happen in their entirety.S7r further argued that the guarantee transaction cannot work as it is child transaction of the main transaction, which Alice needs to broadcast to the blockchain first. In response, Raymo explained that the guarantee transaction is created based on the main transaction's output amounts and will cut a part of Bob and Alice's money in favor of transaction fees if the issuer breaks its promise. Raymo acknowledged that some attacks could potentially succeed, but they have too high a risk-to-reward ratio to be considered viable threats.</summary>
