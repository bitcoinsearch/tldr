    <summary>Bitcoin does not have a virtual machine, but there are higher level languages like Miniscript, Min.sc, Simplicity and Sapio that compile to Bitcoin Script. Sapio is based on Rust and may be the best fit for certain settings. A question was posed on the Bitcoin Stackexchange about whether there is a tool like Ethereum EVM at present for Bitcoin script programming, where users can write scripts in a syntax similar to Python and translate them into Bitcoin original scripts. The writer suggests that Bitcoin's opcode expression ability is rich but unfriendly, which has affected its promotion in the technical community. Bitcoin-dev mailing list members are encouraged to share their thoughts on this topic.</summary>
