    <summary>In an email exchange between Wladimir and Mike Hearn, the former argued that using services bits to advertise services on a different port than the P2P protocol is not acceptable. He explained that services bits are solely meant for advertising services on the P2P network and this was not open for discussion. Additionally, he noted that using only a bit to find an external service would not be sufficient except in cases where the advertised service had a fixed port. Since even bitcoind does not have a fixed port, there needs to be a mechanism to connect to the external service. This mechanism is provided by the proposed extension. While it would be possible to advertise an extra service bit in addition to the proposed one, to make it easier to find through the addr mechanism, this would be confusing and an abuse of P2P service bits according to Wladimir.</summary>
