    <summary>In the given context, it is stated that ZeroMQ is a lightweight message routing system that could work as a plug-in by registering internal signals. It aims to capture precise points where a block was accepted internally. The PR #4599 is an example of how it works. Although similar in function, a P2P service would be a slightly different type of plug-in. ZeroMQ could make P2P messages available to other applications if they subscribe to them and vice versa. It is easy to route messages from ZeroMQ to certain P2P clients. Overall, ZeroMQ has unique features that distinguish it from a typical P2P service.</summary>
