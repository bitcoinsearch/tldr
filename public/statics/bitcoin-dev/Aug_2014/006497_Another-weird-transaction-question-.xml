    <summary>RicMoo, the founder of Genetic Mistakes Software, has discovered a transaction in the blockchain that contains an output script with a public key. He seeks clarification on whether invalid public keys are permitted and silently ignored or if the 0x00 prefix has some meaning. The transaction is verified by the legit client. RicMoo is verifying the blockchain one transaction after another with his own implementation.</summary>
