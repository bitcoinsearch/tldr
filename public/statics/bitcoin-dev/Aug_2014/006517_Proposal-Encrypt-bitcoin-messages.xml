    <summary>The author believes that all communications should be encrypted by default, including public information such as transaction information. The only exception to this would be block packets to avoid increasing propagation time. The author suggests that Bitcoin Core generate a public/private key pair and share the public key with peers for privacy and integrity purposes, but not authentication. This method would prevent passive recording of transactions by impersonating a Bitcoin node, but would not prevent active man-in-the-middle attacks. Currently, incoming/outgoing transactions can be watched to determine what transactions are created in the node, allowing tracking of Bitcoin addresses and their associated bitcoins. The author cites SSH as an example of encryption that could be used by Bitcoin Core, though fingerprint changes caused by reinstalls should be ignored. The author invites discussion on whether or not this idea is needed or feasible.</summary>
