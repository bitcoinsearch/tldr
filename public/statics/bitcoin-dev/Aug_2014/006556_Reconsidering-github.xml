    <summary>In an email from August 19, 2014, Jeff Garzik expressed concern over Bitcoin Core's use of a centralized service like GitHub for its issues and repository. Another developer, xor, responded, arguing that the benefits of using GitHub outweighed any potential downsides. Specifically, xor noted that with over 4,000 forks on GitHub, Bitcoin can receive contributions from a large number of developers. Additionally, GitHub cannot modify commits that have been GnuPG signed without breaking the signature, ensuring the integrity of Bitcoin's code. However, xor cautioned that those reviewing pull requests should carefully verify signatures before accepting any changes, and release managers should be the only ones with push access to the main repository. Finally, xor provided a link to an article discussing ways to ensure that GitHub does not insert malicious code into repositories.</summary>
