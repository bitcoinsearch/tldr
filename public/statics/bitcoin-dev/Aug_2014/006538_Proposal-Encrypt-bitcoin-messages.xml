    <summary>In this discussion, Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd are talking about the resources required for monitoring a network. Peter Todd believes that determining the origin of a few hundred bytes of days interspersed in dozens of kB/s of buffered data streams is very difficult and expensive even without padding and/or random delay features. He has spoken to people like Jacob Applebaum who have a solid understanding of what the NSA is actually capable of. However, he suggests that not using straight OpenSSL for encryption is a wise decision and proposes using existing and tested Tor support to encrypt by default.</summary>
