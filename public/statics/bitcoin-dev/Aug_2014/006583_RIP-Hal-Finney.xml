    <summary>Hal Finney, a prominent figure in the cypherpunk community, passed away on Tuesday and his body is being cryogenically preserved. He played a significant role in the early days of Bitcoin and PGP, and his contributions to the cypherpunk movement are greatly appreciated. Matt, who shared the news on an Extropy chat forum, encourages everyone to take a moment to thank Hal for everything he did for the community.</summary>
