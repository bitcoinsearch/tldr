    <summary>A proposal has been put forth by Kaz, which suggests setting nLockTime to the current height by default in newly created transactions. This discourages fee-sniping and helps in case of reorg. Bitcoin-qt #2340 has already implemented this idea, with a slightly cautious approach of setting it to current-height - 10 by default with randomness to mitigate privacy concerns.The proposal also includes actions #2, #3, and #4 for future implementation. The fourth action suggests adding a new IsStandard rule that rejects transactions with an nLockTime more than N blocks behind the current tip (for some fixed value N, to be determined). A janitor mechanism is desirable to purge mempool of transactions more than N behind current-height.Nodes dropping a transaction N blocks after they became eligible to be mined makes sense. It is not an overloading or new use for nLockTime but a logical extension of it. This solves the problem of unintentional resurrection that arises with locally measured age.</summary>
