    <summary>In an email sent by Ivan Pustogarov, he proposed to start a discussion on periodic rotation of outbound connections. His idea was to drop and replace an outbound connection every 2-10 minutes. The purpose of this idea was to improve a node's knowledge about available peers and make the network stronger against partitioning. However, the motivation behind the behavior is opposite to what Pustogarov intended, according to one of the recipients of the email. Constant outbound peer connections can help prevent attackers from gaining strong evidence about the origin of transactions. If the outbound connections are rotated, then it is highly likely that a sybil pretending to be many nodes will observe the transmission directly. Since the traffic is clear text, broadcasting over tor or i2p is recommended for anyone who expects to have any privacy at all in their broadcasts.</summary>
