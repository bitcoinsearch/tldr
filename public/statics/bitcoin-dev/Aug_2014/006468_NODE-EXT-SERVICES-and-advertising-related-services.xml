    <summary>In a conversation between Mike Hearn, Wladimir, and an unknown individual on August 8th, 2014, they discussed the possibility of implementing an external application or script to handle certain Bitcoin functions instead of integrating them into bitcoind. While this could be a viable option for some tasks, such as getutxos, which requires access to the UTXO set that bitcoind already has, other functions may require more work if implemented externally. However, it was suggested that information could still be queried back over RPC.</summary>
