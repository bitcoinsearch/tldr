    <summary>In an email exchange on August 8, 2014, Tom Harding proposed a new rule for Bitcoin transactions. The proposed IsStandard rule would reject transactions where the nLockTime is more than N blocks behind the current tip. However, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, cautioned that it could not be assumed that transaction creation time and transaction publish-to-outside-world time are the same. While they often coincide, this was not always the case. Garzik works for BitPay, Inc., a company that provides businesses with tools to accept Bitcoin payments.</summary>
