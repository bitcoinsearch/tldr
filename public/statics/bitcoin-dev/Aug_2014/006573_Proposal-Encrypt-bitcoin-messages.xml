    <title>Proposal: Encrypt bitcoin messages</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange, Troy Benjegerdes has expressed his skepticism over the proposal to encrypt bitcoin messages. He believes that even if one hires a hacker to find misplaced characters in crypto code, all the work done to encrypt wire protocols becomes worthless. Additionally, he suggests that encrypting non-sensitive inter-node traffic is almost completely useless in providing anonymity. He questions the justification for this proposal and distinguishes it from Tor-ifying communications, which is a completely different issue.</summary>
