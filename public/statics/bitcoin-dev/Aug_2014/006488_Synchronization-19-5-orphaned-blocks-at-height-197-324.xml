    <title>Synchronization: 19.5 % orphaned blocks at height 197'324</title>

    <summary>The issue discussed in this email is related to the synchronization of a new node. The user, mbde at bitwatch.co, mentions that they have observed 38,447 orphaned blocks which account for approximately 19.5% of their progress at a height of 197,324 blocks. They are concerned about this high number and question whether it is possible for a malicious party to generate chains of blocks with low difficulty that are not part of the main chain in order to slow down the sync process. The email provides information on the build and version being used, as well as a compressed debug.log file for further analysis. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, responds to the email thread and notes that the issue is currently being worked on under the category of "headers first synchronization." Until this is completed, he recommends downloading bootstrap.dat via torrent from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145386.0.</summary>
