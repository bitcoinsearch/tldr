    <summary>A developer from the Freenet project has commented on a proposal to move the Bitcoin Core repository off GitHub, stating that "you shouldn't ditch that due to not using all features of git". The developer goes on to suggest that decentralised code review should be used as opposed to just relying on digital signatures. There are currently over 4,000 forks of Bitcoin on GitHub which, according to the developer, is a huge amount of potential contributors; this number is greater than 99% of other open source projects hosted on the site. The developer suggests that the actual code should be reviewed by multiple people, rather than just signatures, and recommends having multiple redundant 'master' repositories run by different people in different jurisdictions that get updated on different schedules, and have all of these people pay attention to operational security.</summary>
