    <summary>In a message dated August 19, 2014, J Ross Nicoll asks how many nodes require a high level of security. The response is that all nodes require this level of security. While other networks are getting rid of unencrypted transport methods, the importance of blocking passive surveillance should not even be up for debate. Security should be on by default and users who do not want it should have to jump through hoops to turn it off instead of the other way around. This message is signed with a PGP signature and includes an attached file of PGP keys.</summary>
