    <summary>SSL and certificate validation are currently the only protection for miners. However, certificate revocation and updates in miners can be difficult, which is why most pools do not utilize them. Despite this, SSL is essential for financial services and should be used everywhere. Changing certificates and keys does not require miner updates if standard SSL infrastructure is implemented. It is surprising that SSL is not already universally used, as it is necessary for secure online banking and email usage.</summary>
