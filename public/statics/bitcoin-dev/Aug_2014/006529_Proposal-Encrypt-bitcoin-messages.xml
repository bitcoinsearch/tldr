    <summary>In an email conversation on August 19, 2014, Gregory Maxwell expressed his belief that not having TLS had helped the group avoid several emergency scale vulnerabilities. He was still trying to understand the need for encrypted communications between nodes. Johnathan Corgan, founder of Corgan Labs, responded to Maxwell's email by stating that he could see the value in having authenticated traffic with specific nodes. Corgan suggested using an HMAC for the protocol messages instead of the current checksum. Along with his email, Corgan included a vcf file and a signature.asc file.</summary>
