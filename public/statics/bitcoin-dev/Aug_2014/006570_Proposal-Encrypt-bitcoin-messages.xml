    <title>Proposal: Encrypt bitcoin messages</title>

    <summary>In a message posted on the Bitcoin Development mailing list, Jeff Garzik argued that encryption is of little value if the same information can be deduced by observing packet sizes and timings. In response, xor suggested padding encrypted packets with random bytes and adding some random bias to their timing as a solution. The packet size and timing issue will become less of an issue as the network grows anyway, with one transaction inserted into a 3 TPS stream being more obvious than the same transaction inserted into a 100 or 1000 TPS stream. A PGP signature was included in the message, along with a link to learn how to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible.</summary>
