    <summary>The implementation of stealth addresses used by Cryptonote/Monero has shown that attaching a number to each transaction output can be valuable in real-world scenarios. This number can be used by exchanges to credit the correct customer's account and by individuals to communicate verbally or on paper. Additionally, multiple payments with the same ID can be merged together in wallet UIs, allowing merge-avoidance to be conveniently used with stealth addresses. To avoid accidental collision, payment numbers should be at least 64-bits and the encoded size should be the same for all users. For CoinJoin and multiple outputs, it would be desirable for all stealth-using outputs to have the option of sharing a single 33-byte ephemeral pubkey. However, this cannot currently be accommodated within the existing 40-byte, one OP_RETURN per tx, IsStandard() rules. This is causing issues with Dark Wallet when users try to send to multiple stealth addresses at once, and when multiple stealth sends are CoinJoin'd together.</summary>
