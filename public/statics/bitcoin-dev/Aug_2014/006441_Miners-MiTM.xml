    <summary>In an email conversation dated August 7, 2014, Pedro Worcel brought to attention an article published on Wired.com. The article discussed someone abusing the BGP protocol to intercept miner traffic and earn profits from it. However, this issue was addressed a long time ago by BFGMiner and Eloipool. There have been no documented cases of this being used against Bitcoin, but rather scamcoins have been the target.</summary>
