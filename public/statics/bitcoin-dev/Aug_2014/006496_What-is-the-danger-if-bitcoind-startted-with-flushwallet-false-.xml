    <summary>Qing Qing Pan from okcoin.com shared his experience of reducing the IO of bitcoind by using the "-flushwallet=false" option. He found that after trying it, his IO reduced greatly. However, he questioned why "flushwallet" is true by default and whether there is any danger if closing the flush wallet thread. Pan also mentioned that he lost all his coins in testnet after one crash with "-flushwallet=false". He wondered whether this was because of no flush wallet thread. The post raises questions about the default settings of the 'flushwallet' option and its impact on the security of Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
