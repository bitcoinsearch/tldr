    <summary>On August 19, 2014, Bryan Bishop suggested a smaller first step towards switching the primary repository for Bitcoin development. He proposed to mirror the git repository on bitcoin.org before making any changes. Jeff Garzik had previously suggested that one possibility for the switch could be to put the primary repo on bitcoin.org and mirror it to GitHub with each push. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list and can be found in the provided link.</summary>
