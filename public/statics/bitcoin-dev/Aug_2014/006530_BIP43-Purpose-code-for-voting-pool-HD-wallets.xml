    <summary>The HD multisig structure that will be used for Bitcoin wallets used for voting pools, will be reserved two purpose codes. Two draft information BIPs have been documented - one for the wallets suitable for storing bulk bitcoin deposits and the other for storing colored coin deposits. The primary difference is that bulk deposit wallets use cold storage and are allowed to incur significant administrative overhead, whereas colored coin wallets do not use cold storage because they must be capable of being generated on the fly.
