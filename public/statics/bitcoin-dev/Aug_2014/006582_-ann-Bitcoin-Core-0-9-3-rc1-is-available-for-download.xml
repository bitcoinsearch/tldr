    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.3rc1 has been released as a test version. This new minor release brings only bug fixes and updated translations. Users are requested to report any bugs using the issue tracker at github. If users are running an older version, they need to shut it down before upgrading. The installer can be run on Windows or /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux) can be copied over. For those upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time 0.9.3 is run, blockchain files will be re-indexed which may take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the speed of the machine. The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous releases so users should be aware that if they switch back to a 0.8.x release after running 0.9.x, they might get a blockchain validation error when starting the old release. Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate data structures and correct the problem. There have been several improvements to the RPC, protocol and network code, wallet, GUI, and miscellaneous features in this release. OpenSSL has been upgraded to 1.0.1i, and boost detection in build system on some platforms has been fixed. Finally, thanks are given to everyone who contributed to this release along with everyone who helped translating on Transifex.</summary>
