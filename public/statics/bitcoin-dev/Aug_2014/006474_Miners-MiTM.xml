    <summary>In August 2014, a discussion was held on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding enabling TLS. The concern was that it could potentially function as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on pool servers. A more lightweight solution was proposed to prevent client payout redirection and server impersonation. Mike Hearn questioned the necessity of certificate validation unless the attacker could perform a direct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack during connection time, which is harder to maintain than injecting a client.reconnect. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, also participated in the discussion.</summary>
