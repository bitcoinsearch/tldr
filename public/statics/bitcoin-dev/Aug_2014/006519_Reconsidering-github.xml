    <summary>In a 2014 email by Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik, he expressed the desire to move away from GitHub for hosting the Bitcoin Core issues and git repo due to its centralized nature. In the email, Garzik mentions that Linux uses its own git repo and has implemented 2FA (two-factor authentication) for security purposes. He suggests putting the primary repo on bitcoin.org and mirroring it on GitHub for each push as a first step towards decentralization. As an alternative to GitHub, GitLab is open source, self-hosted, and provides similar features.</summary>
