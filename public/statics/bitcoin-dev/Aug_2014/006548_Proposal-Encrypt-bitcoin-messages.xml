    <summary>The email conversation between Peter Todd and William Yager on the Bitcoin-Development mailing list discussed the need for encryption in the Bitcoin network. Although the network is an open P2P protocol with available source code, encrypting messages between nodes would prevent passive attackers from tracing the origin of Bitcoin transactions. Additionally, authentication and encryption are needed to secure the upcoming v0.10's fee estimation implementation from Sybil attacks. Enabling hidden service support by default would introduce a huge attack surface, but separating it with the standalone Tor binary would provide anonymity and encryption for the network. Bitcoinj has already implemented Tor support for these reasons.</summary>
