    <summary>If GitHub were to be abandoned, it's suggested that code review and bug tracking could be moved elsewhere as GitHub is better at hosting git repositories than code review. GitHub's issue tracker is considered rudimentary at best. However, logging in with a GitHub account is convenient if done well. JetBrains, known for making great products, is developing Upsource, a code review and repository exploration tool designed for self-hosting. Though proprietary, it's no different from GitHub and should be releasing soon.</summary>
