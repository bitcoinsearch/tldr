    <summary>The discussion in this email thread revolves around the idea of using first-eligible-height and last-eligible-height to set a lifetime for certain transactions. The suggestion is that this could be achieved without the need for a fork or protocol revision. Jeff Garzik suggests that it may be possible to create a "network TX" with digitally signed information that is discarded before it reaches miners. Peter Todd proposes creating a new, parallel transaction format where fields are committed by a merkle radix tree in an extensible and provable way. He argues that changing the current transaction format would be needlessly disruptive and waste opportunities for improvement.</summary>
