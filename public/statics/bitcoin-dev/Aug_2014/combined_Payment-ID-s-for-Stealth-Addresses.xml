    <summary>The use of stealth addresses in Cryptonote/Monero has proven to be beneficial in real-world scenarios. The attachment of a payment number to each transaction output allows exchanges to credit the correct customer's account and individuals to communicate verbally or on paper. This feature also allows multiple payments with the same ID to be merged together in wallet UIs, making merge-avoidance more convenient when using stealth addresses.To avoid accidental collision, payment numbers should be at least 64-bits and the encoded size should be the same for all users. In addition, it would be desirable for all stealth-using outputs to have the option of sharing a single 33-byte ephemeral pubkey for CoinJoin and multiple outputs. However, this cannot currently be accommodated within the existing 40-byte, one OP_RETURN per tx, IsStandard() rules. This limitation is causing issues with Dark Wallet when users attempt to send to multiple stealth addresses simultaneously and when multiple stealth sends are CoinJoin'd together. Therefore, it is necessary to find a solution to accommodate the use of shared pubkeys for stealth-using outputs without violating the current rules.</summary>
