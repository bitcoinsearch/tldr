    <summary>In August 2014, Mike Hearn suggested using the existing extension mechanism to advertise services that are not part of the P2P protocol and run on a different port. He did not want to reserve service bits for those services. The NODE_EXT_SERVICES bit was only used to advertise the "getextsrv" command to obtain information about the auxiliary service, such as the port to connect on. Wladimir agreed with Mike's proposal to continue using the existing extension mechanism until the service bits are exhausted.</summary>
