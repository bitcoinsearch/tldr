    <summary>Sergio Lerner sent an email to Tim on August 9, 2014, in which he stated that the second party in a protocol can de-anonymize the first party. However, Tim disagreed with Sergio's statement and mentioned that the second party doesn't know how the third, fourth, fifth, etc., parties shuffled the outputs as it doesn't have their decryption keys.</summary>
