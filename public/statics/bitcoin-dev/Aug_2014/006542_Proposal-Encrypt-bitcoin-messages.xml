    <summary>In this email conversation, William Yager raises a question about the usefulness of implementing end-to-end encryption, given that it won't work perfectly without any method of authentication. He argues that any encryption implemented will just get blown away by anyone who cares enough to stand in the middle of two nodes, and that there is a huge software complexity cost to such implementation. In response, the other party suggests enabling hidden service support by default, which adds both encryption and reasonably good authentication. The suggestion is further supported by the fact that MITM attacks are easily detected and would make great headlines if they happened on the Bitcoin network.</summary>
