    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Wladimir on August 8, 2014, the topic of using services bits to advertise services that are not part of the P2P protocol was discussed. Mike suggested reserving these bits for these services, but Wladimir disagreed and stated that the services bits are specifically for advertising services on the P2P network and are not up for discussion. The importance of the port was also brought up in the conversation.</summary>
