    <summary>The context discusses the idea of encrypting all communications by default, including public information, within Bitcoin Core. The proposal suggests generating a public/private key pair and sharing the public key with peers to provide privacy and integrity, but not authentication. However, there are concerns about how to share the public key securely and avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, it is mentioned that SSH provides similar encryption but warns against ignoring fingerprint changes, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of secure communication protocols in Bitcoin Core.</summary>
