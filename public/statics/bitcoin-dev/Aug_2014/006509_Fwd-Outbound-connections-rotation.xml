    <summary>The best way to avoid linkages is to randomly pick a different peer for each transaction and only relay the transaction to that peer, according to Wladimir. However, if one has lousy peers, the transaction may not reach the network on the first broadcasting. It may be even worse when sending to only one random peer. The wallet could send out the transaction 'staggered' over time by picking a random new node, broadcasting the transaction, waiting a bit, picking a new node, and repeating the process until it comes back through one of the other peers. Separating the transaction broadcasting from the nodes used to request blocks could make sense, especially if bloom filters are involved.</summary>
