    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Mike Hearn are discussing the usefulness of peer rotation in improving a network's internal knowledge. Wuille suggests attempting a new outgoing connection every X minutes, potentially replacing an existing connection according to a scoring system. Hearn brings up the possibility of an attack where an observer could listen to lots of peers, revealing information about linked transactions. Wuille proposes protecting a subset of long-lived connections to prevent an attacker from partitioning the network. Additionally, he suggests announcing transactions through randomly chosen peers to avoid linkages, and using a facility for anti-linkage announcements that can be optimized for learning and partition resistance. These solutions may also protect the user's identity if used over Tor.</summary>
