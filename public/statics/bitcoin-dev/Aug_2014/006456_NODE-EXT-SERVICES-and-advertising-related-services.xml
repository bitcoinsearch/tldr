    <summary>In this email thread, Christian Decker questions the inclusion of advertisements in the P2P protocol, stating that there is already a mechanism in place for protocol extensions in the P2P network. He suggests that an external, parallel network could be used for advertising external services instead. Wladimir responds by explaining that the service bits are reserved for advertising services on the P2P network and are not open for discussion. Additionally, a bit is not enough to find an external service except in the case where the advertised service would have a fixed port. The proposed extension provides a mechanism to find how to connect to the 'external service.' While it would be possible to advertise an extra service bit in addition to this one to make it easier to find through the addr mechanism, it would be confusing and an abuse of P2P service bits according to Wladimir.</summary>
