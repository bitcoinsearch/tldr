    <summary>The discussion is about adding categories (classes) instead of a single bit for autodiscovery of block indexes in Bitcoin Wallet for Android. Currently, the app has a hard-coded block explorer, which limits decentralization. However, autodiscovery would take too long, and users would not want to wait for it. By implementing API-based categories of service bits, the process can be made faster and more efficient. This change would enable the removal of the hard-coded block explorer, promoting decentralization.</summary>
