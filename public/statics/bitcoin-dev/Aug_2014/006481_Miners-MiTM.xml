    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin community in August 2014, Luke Dashjr responded to concerns raised by Pedro Worcel about an article detailing how someone was abusing the BGP protocol to intercept miner traffic and profit from it. Dashjr stated that this was not new news and that both BFGMiner and Eloipool had already been hardened against it. He also noted that no Bitcoin pools had deployed it so far and that the target had always been scamcoins. However, one individual believed that this was evidence of continuous and active BGP feed manipulation by organized crime elements. They suggested that referring to other cryptocurrencies as 'scamcoins' was part of an organized marketing/psychological operations effort to marginalize competitors and that the altcoin BGP hijacks were likely testing the system for future use.</summary>
