    <summary>In an email thread discussing the proposal to implement a new getutxos call in Bitcoin Core, Mike Hearn suggested the idea of delegating processing of unknown messages to an external process. This would allow a P2P node to be composed of separate programs, without compromising the network layer. Bitcoind would need a local interprocess message bus and would act as a router for messages from/to the P2P network, making ZeroMQ a good choice for this. Plans are already in place to add ZeroMQ as an optional dependency for notifications in Bitcoin Core.</summary>
