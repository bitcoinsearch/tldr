    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, a question was raised about why Bitcoin is less of a target than other "scamcoins." The concern was prompted by an article discussing how someone was using the BGP protocol to intercept miner traffic and make a profit. However, it was noted that this is old news and that both BFGMiner and Eloipool were already hardened against it a long time ago. Additionally, no actual case of this being used against Bitcoin has been reported; instead, scamcoins have been the primary target. The only protection for miners is SSL and certificate validation on the client side, but certificate revocation and updates are difficult, so many pools choose not to use them.</summary>
