    <summary>In an email conversation, Kaz Wesley expressed doubts about the approach of beginning a transaction expiry countdown when a transaction is received, stating it seems unviable. He suggests including information in the transaction itself, as with his nLockTime/IsStandard proposal, is necessary for transactions to reliably eventually die off from mempools. The issue of tightly synchronizing memory pools across the network is a problem of large scope and much debate. For now, capping the mempool's size at each local node is a more reachable goal, which implies some culling policy. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, agrees that the bitcoind Tx mempool size is rather open-ended and needs sorting out.</summary>
