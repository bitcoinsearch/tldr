    <summary>Richard Moore posted a query on 13th August 2014 regarding a multisig output script with a public key and whether invalid public keys are permitted and silently ignored or if the 0x00 prefix has some interesting meaning. In response to this, another user suggested looking at the Bitcoin Core script test cases and reading the source code. They also mentioned that the Bitcoin protocol doesn't care whether or not a public key is valid. The email was signed off with a PGP signature.</summary>
