    <summary>In August 2014, a discussion took place about whether or not Bitcoin Core's issues and git repo should be on Github, which was seen as a centralized service. Jeff Garzik suggested moving away from Github, but Wladimir opposed the idea, insisting that Github had a low barrier to entry for contributors. Moving to another platform would make contributions more difficult and require more manpower to handle sysadmin work. Furthermore, migrating current issues and pulls would be a lot of work. In response, Troy Benjegerdes argued that if a project cannot run its own hosting/web presence/security, then it is unwise to trust one's financial future to software written by such a group. He also claimed that there was pointless work in regards to claims about security unless one had the understanding that comes from operating and running their own servers, including running DDoS protection without cloudflare. Benjegerdes suggested that those who do run their own servers will migrate to higher quality alternatives.</summary>
