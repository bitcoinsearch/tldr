    <summary>In a discussion about pre-consensus mempool behavior, it was suggested that a fork is not necessary for making a "network TX" with digitally signed information. This can be achieved by discarding the information before it reaches miners. The conversation then turned to adding a new field to the transaction format. Peter Todd suggested creating a new, parallel tx format where fields are committed by merkle radix tree in an extensible and provable way. He recommended committing to that tree with a mandatory OP_RETURN output in the last txout or with a new merkle root, rather than changing the tx format itself in a hard-fork, which he deemed needlessly disruptive. Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist Jeff Garzik contributed to the discussion.</summary>
