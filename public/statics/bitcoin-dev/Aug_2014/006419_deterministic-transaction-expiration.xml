    <summary>In an email conversation, Kaz Wesley expressed doubts about a transaction expiry countdown approach that starts when a transaction is received since it would lead to nodes re-accepting transactions that they had forgotten. The use of nLockTime for expiration was proposed as an alternative, preventing the creator from extending the life of the transaction without pushing confirmation eligibility into the future. This method would also allow "fill or kill" transactions with a backdated nLockTime, which must be confirmed in a few blocks or start disappearing from mempools.</summary>
