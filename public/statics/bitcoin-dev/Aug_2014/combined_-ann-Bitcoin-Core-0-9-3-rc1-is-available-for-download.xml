    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.3rc1 has been released as a test version to fix bugs and update translations. Users can report any bugs using the issue tracker at github and are requested to shut down older versions before upgrading. The installer can be run on Windows or /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux) can be copied over. Upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier requires re-indexing of blockchain files which may take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the machine's speed. The 'chainstate' for this release may not always be compatible with previous releases, so users need to be cautious when switching back to a 0.8.x release after running 0.9.x. Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate data structures and correct the problem.Improvements have been made to the RPC, protocol and network code, wallet, GUI, and miscellaneous features in this release. OpenSSL has been upgraded to 1.0.1i, and boost detection in build system on some platforms has been fixed. Finally, thanks are given to everyone who contributed to this release along with everyone who helped translating on Transifex.</summary>
