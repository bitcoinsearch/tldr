    <summary>To create a pull tester JAR, one needs to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6 or higher, Apache Maven, and git installed on their system. Once these requirements are met, bitcoinj can be cloned from the git master and built using the command "mvn -DskipTests package". This will download the necessary libraries, compile the code, and create a bundled executable JAR file called core/target/pull-tests.jar. The JAR file can be used with the QA scripts in the bitcoin core qa/pull-tester directory or run directly using the commands "./bitcoind -regtest -connect=0.0.0.0 -listen -whitelist=127.0.0.1 -datadir=/tmp/pulltester" followed by "java -jar core/target/pull-tests.jar". It is also mentioned that Java JARs can easily be reproduced if the same version of javac and bitcoinj are used. Finally, the author offers to provide a pull-tests.jar from their local machine if anyone would like to do this.</summary>
