    <summary>Transactions with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY inputs are vulnerable to DoS attacks by attackers who add extra inputs that make the fee/byte paid unfavorable to miners, while still being high enough to be relayed. This poses a serious obstacle towards using ANYONECANPAY, as it affects various functions such as crowdfunds/assurance contracts, fee bumping, privacy and Replace-by-fee scorched earth. However, the attacker's modified transaction may not always replace the intended one, as the latter will have higher fees.Each input that does not use SIGHASH_ALL can be evaluated in terms of whether or not it increases the fees/byte paid by the transaction. Therefore, transactions can be optimized to pay the highest fees/byte. It is important to consider the potential risks involved in using SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY and to take necessary precautions to prevent any malicious activity from disrupting the process.</summary>
