    <summary>Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, Jeff Garzik, suggests that it would be beneficial if the issues and git repo for Bitcoin Core were not hosted on such a centralized service as Github. He notes that Linux has its own git repo and now requires 2FA. One possibility he suggests is putting the primary repo on bitcoin.org and mirroring it to Github with each push.</summary>
