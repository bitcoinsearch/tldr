    <summary>Based on the given context, it is suggested to continue using the existing extension mechanism until service bits start running out. This is because there is no shortage of service bits, which means that one does not have to connect to every node to determine the services it supports. Therefore, it is more efficient to use the current system until the need for additional bits arises. The existing extension mechanism can be used to add new features and functionality to a system without affecting its core functions. This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability, which is essential in today's rapidly changing technological landscape. It also saves time and resources as developers do not have to create an entirely new system from scratch.However, it is important to keep track of the usage of service bits to ensure that they are not being wasted or duplicated unnecessarily. Proper management of service bits is crucial to prevent any potential conflicts or errors in the system. Therefore, it is recommended to use a systematic approach in allocating and monitoring service bits usage.In conclusion, the suggestion to continue using the existing extension mechanism until service bits start running out is a practical and resourceful approach. As long as proper management and monitoring of service bits usage are implemented, this method can provide the necessary flexibility and adaptability to meet the ever-evolving needs of the technological landscape.</summary>
