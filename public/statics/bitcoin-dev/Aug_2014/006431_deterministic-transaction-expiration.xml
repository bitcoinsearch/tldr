    <summary>The Bitcoin developers discussed the possibility of creating a new field to deal with pre-consensus mempool behavior without requiring a fork or protocol revision. Tom Harding suggested using first-eligible-height (nLockTime) and mempool expiration, measured from this height, to achieve the desired goals. Jeff Garzik proposed creating a "network TX" with digitally signed information that is discarded before reaching miners. Peter Todd recommended creating a new parallel tx format where fields are committed by merkle radix tree in an extensible and provable way instead of changing the tx format itself in a hard-fork. He suggested committing to that tree with a mandatory OP_RETURN output in the last txout or with a new merkle root. However, he noted that changing the tx format in a hard-fork would be disruptive and would waste opportunities for improvement. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin development mailing list.</summary>
