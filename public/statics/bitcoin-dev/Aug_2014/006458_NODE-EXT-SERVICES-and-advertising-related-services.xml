    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, and Mike Hearn on August 8th, 2014 at 6:01 AM, they discuss the existing mechanism of adding NODE_INSIGHT, NODE_ELECTRUM_SERVER bits to bitcoin-related APIs that exist on the same system as bitcoind. Jeff Garzik argues that it would be wrong to add these bits. He works for BitPay, Inc., a company that provides payment services using Bitcoin. The context does not provide any further information about the conversation or the reason for the argument.</summary>
