    <summary>Gerrit is a free code review tool as long as you can afford the admin(s) to maintain it. It is possible for someone to volunteer to be the admin in exchange for payment, especially if a 'painless' log in with a GitHub account feature is desired. This would make it less painful to unroll the damage if GitHub were to be compromised. The author of the post suggests that the same ECDSA keys used to secure bitcoins could be used to secure access to the code review and source control systems.In response to another post that suggested moving code review and bug tracking elsewhere if GitHub were to be abandoned, the author of this post agrees that GitHub does a reasonably good job of hosting git repositories but is lacking in code review and issue tracking. JetBrains is developing a proprietary code review and repository exploration tool called Upsource, which is designed for self-hosting and should be released soon.</summary>
