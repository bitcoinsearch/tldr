    <summary>In an email exchange from August 2014, Peter Todd warned against letting perfection be the enemy of good when it came to proposals for Bitcoin network security. However, Todd's correspondent disagreed with his proposal, arguing that a software update would introduce too much complexity and potentially make the network vulnerable to attacks. They also pointed out that even major organizations like the NSA would likely be limited in their ability to attack the network due to technical and political barriers. While Todd suggested enabling hidden service support by default as a way to add encryption and authentication, the other party cautioned that this would significantly increase the network's attack surface. Ultimately, they concluded that while using Tor could provide some anonymity benefits for Bitcoin, encryption would likely not be effective in improving network security.</summary>
