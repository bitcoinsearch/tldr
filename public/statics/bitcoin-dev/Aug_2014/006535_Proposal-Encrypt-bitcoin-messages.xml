    <summary>In August 2014, Justus Ranvier questioned the debate around deprecating HTTP and other unencrypted transport methods. While it is desirable to have encryption, engineering tradeoffs make it a low priority for Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Authentication is considered more important than encryption because it is required for anti-partitioning-attack measures. Nakamoto's past thinking on opportunistic encryption is that once authentication is established, encrypting would require little work, but emphasis should be placed on authentication driving such efforts. In any case, people should be using Bitcoin over Tor for better privacy and coverage of encryption and authentication.</summary>
