    <summary>During the conversation, it was agreed that reducing the number of persistent connections to 3 instead of 8 could help reduce the success rate of the entry-peers fingerprinting attack. However, it was recommended not to disconnect any "addnode" nodes and whitelisted peers. The participants also discussed the concern of partitioning, where an attacker starts up a moderate number of sybil nodes and connects to every available listening peer to fill their inbound capacity.Although this kind of activity would only disrupt newly joining peers in the current network, excessive rotation could result in the entire network getting connected exclusively via the sybils. This could lead to the sybils controlling the whole network, which is undesirable. Therefore, it is important to be cautious about the number of sybil nodes that are allowed to join the network.Overall, the conversation focused on ways to improve the security of the network by reducing the success rate of certain attacks and preventing the network from being taken over by malicious actors. It is important to consider these issues when designing and maintaining a secure network.</summary>
