    <summary>In an email conversation between Bitcoin developer Wladimir and Jeff Garzik, it was suggested that Bitcoind would require a local interprocess message bus to act as a router for messages from/to the P2P network. ZeroMQ was proposed as a good choice for this task since there were already plans to add it as an optional dependency for notifications. Jeff Garzik agreed with this suggestion but stated that ZMQ would function better as a plug-in that registers internal signals rather than a P2P service. He cited PR #4599 as an example of how ZMQ could be used in this context. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
