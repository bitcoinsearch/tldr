    <summary>Transactions with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY inputs can be DoS attacked by attackers adding extra inputs to them that make the fee/byte paid unfavorable to miners, while still being high enough to be relayed. This is a serious obstacle towards using ANYONECANPAY. Crowdfunds/assurance contracts, fee bumping, privacy and Replace-by-fee scorched earth depend on ANYONECANPAY. The attacker's modified transaction will usually, but not always, be replaced by the intended one as the latter will have higher fees. Each input that does not use SIGHASH_ALL can be evaluated in terms of whether or not it increases the fees/byte paid by the transaction. Thus, transactions can be optimized to pay the highest fees/byte.</summary>
