    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Mike Hearn are discussing ways to improve a network's internal knowledge through peer rotation. Wuille suggests attempting a new outgoing connection every X minutes, which could replace an existing connection based on a scoring system. However, Hearn raises concerns about an attack where an observer could gather information about linked transactions by listening to many peers. To prevent such attacks, Wuille proposes protecting a subset of long-lived connections and announcing transactions through randomly chosen peers to avoid linkages. He also suggests using a facility for anti-linkage announcements that can be optimized for learning and partition resistance. These solutions not only protect against attacks but also preserve the user's identity if used over Tor.</summary>
