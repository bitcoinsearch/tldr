    <summary>In an email from August 23, 2014, programmer Paul Rabahy shared his thoughts on the use of Github for Bitcoin Core. Despite understanding the concepts of Bitcoin and being a professional programmer, Rabahy had not compiled his own copy of Bitcoin Core. However, he had looked at pull requests on Github and cloned the repository to his computer. He found Github easy to use and appreciated the extra time and effort that goes into signing commits and merges for security purposes. Rabahy expressed a desire for Bitcoin Core to continue using Github but did not object to additional mirrors of the repo being hosted on different sites. He also noted that nothing suggested would remove the ability to explore and read changes in the code. The way Git works is that local repositories are authoritative for each user, making it a decentralized system regardless of Github's efforts to make it look otherwise.</summary>
