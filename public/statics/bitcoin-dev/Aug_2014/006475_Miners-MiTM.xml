    <summary>In this context, Jeff Garzik discusses the possibility of enabling TLS on pool servers and how it could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. As an alternative, he suggests implementing a more lightweight method that prevents client payout redirection and server impersonation. He also mentions his previous idea of using simple ECDSA signatures for messages in GBT2, but notes that it may run into legal issues with RedHat/Fedora. The context ends with a message from Luke, but no further information is provided about their contribution to the discussion.</summary>
