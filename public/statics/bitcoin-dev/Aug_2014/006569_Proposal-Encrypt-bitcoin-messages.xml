    <summary>In an email sent on August 19, 2014, Jeff Garzik discussed the limitations of encryption and suggested a solution to fix the issue. He stated that encryption is not useful if one can deduce the same information by observing packet sizes and timings. Rather than using this as a reason to not encrypt, he recommends adding random padding to encrypted packets, which will not be distinguishable from the rest of the data. In addition, he suggests adding random bias to their timing. Garzik believes that making Bitcoin as anonymous as possible is a natural desire and encourages everyone to acknowledge this fact. He states that people will continue to demand anonymity until it is achieved and suggests using Tor, Freenet, or other anonymous P2P networks to help solve the problems associated with achieving anonymity. The email was signed by "xor," who is a developer of https://freenetproject.org.</summary>
