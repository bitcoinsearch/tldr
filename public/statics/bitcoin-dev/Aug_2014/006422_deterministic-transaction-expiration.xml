    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list in 2014, Tom Harding proposed the use of nLockTime for transaction expiration, which would prevent a transaction creator from lying about transaction confirmation eligibility. Jeff Garzik expressed concerns about this proposal, citing potential issues with existing uses of nLockTime, such as payment channel refunds. Kaz Wesley also raised concerns about using a transaction expiry countdown when a transaction is received, stating that it would make nodes susceptible to re-accepting forgotten transactions. The possibility of introducing a new field in a new transaction version was also mentioned as a solution.</summary>
