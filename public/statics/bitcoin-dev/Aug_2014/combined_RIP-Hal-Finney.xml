    <summary>Hal Finney, a prominent figure in the cypherpunk community, passed away on August 28, 2014. Matt Corallo shared the news of his death on an Extropy chat forum and encouraged everyone to thank Hal for his contributions to the community. Hal played a significant role in the early days of Bitcoin and PGP, and his work and contributions to the cypherpunk movement are greatly appreciated. Despite not personally knowing Hal, the writer felt saddened by his passing and acknowledged him as an inspiring character due to his thought-provoking post about his battle with ALS on Bitcoin Talk in 2013. Hal's body is being cryogenically preserved.</summary>
