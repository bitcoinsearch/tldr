    <summary>In 2014, Matt Whitlock suggested that it would be more efficient to introduce a new script opcode that pushes the current block height onto the operand stack. This would enable arbitrary logic about which blocks the transaction can be valid in and require that the client revalidate all transactions in its mempool when the chain tip changes. If a transaction becomes invalid later, it could have severe consequences as it might preclude otherwise harmless transactions due to reorganization. Although there may be uses for this, the resulting outputs should be considered differently fungible and only used with caution, not as a mechanism for ordinary transactions, similar to immature coinbases.</summary>
