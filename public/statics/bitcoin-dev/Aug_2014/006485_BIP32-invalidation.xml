    <title>BIP32 - invalidation</title>

    <summary>The email conversation discusses the security concerns of a proposed change in the bitcoin specification. The proposed change involves assigning I_L := I_L mod n when I_L &gt;= n, which is considered less secure as it makes the selection of private keys uneven and eliminates the possibility of provable security equal to random keys. Additionally, the bignum modulo operation requires complex additional logic and may not be available due to layering issues. The email highlights the importance of handling corner cases in cryptographic software such as point at infinity cases, zero value signature and adding colinear points. While some implementations do not check for these cases, it is important to handle them to ensure the security of the system. The email concludes by stating that those who are unprepared to deal with these complications should leave writing this kind of software for other people.</summary>
