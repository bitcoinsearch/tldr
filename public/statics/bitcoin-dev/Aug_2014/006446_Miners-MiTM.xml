    <summary>On August 8, 2014, a conversation occurred regarding a potential attack on Bitcoin mining pools. It was stated that although 140 BTC may sound alarming, it was actually a minor issue and many miners were not even aware of it. The implementation of TLS would make the attack more difficult to execute. However, if someone controlled ISP routers, a man-in-the-middle attack with TLS would still be possible, albeit more challenging.Pedro Worcel expressed surprise that miners were not concerned about losing their profits due to the attack. Slush responded to the email thread but his response is not included in the provided context.</summary>
