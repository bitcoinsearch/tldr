    <summary>In an email exchange, Luke Dashjr and Mike Hearn discussed the usefulness of encrypting inter-node traffic for anonymity. Dashjr argued that encrypting non-sensitive inter-node traffic is worthless for anonymity, while Hearn pointed out that P2P connections carry Bloom filters which are not public information. Dashjr responded by saying that as soon as this information is shared with an unknown or public peer, it becomes public information. However, he also acknowledged that there is weak assurance that it probably won't be against many weaker attackers, due to the expense of obtaining lots of IP addresses.</summary>
