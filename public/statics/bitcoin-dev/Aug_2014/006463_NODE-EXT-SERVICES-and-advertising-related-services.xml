    <summary>The proposal of implementing an external application or script like 'getutxos' could be useful for adding other services like -txindex or nLockTime storage facility into bitcoind. However, this would require a local interprocess message bus for bitcoind. A better alternative would be to use './bitcoind -servicecookie= -allowextservices=127.0.0.1/8' and connect to bitcoind as normal. This will allow any program to send "registersrv" with the cookie and a list of command ids it's interested in, maybe a service bit to set, and start receiving those messages wrapped in a new structure that gives some kind of client ID (like IP address). An additional standalone program can then bridge this mechanism to running a shell command for particular messages.</summary>
