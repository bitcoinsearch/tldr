    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2014, a new network tx field was proposed to solve the problem of redeeming a transaction that has passed its relay window without being confirmed. However, developer Jeff Garzik pointed out that it cannot be assumed that transaction creation time and transaction publish-to-outside-world time are the same. In response to a suggestion to add a new IsStandard rule rejecting transactions with an nLockTime more than N blocks behind the current tip, Garzik said that someone wishing to redeem such a transaction could still do so with a child-refreshes-parent policy. The email chain also included a promotion for Black Duck Code Sight software.</summary>
