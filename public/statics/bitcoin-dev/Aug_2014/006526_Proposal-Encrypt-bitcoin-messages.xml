    <summary>A suggestion was made for Bitcoin Core to generate a public/private key pair and share the public one with peers. The proposal was to exchange public keys during the initial handshake between two peers. It was suggested that generating a new random pair of keys per each peer would keep each conversation isolated from each other encryption-speaking. These keys would be used only to encrypt further communication between peers post-handshake and have nothing to do with a user's wallet. While it was acknowledged that this approach could provide privacy and integrity, it would not provide authentication. In response, Gregory Maxwell cautioned against the use of TLS due to its complex attack surface and difficult-to-audit code, which makes it vulnerable to DOS attacks and memory disclosures or remote execution vulnerabilities.</summary>
