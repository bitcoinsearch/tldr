    <summary>The discussion started by Ivan Pustogarov on periodic rotation of outbound connections in the Bitcoin network aims to mitigate the risks associated with a subset of 8 entry nodes, which uniquely identifies a user. An attacker can leverage this information to link different blockchain addresses of the same user. The proposed solution recommends that a Bitcoin client periodically rotates its set of outbound connections to blur the fingerprint over time. However, rotating peers excessively every 2-10 minutes is unnecessary. By default, Bitcoin clients advertise their public IP addresses, and an attacker can use this information to deanonymize clients. The corresponding pull request is #4723. More details are available at https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, supported the open discussion.</summary>
