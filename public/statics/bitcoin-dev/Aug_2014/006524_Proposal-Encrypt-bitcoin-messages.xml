    <summary>In an email thread from 2014, Richard Moore and another individual discuss the use of public and private key pairs for encryption between peers. They raise concerns about the security of sharing public keys and suggest using ECDH for a symmetric key and transport using a block cipher as a solution. The use of SSH fingerprint and self-signed certificates with TLS is also proposed. A link to a website promoting CurveCP encryption is provided in the email signature. The email ends with a reminder to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible.</summary>
