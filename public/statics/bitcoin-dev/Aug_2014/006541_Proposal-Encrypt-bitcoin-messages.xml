    <summary>End-to-end encryption may not be very useful in achieving its intended purpose of securing communication, according to a post on the Bitcoin mailing list. The post argues that even if it worked perfectly, it would only provide a microscopic obfuscatory advantage over a weak passive attacker, while greatly increasing software complexity and CPU time. Moreover, because there is no method of authentication, any encryption implemented will be easily blown away by someone who stands in the middle of two nodes. Additionally, the post suggests that sensitive information is already better protected by anonymization rather than encryption, making the latter redundant.</summary>
