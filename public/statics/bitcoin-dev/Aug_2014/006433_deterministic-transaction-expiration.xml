    <summary>In a discussion about bitcoin transactions on 08/06/2014, Peter Todd claimed that the general case doesn't need transmission of any merkle data and can be derived from transaction data itself. However, another participant raised concerns about this claim, stating that information such as expiry is hidden behind the merkle root in the transaction and validators need to know it. The participant questioned how validators could make decisions without this information and suggested that guessing would not be a viable solution.</summary>
