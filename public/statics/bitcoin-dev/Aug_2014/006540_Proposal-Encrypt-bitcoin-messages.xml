    <summary>Justus Ranvier and Peter Todd were discussing the best way to add support for Tor to Bitcoin. Todd suggested making Debian/Ubuntu packages depend on Tor and including an install-time script to set up the hidden service, which was welcomed by Tor developers. However, Ranvier proposed compiling Tor into Bitcoin Core as a library to make it work seamlessly, without any code changes. Todd countered this proposal, stating that it would increase the attack surface of Bitcoin Core, similar to using OpenSSL for straight SSL support. Furthermore, Todd's suggestion of adding Tor support to the Debian packages can be easily implemented through an install-time script without requiring any code changes.</summary>
