    <summary>In an email conversation in August 2014, Jeff Garzik expressed his wish for Bitcoin Core's issues and git repository to not be on centralized service like Github. In response, xor mentioned that using Git the wrong way or being unaware of its capabilities could lead to a problem with Github, but also pointed out that GnuPG signed commits or tags prevent anyone from modifying or inserting a commit before them without breaking the signature. Furthermore, Pieter, who was part of the conversation, stated that they were aiming to have merges done through the github-merge tool, which allows for an easy-access mechanism for people to contribute and inspect, while having a higher security standard for changes made to master.</summary>
