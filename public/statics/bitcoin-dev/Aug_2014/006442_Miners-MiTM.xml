    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, a user shared an article about someone abusing the BGP protocol to intercept miner traffic. Luke Dashjr responded that this was old news and that BFGMiner and Eloipool had already been hardened against it. He also mentioned that no Bitcoin pools had deployed it so far and that he was not aware of any actual case of it being used against Bitcoin. In response, slush chimed in saying that SSL + certificate validation on the client side was the only protection available, but certificate revocation and updates in miners were problematic, and that was why most pools did not want to use it.</summary>
