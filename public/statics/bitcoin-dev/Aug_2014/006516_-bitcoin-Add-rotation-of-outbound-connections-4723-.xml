    <summary>The conversation begins with an agreement that 3 persistent connections instead of 8 can reduce the success rate of the entry-peers fingerprinting attack. It is suggested not to disconnect any "addnode" nodes and whitelisted peers. The concern of partitioning is discussed where an attacker starts up a moderate number of sybil nodes and connects to every available listening peer to fill their inbound capacity. This kind of activity would only disrupt newly joining peers in the current network, but excessive rotation could result in the entire network getting connected exclusively via the sybils.</summary>
