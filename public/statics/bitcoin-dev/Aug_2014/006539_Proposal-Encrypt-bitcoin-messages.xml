    <summary>Peter Todd suggested that the easiest way to add Tor support to Bitcoin would be to make Debian/Ubuntu packages depend on Tor and include an install-time script to set up the hidden service. He confirmed with Tor developers that they would welcome the additional load that Bitcoin would add to the Tor network. However, the easiest way for node operators to support Tor would be to compile it into Bitcoin Core as a library so that it would "just work" when turned on. The message was signed with PGP using SHA256 and included an attachment of 0x38450DB5.asc.</summary>
