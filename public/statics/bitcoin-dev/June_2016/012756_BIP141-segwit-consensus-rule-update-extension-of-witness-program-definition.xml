    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr expressed his opinion regarding the possibility of a hard fork being needed if the 32 bytes hash is deemed unsafe in the future. He argued that having a witness program larger than 40 bytes would be unnecessary and expensive as it takes up more UTXO space. However, he acknowledged the downside of being too strict, which limits the ability to do soft fork upgrades in the future. Therefore, he suggested raising the limit to 75 bytes. On the other hand, Pieter, who initiated the discussion, didn't see the point of changing it anymore. He believed that any data that needs to be encoded can be moved to the witness at a cheaper cost and replaced by a 256-bit hash. The only thing not allowed in the hash is metadata to indicate the hashing/rule scheme used, which Pieter thought could be represented by 68 bits (OP_n + 8 bytes).</summary>
