    <summary>In this email conversation, there is a discussion between Peter Todd and Bram Cohen regarding the proposal of UTXO and STXO commitments. However, Todd clarifies that he is only proposing TXO commitments, not UTXO or STXO. Then, they go on to discuss the use of a merkle tree or a patricia trie for the commitments. Todd explains his use of patricia trie and its byte level definition. He also compares the performance of hashing functions and memory cache misses between the mountain range and straight merkle tree. Finally, there is a discussion about the sub-1 cache miss per update for MMRs and patricia trie utxo commitment.</summary>
