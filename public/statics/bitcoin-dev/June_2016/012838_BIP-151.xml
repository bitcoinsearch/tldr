    <summary>In a discussion regarding BIP151, Eric Voskuil asked Peter Todd how it makes a MITM attack easier to detect or increases the probability of one being detected. Peter Todd replied that BIP151 gives users the tools to detect such an attack. He compared it with PGP where some users do not properly check keys making them easy targets for attackers. However, some users do check keys, and it is difficult for attackers to distinguish between these two groups of users, making it risky to MITM attack any user. The key thing is to get everyones communications encrypted first. This will prevent MITM attackers from intercepting 99% of the communications without the risk of detection.</summary>
