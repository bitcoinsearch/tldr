    <summary>Akiva is proposing a new way of partitioning a Merkel Tree Forrest to create new Merkel Trees periodically as the currency supply grows. This approach would partition the mining process and improve the distribution of verification. New trees would be created once the number of BTC exceeds 250 BTC, with each tree containing its own batch and Merkel Tree. Small-scale pool miners would dominate a single or small number of trees and their block chains under this scenario.However, there could be a potential partial payment problem where a user may send 3 BTC but only receive 2 BTC since 1 BTC ends up on a bad block and needs to be resent. This idea is not thoroughly thought through, and it might be too late for Bitcoin since most of the currency supply is already available. Nevertheless, it could be used for new cryptocurrencies.Akiva asks Scott if he has any further thoughts on this idea.</summary>
