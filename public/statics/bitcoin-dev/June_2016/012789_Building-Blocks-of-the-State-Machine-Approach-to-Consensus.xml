    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, zaki inquired about the process of transaction linearization. Peter Todd responded by proposing a state machine approach that does not require blocks or miners to exist at all. Rather than broadcast publicly, transaction data only needs to be provided to parties involved in the transaction. Therefore, transaction history linearization is something that wallets would handle. The proposal assumes the availability of a single-use seal primitive and a random beacon primitive for tx linearization, allowing a system to be built on top of these primitives.</summary>
