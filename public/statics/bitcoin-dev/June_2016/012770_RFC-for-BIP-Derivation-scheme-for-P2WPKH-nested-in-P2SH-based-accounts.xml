    <summary>On June 14, 2016, Daniel Weigl proposed a BIP for a P2SH accounts protocol. He posted the proposal on Github and asked for feedback from the community. In response to this post, Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet, asked about the upcoming implementation of segwit version 2 with schnorr signatures and if there was a way to support it without using a third derivation path. There is no further information provided in the context regarding these questions.</summary>
