    <summary>The email conversation between Peter Todd and Pieter Wuille, dated June 23, 2016, discusses the removal of BIP75 from the bips repository. Peter Todd argued that Bitcoin developers should not participate in anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) practices, as it is bad strategy for Bitcoin. He suggested boycotting wallets that implement it. However, Pieter Wuille disagreed with him, stating that censorship of a BIP based on personal opinion is not appropriate. Peter Todd believed that by accepting BIPs, the bitcoin organization on Github is putting some kind of approval stamp on them. Although editorial control is necessary to some extent, it should be based on process rather than opinion.</summary>
