    <summary>In an email conversation between Eric Voskuil and Peter Todd, Voskuil expressed his concern over the insufficiency of BIP151 in protecting against a MITM attack. Todd responded by stating that Bitcoin Core's tor support is already equivalent to BIP151 functionality, but with a Tor dependency. He also mentioned that any arguments against BIP151 being implemented are equally arguments against existing Tor onion support. Todd clarified that BIP151 removes the dependency on Tor and enables encrypted connections regardless of whether or not Tor is installed. Finally, Todd asked Voskuil if he was against Bitcoin Core's tor support because if he wasn't, then he couldn't have any objections to BIP151 being implemented either.</summary>
