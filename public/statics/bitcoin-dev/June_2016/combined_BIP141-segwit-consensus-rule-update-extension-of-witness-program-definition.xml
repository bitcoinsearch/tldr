    <title>Combined summary - BIP141 segwit consensus rule update: extension of witness program definition</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr expressed his opinion regarding the possibility of a hard fork being needed if the 32 bytes hash is deemed unsafe in the future. He suggested raising the limit to 75 bytes, while Pieter believed that any data that needs to be encoded can be moved to the witness at a cheaper cost and replaced by a 256-bit hash.The segregated witness (BIP141) consensus rule has been updated to extend the definition of a witness program, allowing it to consist of a data push between 2 to 40 bytes. Previously, only a data push between 2 to 32 bytes was allowed. The update was necessary as BIP141 defined only version 0 witness programs for P2WPKH and P2WSH, leaving versions 1 to 16 undefined and considered anyone-can-spend scripts. Luke Dashjr and Johnson Lau discussed the possibility of extending the definition for scripts with a 1-byte push followed by a push of 40 bytes. Lau suggested making it even bigger, up to 75 bytes, which Dashjr did not see as a sufficient answer to. However, Pieter explained that a softfork to redefine such scripts would be complicated due to the limit in place preventing the use of the witness field. Dashjr proposed extending the definition to 33 bytes, allowing for 16*256 new script versions assuming the use of a 32-byte program hash. The safety of a 32-byte hash was also mentioned, and a potential hard fork if it is deemed unsafe. A witness program of 40 bytes allows a 32-byte hash with 8-byte metadata, and any scripts larger than 32 bytes should be recorded in the witness field to reduce transaction cost and impact on the UTXO set. Since SHA256 is widely used, it is unlikely that a larger witness program would be required without a major revamp of the bitcoin protocol.Previously, no witness data was allowed for a script with a 1-byte push followed by a data push of 33-40 bytes, but this is now allowed. On June 8, 2016, Johnson Lau suggested making the size of transaction scripts even bigger at 75 bytes. However, while Pieter explained why a size larger than 75 would be inconvenient, he did not provide an adequate answer for the proposed increase to 75 bytes. Luke pointed out that scripts with a 1-byte push followed by a push of over 40 bytes remain anyone-can-spend, so they could be redefined with a softfork. If you're running a segnet node or a testnet node with segwit code, it's important to upgrade to the latest version at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7910. Alternative implementations should ensure their consensus code is updated accordingly to avoid forking off the network.In summary, while there was a suggestion to increase the size of transaction scripts, it was deemed inconvenient and alternative solutions were proposed that would require careful consideration and potential changes to the current transaction format. The possibility of a hard fork was also discussed if the 32-byte hash is deemed unsafe in the future.</summary>
