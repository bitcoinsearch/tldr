    <summary>On June 8, 2016, Johnson Lau suggested making the size of transaction scripts even bigger at 75 bytes. However, while Pieter explained why a size larger than 75 would be inconvenient, he did not provide an adequate answer for the proposed increase to 75 bytes. Luke pointed out that scripts with a 1-byte push followed by a push of over 40 bytes remain anyone-can-spend, so they could be redefined with a softfork. However, this would prevent the use of the witness field for such scripts. Therefore, any such softfork would require two different witness commitments or disabling the previous witness transaction format.</summary>
