    <summary>The context revolves around the concept of closed seals, which are used as a construct for smart contracts and value transfer systems. The scalability properties of closed seals are discussed, with various techniques suggested to shorten history proofs in different ways, depending on the application's needs. Bitcoin developers are considering embedding a Lisp interpreter, like Scheme, into the blockchain protocol to provide validation in a functional scripting language.The article delves into various methods of using oracles to prove the validity or non-validity of transactions, messages, and seals in decentralized systems. The scalability of transaction history proofs can be improved by using a random beacon and taking advantage of inflation. Probabilistic validation techniques, such as the Fiat-Shamir transform, can also be used to prove that the percentage of undetected fraud within the system is less than a certain amount with a specified probability. Transaction history proof scalability can be further improved by allowing a transaction proof to be considered valid without validating any of the inputs and resetting the size of the transaction history proof.The context covers multiple email conversations and articles discussing various aspects of Bitcoin's design, including smart contracts, value transfer systems, and scalability. The state-machine approach to smart contract systems is discussed, requiring deterministic code and expressions that allow for precisely specified conditions upon which funds can be spent. The data that causes a given expression to return true is then a "proof," which can be passed from one party to another to prove desired states in the system have been reached.Several articles and email conversations discuss the importance of closed seals as a useful construct for smart contracts and value transfer/currency systems. However, the scalability properties of closed seals are not clear, with scalability remaining an issue despite the use of trusted oracles. Additionally, the conversation discusses transaction linearization and embedding a Lisp interpreter such as Scheme in Bitcoin's design. The articles also discuss bounded oracles, atomicity, proof-of-publication, and proof-of-non-publication techniques to improve scalability and security of blockchain transactions. Finally, probabilistic validation techniques are suggested as a means of proving the percentage of undetected fraud within the system is less than a certain amount with a specified probability.The article emphasizes on the importance of classifying systems based on available data to condition and status of other seals. It discusses how new data is returned by the 'condition'. The context also mentions related work on UTXO-based smart contracts such as Typecoin, which is a contract language based on logic. Another system described is Generic coins, which is a generalized Bitcoin-style system used for reference in research. Additionally, flexichains is a prototype that unifies account-based and UTXO-based models into a single model.In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, the process of transaction linearization was discussed. Peter Todd proposed a state machine approach that eliminates the need for blocks or miners to exist. Instead, transaction data only needs to be provided to parties involved in the transaction, with wallets handling transaction history linearization. The proposal assumes the availability of a single-use seal primitive and a random beacon primitive for tx linearization, allowing a system to be built on top of these primitives.The article concludes with several references for further reading.</summary>
