    <summary>The conversation between Peter Todd and an unknown individual discusses the implementation of merbinner trees and their efficiency against attackers. They clarify that each node in a merbinner tree commits to the prefix that all keys below that level start with, not just the depth. The discussion also touches upon the optimization of memory usage, and how making things smaller than a single block (64 bytes) won't speed up hashing time. Furthermore, the conversation covers security issues related to variable sized commitments and how it can help make clear whether it's possible to brute force the message behind the commitment. The conversation proceeds to discuss the data structure used for Bitcoin updates and addresses how hashing is slow and the overheads that come with it. Finally, the conversation concludes with the idea that blake2 and cache-coherent implementation are worth it and necessary for real adoption, while the amortized binary radix tree is tempting but not worth it.</summary>
