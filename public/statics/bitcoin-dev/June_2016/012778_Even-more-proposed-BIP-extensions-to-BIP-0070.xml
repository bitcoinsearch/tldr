    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin P2P protocol has led to a comparison between Protobuf and JSON. Despite some opinions questioning the appropriateness of Protocol Buffers, it was chosen in favor of its strong types, less vulnerability to malleability, and good platform support. Arguments have been made for the use of JSON instead, but this has not gained enough traction yet. In terms of extending BIP70, it is suggested that multiple BIPs should be created for orthogonal ideas. The proposed extensions include using payment codes instead of wallet addresses for subscriptions, supporting subscription intervals of a preset list, and allowing optional notifications for upcoming payments. In general, it has been proposed that JSON be used instead of protocol buffers for easier use and extensibility. An "extendible" URI-like scheme has also been suggested to support multi-mode identity mechanisms.Some questions have been raised about whether a new BIP should be created specifically for identity verification, or if a more general approach would be better. There are also different opinions on which identity protocols to use and whether an extensible protocol is necessary. Overall, there seems to be a desire for more flexibility and options in the Bitcoin P2P protocol.</summary>
