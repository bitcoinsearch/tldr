    <summary>The writer expresses concerns about the use of bitcoin URI for everything and the potential bloat it could cause on the blockchain. However, they clarify that they do not want to add unnecessary refund transaction data and were simply thinking out loud. They suggest keeping BIP 75 the same and including subscription information in the PaymentACK, allowing the wallet to re-initiate an invoice after the subscription interval has passed. The writer believes subscriptions are essential for bitcoin to be used as a real payment system.</summary>
