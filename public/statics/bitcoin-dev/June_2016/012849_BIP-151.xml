    <summary>The conversation between Gregory Maxwell and another member of the bitcoin-dev community discussed the BIP37 bloom filters, which are used in "SPV" wallets. Maxwell argued that these filters should eventually be removed from the protocol. They also discussed the importance of privacy for network participants and the limitations of BIP151 in providing such privacy. The topic of key distribution was brought up as a potential problem with general authentication, but it was noted that manually maintaining add nodes is a best practice for miners and high value systems. Overall, there were concerns about the effectiveness of the BIP without an identity system or strong authentication. The discussion ended with mention of a future auth BIP that could address some of these concerns.</summary>
