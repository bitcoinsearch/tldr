    <summary>In the discussion between Bram Cohen and Peter Todd, they talked about the differences between merkle trees and patricia tries in relation to Bitcoin's unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. Cohen proposed that there should be incentives for collecting dust. Todd suggested using variable-sized commitments instead of just hash digests for when data is committed. This would allow for data shorter than the length of a digest to be included in the commitment itself, thus improving efficiency. Todd also discussed the indexing of the UTXO set, explaining that it is just a binary radix tree at a crypto definition level. He described some optimizations to avoid cache misses, but concluded that it would be better to keep the codebase simple and use standard techniques.</summary>
