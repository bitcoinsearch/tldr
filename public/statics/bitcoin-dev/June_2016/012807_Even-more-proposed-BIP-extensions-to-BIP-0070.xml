    <summary>In a Bitcoin development forum, Peter Todd made a proposal to remove BIP75 from the BIPS repository and boycott wallets that implement it. He argued that Bitcoin developers should not willingly participate in AML/KYC because it is bad strategy for Bitcoin development. He compared this to Tor adding wiretapping functionality and W3C supporting DRM tech. However, another developer replied and questioned Todd's suggestion, asking if he was seriously suggesting to censor a BIP just because he disagrees with it.</summary>
