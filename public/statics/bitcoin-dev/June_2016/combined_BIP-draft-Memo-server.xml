    <summary>A developer named Chris Priest is building a standalone system called multiexplorer to archive and serve memos for Bitcoin wallets. The system would allow wallet users to move from one wallet to another without losing their memos. The memos will be encrypted, stored on memo servers, and the public key will be propagated so that they can be shared amongst different servers. There should be multiple memo servers, and users could decide which ones to entrust their data with. However, when exporting and importing into another wallet, memos added to each transaction are lost as there is no way for this data to be encoded into the mnemonic. Thus, the writer is planning to make a stand-alone system for archiving and serving these memos. Once built, every wallet will support the system, and users should be able to move from one wallet to another by copy+pasting the mnemonic into the next wallet without losing their memos.The specifics of how the memos will be encrypted have not been set in stone yet, but it is important that they are encrypted strongly. The memos should also support different types of data and the memo server shouldn't be tied to a specific wallet schema. Users should only need to provide their memo-specific identifier to the memo server, which isn't necessarily related to any part of the user's wallet. There isn't one single memo server, but multiple memo servers all ran by different people. These memo servers share data amongst each other through a sync process. The writer has provided details of how the system will work at https://github.com/priestc/bips/blob/master/memo-server.mediawiki. This system will make it easier for people to move off of old wallets that may not be safe anymore, to more modern wallets with better security features, and reduce lock-in.</summary>
