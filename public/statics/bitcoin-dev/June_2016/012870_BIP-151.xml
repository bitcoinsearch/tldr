    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Erik Aronesty opined that encrypting links in a network without identity doesn't seem to help enough for the costs to be justified. He suggested a PGP-like "web of trust" proposal for both the security of the Bitcoin network itself and transmission of Bitcoin addresses. There already exists an unutilised WoT of "good" actors within the network - miners via the coinbase transaction. Bootstrapping their own "trusted" pool of IP addresses would be possible via the 100 bytes coinbase script. Once nodes have identity and peer-to-peer verified public keys, encryption becomes easy. A miner's WoT will give this.</summary>
