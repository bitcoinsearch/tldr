    <summary>In an email conversation on June 8, 2016, Johnson Lau expressed concerns about the safety of 32 bytes hash and how it could affect the safety of txid. He suggested that if 32 bytes hash is deemed unsafe in the future, a hard fork might be needed. He also questioned the usefulness of witness program larger than 40 bytes, as it would be more expensive and take more UTXO space. On the other hand, Luke argued that being lenient could limit the ability to do softfork upgrades in the future. Despite Pieter's concern that raising the limit to 75 bytes would require more development and testing, Luke requested the limit to be raised to 75 bytes.</summary>
