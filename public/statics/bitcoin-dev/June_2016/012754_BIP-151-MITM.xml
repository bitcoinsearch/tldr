    <summary>In this context, Gregory Maxwell discusses an attack vector where plaintext reduction is not interesting for active attackers as they can impersonate the remote side. Authentication is addressed through a separate specification that builds on this one. The discussion leads to a query about how authentication may be done and Jonas Schnelli suggests reviewing his current work on Auth-BIP. He also provides a link to his work on Github and the most recent MITM/auth discussion.</summary>
