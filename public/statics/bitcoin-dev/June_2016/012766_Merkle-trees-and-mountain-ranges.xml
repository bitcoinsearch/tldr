    <summary>Peter Todd and an unidentified person were discussing the technicalities of TXO commitments, which are a merkle tree committing to the state of all transaction outputs, both spent and unspent. The conversation also touched upon the possibility of introducing incentives for collecting dust, concerns about introducing STXO set commitments that grow without bound, and the differences between Peter's MMR codebase and patricia trie. The patricia trie being discussed is similar to the one used in Peter's MMR codebase, with non-padding sha256 and each level not hashing in a record of its depth and the usage of ONLY0 and ONLY1. The conversation also explored the possibility of sub-1 cache misses per update and how it would be indexed in memory.</summary>
