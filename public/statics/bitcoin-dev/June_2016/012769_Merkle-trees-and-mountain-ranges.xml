    <summary>The discussion between Peter Todd and Bram Cohen via Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the issue of handling latency problem in UTXO commitments while ensuring fast validation before block propagation. The proposed approach is to trail UTXO commitments by a fixed number of blocks (not exceeding five blocks) to keep latency from becoming an issue, as computing UTXO commitments takes some time. However, it does not imply latency to proofs of inclusion and exclusion, which can be done by adding roots of what's added and deleted in each block. This approach adds complexity and may increase proof size but is necessary for fast validation before block propagation.</summary>
