    <summary>Eric Voskuil, a member of the Bitcoin development community, stated in an email on June 28, 2016 that "out of band key check" is not included in the BIP151 protocol. The purpose of this protocol is to provide a session ID and it requires a secure channel for authentication. However, it does not include tools to detect an attack, which is a general requirement for authentication. Voskuil raised concerns about this issue. He also questioned how one can use a Bitcoin address securely and whether emails from individuals claiming to be from the NSA are legitimate.</summary>
