    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about end-to-end encryption between nodes, Eric Voskuil expressed concern over the potential issues with designing a distributed system that requires authentication without identity and central control. He suggested that this challenge may be even more difficult than creating Bitcoin itself and that trust on first use (TOFU) would not solve the problem. Alfie John responded to the thread with a link to a paper titled "Decentralized Anonymous Credentials" by Christina Garman, Matthew Green, and Ian Miers, which he thought could contribute to the discussion. The paper proposes a decentralized system for anonymous credentials that could potentially address some of the concerns raised in the discussion.</summary>
