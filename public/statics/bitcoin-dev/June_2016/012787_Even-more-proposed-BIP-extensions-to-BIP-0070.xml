    <summary>Erik Aronesty, via bitcoin-dev, has shared his opinion on BIP 0070 stating that it has been a moderate success. However, he suggests that protocol buffers are not appropriate because ease of use and extensibility is desired over the minor gains of efficiency in this protocol and therefore, JSON messages should be supported as the standard going forward. He also highlights the problematic reliance on merchant-supplied https (X509) as the sole form of merchant identification and suggests alternate schemes such as dnssec/netki, pgp, and possibly keybase. In addition, Erik suggests the inclusion of an optional client supplied identification for AML/KYC compliance. Peter Todd, in response, expresses his concerns about including AML/KYC support in standards as it negatively impacts fungibility and privacy. He argues that standards with AML/KYC support should not be adopted for similar reasons that the W3C should not be standardizing DRM.</summary>
