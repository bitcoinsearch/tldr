    <summary>In a discussion thread dated June 9, 2016, Gregory Maxwell addressed concerns about plaintext attacks and suggested that it is not an interesting attack vector for active attackers. Instead, they can easily impersonate the remote side. Authentication was mentioned as the solution to this issue, which is done by a separate specification that builds on this one. Alfie John, who was part of the discussion, asked if there are any links to discussions on how authentication may be done.</summary>
