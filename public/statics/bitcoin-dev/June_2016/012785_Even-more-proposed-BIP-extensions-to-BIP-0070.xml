    <summary>The email thread discusses various proposals for improving Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) 0070, which has seen moderate success. The first proposal advocates for using JSON messages instead of Protocol Buffers. However, some people disagree with this because of JSON's potential inefficiencies and parser bugs. The second proposal suggests using alternate schemes like DNSSEC/Netki, PGP, or Keybase instead of relying solely on merchant-supplied HTTPS as the sole form of merchant identification. X509 should still be supported since it is entrenched. Keybase is particularly liked by the author because it does not rely on the existing domain name system. Furthermore, the author suggests implementing a lightweight protocol for getting monthly subscriptions working. The third proposal recommends replacing BIP 47 payment codes with regular BIP 32 pub seeds when establishing subscriptions. It also suggests giving wallets the ability to confirm and store subscriptions and initiating them at the specified interval. Wallets may optionally ask users whether they want to be notified and confirm every interval, but if they do not, they must notify before initiating each payment. The fourth proposal suggests using JSON instead of Protocol Buffers going forward, an extendible URI-like scheme to support multi-mode identity mechanisms on both payment and subscription requests, and support for client as well as merchant multi-mode verification. Finally, the author proposes an identity-protocol-agnostic BIP + solid implementation of a couple of major protocols without any mention of payment URIs, just a way of sending and receiving identity-verified messages in general.</summary>
