    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jonas Schnelli shared that he is working on an Auth-BIP but it is not ready for review yet. However, he provided the link to his current work on Github for anyone who wants to take a look. He also shared the most recent discussion about MITM/auth, which was held on IRC. Alfie John thanked Jonas for providing the links.</summary>
