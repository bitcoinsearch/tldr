    <summary>In a mailing list conversation between Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd, the topic of editorial control over Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) was discussed. Wuille argued that some degree of editorial control will inevitably exist, but it should be restricted to objective process rather than personal opinions. Todd suggested that rejecting BIP75 on ethical/strategic grounds is reasonable, but Wuille disagreed and called it ridiculous. The conversation then shifted towards the acceptance of BIPs related to anti-money laundering/know-your-customer support in the future. The discussion took place on June 23, 2016.</summary>
