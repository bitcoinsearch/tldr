    <summary>The BIP37 bloom filters should be removed from the protocol as they lack value. However, the BIP151 is necessary for network participant privacy and authenticated links. The proposal is an ephemerally keyed opportunistic encryption system, not an identity system. Without something like BIP151, manually curated links cannot provide protection against partitioning sybils. Additionally, the protocol may become faster with the implementation of BIP151. While there are no significant key distribution problems in the mining and high-value systems case, a future auth BIP is expected to address the issue well.</summary>
