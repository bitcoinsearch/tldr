    <summary>Bram Cohen responded to Peter Todd's proposal for Merkle Mountain Range commitments in blocks. Cohen agrees that there is a need for UTXO commitments in blocks, but disagrees on the inclusion of STXO commitments and the use of Merkle Mountain Ranges. He argues that STXO commitments are unnecessary and cause performance problems, while the UTXO set can be used instead, and that the complexity of Merkle Mountain Ranges is not worth the CPU costs. Cohen suggests using trailing UTXO commitments as an approach to handling latency problems and proposes a raw Merkle tree with "magic pixie dust" to address cache misses as an alternative to Merkle Mountain Ranges. He has been working on an implementation of this and claims it is almost finished.</summary>
