    <title>BIP 151</title>

    <summary>The author of the message expresses concern over the lack of discussion on the reasoning behind BIP 151 and questions why libbitcoin or any node would want to support it. While acknowledging the usefulness of Bloom filter features when coupled with an identity system, the author is worried about the application of identity to the P2P protocol. The author argues that the desire to secure against the weaknesses of BF is being casually generalized to the P2P network, which may actually weaken its security. The author suggests that moving BF features to a client-server protocol might be a better resolution. The author highlights that the BIP does not make a case for other scenarios or contemplate the significant problems associated with key distribution in any identity system. Given that the BIP relies on identity, the author believes these considerations should be fully vetted before heading down another blind alley. The author's message also includes a PGP signature indicating its authenticity.</summary>
