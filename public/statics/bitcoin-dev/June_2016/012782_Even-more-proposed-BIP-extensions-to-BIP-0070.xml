    <summary>Erik Aronesty suggests some improvements to the BIP 0070 protocol. He believes that JSON messages should be used instead of protocol buffers for ease of use and extensibility. However, he also states that JSON can be inefficient and prone to bugs. Erik prefers sticking to protobuf unless a clearly superior protocol turns up. He also suggests alternate schemes for merchant identification such as DNSSEC/Netki, PGP, and Keybase. Erik likes Keybase because it does not rely on the existing domain-name system. Regarding subscriptions, Erik recommends using BIP0047 payment codes instead of wallet addresses when establishing subscriptions. Wallets must confirm and store subscriptions and initiate them at the specified interval. Intervals can only be from a preset list, and intervals missed by more than three days cause suspension until the user re-verifies. Wallets may optionally ask the user whether they want to be notified and confirm every interval or not. Erik proposes using JSON instead of protocol buffers going forward. An extendable URI-like scheme should be supported to support multi-mode identity mechanisms on both payment and subscription requests. Support for client as well as merchant multi-mode verification should be provided. Ideally, the identity verification URI scheme is somewhat orthogonal/independent of the payment request itself. Erik suggests implementing plugins for identity protocols if anyone thinks this is a good idea. Finally, he asks whether https:// or Keybase, PGP, or Netki all by themselves are enough or whether it is always better to have an extensible protocol.</summary>
