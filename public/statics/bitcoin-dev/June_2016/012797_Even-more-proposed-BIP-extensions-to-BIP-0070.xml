    <summary>The context discusses the use of payment protocol for buying from purse.io and its impracticality for end-users. The article suggests an alternative by extending the Bitcoin URI scheme, where the requestor is authenticated using DNSSEC, and the payment request is signed using an EC private key. This allows for authenticated requests without requiring a https server. However, there is no way for a merchant to refuse payment without direct communication with the merchant's server. The author suggests adding a refund address or a "ping" transaction to solve this issue. They also propose extending the PaymentAck with a "next_payment_days" field to update BIP0070/0075 for subscriptions. This would allow wallets to re-initiate an invoice request after the selected number of days.</summary>
