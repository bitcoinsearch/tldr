    <summary>The discussion in the bitcoin-dev mailing list talks about the adoption of the protocol buffers over JSON due to its strong types, less vulnerability to malleability and very good platform support. Although there is a noticeable lag with Bluetooth exchange of payment requests already with protocol buffers, JSON is considered less efficient size-wise. Erik Aronesty proposes several new additions for BIP70, which include the use of JSON instead of protocol buffers, adding alternate identification schemes such as pgp, keybase, and dnssec/netki, and an extendible URI-like scheme to support multi-mode identity mechanisms on both payment and subscription requests. Additionally, PGP signature of payment requests is recommended allowing for manual verification of key authenticity, consolidation into Bitcoin wallet's transaction history, and someone else can extract a signed payment request from a signed PGP e-mail and send it to make a payment for you. Lastly, the concern is raised about extending the URI scheme too much and reaching the practical size limit of NFC and QR codes quickly.</summary>
