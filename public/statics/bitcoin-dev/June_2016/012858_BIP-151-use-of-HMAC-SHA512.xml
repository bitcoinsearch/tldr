    <summary>A discussion on the Bitcoin developer mailing list has been had regarding BIP-0151 and the inclusion of cipher-type into the symmetric cipher key to avoid weak-cipher attacks. It was questioned whether the cipher-type referred to ECDH negotiation parameters. In response, Pieter Wuille explains that SHA256(key|cipher-type|mesg) is insecure due to the length extension property of SHA256. Although this property does not technically apply here, it is an example of why a hash function cannot be used generically in places where a MAC is needed. Furthermore, if a hash function is already being used, HMAC is easy to construct on top of it.</summary>
