    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Daniel Weigl has proposed a BIP for P2SH accounts. He has requested comments on the proposal and asked if anyone is implementing something different for BIP44 compliant wallets. The discussion on whether to keep it on the mailing list or move it to GitHub was also raised. Jochen has suggested that not only P2WPKH over P2SH addresses should be considered but also "native" P2WPKH addresses. He recommends that every fully BIP compatible wallet should support both types of segwit addresses. Aaron Voisine's suggestion to use different chain ids to distinguish between the address types is also supported by Jochen.</summary>
