    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd are discussing the role and authority of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) in the bitcoin community. Pieter believes that the BIP repository is not just a publication platform, but also carries an implicit seal of approval for accepted proposals. Peter argues that he has no authority over what goes into the repository, and that editorial control is inevitable to some extent, but should be based on process rather than opinion. He suggests using criteria such as community discussion, relevance, and reference implementation. The two disagree on whether rejecting BIP75 on ethical/strategic grounds constitutes censorship. Despite their differing opinions, both acknowledge that the location of the BIPs under the bitcoin namespace implies editorial control.</summary>
