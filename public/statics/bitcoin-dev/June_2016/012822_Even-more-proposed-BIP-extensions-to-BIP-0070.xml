    <summary>BIP0075 is not primarily for giving wallet addresses memorable names using DNSSEC protocol, as suggested by a previous statement. Rather, it is an encrypted/encapsulated version of BIP70 that ensures the safe exchange of BIP70 messages through an intermediary. The only identity information included in BIP75 is the pki_data field, which was already present in BIP70. There seems to be no proposal to remove BIP70 altogether.</summary>
