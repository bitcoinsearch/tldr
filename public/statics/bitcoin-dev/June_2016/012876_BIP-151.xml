    <summary>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers, Eric Voskuil asked Peter Todd if he was against Bitcoin Core's Tor support. Voskuil argued that node-to-node connections over Tor are encrypted and use self-authenticated onion addresses in the same way as BIP151 proposes. However, Todd pointed out that BIP151 is not enough to protect against a MITM attack and that node identity is necessary to close this hole. The yet-to-be-specified requirement for node identity is the basis of his primary concern. Despite this, Voskuil countered that Tor onion support is already enabled by default in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 and that any objections to BIP151 being implemented are also arguments against their existing Tor onion support. Nevertheless, Todd clarified that his objection to the presumption of node identity by BIP151 is unrelated to Bitcoin Core's Tor integration.</summary>
