    <summary>The context discusses the importance of payment protocol in face-to-face transactions where the payee's hardware device is automated in public or operated by untrusted employees. Providing a signed payment request gives the payer additional confidence that they are paying the correct person. However, the size of the Bitcoin URI can become too big for NFC and QR codes, and multiple destination payment addresses are essential for many reasons. The extension of the Bitcoin URI scheme can be used to provide authenticated requests without requiring an https server, but there is no way for a merchant to refuse a payment without direct communication with their server. This issue can be resolved by adding another step to review unsigned transactions before broadcasting them. Additionally, it's important for merchants processing monthly subscriptions to not hear about user payments after they hit the blockchain. Adding a refund address could help with this, but unnecessary refund transaction data should not bloat the blockchain.</summary>
