    <title>BIP 151 MITM</title>

    <summary>The author of the message believes that BIP 151 is a good idea but raises a concern about the initial 'encinit' message being suppressed during negotiation, causing a fallback to plaintext. The author suggests that peers should negotiate a secure channel from the beginning or back out entirely with no option of falling back. Additionally, the daemon listening on an entirely new port can indicate this loudly. The message is signed by Alfie John and includes a link to their personal website, https://www.alfie.wtf.</summary>
