    <summary>In an email conversation between Andreas Schildbach and an unknown party on May 9, 2015, Schildbach clarified that Bitcoin Wallet, along with most other bitcoinj based wallets, selects unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) by age to maximize priority. This helps to keep the number of UTXOs low but not as low as if it would always pick all UTXOs. However, it was noted that the growth of the UTXO database is not considered when selecting UTXOs to use. The size of the transaction is also a priority if not the top priority.</summary>
