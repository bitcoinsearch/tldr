    <summary>The email conversation between Matt Whitlock and Jim Phillips discusses the possibility of using a zero-conf service discovery protocol to allow lightweight clients to find a full node on the same LAN to peer with, instead of tying up WAN bandwidth. This would allow for lower traffic across the slow WAN connection in situations where there are hundreds or thousands of small SPV devices in a single home monitoring the blockchain. The proposed solution involves pinging the "all nodes" address and trying to connect to TCP port 8333 of each node that responds. While it may potentially take a lot of these devices before the total bandwidth is greater than downloading a full copy of the blockchain, hosting your own full node is seen as more trustworthy.</summary>
