    <summary>The conversation is about the issue of developer consensus in the Bitcoin community. The idea that anyone can be kicked out of the consensus process if they make no sense is discussed, and it is pointed out that this notion cannot work as it results in a belief in consensus only when it goes one's way. The importance of having a single decision maker for any given codebase is emphasized. The disagreement between members of the community on the issue of scalability and the possibility of Bitcoin becoming like Visa is mentioned. The idea that decentralization is a spectrum and Bitcoin will move around on that spectrum over time is put forward. Finally, there is a personal attack on Peter, accusing him of hypocrisy and publishing hacked private emails.</summary>
