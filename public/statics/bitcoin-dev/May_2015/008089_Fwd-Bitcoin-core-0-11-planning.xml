    <summary>In a conversation on April 28th, 2015, Pieter Wuille and Wladimir discussed the idea of softforks and their compatibility with Bitcoin Core major releases. Pieter suggested that since backports to older releases would be necessary anyway, there is no need for softforks to be bound to major releases. Wladimir agreed, stating that consensus changes are not really software features but rather properties of the underlying system that need to be adapted to. He also pointed out that if these changes do not require large code changes, they could be done in minor releases as well.</summary>
