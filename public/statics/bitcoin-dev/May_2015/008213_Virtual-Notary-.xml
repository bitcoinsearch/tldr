    <summary>On a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jonas Schnelli expressed his appreciation for http://www.deedbot.org, a website that offers proof of existence and ownership for various types of information, such as Bitcoin funds, real estate value, DNS ownership, and web page contents. The factoids generated can be recorded on the blockchain or part of a free attestation chain maintained by the website, with a permanent URL and an X.509 certificate available for download. However, Schnelli suggested improvements for the site's user experience, including fixing issues with Bitcoin payment verification and adding a "US only" badge for weather and real estate notarization. He also proposed two ideas: decentralizing the notary service log via an opensource p2p daemon and adding an opensource UI app to examine certificates, which could demonstrate independence from the website/service.</summary>
