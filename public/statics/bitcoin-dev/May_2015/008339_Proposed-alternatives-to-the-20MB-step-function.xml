    <summary>The context discusses the setting of minimum hardware requirements for running a Bitcoin node. This plan determines the finite nature of computing machines, which acknowledges the capacity limitations of remote nodes. The system can send a block of much larger size with a change to the processing of any merkle blocks received. However, this change is more significant than merely setting a multiple of the maximum block size allowed. The plan should be updated to reflect these considerations and avoid exhausting the hardware abilities of any reasonable computer.</summary>
