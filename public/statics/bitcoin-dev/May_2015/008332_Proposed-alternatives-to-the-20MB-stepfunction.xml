    <summary>In an email thread from May 2015, Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin core developer, expressed his opinion that developers should not be responsible for imposing economic policy on the network. He believed that hard forks should not be controversial and that forcing the public to adopt a controversial change is an abuse of power that sets a dangerous precedent for future changes. Wuille argued that the block size is a compromise made by the network between utility and centralization pressure, and should be treated as such. While he personally thought the block size should increase, he believed it should only be done after sufficient technological growth had been shown to support it without increased risk.</summary>
