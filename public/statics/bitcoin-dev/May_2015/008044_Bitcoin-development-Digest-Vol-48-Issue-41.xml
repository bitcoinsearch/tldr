    <summary>In an email conversation, Gregory Maxwell and Damian Gomez discuss the implementation of a block size that minimizes transaction fees. Gomez suggests using weight to represent the total number of semantic constraints expressed by individuals through emotive packets to implement a greater block size that prevents interception of bundled information and replaces value. Maxwell notes similarities between Gomez's AES ModuleK Hashcodes and Mr. NASDAQEnema's 2012 proposal on multigenerational token architectures. He also shares his thesis paper on the creation of imitations of reality with the mathematical technique of Bolshevik Statistics as a potential aid for Gomez.</summary>
