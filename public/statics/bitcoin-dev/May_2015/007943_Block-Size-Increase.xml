    <summary>In the context given, there is a proposal to raise the block size dynamically instead of setting it to a static number like 20MB. The suggestion is to make the maximum block size equal to "pow(2, nHeight/100000) * 1MB," which would double every approximately two years. This approach aims to address the issue of scalability and capacity in blockchain technology by allowing for more transactions to be processed within a block. It is important to note that this proposal is still under consideration and has not yet been implemented.</summary>
