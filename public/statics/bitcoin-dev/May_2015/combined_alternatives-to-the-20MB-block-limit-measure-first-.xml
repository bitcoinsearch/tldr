    <summary>During a discussion on block size limits, Ron proposed a method to estimate the average block size by measuring the average transaction size. He suggested fixing an average block period of 10 minutes and determining the desired average transaction rate (tps) to estimate the average block size. For instance, for a tps of around 10 transactions per second and an average transaction size of 612 Bytes, the block size would be 3,672,000 Bytes. Ron also discussed that given an average transaction size of 612 Bytes and a maximum block size of 1,000,000 Bytes, the current maximum tps would be approximately 2.72.Ron further shared that the average block size for the ten blocks up to block number 357999 was approximately 576 Bytes, indicating that the current possible tps is around 2.89. According to him, it's important to state one's assumed tps and a measured or presumed average transaction size before suggesting a maximum block size. For example, assuming a maximum block size of 20,000,000 Bytes and a current average transaction size of 600 Bytes, the tps would be around 55.5.Overall, Ron suggested using average transaction size as a key factor while estimating the average block size and determining the desired tps.</summary>
