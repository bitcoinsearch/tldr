    <summary>In an email exchange, Jorge Tim√≥n argues that larger blocks will lead to more centralization of mining and validation. Gavin Andresen counters that if a miner is leaving Bitcoin on the table due to poor connectivity, they should invest in better connectivity rather than relying on smaller block sizes. He also asks for a specific proposal for minimum requirements for connectivity to run a full node. The 20MB block size estimate comes from the cost to run a full node, which Andresen believes is not excessive.</summary>
