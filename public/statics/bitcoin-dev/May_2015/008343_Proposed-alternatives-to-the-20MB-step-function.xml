    <summary>The email thread is discussing the ongoing debate about whether or not to increase the size of the blocks in Bitcoin's blockchain. Gavin Andresen proposes implementing a big increase that grows over time, and then asking for help from merchants, exchanges, and other companies to run Bitcoin-Xt instead of Bitcoin Core. He suggests monitoring the client versions and using the soft-fork block version voting mechanism to get a majority and then a super-majority willing to produce bigger blocks. The purpose of this process is to prove to any doubters that they'd better start supporting bigger blocks or they'll be left behind, and to give them a chance to upgrade before that happens. The ultimate authority for determining consensus is what code the majority of merchants, exchanges, and miners are running.</summary>
