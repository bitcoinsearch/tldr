    <summary>The Virtual Notary project is an online witness to factoids which provides proof of Bitcoin funds, address ownership, tweet, real estate value, DNS ownership, existence, web page contents, and weather conditions. Factoids can be recorded on the blockchain or they can be part of a free attestation chain that the website maintains. The website provides a permanent URL to the factoids it generates and an X.509 certificate that can be downloaded. They are actively looking for people to develop the service further and welcome suggestions for new proof/factoid types as well as ideas for how to build a business case around the core idea. The website link is http://virtual-notary.org and the link to the writeup describing the various factoids and their use cases is http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/06/20/virtual-notary-intro/.</summary>
