    <summary>In this context, the author describes an attempt to fix a similar proposal by Mark Friedenbach but later realized that it did not need fixing. The RCLTV proposed by Mark is completely reorg safe and hence does not require the 100 block restriction. This proposal also ensures that the script validation remains independent from the utxo. The operator takes a relative_height parameter and checks if the nSequence of the input is lower than that parameter. Furthermore, a new check at the transaction level is added which ensures that the sequence numbers of all inputs are less than the current block height plus their respective relative heights. Overall, Mark's RCLTV proposal provides a secure and efficient solution to the problem at hand.</summary>
