    <summary>In an email thread, s7r asks about the purpose of Replace-By-Fee (RBF). Todd clarifies that standard RBF lets you change anything, and Full Sequence Replace-By-Fee (FSS RBF) lets you modify inputs and add outputs and/or make the value of outputs higher. A major miner has asked Todd to backport FSS RBF for v0.10.x. However, any significant change to mempool policy like RBF is unlikely to be incorporated in the Bitcoin Core v0.10.x branch as it would be too large a change for a minor release.</summary>
