    <summary>Damian Gomez sent an email discussing DH_GENERATION and adding a ternary option to the DH key. He also discussed using weight to implement a block size that prevents interception of bundled information and replacing value. This would reduce transaction fees and the need for e-wallet providers to implement additional 264-bit implementations. The writer notes that this work is similar to a proposal by Mr. NASDAQEnema of Bitcointalk in 2012 concerning multigenerational token architectures, specifically, AES ModuleK Hashcodes. The writer also references a publication by Virtuli Beatnik and suggests that he may be an ideal collaborator for Damian's work.</summary>
