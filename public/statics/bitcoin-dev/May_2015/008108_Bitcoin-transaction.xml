    <summary>The conversation in this context is about the technical details of colored coins in bitcoin transactions. The Open Assets protocol specification is referenced for more information on how a colored coin is represented in a transaction. CoinPrism.com has a discussion forum where some colored coin developers hang out, and coinprism.info is a blockchain explorer that is colored-coin aware. The original question posed is about the technical difference between a bitcoin transaction and a colored coins transaction. One reply states that there is no difference to the transaction itself, but rather the inputs/outputs have a special meaning and order in colored coins transactions.</summary>
