    <summary>In this email exchange, Gavin Andresen discusses possible solutions to the debate regarding sigop counting and the implementation of a UTXO cost. There is also discussion about implementing a hard upper limit with a dynamic limit underneath it. Some individuals want a high upper limit for rapid growth while others want a lower limit to prevent centralization and allow for hobbyists to run full nodes. The proposal is to choose an upper limit that satisfies both groups, ideally one that is inexpensive enough for hobbyists to afford. It is suggested that the hard upper limit be adjusted during each block reward halving based on the dynamic limit. Additionally, a lower dynamic limit algorithm is proposed which is well received.</summary>
