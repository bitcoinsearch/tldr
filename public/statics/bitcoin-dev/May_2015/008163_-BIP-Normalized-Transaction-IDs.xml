    <summary>In an email conversation between Tier Nolan and Pieter Wuille, they discuss a solution to the multi-level refund problem. Pieter suggests two end-goal proposals, the first of which involves transactions and blocks referring to other transactions by full txid, but signature hashes being computed off normalized txids. The second proposal involves blocks committing to full transaction data, but transactions and signature hashes using normalized txids. The latter solution does not require fixing transactions whose inputs have been malleated, but would require a very invasive hard fork.</summary>
