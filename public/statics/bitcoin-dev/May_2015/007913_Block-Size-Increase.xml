    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik in May 2015, they discussed the possibility of a fork in Bitcoin's system. Hearn expressed concern that if there was no fork, it would damage people's confidence in Bitcoin. Garzik argued that removing a temporary hack put in place by Satoshi Nakamoto was not a trivial change because of its impact on the economics of a $3.2 billion system. Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist who works for BitPay, Inc.</summary>
