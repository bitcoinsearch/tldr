    <summary>In a conversation between Gavin Andresen and another individual, the possibility of bad miners attacking the network with artificial big blocks is discussed. Gavin Andresen ran some simulations to see if a big miner producing big blocks could cause a loss of profit to another miner producing smaller blocks but found that he couldn't find a network topology where this would be the case. However, if someone propagated a 20MB block, it would take at best 6 seconds for verification at current configuration, resulting in a one percent orphan rate increase. The orphan rate is about 0.5% over the past few months, but if the network floods 20MB blocks, it can be well above 2%. In addition to bandwidth issues, a 20MB block could contain an average of 50000 transactions, and hundreds of thousands of sigops. The cost of bandwidth is also mentioned with a bandwidth of 30Mbps in Beijing costing $1350 per month and cloud services being used for block propagation. Based on these factors, the individual suggests that the network should only accept 5MB blocks at most.</summary>
