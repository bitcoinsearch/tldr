    <summary>In an email thread from May 26, 2015, a person angrily tells Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, to "get the fuck out." The sender accuses Garzik of leading the anti-scaling movement and promoting replace-by-fee, which they believe is only suitable for big bank clients like those associated with ViaCoin, an altcoin Garzik was working on at the time. Garzik responds by reminding the sender that doxxing and this kind of attitude are inappropriate for the discussion list they were on.</summary>
