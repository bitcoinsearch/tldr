    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal to fix transaction malleability in Bitcoin Core. The proposed solution involves the creation of a normalized transaction ID, which will replace the current transaction ID that is susceptible to malleability. However, this change requires a hard fork, which means that it is not backward-compatible and could potentially cause significant disruptions to the network. To address concerns about the size of the UTXO database doubling due to this change, the proposal includes a legacy txid to normalized txid map in the database. Additionally, an SPV proof of the spending transaction could be included with legacy transactions to eliminate the need for a second index. The email also raises questions about which opcodes will be affected by the change, and how it will affect them. It is suggested that there may be two or three or four separate BIPs required to fully implement the proposal. While some concerns are raised about the proposal, if there are no obvious roadblocks and the change seems generally positive, the author proposes to implement it in Bitcoin Core. Finally, the email suggests that the proposal to move to a normalized txid could be bundled with a bigger change to OP_CHECKSIG, as discussed in Greg Maxwell's talk on the topic.</summary>
