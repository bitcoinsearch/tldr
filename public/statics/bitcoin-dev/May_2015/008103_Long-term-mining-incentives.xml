    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent member of the Bitcoin community, proposed four plausible future scenarios for mining incentives. The scenarios include fee-supported large blocks with small-fee transactions, proof-of-idle supported, fees purely as transaction-spam-prevention measure, and fee-supported small blocks with high-fee transactions moving coins to/from sidechains. He suggested that all of these scenarios should be considered rather than focusing on just one. Gavin's proposal was in response to Thomas Voegtlin's request for a roadmap for long-term mining incentives in addition to scalability plans. While Gavin's blog post discussed scalability, it did not address long-term mining incentives.</summary>
