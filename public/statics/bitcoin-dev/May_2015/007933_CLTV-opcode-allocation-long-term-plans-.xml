    <summary>In a discussion about the implementation of OP_CLTV, Peter Todd suggested that the opcode should work as either absolute mode or relative CLTV. Absolute mode would be selected by entering '1' after OP_CLTV, while all other entries would act as NOPs. The future implementation of relative CLTV could then be as a soft-fork which uses '2' instead of '1'. Rusty Russell disagreed with the order of the implementation, preferring that OP_NOP1 becomes an OP_EXTENSION_PREFIX and the following opcode defines which extended opcode it is. However, the complexity of this approach makes it difficult to implement.</summary>
