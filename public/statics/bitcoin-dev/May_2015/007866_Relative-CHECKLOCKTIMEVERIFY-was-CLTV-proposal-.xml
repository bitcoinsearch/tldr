    <summary>The discussion revolves around the verification of a spending block's height in comparison to the height of the UTXO and sequence number. An exception is proposed for final inputs, which would count as a relative locktime of 0xFFFFFFFF. The concern is raised that invalidating previously valid transactions may reduce confidence in the currency. A workaround is suggested by enabling the sequence number to be checked using OP_RELATIVELOCKTIMEVERIFY and introducing OP_SEQUENCE_AS_RELATIVE_HEIGHT as a flag to enable the use of the sequence number as a relative block height. This can be achieved using a simple pattern match in the IsSequenceAsRelativeHeight function. The code for the implementation is provided along with the proposal.</summary>
