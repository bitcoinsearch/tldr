    <summary>In an email exchange between Aaron Voisine and Pieter Wuille in May 2015, Voisine argues that increasing the block size is the safe and conservative option to defend the $3 billion value of the system. He suggests encouraging higher fees by implementing standard recommended propagation rules and hybrid priority/fee transaction selection for blocks. However, Wuille disagrees with Voisine's suggestion of a hard fork, as it would require everyone to agree and upgrade to new suggested software before a flag date, which could put the survival of the entire ecosystem at risk.</summary>
