    <summary>F2Pool claims to be mining the largest blocks on the Bitcoin network. They support an increase in block size, but they cannot handle 20 MB blocks right now as it would greatly increase their orphan rate and result in higher fees for miners. Other Chinese pools, such as AntPool and BW, are not as concerned about this issue and would continue their zero fee policy. F2Pool believes that a smooth increase in block size is necessary, starting with 2 MB, then increasing to 4 MB after one or two years, and so on. Matt Corallo, on the other hand, has several concerns regarding the commitment to a block size increase. He would like to see better technologies implemented, such as those that significantly decrease block propagation latency, and better scaling technology. He also wants to see better conclusions to the discussion about long-term incentives within the system. Ideally, he would love to see some real free pressure already on the network when they commit to hardforking in a year. Overall, there are still many issues that need to be addressed before a consensus can be reached on a block size increase.</summary>
