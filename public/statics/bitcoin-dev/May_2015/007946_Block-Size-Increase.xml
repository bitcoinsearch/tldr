    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Gavin Costin asked if anyone could explain in plain English the worst case scenarios if a proposal went ahead. He noted that some people in the conversation seemed uncomfortable or defensive about the proposal, but he had not seen any specifics on why it was not feasible. A link to a response was provided in the email.</summary>
