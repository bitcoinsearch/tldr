    <summary>Justus Ranvier, a member of the Bitcoin community, responded to a question regarding the ratings of Bitcoin wallets. He explained that they rated as many wallets as possible based on the amount of manpower available, and will be recruiting more volunteers to cover more wallets in future rounds of ratings. The question specifically asked about Bitcoin-Core and Breadwallet for iOS, which were missing from the ratings.</summary>
