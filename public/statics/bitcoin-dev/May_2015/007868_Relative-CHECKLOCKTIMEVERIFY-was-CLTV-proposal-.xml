    <summary>In an email conversation on May 6, 2015, Jorge Timón expressed his opinion about a switch that turns on and off the new mode. He believed that it would give less flexibility and should be avoided if possible. Instead, he suggested increasing the transaction version to achieve the desired outcome. The transactions from version 2 onward use height as the sequence field, making legacy transactions spendable. Timón clarified that this is a pure soft-fork.</summary>
