    <summary>The email exchange discusses the issue of dynamic scaling method for block size. The current cap of 20MB is not enough and a 40% increase is needed to achieve effective DOS protection. However, until a way to dynamically scale is found, the cap will remain an issue. The suggestion is made to set a policy of maximum 2 years as a protection against dynamic scaling abuse. The policy of Max(1MB, (average size over previous 144 blocks) * 2) calculated at each block seems reasonable. The main issue is finding the 'right' block size between the two poles of 'block size must increase' and 'block size must not increase'. Powerful miners may include superfluous transactions to increase their share of the network, so keeping space in their blocks relatively scarce may not be enough. Gavin Andresen proposes implementing a big increase that grows over time to Bitcoin-XT project and asks for help lobbying companies to run it. If there is still no consensus among developers, he will ask for help getting big miners to use the soft-fork block version voting mechanism to prove that bigger blocks are necessary. Ultimately, the code the majority of merchants, exchanges, and miners are running will determine consensus.</summary>
