    <summary>Peter Todd has released a replace-by-fee patch for Bitcoin Core v0.10.1, available on Github. This version does not have any new features and is simply a rebase of the previous version. Replace-by-fee changes the way that most Bitcoin nodes accept transactions in order to align with miner incentives: accepting the transaction with the highest fee. This change makes for a more efficient transaction fee marketplace as well as providing a path to making zeroconf transactions economically secure by relying on economic incentives. The installation process is simple; once the user has compiled the replace-by-fee-v0.10.1 branch, they can run their node normally. With -debug logging enabled, users will see messages indicating that their node is replacing transactions with higher-fee paying double-spends. Additionally, users can check whether or not they are connected to replace-by-fee nodes or Bitcoin XT nodes by examining the service bits advertised by their peers. Replace-by-fee nodes advertise service bit 26 from the experimental use range, while Bitcoin XT nodes advertise service bit 1 for their getutxos support.</summary>
