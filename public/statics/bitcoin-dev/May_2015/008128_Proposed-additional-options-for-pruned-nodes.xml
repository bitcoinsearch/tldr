    <summary>A user on the Bitcoin-development mailing list proposed a solution for block coverage with locality. They suggested using a sequence of start points generated by hashing a seed, which would count as a hit if it's less than the block height. The node would store the 50MB of data starting at the block at height S(n), and as the blockchain grows in size, new starts would be less than the block height, meaning some other runs would be deleted. The proposal has weaknesses including randomness with regards to block heights and tiny blocks having the same priority as larger blocks. However, it meets most of the requirements such as local blocks, compact communication, uniform coverage, and efficient block range computation. The communication about what blocks a node has should also be compact, and N can be dropped one run at a time when a node exceeds its cap. A special rule should ensure low height blocks are covered, and nodes should keep the first 50MB of blocks with some probability.</summary>
