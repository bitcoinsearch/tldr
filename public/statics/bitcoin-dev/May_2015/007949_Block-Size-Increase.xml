    <summary>The email exchange between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen discusses the issue of block size increase in Bitcoin. Hearn believes that while Andresen may not be deliberately dishonest, his phrasing has given rise to misinterpretation of the issue. Hearn argues that a consensus needs to be reached among developers before pitching the idea to the general public. He also points out that there has been very little public discussion on block sizes since 2013 and that more research and software development around supporting larger block sizes is needed. Finally, Hearn suggests that a specific list of things that need to be done before block size increase should be created by the technical community.</summary>
