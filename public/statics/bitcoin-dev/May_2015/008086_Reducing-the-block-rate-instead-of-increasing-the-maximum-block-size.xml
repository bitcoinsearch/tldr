    <summary>In a discussion about potential attacks on the Bitcoin network, Peter Todd asked how blacklisting would be implemented. The response given was that miners who engage in harmful behavior can simply be banned from mining. This has been done in the past with ghash.io when they used Finney attacks against BetCoin Dice. Andreas Antonopoulos has also stated that any attack by miners only lasts for 10 minutes before being stopped. Therefore, there is no need to worry excessively about these types of attacks on the network. The link provided is a video where Antonopoulos discusses this topic further.</summary>
