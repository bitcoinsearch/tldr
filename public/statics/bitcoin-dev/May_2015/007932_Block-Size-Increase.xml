    <summary>In various discussions, fee dynamics has been a recurring topic with a lot of speculation. Gavin Andresen has written a blog post on the current situation of fees to provide data that might help in understanding the issue better. In the blog post, graphs have been used to illustrate the point which couldn't be done in a mailing list post. The post explains that it is not necessary to have fully 100% one megabyte blocks to understand what will happen as transaction volume increases or the block size limit is raised.</summary>
