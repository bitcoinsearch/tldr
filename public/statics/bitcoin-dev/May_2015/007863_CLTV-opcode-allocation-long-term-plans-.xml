    <summary>In an email exchange on May 4, 2015, Peter Todd and Matt Corallo discussed the issue of OP_NOP scarcity on the mempool only CLTV pull-request. Todd suggested that adding a parameter to OP_CLTV would make it more flexible and is the most economic use of precious NOPs. He also mentioned that although it would require some extra time and effort to rewrite existing tests and example code, it would be good to make this change to the PR in time for the feature freeze. However, he acknowledged that if people had strong feelings about this, he would be willing to make OP_CLTV work differently. Overall, the proposed change was not seen as a big deal but could complicate the codebase compared to sticking with just doing a Script v2.0.</summary>
