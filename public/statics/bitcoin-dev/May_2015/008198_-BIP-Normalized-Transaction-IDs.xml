    <summary>In an email exchange from May 19, 2015, Christian Decker addresses the need to address BIP 34 in two proposals. He expresses a desire to avoid having one transaction hashed differently than others and suggests that the height could be included in the scriptSig for all transactions, with non-coinbase transactions using a height of zero. The normalized txid function could incorporate the height without any specific inclusion method. The previous txid for coinbases are required to be all zeros, so the normalized txid could add the height to the txids of all inputs. Decker assumes that the scriptSig in the coinbase is intended to be random and therefore backward compatible.</summary>
