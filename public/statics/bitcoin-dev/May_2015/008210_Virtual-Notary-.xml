    <summary>In May 2015, Emin GÃ¼n Sirer, an American computer science professor, introduced the Virtual Notary project as an online witness or attestor to online factoids. The project aimed to provide proof of Bitcoin funds, address ownership, and tweets without revealing public addresses or fund location on the blockchain. Meanwhile, a subsidiary of Dunvegan Space Systems was pursuing the same business idea. Interested parties were advised to email JGarzik at DSS.co for more information about the project. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, signed off the email with his credentials and BitPay, Inc. website link.</summary>
