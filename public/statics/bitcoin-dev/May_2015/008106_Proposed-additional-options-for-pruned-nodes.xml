    <summary>On May 12, 2015, Jeff Garzik wrote about the assumption that there will be a few archive nodes with the full blockchain and a majority of nodes that are pruned and only able to serve the tail of the chains. In response to this, Peter Todd suggested the idea of partial archival nodes that would store a subset of blocks so that the entire blockchain could be available even if no single node had the complete chain. The idea was proposed as part of a discussion on how to best handle the storage and retrieval of the Bitcoin blockchain.</summary>
