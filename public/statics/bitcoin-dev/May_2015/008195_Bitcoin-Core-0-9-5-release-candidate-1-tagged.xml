    <summary>The Bitcoin team has released the first candidate for version 0.9.5, tagged as `v0.9.5rc1`. This release is primarily intended to make BIP66 available on the 0.9 branch, which has been requested by several users, especially miners. The preliminary release notes can be found on Github at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.9/doc/release-notes.md.Unlike the releases of 0.10.x versions, it is unclear whether there will be enough gitian signatures for a binary release. Therefore, any help with building is welcome. The release process for 0.10 or master will not work as many steps have changed since then, according to the release-process.md file.</summary>
