    <summary>In an email exchange on July 5th, 2015, Mike Hearn asked for clarification on what would happen if the block size wasn't increased by winter. He later specified that he was referring to winter of the following year, as version 0.12 was not scheduled to be released until the end of that year according to Wladimir, a contributor to Bitcoin Core. In a related note, Mike Hearn expressed agreement with Peter Todd's suggestion to move away from doing forks only in releases. Instead, they could add code for a fork and enable it in versions 0.11.1 or 0.11.11 if Gavin Andresen, another contributor to Bitcoin Core, preferred more 11s.</summary>
