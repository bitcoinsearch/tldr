    <summary>In this context, Gavin Andresen is suggesting the implementation of a "soft-forking extension block" in Bitcoin Core wallet. He suggests coding it and asking various wallet developers how long it would take to update their software to support such a solution. Additionally, he recommends creating UI mockups to provide users with a better experience. Gavin questions why one should choose a complex engineering solution when there is a simpler, equally effective one. He also raises concerns about the potential danger of 20MB extension blocks and whether they are as problematic as 20MB main blocks.</summary>
