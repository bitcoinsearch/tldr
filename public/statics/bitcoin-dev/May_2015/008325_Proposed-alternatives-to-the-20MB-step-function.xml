    <summary>In May 2015, Gavin Andresen proposed a new idea for calculating the maximum block size in Bitcoin. His proposal was to set the max size at 2 times the average size of the last 144 blocks, with this calculation being done at every block. This idea was met with approval by others, including the statement that using an average instead of a median is a better choice, as the median can be ill-defined on discrete sets. Additionally, there was no need to be robust to outliers thanks to the use of the max size.</summary>
