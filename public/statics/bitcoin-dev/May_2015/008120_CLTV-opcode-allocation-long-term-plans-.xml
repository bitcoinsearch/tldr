    <summary>The process of softforking RCLTV as a negative CLTV is considered to be straightforward. In this regard, it is important to note that all nLockTime values are greater than or equal to any negative number which essentially renders CLTV as a no-op. This makes it clean to define negative numbers as relative later. Furthermore, the concept of using negative numbers is not entirely new and should be familiar to developers, especially those who have experience with Python where negative list indices often imply an offset.Overall, the proposed solution for softforking RCLTV involves redefining negative numbers as relative later, making the process easier for developers to understand. With the use of negative CLTV, the nLockTime values can be easily modified, allowing for more flexibility and control in the softforking process.</summary>
