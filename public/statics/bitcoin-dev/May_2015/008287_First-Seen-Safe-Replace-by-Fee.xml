    <summary>The email discusses two cases where increasing fees on bitcoin transactions can be done more efficiently using Full Sequence Replace-By-Fee (FSS-RBF) rather than Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). In the first case, increasing the fee on a single transaction involves adding a new input and increasing the change output value. The cost savings achieved with this method range from 11% to 34%+. In some cases, if an unspent output has a greater value than one of the outputs spent by the original transaction, it can be replaced in the vin txin set, resulting in a 34% savings compared to CPFP. In the second case, paying multiple recipients requires adding an input or swapping one input for another. Defragmenting outputs in this way results in overall savings of 25%, and FSS RBF can help reduce transaction size and increase cost savings. However, care must be taken to ensure that multiple rounds of this process always leave at least one input unchanged.</summary>
