    <summary>Danny Thorpe raised a question on Tuesday, 26 May 2015 at 11:22 am about the possibility of using RBF (Replace-By-Fee) for fraudulent payment reversals. He explained that someone could pay 1BTC to Alice for hard goods and then broadcast a double spend of that transaction to pay Alice nothing after receiving the goods, with only the higher network fee of the second transaction being the cost. The discussion on the "First-Seen-Safe" replace-by-fee was brought up as a solution to prevent fraudulent payment reversals. This feature disallows a replacing transaction that pays less to any output script than the replaced transaction paid.</summary>
