    <summary>In a discussion about block propagation latency, it was noted that there are proposals to decrease latency, but none have been implemented yet. The soft limit is an option for miners to produce smaller blocks, but it does not prevent other miners from producing larger ones. However, talking about the soft limit is irrelevant when discussing ways that miners can use 20MB blocks to harm competition. Security engineers must plan for the worst-case scenario, and soft limits are an extremely weak form of control. Therefore, for the purpose of discussing blocksize increase requirements, the soft limit can be disregarded.</summary>
