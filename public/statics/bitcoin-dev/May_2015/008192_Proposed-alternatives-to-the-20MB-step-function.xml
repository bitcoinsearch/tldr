    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin's unspent transaction output (UTXO) set, Rusty Russell raised concerns about perverse incentives for miners to include more UTXOs in blocks. Tier Nolan suggested excluding UTXOs from blocks before a certain count to fix the incentive problem. The size of UTXOs was also discussed, with suggestions to store them as a fixed digest and add a CHECKSIG cost to transactions. However, it was noted that the proposed cost limit was too high for a 10% block change and should be included in a hard byte limit block size fork instead. Despite this, having one combined "cost" for transactions was considered ideal as it would mean fewer transaction checks.</summary>
