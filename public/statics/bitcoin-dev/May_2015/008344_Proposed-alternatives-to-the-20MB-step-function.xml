    <summary>In May 2015, Gavin Andresen responded to a question about measuring exchange and merchant acceptance of bigger blocks in the Bitcoin network. He mentioned that public statements claiming readiness for bigger blocks could be a measure. Additionally, he suggested looking at the version or user-agent strings of publicly reachable nodes on the network as another way to gauge acceptance. He provided a link to a website displaying the count of reachable nodes with these version strings.</summary>
