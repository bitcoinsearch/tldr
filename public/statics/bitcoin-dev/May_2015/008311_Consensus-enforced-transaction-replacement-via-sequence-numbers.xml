    <summary>The email thread discusses modifying a proposal regarding the usage of nSequence field. The proposal suggests using the most significant bit signal as a relative lock-time, leaving 31 bits for other experimentation when relative lock-time is not in use. The code has been adjusted accordingly and can be found on Github. Mike Hearn raises concerns about the original semantics of Satoshi's construction, which allowed for millions of revisions of transactions and was intended for high-frequency trading (HFT). However, with a careful construction of channels, sequence numbers only need to be bumped when the channel reverses direction. If an app only needs to do that rarely, the proposed approach is fine. The email thread ends with a suggestion to leave a path open to the original proposal as it seems to be a superset of all other proposals features-wise.</summary>
