    <summary>Jeff Garzik and Alan both discussed the issue of block intervals in Bitcoin on 5/7/2015. According to Jeff, blocks are bursty with different intervals ranging from one minute to sixty minutes, which remains the same with larger blocks. Alan pointed out that long inter-block intervals cause blocks to fill up, and he wants to go where Gavin's concrete proposal suggests. In response to Jeff's query about scaling up Bitcoin to handle the world's coffees, Alan stated that his current focus is on Gavin's proposal.</summary>
