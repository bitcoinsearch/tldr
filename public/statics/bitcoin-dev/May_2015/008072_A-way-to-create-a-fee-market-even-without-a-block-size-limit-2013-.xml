    <summary>In an email conversation dated May 10, 2015, Sergio Lerner raised a question about whether the system can be gamed. It was mentioned that users have the ability to pay fees or a portion of fees out of band to miner(s), which is undetectable to the network. This behavior has been observed since at least 2011 in two forms: treating transactions that paid miners directly via outputs as having that much more in fees and taking contracts for fast processing for identified transactions.It was also noted that two companies had made such arrangements with miners. The suggestion made by Lerner was seen as further rewarding this behavior and allowing bypassing of controls. It was suspected that any scheme that looks at fee values may have similar properties.</summary>
