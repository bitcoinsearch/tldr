    <summary>Kalle Rosenbaum has proposed two Proof of Payment (PoP) proposals to the Bitcoin community. The proposals are related to PoP data structure and process, and btcpop URI scheme. Rosenbaum seeks community agreement to standardize these proposals. No major objection against the idea was raised in the previous thread. Implementation of the proposals is available on GitHub. Rosenbaum plans to extend BIP70 to support PoP after achieving consensus on the proposals. Rosenbaum has received feedback from the community and included most of it in the updated version of the specification. The changes include ensuring minimal impact if a PoP appears in the Bitcoin p2p network, checking if the transaction is actually a tx that you want proof for later in the validation process, including a version field of 2 bytes, and removing the "PoP" literal. The PoP can be useful in various applications such as paysite login, concert tickets, left-luggage lockers, lotteries, video rental, etc.</summary>
