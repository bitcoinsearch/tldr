    <summary>In a conversation between Bitcoin core developer, Jeff Garzik and Matt Corallo, they discussed the issue of Gavin Andresen pitching the idea of increasing the block size limit to the general public while ignoring the opinions of those who study the issue at hand. Corallo suggested that if there had been more consensus-building happening on the list, then there could have been a specific list of things to do before a block size increase. However, Garzik believes that it's important to focus on where to go from here rather than how they got to this point. They both agree that making a change to a leaderless automaton powered by open source software is breaking new ground.</summary>
