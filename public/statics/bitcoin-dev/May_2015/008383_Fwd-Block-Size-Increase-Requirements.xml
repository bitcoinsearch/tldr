    <summary>The orphan rate increase in Bitcoin mining will go to those who produce 20MB blocks, not the individual miners. However, this can vary depending on how miners are connected. For example, if there are three miners, A and B with fast connectivity and C with a slow network, a block mined by A will be received by B in 1 second but by C in 6 seconds. As a result, any blocks mined by C during these ~5 seconds will be orphaned because B receives A's block first.</summary>
