    <summary>METAmarket is a decentralized, trustless federated marketplace that operates on blockchain technology and allows buyers and sellers to transact without intermediaries. The platform features a reputation system that incentivizes good behavior from users and discourages bad actors. Transactions are transparent, secure, and immutable, and the platform does not charge fees or commissions. METAmarket aims to be a universal marketplace that can facilitate transactions across all industries, including peer-to-peer, business-to-business, and business-to-consumer. It is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to facilitate transactions. The platform also supports the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.The email conversation between Melvin Carvalho and Marc D. Wood on May 1, 2015, reveals the concept of software for creating markets with variable levels of privacy and censorship resistance. This project is similar to the work Satoshi was doing in the Bitcoin Core before he left but is not related to his original plan for a bitcoin marketplace. METAmarket is an open-source protocol and reference client for a trustless federated marketplace that uses Bitcoin as a universal currency and Bitmessage as a P2P communication network. The system aims to eliminate the need for trusted third parties and middlemen and mitigate systemic vulnerabilities such as transaction malleability through a federated reputation model. The ideal system would involve secure private transactions directly between buyers and sellers without middlemen collecting data or adding fees.</summary>
