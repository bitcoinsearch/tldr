    <summary>The recursive version of a new signature opcode suggests that the normalized txid system should be used from the beginning, and all txids in the entire blockchain should be replaced with the "correct" values. This requires a full re-index of the blockchain since one cannot work out what the TXID-N of a transaction is without knowing the TXID-N of its parents. The non-recursive version can only handle refunds one level deep. If A is mutated before being added into the chain, then B can be modified to a valid transaction (B-new). However, C-new cannot be created as TXID-N(B-new) is not the same as TXID-N(B). The recursive version repairs this problem by replacing all txids with their TXID-N versions and replacing the from field with the TXID-N from A-mutated which is equal to TXID-N(A). The signature is still valid, making multi-level refunds possible.</summary>
