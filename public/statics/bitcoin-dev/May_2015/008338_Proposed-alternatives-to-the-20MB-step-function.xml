    <summary>In a message thread from May 29, 2015, Mike Hearn suggested that there may not need to be a size limit for blocks in Bitcoin. He noted that the current 32mb message cap imposes one anyway, but if the plan is to fix this once and for all, then it should be changed to at least some multiple of the max block size allowed. Alternatively, he suggested that the merkle block message already incorporates the required functionality. This system would allow for sending headers messages with one header and merkleblock messages with a maximum of 1MB per message. The transactions for each merkleblock could be sent directly before each merkleblock, as is currently the case. This change would require a modification to the processing of any merkleblocks received.</summary>
