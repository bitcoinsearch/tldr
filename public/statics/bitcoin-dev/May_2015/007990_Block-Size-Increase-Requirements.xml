    <summary>There are various proposals to significantly decrease block propagation latency, but none of them are currently implemented. Although miners have the option of a soft limit with a 20mb cap, they may still need to throttle their block sizes artificially due to propagation delays. However, the priority should be to demolish the hard cap bottleneck and move on to tackle other scalability issues one by one. One company, StrawPay, is already working on developing better scaling technology with code available on Github. Another area of discussion is long-term incentives within the system and the potential use of hashing assurance contracts (HACs) to fund network security. While it is unclear whether HACs will work, it is also uncertain if plain old fee pressure will be effective in the long run as demand may eventually outstrip supply.</summary>
