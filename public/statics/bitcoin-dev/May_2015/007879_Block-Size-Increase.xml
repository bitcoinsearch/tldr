    <summary>In a 2015 email thread, Bitcoin core developer Matt Corallo raised concerns over the potential security risks of increasing the maximum block size of the blockchain. While there had been significant discussion on the topic in #bitcoin-wizards on irc.freenode.net, the objections raised were not being referenced in the recent media coverage on the issue. Corallo emphasized that the most important property of bitcoin is its secured decentralization, which must be maintained even as the currency grows. He argued that technical work on the system should be informed by the nature of the system itself, and that safety is critical when proposing changes that could compromise blockchain security. Rather than focusing on the number of transactions the system should perform, Corallo suggested that technical solutions for aggregating transactions into tiny bundles should be explored. He also encouraged the MIT group to measure decentralization and its security, and called for high standards in open-source projects.</summary>
