    <summary>Andreas Schildbach, a software developer, discussed the issue of instant confirmations in Bitcoin transactions via email on May 25, 2015. The problem is caused by connecting to only one node, which limits the ability to receive instant confirmations according to the Bitcoin protocol. Andreas explained that nodes can only send confirmations if they did not receive the transaction information from the sender. Warren, who was also part of the email conversation, questioned whether this process should be called a "confirmation" since it only indicates that one peer has relayed the transaction back to the sender.</summary>
