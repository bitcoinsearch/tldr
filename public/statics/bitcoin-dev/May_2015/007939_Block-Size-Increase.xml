    <summary>In response to the debate on whether or not Bitcoin can support 1MB blocks every 10 minutes for the next eleven years, a statement has been made that any other answer aside from this is dishonest. However, another individual disagrees and argues that Gavin is not clueless nor dishonest. Gavin has been working on finding a middle ground solution that everyone can agree on, by considering objections and asking for suggestions. The individual challenges anyone with a specific and credible alternative solution to present it.</summary>
