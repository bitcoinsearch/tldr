    <summary>Jeff Garzik responded to Adam Weiss's email concerning additional options for pruned nodes in Bitcoin development. Garzik suggested forwarding his response to the list as an FYI. In a different part of the email thread, Weiss informed Garzik that his email to Bitcoin-dev was still generating Google spam warnings. Garzik replied by stating that San Francisco (SF), not Bitpay, was rewriting email headers and breaking authentication, which has been reported by 12 people.The email thread includes an HTML attachment that was scrubbed of its URL.</summary>
