    <summary>The author of the context suggests leaving 16 bits of the version fixed as an extra-nonce to prevent miners from using them as a nonce and interfering with the soft-fork voting system. The author provides a link to their original proposal in a GitHub pull request. It is unclear what exactly the proposal entails, but it may provide more details on how the extra-nonce would work. Overall, the author seems to be concerned about maintaining the integrity of the soft-fork voting system while implementing this idea.</summary>
