    <summary>The hard block size limit is set to prevent miners from performing any kind of malicious attacks on the network. The incentives for miners to pick block sizes are not compatible with what allows the network to continue running in a decentralized manner. However, miners can always reduce the block size if they coordinate. Increasing the maximum block size doesn't necessarily cause an increase and a majority of miners can soft-fork to set the limit lower than the hard limit. If the hard-fork limit is set higher, then a soft fork can be used to adjust the limit in the future. The reference client would accept blocks above the soft limit for wallet purposes but not build on them. Nonetheless, blocks above the hard limit would be rejected completely.</summary>
