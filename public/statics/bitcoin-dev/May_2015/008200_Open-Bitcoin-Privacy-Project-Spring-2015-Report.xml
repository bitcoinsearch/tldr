    <summary>The email is from Jonas Schnelli, a representative of include7 AG in Switzerland. The email provides contact information for the company and includes a warning not to send sensitive data in unencrypted emails. Instead, a link to a secure form is provided. The email also includes a message from Justus Ranvier regarding the rating of Bitcoin wallets. Ranvier explains that the wallets were rated based on available manpower and that a recruiting drive will be held to cover more wallets in the future. The email ends with a question from an unknown sender asking why Bitcoin-Core and Breadwallet (iOS) are missing from the ratings.</summary>
