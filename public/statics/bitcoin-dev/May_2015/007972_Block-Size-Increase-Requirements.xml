    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin Development mailing list, Matt Corallo has expressed concern over committing to a block size increase. He states that there are several things that worry him significantly about committing to a block size increase and he'd like to see them resolved before he'd consider supporting such a commitment. One of these concerns centers around block propagation latency, which he says needs to be significantly reduced by testing the software with simulated loads before considering increasing the block size. Another concern is how to ensure miners don't cheat and stop validating blocks fully before building on them as this could lead to dangerous forks. Finally, he would like to see better conclusions to the discussion around long-term incentives within the system.</summary>
