    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, responded to a suggestion of a good paper on "The Economics of Bitcoin Transaction Fees" by stating that the paper may present valid game theory, but it has well-known limitations when it comes to predicting real-world behavior. Todd suggests waiting for a praxeological review before drawing any conclusions from the paper. No details were given about the contents of the paper or who wrote it. The post includes a PGP signature and an attached file named 0xEAD9E623.asc, which is an application/pgp-keys file with a size of 18381 bytes.</summary>
