    <summary>There are different proposals regarding the fixed 20mb cap, but proponents and critics have their own arguments. The proposal was originally suggested by Gavin, not the speaker who supports it as better than nothing. Gavin's initial idea was to make the block size a function of time, but this was dropped to simplify the consensus process. The current proposal is the simplest solution that can work. The speaker hopes for a less traumatic chain forking process and recalls a previous discussion with Gavin and Jeff about scheduling a fork every year to provide predictability. However, if things go well, there is no reason why the 20mb limit would be permanent.</summary>
