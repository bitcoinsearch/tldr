    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Alex Mizrahi questioned the decision to increase the block size limit from 2 MB to 20 MB. He suggested that a gradual increase of 1 MB per year may be a safer option, allowing for evidence to be gathered on whether the network can handle larger blocks. Mizrahi proposed that this solution would satisfy both those concerned about block size growth and those advocating for bigger blocks, with a soft fork as an option to stop growth before it becomes too much. He claimed not to have heard any valid arguments against linear growth.</summary>
