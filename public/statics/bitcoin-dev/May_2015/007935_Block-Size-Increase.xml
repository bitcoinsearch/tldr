    <summary>Gavin Andresen requested people to email him objections they might have missed regarding the debate on bigger blocks. He emphasized the need for a concrete course of action that can be agreed upon by consensus in order to inform entrepreneurs about the transaction volume the main Bitcoin blockchain will be able to support over the next eleven years. However, someone responded with concern that Andresen has been telling people that the blocksize will increase soon despite the lack of consensus on this matter. The responder suggested that the only honest answer is that the blockchain will likely support at least 1MB blocks every 10 minutes on average for the next eleven years and that a block size increase of some sort may happen within that time frame.</summary>
