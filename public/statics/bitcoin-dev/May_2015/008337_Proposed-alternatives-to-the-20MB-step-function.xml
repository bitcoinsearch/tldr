    <summary>The discussion revolves around the issue of block size limit. The writer expects an average block size above 500K by the time a hard fork can happen. The idea of supporting a rule "larger of 1MB or 2x average size" is only marginally better than the current situation, which still may lead to hitting the limit. The writer suggests against artificially throttling organic growth of the network and advocates for discouraging blocks over some particular size if miners want to. The writer proposes a 20mb limit as a reasonable compromise that should free up enough space for user growth while still being below VISA capacity.</summary>
