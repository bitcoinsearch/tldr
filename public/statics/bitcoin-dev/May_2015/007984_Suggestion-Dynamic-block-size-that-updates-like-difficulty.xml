    <summary>A recent subscriber to a mailing list posed a question regarding the possibility of having a dynamic block size limit that changes with difficulty. They proposed that the block size should not exceed two times the mean size of the prior difficulty period. The author acknowledged that this topic may have already been discussed on the list. However, no further context or information was provided regarding the mailing list or the specific topic being addressed.</summary>
