    <summary>Kevin Greene, a security expert, advises against choosing a set of predictable and homogenous peers when designing a system to prevent Sybil attacks. He suggests that an ideal set of peers should be diverse and unpredictable to make it difficult for attackers to carry out such attacks. However, Kevin also recommends having a few local nodes to improve propagation while maintaining diversity in the peer set.</summary>
