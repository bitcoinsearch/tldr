    <summary>In May 2015, Bitcoin core developer Pieter Wuille expressed his belief that developers should not impose economic policy on the network and that hard forks should not be controversial. He argued that forcing a controversial change is an abuse of power that sets a dangerous precedent for future changes. While he personally believed the block size should increase, he thought it should only be done after sufficient technological growth had been shown to support it without increased risk. The email thread discussed the proposal for a larger maximum block size but raised concerns over the delay caused by the lower security of extended blocks.In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, Andresen expressed his opinion that developers should avoid imposing economic policy and leave such matters to the decentralized free market. Regarding the maximum block size, Hearn suggested setting it to be 20 times the average size, but Andresen found this number too large and proposed using two as a neutral number instead. Raystonn expressed concern over the lower security proposed by Tier for extended blocks, which could delay the implementation of larger blocks. However, Tier argued that the potential centralization risk lies in the lower security.Another email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille revealed that Andresen believed that block size should increase but only after sufficient technological growth has been demonstrated to mitigate any risks. Wuille believed hard forks should not be controversial and that the block size is a compromise made by the network between utility and centralization pressure, and should be treated as such.Overall, the discussions center around the proposal for larger maximum block size and the concerns over its implementation. There are debates about the role of developers in imposing economic policy, the potential risks involved, and the technical aspects of increasing the block size. Various solutions were proposed, including dynamic increases, secret ballots, and soft forks using extended blocks with lower security.Moving on to Ethereum, a new proposal from the Ethereum developer, Alexey Akhunov, suggests a change in the way Ethereum wallet balances are displayed. Akhunov's proposal, called "EIP 2930," would create a new type of transaction that would allow users to split their ETH holdings into two separate accounts: one for everyday use and another for more secure storage. This move is aimed at improving the security of user funds by allowing users to keep a portion of their funds in a "cold" or offline wallet, while still being able to transact with the rest of their funds.However, this proposal does make things more complex as wallets would have to list two balances. The proposal has received mixed reactions from the Ethereum community with some expressing concerns about added complexity and potential confusion for users. Nonetheless, it has been approved by the Ethereum developers and will be implemented in the upcoming Istanbul hard fork.The Istanbul hard fork is expected to take place in October 2019 and will bring several other changes to the Ethereum network, including improvements to the scalability and interoperability of the platform. Overall, Ethereum is working towards becoming a more secure and scalable blockchain platform that can support a wide range of decentralized applications and smart contracts.</summary>
