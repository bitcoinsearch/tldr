    <summary>In May 2015, Gavin Andresen considered contributing a version of the bigger blocksize-limit hard-fork patch to the Bitcoin-Xt fork. He aimed to target hobbyists with fast internet connections and assume Nelson's law to increase over time. He planned to encourage merchants, exchanges, web wallets, and individuals who thought it struck a reasonable balance to run it. Assuming it became a super-majority of nodes on the network, he would encourage miners to roll out a soft-fork to start producing bigger blocks and eventually trigger the hard fork. When asked about "a soft-fork to start producing bigger blocks," Peter Todd requested clarification from Andresen.</summary>
