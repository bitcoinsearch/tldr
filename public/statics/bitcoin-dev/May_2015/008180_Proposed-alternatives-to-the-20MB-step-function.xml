    <summary>In a discussion between Gregory Maxwell and Tier Nolan, they proposed implementing changes in transaction size as a soft fork. The proposal included renaming tx_size to "tx_cost" and real_size to "tx_bytes". They also suggested removing the MAX() function if a hard byte limit is set for transactions. For measuring UTXO size, they proposed adding 32 to scriptlen and incorporating a CHECKSIG cost of 50 bytes per CHECKSIG. The initial cost limit would be around 2MB. Finally, an example was given where a 250-byte transaction with two inputs and outputs would have an adjusted size of 252 bytes, resulting in a cost of 352.</summary>
