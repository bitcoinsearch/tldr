    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal to set deadlines for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) as block counts, eliminating the need for the median time mechanism. The proposal suggests matching the deadline to a "start-line" and creating a simple table of known BIPs while keeping multiple users of the bit separate. An alternative suggestion is setting the start time equal to the deadline or implication time of the previous user of the bit. There is also a discussion on changing the 95% rule. Currently, 750 out of the last 1000 blocks must support a BIP for activation, followed by at least 1000 blocks for implication. In addition to the proposed changes, Luke Dashjr suggests adding a section describing how it interacts with and changes GetBlockTemplate (GBT). He proposes that GBT clients indicate a list of softforks by identifier keyword, and the GBT server responds with a template indicating an object of softfork keywords to bit values that the server will accept. The email thread ends with links to the Bitcoin-development mailing list for further discussion.</summary>
