    <summary>Mike Hearn, a Bitcoin developer, discussed the issue of centralized authority over the development process in the Bitcoin core project with fellow developers. While some argue that the five committers should have equal say in decision-making, others point out that Wladimir is formally the maintainer and therefore has more authority. However, it is acknowledged that forcing people to run Bitcoin Core is not feasible and unsuccessful patches indicate a lack of user acceptance. The decentralized nature of the development process can result in messy consequences, but forking the project and attempting to gain user acceptance for the fork is always an option.</summary>
