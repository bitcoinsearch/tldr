    <summary>In a discussion about the block size limit, Ron proposed measuring the average transaction size to estimate the average block size. He suggested that by fixing an average block period of 10 minutes, one could estimate the average block size by determining the desired average transaction rate (tps). For instance, for tps of around 10 transactions per second and an average transaction size of 612 Bytes, the block size would be 3,672,000 Bytes. Alternatively, given an average transaction size of 612 Bytes and a maximum block size of 1,000,000 Bytes, the current maximum tps would be approximately 2.72.The average block size for the ten blocks up to block number 357999 was approximately 576 Bytes, which means that the current possible tps is around 2.89, and the maximum block size for a tps of 10 would be 3,456,000 Bytes. Therefore, Ron suggested stating one's assumed tps and a measured or presumed average transaction size before proposing a maximum block size. For example, assuming a maximum block size of 20,000,000 Bytes and a current average transaction size of 600 Bytes, the tps would be around 55.5.</summary>
