    <summary>The attached PDF document is a simplified costing analysis that provides information on the cost of scaling a network. The analysis breaks down the cost into different components, such as hardware, software, and operational costs. It offers a framework for understanding the costs involved in scaling any type of network. The document is concise and has clear headings for each section. The first section of the analysis provides an overview of the different components of scaling a network. The second section breaks down the cost of hardware, including servers, storage, and networking equipment. The third section covers the cost of software, including licenses and support fees. The fourth section discusses operational costs, including staffing and training. It is important to note that the specific costs outlined in the analysis may vary depending on the particular network being scaled. Nonetheless, the document is a helpful starting point for discussions around network scaling. Overall, the analysis provides a useful framework for thinking about the costs involved in scaling any type of network.</summary>
