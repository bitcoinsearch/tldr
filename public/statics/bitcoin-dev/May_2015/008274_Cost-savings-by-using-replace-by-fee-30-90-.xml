    <summary>On May 26, 2015, Peter Todd wrote about the benefits of Replace-by-Fee (RBF) over Child Pays for Parent (CPFP). RBF is less expensive than CPFP, particularly when defragmenting outputs. It can increase the BTC paid into a transaction and pay more to an existing change address with a higher fee or add an additional change address and leave a larger fee. With RBF on the other hand, you can simply double-spend t1 with a transaction paying both Alice and Bob, resulting in a 36uBTC additional fee. The above situation gets even worse with multisig.</summary>
