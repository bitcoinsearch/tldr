    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent Bitcoin developer, posted a blog discussing the ongoing debate regarding the block size limit. Andresen argues that the current limit of one megabyte is not causing issues and that the network can handle larger blocks. In his blog post, he provides data on fees, stating that the majority of transactions include a fee and that fees are increasing over time. While some users have sent transactions with extremely low or no fees, there is little evidence that this is impacting meaningful usage from the user's point of view. It is unclear how users are coping with the current limit, but it is possible that they are sending time-sensitive transactions with higher fees or moving low-value transactions off the blockchain. Payment processors and wallets, such as Coinbase, may be planning to work together to aggregate fund transfers between providers.</summary>
