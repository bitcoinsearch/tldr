    <summary>The discussion is about calculating bandwidth for a highly connected miner who could have 30-100 node connections, which means the traffic estimates need to be increased by that factor. For 100MB blocks, 30-100 Mbps and $60-$100 per day data costs are required. The Aliyun and Linode cloud services are used for block propagation, and as of May 2015, the price is 0.13 U.S. dollars per GB for 100Mbps connectivity at Aliyun. That speed can handle 20MB blocks with no problem. Each 20MB block is estimated to be 100MB of data up/down the wire, but after optimization, it should be 40MB. Based on this estimation, the cost will be less than $2 per day in bandwidth. A single cross-border TCP connection would be slower than 12.5 MB/s, but 1.3Mbps or less would be sufficient.</summary>
