    <summary>There is not enough context provided to generate a detailed summary. The given statement "CPFP also solves it just fine" is incomplete and does not provide any information on what CPFP refers to or what problem it solves. Additionally, the next part of the text seems to contain an email attachment that is missing. Please provide more context and information for me to create a meaningful summary.</summary>
