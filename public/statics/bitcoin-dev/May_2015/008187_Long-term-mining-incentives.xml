    <summary>In an email conversation, Aaron Voisine and Peter Todd discussed the impact of increasing fees on Bitcoin's adoption. Voisine expressed concerns about people looking for alternatives to Bitcoin if fees continue to rise. However, Todd disagreed, stating that there are alternatives that still use Bitcoin as a unit of value, such as sidechains and off-chain solutions. Moreover, he pointed out that raising block size may not be the only solution to avoid transaction failures, and that high costs of using the system do not necessarily lower its adoption as a store-of-value, citing gold as an example. Todd also questioned whether continuing to pretend that the problem can go away is doing users a disservice.</summary>
