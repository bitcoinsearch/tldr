    <summary>Dave Collins and Josh Rickmar have discovered a consensus change in Bitcoin Core that causes forking behavior on regtest. Regtest difficulty retargetting is broken, but this issue doesn't affect mainnet or testnet. The details of the discovery are explained in a post made by Dave Collins on the bitcointalk forums, which can be found at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1065504.</summary>
