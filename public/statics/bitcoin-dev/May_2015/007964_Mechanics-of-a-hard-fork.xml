    <summary>The context discusses the plausibility of a serious split in the network if only 75% of merchants and users updated their systems while 99.99% of miners updated. The scenario would only be possible if consensus rules required a 99% supermajority of miners for the hard fork to proceed. In such a case, there would be no logical reason for merchants and users to refuse to upgrade. They would have to choose between the active chain and the one that is effectively stalled. However, they can make that choice ahead of time.</summary>
