    <summary>In a discussion about the necessity of consensus in the technical community for block size increases, Mike Hearn expressed his disagreement, stating that he no longer believes the community can reach consensus on anything protocol related. He questions who exactly would be included in this consensus and what happens if no agreement is reached. However, Peter Todd disagrees with Hearn's statement, citing examples of successful protocol and non-consensus policy changes that have been made in short timeframes and with little drama. Todd also mentions the upcoming v0.11 release, which will include pruning, a significant change to the way Bitcoin Core works, and notes the collaborative effort and little drama involved in its implementation. While some changes are difficult to get consensus on due to their high risks and potential security vulnerabilities, Todd believes that the peer review and consensus building process ultimately works well.</summary>
