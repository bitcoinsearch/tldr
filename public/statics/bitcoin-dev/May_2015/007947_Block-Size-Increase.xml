    <summary>Linear growth is an alternative to exponential growth that approximates diminishing returns, as technological advances become slower with time. This approach allows people more time to adapt to new realities. For example, data block sizes could increase linearly from 2 MB in 2016 to 20 MB in 20 years. However, if miners find the 20 MB blocks too overwhelming, they can limit it through soft work based on actual data.</summary>
