    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin mailing list, Bob McElrath questioned whether it was worth adding the complexity of merge avoidance to the Bitcoin protocol. Jeff Garzik replied that he had explored this topic before and suggested two strategies for improving privacy without requiring merge avoidance. The first involves aggregating to highly common denominations of bitcoins, which permits merge avoidance and easy coinjoin while avoiding the over-aggregation problem where you have consolidated down to one output. The second strategy is simply doubling outputs. By adding another output to yourself and a final change output, it becomes difficult to determine which output goes to whom. There are many iterations and trade-offs between fragmentation and privacy.</summary>
