    <summary>Sergio Lerner has outlined the arguments against reducing the block interval. Firstly, it will encourage centralization since participants of mining pools will lose more money due to excessive initial block template latency, leading to higher stale shares. Secondly, it will increase the probability of a blockchain split. Thirdly, it can reduce the speed and efficiency of block verification and transmission. Fourthly, there has been insufficient testing and/or research into technical/economic implications of reducing the block rate. Lastly, Sergio explains that networking optimizations using headers-first or IBLTs can be added later.</summary>
