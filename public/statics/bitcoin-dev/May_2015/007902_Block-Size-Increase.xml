    <summary>Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin developer, stated that Bitcoin's restricted transaction rate capability has led to non-Bitcoin projects benefitting from this gap and filling it. He believes that if Bitcoin fills the gap, those other projects will lose while Bitcoin wins. Garzik questions whether decisions about Bitcoin development should take into account competing projects. This change is significant as it affects a $3.2B system and could lead to moral hazard. The discussion was signed off with a PGP signature.</summary>
