    <summary>At DevCore London, Gavin proposed a new idea to get rid of sending full blocks and instead distribute newly minted blocks as block headers plus all transaction hashes included in the block. The assumption is that nodes already have most of these transactions in their mempool. This would be more efficient and fast, resulting in small blocks and getting rid of the blocksize limit for a long time. However, Arne admits to being ignorant of bitcoin core's internals to judge the changes required for this to happen. Arne is curious to hear from others with a better understanding of bitcoin core's internals.</summary>
