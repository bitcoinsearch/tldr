    <summary>In a discussion about modifying the nSequence field in Bitcoin transactions, Tier Nolan suggested updating it to only apply to transactions with version number 3 and higher, which have a sequence number of 0xFFFFFFFF and where the sequence number field is repurposed for relative lock time. Mark Friedenbach agreed to modify the proposal accordingly, leaving a full 31 bits for experimentation when relative lock-time is not in use. Mike Hearn noted that the original protocol allowed for millions of revisions of a transaction, hence for high frequency trading, and suggested leaving a path open to the original design, as it seems to be a superset of all other proposals, features-wise.</summary>
