    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and gb, the topic of calculating bandwidth for highly connected miners was discussed. Gb suggested that the traffic estimates needed to be increased by a factor of 30-100 due to the number of node connections a miner could have. However, Andresen pointed out that randomly connected gossip networks, such as the Bitcoin p2p network, operate differently and that bandwidth is roughly O(N), where N is the number of bytes relayed to everybody. Andresen also mentioned that the overhead of 'inv' messages could increase the bandwidth slightly, but this would not be a problem for years.</summary>
