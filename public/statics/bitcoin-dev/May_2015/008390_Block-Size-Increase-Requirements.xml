    <summary>The discussion revolves around the impact of bigger blocks on mining and validation centralization. The argument is that even with current subsidies, bigger blocks would lead to more mining centralization, thus sacrificing decentralization. It is questioned how far we are willing to go with this "scaling by sacrificing decentralization" approach. The conversation then shifts to a hypothetical scenario where subsidies are gone and all block rewards come from fees. Gavin Andresen shares his thoughts on long-term hypotheticals and why wasting time worrying about them is a mistake.
