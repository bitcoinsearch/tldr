    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn, Wladimir and Gavin, Hearn expressed his concern that a change to the block size was unlikely to get into 0.11, leaving only 0.12, which would give everyone only a few months to upgrade in order to fork the chain by the end of the winter growth season. He stated that leadership and a plan is needed and no longer believes this community can reach consensus on anything protocol related. Hearn disagreed with the notion that long-term incentive compatibility requires some fee pressure and full or nearly full blocks. He also feels that it is difficult to predict what might happen when the money supply eventually dwindles and doubts that it will be fee pressure that funds mining. In response to Hearn, there were suggestions put forward for the criteria for hardfork deployment. The email thread contained discussions over free transactions and the need for competition for block space to help us get more data on a similar situation to be able to predict the future better. Hearn called for a specific and credible plan that fits within the next 12 months and which allows Bitcoin to keep growing.</summary>
