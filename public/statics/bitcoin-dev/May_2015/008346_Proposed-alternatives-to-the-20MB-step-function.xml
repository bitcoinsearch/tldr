    <summary>The discussion revolves around the user-agent strings of publicly reachable nodes on the network, which can be viewed on websites like https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/. It was noted that the count of XT nodes may be higher than what is suggested by simply counting user-agent strings because a change to the user-agent string in Bitcoin XT was accidentally taken out. The author admits to neglecting XT lately but offered to fix any issues if they decide to move forward with it.</summary>
