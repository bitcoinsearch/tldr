    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.10.2rc1 binaries are now available for download from bitcoin.org. This is a minor version release which mainly addresses a bug that affected Windows users who had non-ASCII characters in their data directory. The release also includes translation updates. Users who did not experience any issues with the previous version, 0.10.1, do not need to upgrade. Preliminary release notes for version 0.10.2 can be found on Github under the signed tag. Release candidates serve as test runs for new releases and if no critical problems are found, this release candidate will be tagged as 0.10.2. Any bugs should be reported using the issue tracker on Github.</summary>
