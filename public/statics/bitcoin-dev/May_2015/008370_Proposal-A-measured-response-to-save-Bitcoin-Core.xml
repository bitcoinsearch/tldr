    <summary>Matt Whitlock has proposed a gradual increase in the block size limit of Bitcoin to avoid sudden changes that could potentially damage the currency. He acknowledges that Bitcoin could face problems if it does not raise the block size limit, but he believes that Gavin's proposal to suddenly increase the limit is too risky. Matt suggests using a linear growth function to smoothly adjust the block size limit from 1 MB to 20 MB over several years, beginning next March. His proposal aims to satisfy both those who want larger blocks and those who are cautious about changing the fundamental economic parameters of Bitcoin. Matt offers to implement this proposal and submit a pull request to Bitcoin Core.</summary>
