    <summary>In May 2015, the Bitcoin development community was discussing the topic of block size. Gavin Andresen had been advocating for an increase in maximum block size, but there had not been much discussion on the topic recently. Matt Corallo expressed concerns about a commitment to a block size increase, stating that long-term incentive compatibility requires fee pressure and blocks to be consistently full. He believed that the current lack of fee pressure allowed the well-funded Bitcoin ecosystem to continue building systems that rely on quick transaction confirmations while pretending these systems scale. Eric Lombrozo suggested that if a hard fork were to happen, it should be used as an opportunity to create a good process for future hard forks. Slush recommended including SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE or its alternative to benefit developers of lightweight clients. Overall, the community recognized that block size is a complex question with technical tradeoffs that require honest discussion and consensus.</summary>
