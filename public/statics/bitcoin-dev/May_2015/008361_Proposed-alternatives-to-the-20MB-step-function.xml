    <summary>There is a discussion about the block size limit and DOS protection in the Bitcoin network. A suggestion was made to try dynamic scaling within the 20MB range with a yearly increase of 40% until a way to dynamically scale is found. The current cap is seen as an issue and setting a maximum policy for two years would protect against the possibility of dynamic scaling abuse. There are two poles in this debate: block size must increase and block size must not increase. Gavin Andresen suggests implementing a big increase now that grows over time and then lobbying for merchant services, exchanges, and other infrastructure companies to run Bitcoin-Xt instead of Bitcoin Core. If there is still no consensus among developers, he suggests getting big miners to do the same and use the soft-fork block version voting mechanism to get a majority and hopefully a super-majority willing to produce bigger blocks. Ultimately, the majority of merchants, exchanges, and miners running certain code will determine consensus. Breadwallet co-founder and CEO Aaron Voisine notes that increasing the block size also increases the cost of DOSing the network, which is currently possible at a relatively low cost.</summary>
