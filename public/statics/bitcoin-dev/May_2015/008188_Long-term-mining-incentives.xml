    <summary>In a discussion on the use of bitcoin as a unit of value, Owen Gunden suggested that there are alternatives that still use bitcoin as a unit of value such as sidechains and offchain. He also argued that to say these alternatives are "not bitcoin" is misleading. In response to this, someone questioned whether it was misleading by comparing it to the acceptance of euros implying Visa is okay even though Visa is just an extra protocol surrounding an eventual bank deposit.</summary>
