    <summary>Sergio Lerner proposed reducing the block rate as a better way to increase transactions per second (tps) than increasing the maximum block size. He suggested reducing the inter-block time to 1 minute while keeping the block size limit to 1 Megabyte. This proposal aims to reduce the variance in reaching the "sixty minutes" of security level and increase the odds of a smaller pool finding a block and thus getting a reward. However, there are limits to the block time as it could lead to excessive orphan rates.Lerner argued against the arguments that reducing the block rate would encourage centralization, increase the probability of a block-chain split, reduce the security of the network, and require thousands of SPV wallets running in mobile devices to be upgraded. He said that the security of the network is based on two factors: miners' incentives to extend the best chain and the probability of a reversal based on a long block competition decreasing with the number of confirmation blocks appended.Lerner proposed measuring confirmation numbers in terms of "minutes of security" rather than confirmations to avoid confusion about numbers of confirmations, and said that synchronization will be done less than a 1-minute block confirmation due to low-hanging-fruit optimizations to the protocol that have not been implemented.The context includes various links and information related to Bitcoin development. One link discusses the possibility of reducing block intervals to 5 seconds, while another proposes bigger blocks. A third link provides data on the increasing use of the internet and its impact on network traffic. Additionally, there is a link to a blog post about a tool called "Decor" that simplifies blockchain analysis. The context also includes two identical advertisements for a dashboard monitoring system with multiple features, including transaction tracing using APM Insight. Finally, there are two links related to a Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
