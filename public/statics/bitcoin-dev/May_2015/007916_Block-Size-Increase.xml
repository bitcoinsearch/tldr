    <summary>The context discusses the impact of a trivial code change on the economics of a $3.2B system, specifically Bitcoin. The author argues that Bitcoin has been unconstrained by the hard block size limit and raising it would continue this trend. However, if the block size limit is not raised, businesses built on the assumption that Bitcoin could become popular will have their basic assumptions invalidated, causing users to leave. The technical code change would be zero, but the economic change would be significant.</summary>
