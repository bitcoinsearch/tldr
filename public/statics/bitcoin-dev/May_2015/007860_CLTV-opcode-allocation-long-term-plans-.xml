    <summary>Matt Corallo raised concern over the scarcity of OP_NOP in Bitcoin mempool, regarding only CLTV pull-req. He suggested that using one of the precious few OP_NOPs would be more flexible and efficient. The author presents two lines of thought to address this issue. Firstly, we may end up with a Script v2.0 soon based on Russell O'Connor and Pieter Wuille's Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree idea which requires at most a single OP_NOPx to implement, largely solving the scarcity issue. Secondly, even if all ten OP_NOPxs were used in script v1.0, implementing an OP_EXTENDED would be logical. The form of a relative CLTV is still not clear, but it is proposed that OP_PREVOUT_HEIGHT_VERIFY/OP_PREVOUT_DATA along with OP_ADD should be used whilst avoiding the use of any opcode accessing non-reorg-safe prevout info until the coinbase maturity period has passed for soft-fork safety. If people have strong feelings about this, the author proposes making OP_CLTV work as follows: 1 OP_CLTV where 1 selects absolute mode and all others act as OP_NOPs. A future relative CLTV could then be a future soft-fork implemented as follows: 2 OP_CLTV. Although there are concerns such as rewriting existing tests, example code and updating the BIP, and complicating the code base compared to sticking with just doing a Script v2.0, the author concludes that the above proposal is not too big of a deal.</summary>
