    <summary>Chun Wang, a representative of F2Pool, the largest bitcoin mining pool, stated that they support bigger blocks but cannot handle 20 MB blocks. He also mentioned that if only a small fraction of blocks are more than 10 MB, it would dramatically increase their orphan rate and result in higher fees to miners. Other Chinese pools such as AntPool and BW do not care about orphan rate as much as F2Pool and would continue their zero fee policy. Chun Wang thinks that zero fee is not healthy for the network and the max block size should be increased smoothly, starting with 2 MB first, then after one or two years 4 MB, then 8 MB, and so on. In a separate conversation, Peter Todd noted that Gavin Andresen's analysis of the issue uses quite optimistic scenarios for how nodes are connected to each other. Assuming that connections between miners are direct is a very optimistic assumption that depends on a permissive, unregulated environment where miners cooperate with each other. This can easily change.</summary>
