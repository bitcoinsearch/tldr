    <summary>In this email exchange, Chun Wang from F2Pool expresses concern about the possibility of bad miners attacking the network with artificial big blocks. Gavin Andresen, in response, ran simulations to determine if a miner producing big blocks could cause a loss of profit to another miner producing smaller blocks but could not find a network topology where that was the case. Chun Wang suggests that the max block size should be increased smoothly, starting with 2 MB and gradually increasing to 4 MB after one or two years, and then 8 MB and so on. Gavin Andresen questions why 2 MB specifically and asks about bandwidth costs in China. He suggests arranging to run more simulations with miners from China and elsewhere.</summary>
