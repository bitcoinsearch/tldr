    <summary>The discussion centers around the concept of transaction malleability and how to address it using normalized transaction IDs. The proposal involves using OP_CHECKAWESOMESIG, which looks up the previous transaction, normalizes the prevout and calculates its normalized transaction ID before inserting it in the OutPoint and calculating its own hash to be signed. There are two approaches to implementing normalized transaction IDs - one that continues to use current hashes to reference a specific signed instance of semantically identical transactions, and another that commits to full transaction data in blocks but uses normalized txids for transactions and signature hashes. The latter approach does not require fixing up transactions whose inputs have been malleated but would require a hard fork. The multi-level refund problem is solved by the proposed solution.</summary>
