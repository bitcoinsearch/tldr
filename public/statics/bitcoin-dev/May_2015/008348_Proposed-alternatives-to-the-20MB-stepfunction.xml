    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposal for larger maximum block size but raises concern over the delay that could be caused by the lower security of extended blocks. The writer compares the current situation to the US Congress, where the support of stakeholders for changes has become irrelevant due to the sway of lobbyists. They propose secret ballots as a solution to eliminate the power of lobbyists in Bitcoin Core. The thread then delves into the technical aspect of increasing block size via soft fork using extended blocks with lower security but giving people a choice to move their money or not. This is presented as a fallback option if no consensus is reached.</summary>
