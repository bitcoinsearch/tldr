    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Jim Phillips, the topic of UTXO growth was discussed. Phillips suggested that wallet developers should adopt UTXO selection algorithms that reduce the database size to prevent further growth. However, Todd pointed out that UTXO growth will come from various applications, not just wallets. Nevertheless, Todd agreed that developers should aim to limit UTXOs as they are expensive to store. While consolidation in wallets is not the only solution, it is an easy one to implement and could prevent the problem from getting worse.</summary>
