    <summary>The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project has rated various wallets based on manpower and will be holding a recruitment drive to rate more for the next round. Eric Lombrozo questioned why mSIGNA was not included in the report, stating that it has advanced security and privacy features and has been on bitcoin.org longer than some of the other wallets reviewed. Justus Ranvier, Founder of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, replied to the list that they will add mSIGNA to the report if it meets their standards.</summary>
