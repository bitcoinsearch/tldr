    <summary>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin Core developer, has released a replace-by-fee patch for Bitcoin Core v0.10.1 on Github. This version is simply a rebase of the previous version and does not include any new features. The replace-by-fee patch changes the way most Bitcoin nodes accept transactions in order to align with miner incentives; accepting the transaction with the highest fee. This change creates a more efficient transaction fee marketplace and provides a path to make zeroconf transactions economically secure by relying on economic incentives. The installation process for this patch is simple. Once the user has compiled the replace-by-fee-v0.10.1 branch, they can run their node normally. Users can see messages indicating that their node is replacing transactions with higher-fee paying double-spends if -debug logging is enabled. Additionally, users can check whether they are connected to replace-by-fee nodes or Bitcoin XT nodes by examining the service bits advertised by their peers. Replace-by-fee nodes advertise service bit 26 from the experimental use range, while Bitcoin XT nodes advertise service bit 1 for their getutxos support. Adopting replace-by-fee can avoid the development of an ecosystem that relies heavily on large miners punishing smaller ones for misbehavior. It also allows for double-spending "stuck" transactions with higher paying versions of themselves, making zeroconf transactions economically secure through economic incentives. Finally, if one does not want to advertise that they are running a replace-by-fee node, they can checkout an earlier commit in git. In summary, Peter Todd's replace-by-fee patch for Bitcoin Core v0.10.1 changes the way most Bitcoin nodes accept transactions, making the transaction fee marketplace more efficient while providing a path to make zeroconf transactions economically secure. The installation process is simple, and users can check whether they are connected to replace-by-fee nodes or Bitcoin XT nodes by examining the service bits advertised by their peers. Adopting replace-by-fee can avoid the development of an ecosystem that relies heavily on large miners punishing smaller ones for misbehavior, and users can checkout an earlier commit in git if they do not want to advertise that they are running a replace-by-fee node.</summary>
