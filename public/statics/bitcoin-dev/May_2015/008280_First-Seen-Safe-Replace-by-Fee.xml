    <summary>In a discussion between Gregory Maxwell and Tom Harding, the conversation focused on the potential risks of transaction replacement in Bitcoin. Replacement refers to changing the input signatures of a transaction after it has been broadcasted and seen by observers. Harding mentioned that certain payments could be part of a larger deal with unknown connections to other parts, which could lead to issues if paying parties are kicked out of the deal or do not learn about it right away. Maxwell argued that multisig signers already accepted the possibility of being written out and that they should be included in the set of people who don't get less reliable. They also discussed Kalle's Proof of Payment proposed standard, where one payer in a two-input transaction could decide to boot the other and claim the concert tickets for himself.  Overall, the conversation suggests that while there are potential risks associated with transaction replacement, there are existing mechanisms in place to mitigate them.</summary>
