    <summary>In an email conversation between Tom Harding and an unknown recipient, Tom questions the necessity of contributing to a transaction and asks for a specific case where it makes a difference. He suggests that if there is another unused input that has a larger fee, why not use it instead. Tom also highlights the unreliability of depending on the signature content of a transaction until it is buried. He argues that an inability to replace an input means that one cannot RBF (replace-by-fee) for additional fees without taking change in more cases. Tom believes that there should be a benefit to this.</summary>
