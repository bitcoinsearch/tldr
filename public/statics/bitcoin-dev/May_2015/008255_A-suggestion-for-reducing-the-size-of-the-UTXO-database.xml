    <summary>On May 25th, 2015, Peter Todd and Andreas Schildbach discussed an issue with the Bitcoin wallet app. Todd reported a problem where the wallet would not allow a user to send a second payment before the first one had confirmed, even if there were enough bitcoins in the wallet. This issue occurred in both the latest release and Testnet3 variant of the app. Schildbach explained that the issue was due to Todd's configuration, which only connected to his trusted Bitcoin node. As a result, the wallet did not receive instant confirmations because of a limitation in the Bitcoin protocol. Schildbach suggested that Todd report the issue through the app and attach his log when the problem occurred again.Todd tried the suggested solution of connecting to multiple peers but still experienced the same issue. Despite this, Schildbach maintained that the solution should work and recommended that Todd report the issue through the app.</summary>
