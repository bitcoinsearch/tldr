    <summary>The discussion revolves around the issue of security and efficiency in syncing the blockchain. One suggestion is to have a partial archive which stores the most recent X% of the blockchain by default. This is because there is more demand for recent blocks, and the demand for older blocks rapidly falls off. Another suggestion is to include some sort of torrent in QT to mitigate the risk, although this may not be a good idea. The problem with an attacker DoS'ing a small part of the chain is that it weakens security and leads to a network-wide DoS as nobody can complete a sync. Instead, it could be viewed as a bandwidth exhaustion DOS attack on the archive nodes. It is useful to give people incremental ways to participate even when they cannot swallow the whole pill, or choose to provide the resource that is cheap for them to provide. Having fractional full nodes rather than just archive and pruned nodes takes low(er) bandwidth unless the fractionals get DOS attacked.</summary>
