    <summary>The attached document is a simplified costing analysis that could be useful for network scaling discussions. The document is in PDF format and contains information on the cost of scaling a network, broken down into different components. It is not clear what specific type of network is being discussed, but the analysis provides a framework for understanding the costs involved in scaling any type of network.The document is relatively short and concise, with clear headings for each section. The first section provides an overview of the different components of scaling a network, including hardware, software, and operational costs. The second section breaks down the cost of hardware, including servers, storage, and networking equipment. The third section covers the cost of software, including licenses and support fees. The fourth section discusses operational costs, including staffing and training.Overall, the document provides a useful starting point for discussions around network scaling. It is important to note, however, that the specific costs outlined in the analysis may vary depending on the particular network being scaled. Nonetheless, the document provides a helpful framework for thinking about the costs involved in scaling any type of network.</summary>
