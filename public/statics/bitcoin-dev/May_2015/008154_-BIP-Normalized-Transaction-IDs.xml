    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of malleability in bitcoin transactions and proposes a hard fork solution that allows transactions to refer to their inputs by either txid or txid-norm. Pieter Wuille argues that allowing mixed usage of the two types of txids does not effectively guarantee non-malleability, and suggests a soft fork alternative where transactions would get two txids, one for reference and one for an extended sighash. However, this approach is vulnerable to two-level malleability. The email suggests recursively replacing all input txids with txid-norms when computing the txid-norm for a transaction as a solution to this problem. This would ensure that mutated transactions within two levels of dependencies would still have the same txid-norm and therefore be valid.</summary>
