    <summary>In an email dated November 5, 2015, Leo Wandersleb expressed his belief that a one-minute block target would not have substantial support. He argued that the delay between pool/network and miner, which varies globally, causes stale shares, and that this warrants increasing the block target rather than reducing it. However, he acknowledged that a one-minute block target would reduce payout variance tenfold and could make bitcoin more accessible as a payment method. In response, Sergio pushed for near-instant payments and opposed any changes that move the balance towards the economically upper billion. He argued that having a ten-minute rate is good for internet money but a one-minute rate could expand the use cases for bitcoin, including retail payments and online transactions. He also dismissed concerns about increased traffic from SPV and proposed small improvements in the wire protocol to reduce traffic two-fold.</summary>
