    <summary>The issue of increasing server bandwidth to achieve a tenfold increase in work distribution has been discussed. While most Stratum pools already update the header multiple times per block period, latency is the main issue, with up to 15 seconds between the first and last pools to push headers to clients for the latest block. This may not be significant for a 10-minute block time, but it can affect a 1-minute one heavily. In addition, some pools do not validate blocks but mirror other pools, making this an epidemic of invalidity rather than a solution.Although there are several proof-of-work cryptocurrencies with lower than 1 minute block intervals, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Quarkcoin, these cannot be used as examples of things going just fine. None of these networks have the same transaction volume or network size as Bitcoin, and poor decisions cannot be justified by stating that altcoins are doing it. It is unclear whether there is even a single study of the stale rates within these networks.</summary>
