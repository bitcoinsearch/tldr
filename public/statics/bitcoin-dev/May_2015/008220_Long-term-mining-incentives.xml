    <summary>Hello Thomas, The issue at hand is the lack of vision. The topic of discussion is regarding a proposal for network assurance contracts which can be found in the following link: https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07552.html.Gavin's opinion is that it might be too ambitious to plan for 20 years from now given the uncertainty surrounding the longevity of Bitcoin. It is possible that Bitcoin may not exist or become an abandoned backwater like USENET.</summary>
