    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gabe Appleton suggested a hybrid option for nodes to solve the issue of 20MB step increasing storage needs and switching to pruned nodes reducing network security. The idea is to store a section of the blockchain fully (percentage-based), and selectively prune all sections not included in it. This would allow nodes to continue validating transactions while significantly reducing storage needs. It could also introduce a retroactive --max-size flag to prune until the specified size and continue to prune over time while keeping to the sections defined by the network. However, there were concerns about its side effects and network vulnerabilities, particularly regarding Sybil resistance. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, responded that a general assumption is to have a few archive nodes with the full blockchain, and a majority of nodes are pruned, able to serve only the tail of the chains.</summary>
