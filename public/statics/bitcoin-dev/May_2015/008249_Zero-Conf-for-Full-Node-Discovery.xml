    <summary>In a mailing list conversation, Matt Whitlock mentioned that he had operated a Bitcoin-only Wi-Fi network at a remote festival where over 100 lightweight wallets were used. To deal with the limited bandwidth of the Internet connection, he poisoned the DNS and rejected all outbound connection attempts on port 8333, forcing all wallets to connect to a single local full node. This allowed all the wallets to have Bitcoin network connectivity while only needing to backhaul the Bitcoin network's transaction traffic once. No specific information was provided about the festival.</summary>
