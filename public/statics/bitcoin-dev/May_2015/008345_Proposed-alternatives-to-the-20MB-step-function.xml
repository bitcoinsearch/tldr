    <summary>The speaker is discussing the miner consensus and how they intend to measure exchange/merchant acceptance. They claim to have already asked well-known people and CEOs in the Bitcoin community, all of whom support bigger blocks except for Bitcoin Core. This includes wallet developers, payment processors, and exchange companies. The speaker notes that Gavin has also been talking to people about this. They address a feeling on the list that there is no consensus by stating that there is a strong consensus in the wider community and that the list is an aberration.</summary>
