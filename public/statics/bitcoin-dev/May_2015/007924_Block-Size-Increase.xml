    <summary>In a recent email discussion, Gavin Andresen suggested a compromise which would involve miners flagging their support for larger block sizes. This would allow miners to continue producing blocks supported by both old and new clients until a majority of miners agreed to the new rules. At that point, the new rules would kick in for all miners/clients running the new software. This approach would help to glue together the network during the migration phase and avoid severe fork scenarios. However, it is important to ensure that miners will continue to support both networks long enough to enable successful migration. Ultimately, the hard fork would be determined by user participation as judged by the miners. In order to find a concrete course of action that everyone can agree on, Andresen urged people to email him objections they might have missed. He also suggested contributing some version of the bigger blocksize-limit hard-fork patch to the Bitcoin-Xt fork and then encouraging merchants, exchanges, web wallets, and individuals who think it strikes a reasonable balance to run it. The success of this approach would depend on what software people choose to run.</summary>
