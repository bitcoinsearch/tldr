    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.5 has been released with the aim of backporting BIP66. This release includes some bug fixes and updated translations. The block templates of Bitcoin Core are now only for version 3 blocks, and any mining software depending on its `getblocktemplate` must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either version 0.4.2 or any version from 0.5.1 onward. Solo miners must upgrade Bitcoin Core before BIP66 achieves its 951/1001 status; however, stratum mining protocol users will not be affected. On the other hand, pool operators can make a discretion whether they want to use getblocktemplate protocol or not, but it must be no later than BIP66 achieving its 951/1001 status. The release also contains some significant changes regarding mining and relay policy enhancements. It is highly recommended to upgrade to this release. Users can report bugs by using the issue tracker at GitHub. To upgrade to this version, users running an older version should shut it down and wait until it has completely shut down before running the installer (on Windows) or just copying over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). The 0.9.5 changelog provides detailed information about the changes made in this release, including check pindexBestForkBase for null, fix priority calculation in CreateTransaction, sanitize command strings before logging them, raise version of created blocks, and enforce DERSIG in mempool, backport of some of BIP66's tests, implement BIP 66 validation rules and switchover logic, and build: fix dynamic boost check when --with-boost= is used. Contributors to this release include 21E14, Alex Morcos, Cory Fields, Gregory Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, and Wladimir J. van der Laan, as well as everyone who helped translating on Transifex.</summary>
