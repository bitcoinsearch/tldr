    <summary>In an email dated May 12, 2015, Luke Dashjr suggested that it would be straightforward to implement a softfork of RCLTV as a negative CLTV. Negative numbers could be defined as relative later and are often associated with an offset. However, this approach would make handling the year 2038 problem more complex. The CLTV codebase currently fails on negative arguments to avoid any ambiguity or implementation differences.</summary>
