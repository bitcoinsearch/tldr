    <summary>The context discusses the efficiency of building merkle tree roots using micro-controllers. The writer argues that any reasonable micro-controller can perform this task much faster than necessary. For instance, a controller with 1 Th/s walks the nonce range in just 4.3ms. The largest valid merkle trees are 14 nodes high, which means that translating them to SHA256 operations would require 28 ops per 4.3 ms or 6511 ops/second. However, for reference, an RPi 1 model B performs 2451050 SHA256 ops/second. In response to this context, Sergio Lerner suggested leaving at least 16 bits of the version fixed as an extra-nonce. He believes that if not done, miners may use them as a nonce and interfere with the soft-fork voting system. The writer provided a link to their original proposal on Github.</summary>
