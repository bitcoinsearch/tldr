    <summary>On May 27, 2015, Pieter Wuille suggested adding a section to the mailing list discussion about how changes in GBT interact with it. Currently, clients tell the server their highest supported block version number and the server responds with a template that includes a block version number as well as instructions for the client to use this version, regardless of its maximum supported version number. However, making the version a bitfield contradicts the increment-only assumption of this design, and reused bits can easily cause confusion since GBT clients are not aware of overall network consensus state. Therefore, Pieter suggests that GBT clients indicate a list of softforks by keyword identifier instead of a maximum supported version number, and the GBT server respond with a template indicating an object of softfork keywords to bit values that the server will accept and the preferred softfork flags' version number conveyed at present.</summary>
