    <summary>In an email thread, Matt Corallo discusses the long-term incentive compatibility that requires fee pressure and blocks to be relatively full. He argues that creating fee pressure may drive people towards using something else other than Bitcoin, which is currently not a problem. Instead, he suggests focusing on increasing adoption to maximize miner incentives, which could lead to a justifiably increased exchange rate. He warns against tinkering with adoption in hopes of spurring innovation on speculation while suggesting that any innovation attractive enough to relieve the block size pressure will do so without artificial stimulus.</summary>
