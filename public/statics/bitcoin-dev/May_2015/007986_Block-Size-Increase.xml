    <summary>According to Alan, 7 transactions per second (tps) is too low by a couple of orders of magnitude. However, the real limit currently stands at around 3 tps instead of 7 tps. The figure of 7 tps was calculated by Alan in 2011, before the release of the "sendmany" command and when most transactions were small. As people started developing custom wallets, etc., the average transaction size increased.</summary>
