    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposals for determining the hard block size limit for Bitcoin. Matt expresses his preference for proposal #1, which uses already available data to determine the block size limit and eliminates the possibility of a mismatch between conscious vote and behavior. He identifies two problems with proposal #2: 1) there is often a mismatch between conscious vote and behavior in democracies, which can lead to twisted results if actual behavior doesn't correlate with the vote, and 2) there is no time to gather a meaningful amount of votes over the coinbases after the fork but before the Bitcoin scalability crash. Proposal #3 suggests determining the block size limit based on the length of the blockchain, so that it can scale up smoothly rather than jumping immediately to 20 MB. Matt supports all three proposals but does not support Mike Hearn's proposed jump to 20 MB, which he believes kicks the can down the road without actually solving the problem in a controversial way.</summary>
