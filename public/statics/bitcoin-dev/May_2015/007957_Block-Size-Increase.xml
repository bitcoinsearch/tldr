    <summary>The pressure for adoption and transaction rates in the Bitcoin industry may be mainly external from companies and not necessarily reflective of historic trends. The question then becomes how much cost (hardware capex &amp; bandwidth &amp; power opex) is acceptable for running a full node with or without hardware acceleration. It's assumed that hardware acceleration will become broadly available, but the primary limiter could be anonymous bandwidth. There may be existing hardware platforms to test confirmation times vs block size, but it's unclear if this has been done already. While some believe in Moore's law and its quadratic increase in storage and compute, others doubt that it's a safe assumption due to the potential for technology to slow down over time. In response to a proposal for Bitcoin development, there are concerns raised by some members of the community. However, specific reasons for opposition are not clearly articulated. A link is provided to a response that outlines some potential issues.</summary>
