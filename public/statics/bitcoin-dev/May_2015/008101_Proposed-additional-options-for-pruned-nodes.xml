    <summary>In response to concerns about the 20MB blockchain storage limit and network security, a user suggests a hybrid node option that would flip the --no-wallet toggle, select a percentage-based section of the blockchain to store fully, and begin pruning all other sections. This would allow nodes to continue validating transactions while distributing a full copy among many nodes, reducing individual storage needs. The network would decide which sections to retrieve based on peer data, making it similar to a Koorde implementation. The suggested method should have little impact on security and could include a retroactive --max-size flag for continued pruning. The user asks for feedback on potential side effects or vulnerabilities, noting that some have expressed concern about Sybil resistance.</summary>
