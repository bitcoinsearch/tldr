    <summary>In this context, the discussion is about the appropriate size for Bitcoin blocks. The author questions why the proposed block size increase is 2 MB and suggests that a safer option would be to increase it by 1 MB per year. They argue that this approach would allow for a gradual increase in block size while also providing an opportunity for those concerned about block size growth to stop it before it becomes too much of a problem. The author suggests that increasing block size by 1 MB per year would also provide an opportunity to gather evidence as to whether the network can handle larger block sizes. They propose that this could be a solution that satisfies both sides of the debate - those who are concerned about block size growth and those who want bigger blocks. The author argues that there haven't been any valid arguments against linear growth in block size. Overall, the discussion centers around finding a balance between accommodating the growing number of transactions on the Bitcoin network and ensuring the stability and security of the system.</summary>
