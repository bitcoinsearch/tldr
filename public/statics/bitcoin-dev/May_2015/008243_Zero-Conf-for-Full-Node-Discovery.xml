    <summary>Matt Whitlock suggests a method to make it difficult for an attacker to perform a sybil attack. He advises choosing a set of peers that is diverse and unpredictable. Jim Phillips envisions a future where lightweight devices within a home use SPV over WiFi to connect with a home server which in turn relays the transactions they create out to the larger and faster relays on the Internet. In a situation where there are hundreds or thousands of small SPV devices in a single home, this could result in lower traffic across the slow WAN connection. Matt suggests pinging the "all nodes" address (ff02::1) and trying connecting to TCP port 8333 of each node that responds. This method shouldn't take more than a few milliseconds on any but the most densely populated LANs.</summary>
