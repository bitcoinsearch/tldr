    <summary>In an email discussion with Bitcoin Core developers, Mike Hearn argues that the idea that decisions in Bitcoin Core are made by consensus is just a marketing ploy and that controversial changes are simply avoided. He contends that decisions are often vetoed by whoever shows up and complains enough, regardless of technical merit. However, other developers argue that active contributors who participate and contribute more hold more weight in decision-making. While objections for the sake of objections or unsound technical objections will not hold much weight, the project is comprised of some of the brightest minds in the field and disruptive behavior will ultimately be seen as such. The consensus system may not be perfect, but suspending the normal review process for a proposed hard fork would be drastic.</summary>
