    <summary>In an email exchange between Justus Ranvier and Jeff Garzik, the question is raised about whether decisions about Bitcoin development should consider the desires of competing projects. Garzik argues that a change to the economics of the $3.2 billion system would pick winners and losers, with attendant moral hazard. Ranvier agrees, noting that there are other projects that benefit from filling in the gap left by Bitcoin's restricted transaction rate capability, and if Bitcoin fills that gap, those other projects lose. The existential question of the block size increase is also raised, with Garzik wondering if failing to increase the 1MB limit will permanently stunt Bitcoin's growth.</summary>
