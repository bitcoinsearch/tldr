    <summary>In an email thread, Gavin Andresen requests the team to hold off on discussing the specific choice of parameters until they receive feedback from others about whether there is a set of dynamic parameters they would support at present. The term bike-shedding refers to spending disproportionate amounts of time and energy on small details while ignoring larger issues. Andresen's request suggests that he wants to prioritize more significant matters before diving into discussions about minor details.</summary>
