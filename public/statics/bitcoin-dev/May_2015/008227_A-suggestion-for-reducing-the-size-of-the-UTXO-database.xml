    <summary>Andreas Schildbach reported a problem with the Bitcoin app's behavior on Testnet3 variant, where the wallet won't let one send a second payment before the first payment confirms, prompting the message "You need x.xxxxxx more bitcoins to make this payment." Peter Todd diagnosed that the issue was due to the user only connecting to one trusted Bitcoin node, which prevents instant confirmations from other nodes. However, Todd also faced the same problem despite having multiple peers connected. No further information is provided in the context.</summary>
