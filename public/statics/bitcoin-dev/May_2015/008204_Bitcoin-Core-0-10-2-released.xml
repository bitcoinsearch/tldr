    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.10.2 is now available for download. It brings minor bug fixes and translation updates, and is only necessary to upgrade when unable to start the application on Windows with 0.10.1. The source code can be found in git under the tag `v0.10.2`, or in `bitcoin-0.10.2.tar.gz` in the distribution. Users who want to downgrade smoothly are advised to make a backup of their entire data directory. The release notes also warn that because this release makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel block download, the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software. Notable changes include a fix for a serious problem on Windows with data directories that have non-ASCII characters. For other platforms there are no notable changes. The change log includes a fix for boost::get usage with boost 1.58, and an avoidance of crash on start in TestBlockValidity with gen=1, as well as the resolution of an issue with imbuing boost::filesystem::path with locale "C" on windows. The release credits Cory Fields, Gregory Maxwell, Jonas Schnelli, and Wladimir J. van der Laan for direct contributions, and dexX7, Pieter Wuille, and vayvanne for additional code review and/or security research. The release notes encourage users to report bugs using the issue tracker at github.</summary>
