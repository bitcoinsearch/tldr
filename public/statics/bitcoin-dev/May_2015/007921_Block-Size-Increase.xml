    <summary>Justus Ranvier sent an email on May 7, 2015 in which he summarized his question and accused the recipients of not wanting to answer it and discouraging others from asking. However, the recipients disagreed with the assumptions underlying the question. They argued that while Bitcoin needs to be optimized at Layer 1, not all solutions should be implemented there. Instead, Bitcoin should be scaled up both at Layer 1 and solutions built on top of it at Layer 2. The email also included an HTML attachment that was scrubbed.</summary>
