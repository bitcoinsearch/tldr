    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has proposed a plan if no consensus is reached on the issue of block size increase in Bitcoin. He plans to ask for help reviewing and submitting patches to Mike's Bitcoin-Xt project, which implements an increase in block size that grows over time. He also plans to lobby merchant services, exchanges, wallet companies, and other infrastructure companies to run Bitcoin-Xt instead of Bitcoin Core. If there is still no consensus among developers, he plans to get big miners to produce bigger blocks using the soft-fork block version voting mechanism. The goal is to prove to doubters that they should start supporting bigger blocks or be left behind, and to give them a chance to upgrade before that happens. Ultimately, the majority of merchants, exchanges, and miners running a certain code will determine consensus.</summary>
