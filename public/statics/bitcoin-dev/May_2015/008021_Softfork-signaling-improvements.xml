    <summary>Douglas Roark, a Senior Developer at Armory Technologies, has seen some posts made by Greg (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1033396.msg11155302#msg11155302) where he mentioned that Pieter has a new proposal for allowing multiple softforks to be deployed at the same time. However, Douglas is curious if the actual proposal has been posted anywhere and spent a few minutes searching the usual suspects (this mailing list, Reddit, Bitcointalk, IRC logs, BIPs) but couldn't find anything. Douglas signs off with his contact details and PGP key ID.</summary>
