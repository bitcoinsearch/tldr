    <summary>There is a need to increase the block size limit of Bitcoin to handle the increasing transaction volume. However, there are concerns about the proposed solution dividing Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core into different consensus and creating two altcoins instead of one Bitcoin. Eric Lombrozo suggests that external input may be required, such as a vote or hashing power. He also proposes building the dynamics of hard forks into the model rather than avoiding them altogether. Matt Whitlock has proposed an alternative solution to gradually raise the block size limit using a linear growth function from 1 MB to 20 MB over several years, beginning next March. This gradual increase will allow time to discuss and fix any problem that may arise without panicking.Whitlock believes that ignoring the immediate problem is too risky and that if significantly larger blocks cause a serious problem for Bitcoin, then not making any change to Bitcoin Core will virtually assure that Bitcoin XT takes over. He proposes a way to satisfy both those who want larger blocks and those who want to be extremely cautious about changing the fundamental economic parameters of Bitcoin. Lombrozo agrees with Drak's assessment that politics are inevitable in any consensus protocol seeking dynamism. He argues that while the block size discussion is necessary, it is only serving as an example of the political issues that need to be addressed. Some protocol updates will be highly controversial and lack a process for deciding these issues. Matt offers to implement his proposal and submit a pull request to Bitcoin Core. There is also a possibility of other solutions like micropayment channels and offchain transactions that can easily function with 1 MB blocks. It would be far more helpful if the focus is on enabling level 2 technologies so that Bitcoin can actually scale. Extending blocksize now would be nothing more than a political move. In order for bitcoin to survive, changes must be based on well thought out and discussed technical merits and not the result of political pressure.Lombrozo suggests that hard forks should be built into the model rather than avoiding them altogether. He proposes learning from git and designing the network to allow for merging. The proposed solution of increasing the block size limit may not be a permanent fix as the need for larger blocks may arise again in the future. External input may be required, such as a vote or hashing power, for deciding highly controversial protocol updates.</summary>
