    <summary>Mike Hearn and Andreas Schildbach discussed the fact that some wallets, like Andreas' wallet, only allow users to spend confirmed unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This can be frustrating for users who must wait for previous transactions to confirm before making additional payments. However, Mike claimed to still experience this issue with the latest release of the app, version 4.30, and in the Testnet3 variant. He explained that if a user tries to send a payment before a previous one has confirmed, the wallet will not allow it and display an error message. The issue is resolved once the previous payment confirms. Mike also mentioned that he only connects to his own trusted Bitcoin node, so he has only one active connection at most. Outgoing payments never appear as "Sent" until they appear in a block due to the app not seeing them come in over any connection.</summary>
