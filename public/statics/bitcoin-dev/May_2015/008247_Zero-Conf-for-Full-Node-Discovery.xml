    <summary>The discussion revolves around a potential solution for lightweight devices to find a full node on the same LAN to peer with instead of using WAN bandwidth. Matt Whitlock suggests that all the nodes should connect solely to a central hub node on the LAN, which should be connected to diverse and unpredictable other nodes on the Bitcoin network. Kevin Greene argues that in order to make it as difficult as possible for an attacker to perform a Sybil attack, one should choose a set of peers that is as diverse and unpredictable as possible. Jim Phillips envisions a future where lightweight devices use SPV over WiFi to connect with a home server, which relays the transactions they create out to the larger and faster relays on the Internet. He suggests using some kind of zero-conf service discovery protocol to achieve this. The device would need to ask the user during set up if the LAN is a trusted one or not. However, depending on the nature of the product, this may not be an issue. For example, Chromecast does not require any security protections against trolls on the same LAN.</summary>
