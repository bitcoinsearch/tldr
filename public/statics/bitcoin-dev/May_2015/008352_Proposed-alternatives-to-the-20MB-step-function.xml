    <summary>In a 2015 email exchange, Gavin Andresen proposed implementing a big increase in Bitcoin block size that grows over time to avoid future debates on the issue. If an agreement couldn't be reached soon, Andresen planned to ask for help reviewing and submitting patches to Mike's Bitcoin-Xt project. He also intended to ask for assistance from various companies to run Bitcoin-Xt instead of Bitcoin Core. Andresen acknowledged that while it would be preferable for Core to make such changes, the current environment may make that impossible. He believed that solving today's problems with today's understanding was better than letting speculation about future unknowns stop their ability to respond to known issues.</summary>
