    <summary>In May 2015, Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, expressed the need for a concrete course of action that could be agreed upon by everyone. There was a requirement for a compromise that would help entrepreneurs know how much transaction volume the main Bitcoin blockchain can support over the next eleven years. Mike Hearn responded to this saying that if the transaction volume is not raised, it could result in businesses assuming they cannot become popular and users leaving. However, Andresen disagrees with Hearn’s claims as they involve predictions about people's behavior and require some proof or explanation.</summary>
