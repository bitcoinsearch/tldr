    <summary>On May 7th, 2015, Matt Corallo expressed his concerns to Gavin Andresen about the block size issue. Andresen has been telling people that the block size will increase soon for months, leading Corallo to label it a "huge issue." However, Andresen's response was that he would be pushing for a change in the block size in the near future. He clarified that while there is consensus that the max block size must change eventually, there is no consensus yet on when or how it should happen. Andresen pledged to push for a change within the current year.</summary>
