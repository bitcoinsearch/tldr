    <summary>In an email on May 6, 2015, Bitcoin Core Developer, Matt Corallo expressed his opposition to a block size increase in the near future, stating that it is important for there to be some fee pressure and that blocks be relatively consistently full or nearly full. Corallo also explained that a larger block size could push people at the lower end away from running their own full nodes and increase external costs for users. However, he acknowledged that a block size increase would give breathing room in the short-term and allow more transactions to be on-chain while other solutions are being implemented. Corallo argued that investment in off-chain solutions is guided by other factors such as speed of confirmation, which is unreliable on-chain. He concluded by expressing concerns that increasing the block size could make Bitcoin less useful for people who want to run their own "bank" without special investment in connectivity and computing hardware.</summary>
