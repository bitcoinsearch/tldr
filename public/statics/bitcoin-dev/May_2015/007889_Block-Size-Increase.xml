    <summary>In this discussion about the block size increase in Bitcoin, various individuals express their opinions and concerns. One observer largely agrees with Pieter's stance that a rigorous system for instant transactions is necessary before implementation. They also suggest that Gavin and Mike should clearly state what kind of system is satisfactory for their applications, so that it can be implemented as a soft fork into the protocol. In response to Mike's suggestion that a plan is needed, another individual proposes waiting 12 months to see if full blocks occur and a true "fee market" emerges, while noting that advocates for increasing the block size have not effectively explained why maintaining the current size would be disadvantageous. Finally, there is a disagreement between two individuals regarding whether consensus is possible in the Bitcoin community on protocol-related issues.</summary>
