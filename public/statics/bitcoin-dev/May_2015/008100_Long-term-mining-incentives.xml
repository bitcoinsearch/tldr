    <summary>The author of the email is seeking a reference scenario for the future of Bitcoin. They suggest that this scenario should not be a prediction, but rather a workable path through the future using today's technologies and knowledge. It should include all planned code changes and be amenable to quantitative analysis. The purpose of this scenario would be to justify controversial decisions such as a hard fork. In response, Gavin Andresen suggests that he believes proof-of-work will not be the last word in distributed consensus, but does not think any alternatives are ready to deploy. He also thinks it is premature to worry about what will happen in twenty or thirty years when the block subsidy is insignificant. Andresen considers Bitcoin an experiment, but believes that the incentives are correct and that motivated, smart, hard-working people will make it work.</summary>
