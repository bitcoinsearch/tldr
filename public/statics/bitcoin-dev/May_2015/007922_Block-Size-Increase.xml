    <summary>In a message posted on May 7th, 2015, Jeff Garzik wrote that Bitcoin needs to be the best it can be and all solutions cannot and should not be implemented at Layer 1. Another user provisionally agreed with the statement as long as "all solutions cannot and should not be implemented at Layer 1" is taken as a hypothesis to be tested in the context of each proposed solution rather than a law of nature. The message included a PGP signature and an attachment named "0xEAD9E623.asc", which is a file containing application/pgp-keys.</summary>
