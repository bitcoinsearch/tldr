    <summary>In the previous mail, the sender apologizes for sending it by accident, and then explains why assurance contracts are better than simple donations. Donating to a project means that you might lose your money and the project might still not get funded. Assurance contracts, on the other hand, are similar to Kickstarter where the credit card is charged only if the project is fully funded. This lowers the risk, as the pledger either gets their money back or the project is funded. Despite the risk, it might still be worth it to hope for the project's funding. The email also mentions that Kickstarter has pledge rewards to encourage people to pledge and help with creating momentum for the project.</summary>
