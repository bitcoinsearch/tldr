    <summary>The proof-of-idle concept faces a potential security issue where miners can use the idle time of others to construct a long chain and make it appear as if it was the work of many distinct miners. This could allow them to re-mine block rewards and potentially censor transactions, creating a significant vulnerability. In response to an email from Gavin Andresen, who proposed four possible future scenarios for mining incentives, Thomas Voegtlin pointed out that long-term mining incentives need to be addressed in addition to scalability. The email chain also includes a link to a Bitcoin Foundation blog post outlining a scalability roadmap.</summary>
