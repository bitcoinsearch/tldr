    <title>Version bits proposal</title>

    <summary>Pieter Wuille has proposed a way to coordinate future soft-forking consensus changes in Bitcoin. The proposal supports multiple parallel changes and changes that get permanently rejected without obstructing the rollout of others. Some people have been proposing alternate methods too. The author of the email finds the BIP a bit hard to read as it contains confusing passages. They suggest using the "it" pronoun only when it is clear what "it" is referring to. Also, they found the "W" value handling a bit weird and suggested making the high bits section more readable with a legend. The author suggests changing "one by one" to "incremental steps" and representing data as big endian for readability purposes.</summary>
