    <summary>In an email sent to the Bitcoin Dev mailing list on May 12, 2015, Telephone Lemien asked for technical details on the differences between a regular Bitcoin transaction and a colored coins transaction. Patrick Mccorry responded, stating that there is no difference to the transaction itself, but rather the inputs and outputs have a special meaning and order in colored coins transactions. He also mentioned that it is possible to track one BTC throughout the blockchain as representing an asset. The original poster thanked Mccorry for his input and requested more details on the inputs/outputs and how to proceed in the code.</summary>
