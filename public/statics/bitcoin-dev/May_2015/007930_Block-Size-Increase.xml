    <summary>The Bitcoin Core team may introduce an option for users to continue using the old consensus rules or support the new rules after updating. Users who choose to support the new rules will be able to produce larger blocks when there is majority miner consensus, while those who stick with the old rules will only support them. The decision will not be forced on users and information about whether they are supporting the changes could be included in the version message or incorporated into transactions. This proposal aims to ensure a smooth transition during migration. A fairer way of determining a hard fork would be through user participation as judged by miners. There are tradeoffs involved in deciding the course of action, and it is important to find a compromise so that entrepreneurs can know how much transaction volume the main Bitcoin blockchain will support over the next eleven years. Ultimately, consensus comes down to what software people choose to run.</summary>
