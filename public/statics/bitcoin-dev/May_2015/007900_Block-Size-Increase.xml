    <summary>In an email thread, Peter Todd was accused of being a hypocrite for publishing hacked private emails despite constantly claiming to be a defender of privacy. Mike Hearn, who accused Todd, stated that the hacker forwarded the email to him as he had no illusions about Todd's personality. However, Todd clarified that he did not publish the email initially and consulted with Hearn via private IRC chat first before deciding not to publish it. The hacker ended up publishing the email seven months ago, making it public. Todd provided a link to the source of the email in his message to make this clear. Todd also called for an apology from Hearn for the personal attacks made towards him.</summary>
