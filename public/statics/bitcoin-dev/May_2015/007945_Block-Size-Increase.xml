    <summary>In this email conversation dated on May 8, 2015, Mike Hearn is asking for someone to articulate the worst-case scenarios in plain English if a proposal related to block size increase goes ahead. He believes that there is some urgency as it would take months to implement, merge, test, release and for people to upgrade. However, some people in the conversation are uncomfortable and defensive about the proposal but aren't providing any specific reasons why it is not feasible. Hearn mentions that assuming it takes months to implement, there is an urgency to act upon the matter. The email ends with an advertisement for a dashboard for servers and applications with monitoring support.</summary>
