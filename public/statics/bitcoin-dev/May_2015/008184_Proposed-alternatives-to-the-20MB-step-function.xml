    <summary>In an email exchange on May 16, 2015, Rusty Russell and others discussed potential tweaks to Bitcoin's transaction cost limit. The group discussed the terminology used in referring to transaction size and byte size and agreed to use "tx_cost" and "tx_bytes," respectively. They also talked about how to measure UTXO (unspent transaction output) size and suggested storing them as a fixed digest. Gmaxwell's proposal was mentioned, which suggested a cost of 3-4 bytes per UTXO change. Additionally, the group proposed adding a cost for CHECKSIG and adjusting the cost formula for transactions. They ultimately decided that having one combined "cost" for transactions would be best as it would mean fewer spread out transaction checks and the code for the cost formula would be in one place.</summary>
