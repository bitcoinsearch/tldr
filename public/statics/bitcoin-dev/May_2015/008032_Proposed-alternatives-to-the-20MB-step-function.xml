    <summary>Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, suggests that the default fallback behavior for unconfirmed inputs in Bitcoin transactions should either be non-propagation or delayed confirmation. He argues that this is a less risky and more conservative approach until the block size limit is reached. The current system already has safe and easy-to-experiment-with options to add fee pressure, which can cause users to economize on block space without resorting to dropping transactions after a prolonged delay. Mark Friedenbach responds by stating that there are already solutions waiting to be deployed as default policy to bitcoind, including replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent.</summary>
