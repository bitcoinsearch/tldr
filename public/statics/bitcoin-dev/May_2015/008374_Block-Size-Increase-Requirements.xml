    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing the idea of using linear growth as a model for block size increase. Linear growth removes concerns about complexity, and is seen as a safe compromise between exponential growth and zero growth. A simple linear growth 'hard' technical limit could also be used in conjunction with the simple periodic soft dynamic limit adjustment to provide for growth with fee pressure up until if/when the technical hard limit is hit. This signals a market demand for ancillary layers to be built out that has been missing until now. There is also discussion about growing block size by 1 MB per year as a safer option, giving more evidence as to whether the network can handle larger blocks. Linear growth seems to satisfy both sides, with people who are concerned about block size growth having an opportunity to stop it before it grows too much, while those who want bigger blocks will get an equivalent of 25% per year growth within the first 10 years. There have been no valid arguments against linear growth so far.</summary>
