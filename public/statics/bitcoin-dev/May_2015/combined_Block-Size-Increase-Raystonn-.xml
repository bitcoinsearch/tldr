    <summary>The writer proposes a block size of 20MB for transactions and suggests that this amount of data is sizable for a network, allowing for a rate of 10 transactions per second over 10 minutes. They also discuss the possibility of adding nuanced data to the blockchain while maintaining the block's integral identifiers. The writer recommends a blockchain within 200-300 bytes, enabling encryption standards like DH algorithm keys, resulting in a higher level of integrity within the system. The writer believes that a rate higher than the current standard of 92 bytes permits GPUS like CUDA to perform its standard operations of 1216 flops to create a new personal identity within the chain and attach an encrypted instance of a further categorical variable. The writer also highlights a vulnerability for man-in-the-middle attacks in Bitcoin requests to any merchant. Today's best-fit block size is between 200 - 300 bytes, depending on how excited people get. Finally, the writer expresses their willingness to engage in further discussions and research to resolve any issues brought up by their ideas.</summary>
