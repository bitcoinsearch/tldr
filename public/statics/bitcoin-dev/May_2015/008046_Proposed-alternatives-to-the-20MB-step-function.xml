    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list in May 2015, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen discussed the possibility of creating pools that would have exclusive rights to mine certain transactions. Peter Todd responded, saying that although this idea has potential, it may pose a barrier to smaller mining operations and could be attractive to regulators as a point of control. Kaartinen argued that this idea would allow stakeholders to have a degree of influence on how large fees are, with incentives in place to keep fees reasonable. Todd suggested looking into John Dillon's proof-of-stake blocksize voting scheme if stakeholders wanted more influence. The email thread is archived on SourceForge.</summary>
