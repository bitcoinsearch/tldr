    <summary>In an email conversation between Tier Nolan and Pieter, the former proposed a clearer description of the recursive version. The proposal suggested that the hash for the new signature opcode should assume that the normalized txid system was used since the beginning, with all txids throughout the blockchain being replaced with the "correct" values. However, this approach requires a full re-indexing of the blockchain as it's impossible to determine the TXID-N of a transaction without knowing the TXID-N of its parents, which is necessary for the replacement. Additionally, the non-recursive version of this solution can only handle refunds one level deep. Pieter acknowledged that this was what he had been suggesting all along.</summary>
