    <summary>In a discussion regarding blacklisting on the Bitcoin network, a suggestion was made to ban any miners who engage in bad behavior. The belief is that this would be an effective way to prevent attacks like those of Finney against BetCoin Dice, as Andreas Antonopoulos has stated. However, it was pointed out that this method is flawed because a large-scale miner can make themselves look like many smaller miners, making it difficult to identify and blacklist them. Additionally, anonymity for validators and block makers makes it virtually impossible to maintain sanctions against antisocial behavior. The only deterrent is the lack of incentives for miners to engage in such activity.</summary>
