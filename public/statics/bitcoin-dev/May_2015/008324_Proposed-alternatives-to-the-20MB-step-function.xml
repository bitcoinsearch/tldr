    <summary>The discussion is about the maximum block size for Bitcoin transactions. The current limit of 1MB is said to be too small, even with the implementation of SegWit, as it puts pressure on users to increase fees and can result in delayed transactions. The proposal presented suggests a maximum block size of 2x the average size of the last 144 blocks, calculated at every block. However, some argue that this may still cause fee pressure and suggest setting the max size to be 20x the average size instead. There are concerns that limiting the block size too much could turn away users without a valid reason as mining is not supported by fees and the current fees seem to be enough to prevent penny flooding.</summary>
