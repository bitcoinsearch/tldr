    <summary>The email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Chun Wang discusses the possibility of bad miners attacking the network with artificial big blocks. Gavin runs some simulations and concludes that bigger blocks do not cause a loss of profit to other miners. Chun Wang raises concerns about the orphan rate increasing with 20MB blocks, resulting in transaction-less blocks and bandwidth costs. He suggests that the network can only accept up to 5MB blocks. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list and proposes an experiment for Chinese miners to work with Gavin and others to gather more details for the community.</summary>
