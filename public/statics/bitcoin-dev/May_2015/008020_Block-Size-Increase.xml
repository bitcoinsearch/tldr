    <summary>The email conversation discusses the issues with using time as a reliable factor in the blockchain. In addition to being unreliable, it also poses a problem for reorganization safety as transactions can expire during a reorg and any transaction built on the expired one is invalidated. The discussion mentions the alternative of replace by fee and how end-users interpret the old transaction as expired. Another suggestion made is a reverse time lock feature that expires a transaction after a specific time, but acknowledges that time is still not entirely reliable in the blockchain.</summary>
