    <summary>In a conversation, someone praised a tool that could be useful as a building block for oracle-based services. However, they noted that working with X.509 can be annoying and suggested documenting how to extract data from a certificate. The speaker also pointed out two issues: X.509 being difficult to work with and some data being embedded as text inside the certificate, which is not developer-friendly and risks parsing errors. They proposed embedding either a protocol buffer or DER encoded structure inside the extension to allow developers to extract notarized data directly without additional parsing.</summary>
