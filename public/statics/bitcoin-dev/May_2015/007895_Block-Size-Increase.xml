    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient, the topic of forking Bitcoin Core was discussed. The current community of developers had lost interest in supporting Simplified Payment Verification wallets and any protocol change that might pose a risk was being bogged down in endless circular arguments. Hearn pointed out that maintainers do not usually fork their own software and suggested that forking would be a better option for Gavin if he fails to convince everyone with good points. If ignored, he won't be considered part of the consensus. At that point, Gavin could fork the project and go to the next level of consensus gathering, the community at large. Bitcoin is a decentralized system and all power over the development process is held only by social consent and respect.</summary>
