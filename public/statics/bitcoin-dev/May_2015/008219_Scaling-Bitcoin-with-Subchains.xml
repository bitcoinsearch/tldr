    <summary>The letter writer is responding to a previous message from Andrew about his concern regarding Bitcoin's reliance on hard disk storage. The writer argues that there is no requirement for the blockchain to be stored on hard disks, and suggests using tape backup technology instead. They link an article about Sony's development of tape technology that can store 185 terabytes per cartridge. The writer also notes that sharing the cost of a blockchain archive with others would not be a major concern. However, they caution that if a computer is compromised, validating the chain on that machine is meaningless.</summary>
