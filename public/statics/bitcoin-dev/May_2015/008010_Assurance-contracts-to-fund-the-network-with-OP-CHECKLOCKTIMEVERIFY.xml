    <summary>On May 8, 2015, Jeff Garzik suggested integrating a patch that automatically sweeps anyone-can-pay transactions for a miner. However, he was reminded that it should be anyone-can-spend instead. Peter Todd had already written a code for this, which can be found on Github at https://github.com/petertodd/replace-by-fee-tools/blob/master/spend-brainwallets-to-fees.py. Nonetheless, there is a need for an added feature where the txout set will be replaced with just OP_RETURN-to-fees if the inputs do not sign the outputs, such as SIGHASH_NONE.</summary>
