    <summary>The author is asking if there is any work being done to create a zero-conf service discovery protocol that would allow lightweight clients to find a full node on the same LAN to peer with rather than having to tie up WAN bandwidth. The author envisions a future where lightweight devices within a home use SPV over WiFi to connect with a home server, which in turn relays the transactions they create out to the larger and faster relays on the Internet. This could result in lower traffic across the slow WAN connection, especially in situations where there are hundreds or thousands of small SPV devices in a single home. Although it may take a lot of these devices before the total bandwidth is greater than downloading a full copy of the blockchain, there are other reasons to host your own full node, such as trust.</summary>
