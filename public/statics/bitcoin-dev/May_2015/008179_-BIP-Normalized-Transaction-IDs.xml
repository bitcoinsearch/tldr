    <summary>In a message sent on May 15, 2015 by s7r, the issue of scriptSig and txid being stripped for safety against replays was discussed. However, this method is not safe enough as it does not account for multiple scriptPubKeys per transaction. This creates problems for Bitcoin today and should not be encouraged. Instead, Luke proposes a scriptPubKey-only sighash type that would provide strong safety in all malleability situations, including CoinJoin and other sender-respends. This would enable advanced wallet software to take advantage of it in the future while strictly enforcing no-reuse on its own wallet to avoid known replays.</summary>
