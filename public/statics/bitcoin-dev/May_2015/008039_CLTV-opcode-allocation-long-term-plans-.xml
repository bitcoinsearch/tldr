    <summary>Btc Drak, a contributor to Bitcoin's repository on Github, proposed an update to the OP_CLTV function in a discussion thread. The proposal was to use '1' to select absolute mode while all others would act as NOPs. The aim was to make the OP_CLTV function more flexible and economically feasible. A future relative CLTV could then be a soft-fork implemented by using '2' instead of '1'. However, this would require rewriting existing tests and example code and updating the BIP. Peter Todd, another contributor, agreed with the proposal and made the necessary changes to the PR in time for the feature freeze.</summary>
