    <summary>The author of the email argues that any proposal to switch to a new hardcoded value for block size would lead to a significant issue later when transitioning to a new solution. This is because the economy built on top of Bitcoin is much larger and the technical specifications of Bitcoin are closer to a freeze. Instead, they suggest focusing on long-term solutions, even if it takes more effort and time right now, as short-term "troubles" are worth it. The author believes in adaptive block size mechanisms, which would place the block size issue as part of the algorithmic contract agreed upon when using Bitcoin. This method has the advantage of being similar to difficulty adaptation or block reward.</summary>
