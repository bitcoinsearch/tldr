    <summary>In this message, Jeff Garzik questions whether Bitcoin development should limit the network's capabilities to leave room for other projects or if Bitcoin should attempt to be the best system possible and let other projects try to keep up. The definition of Bitcoin "success" is not clear-cut, as some people view success as serving as a stable backend for their non-Bitcoin platform without further development. The question remains whether Bitcoin should intentionally limit its capabilities to serve these needs or continue to develop into the best system possible. The message includes a PGP signature and an attachment with a public key.</summary>
