    <summary>In an email conversation between Matt Corallo and Gavin Andresen, the two discussed the implications of Bitcoin miners being predominantly located in China. Corallo suggested that miners in China might create larger blocks which fork off miners in other parts of the world to increase their income. When questioned about why miners choose to leave fee-paying transactions in their mempool and create small blocks, Corallo suggested it was because most miners just go along with defaults. Andresen called for increasing block size to 20MB (and then doubled every couple of years) to increase revenue, but Corallo argued that there is no convincing evidence that at 20MB miners will be able to break even on transaction fees for a long time. Instead, he called for more research and simulation to determine what block size would be best.</summary>
