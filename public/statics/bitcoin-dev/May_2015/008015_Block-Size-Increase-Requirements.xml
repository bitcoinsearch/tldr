    <summary>In an email exchange on May 8th, 2015, Peter Todd discussed the idea of having a "miner" flag for the Bitcoin network. The proposal suggested that clients for general users and merchants would have a less strict rule than the rule for miners. Miners who don't set their miner's flag might get orphaned off the chain. The limits could be set to 20MB for clients and 4MB for miners. When in "miner mode", the client would reject 4MB blocks and wouldn't build on them. Miners would refuse to build on 5MB blocks, but merchants and general users would accept them. This system would allow miners to soft fork the limit at some point in the future. If 75% of miners decided to up the limit to 8MB, then all merchants and the general users would accept the new blocks following standard soft fork rules. Another similar system proposed was where clients track all header trees. Wallets would warn users that there is an invalid tree with over 75% of hashing power, and they might want to upgrade.</summary>
