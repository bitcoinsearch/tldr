    <summary>In an email conversation from May 28, 2015, Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn proposed a change to the default settings of Bitcoin miners. However, Gavin Andresen expressed skepticism towards this idea, stating that it would cause the target to effectively drop from 1mb to 800kb, which is the opposite of what is needed at the time. Andresen believed that by the time a hard fork could happen, the average block size would already be above 500k. He suggested a rule that was "larger of 1MB or 2x average size", which he deemed to be strictly better than the current situation.</summary>
