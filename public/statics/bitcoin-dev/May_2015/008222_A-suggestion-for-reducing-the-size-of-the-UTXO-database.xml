    <summary>It has been reported that some wallets, including Andreas Schildbach's wallet, only allow spending of confirmed Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), causing frustration for users who must wait for confirmation before making payments. However, it has been pointed out that Andreas' wallet does not have this limitation and the issue may be outdated. The only instance where waiting for confirmation is necessary is when there is an unconfirmed inbound transaction from an unknown sender.</summary>
