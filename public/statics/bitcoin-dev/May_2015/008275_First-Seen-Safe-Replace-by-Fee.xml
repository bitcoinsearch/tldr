    <summary>RBF (Replace-by-Fee) applies only to pending transactions in the mempool waiting for incorporation into a block. If the pending transaction is incorporated into a block at the same time that the spender is constructing and publishing a replacement transaction, the replacement transaction would be rejected by the peer network as a double spend because it conflicts with the now confirmed original transaction. Therefore, an implementation that wishes to take advantage of RBF will still need to have a "plan B" implementation path to handle the corner case of a replacement transaction being rejected as a double spend. Pieter Wuille clarifies that allowing the content of blocks to change other than by mining a competing chain would be a significant change to Bitcoin's design.</summary>
