    <summary>In an email discussion, Tier Nolan suggested that deadlines for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be set as block counts rather than using the median time mechanism. The latter mechanism allows hashing power to demonstrate what time they think it is while the nVersion soft-fork mechanism shows what features they want to support. However, block counts are inconvenient for planning since there is no guarantee that they will happen in any particular timeframe. Nolan proposed matching the deadline to a "start-line" and creating a simple table of known BIPs, which would keep multiple users of the bit separate. Peter Todd responded that assuming no large reorganizations, a list of block heights could be used instead of a table, even if the median time mechanism is used.</summary>
