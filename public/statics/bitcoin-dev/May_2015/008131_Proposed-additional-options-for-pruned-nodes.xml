    <summary>In a discussion about block coverage on nodes, Gregory Maxwell proposes an idea that he previously proposed on Bitcointalk. The proposal involves creating a "seed" that initializes a PRNG and dividing the range of all blocks into intervals with exponentially growing size. With this, one out of two intervals of each length would be selected using the PRNG. This way, the node stores these blocks and discards the others. By doing so, contiguous block ranges are obtained, with at most O(log height) breaks. The proposal ensures that no believing anyone is required, and the decision to contact a node needs only communication about the node's seed.</summary>
