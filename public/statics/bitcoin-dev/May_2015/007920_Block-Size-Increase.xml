    <summary>In an email conversation between Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn and others, Hearn expressed his concern about the centralisation of decision-making in the Bitcoin development process. He suggested that if Gavin Andresen (one of the maintainers with equal authority to merge pull requests) wanted to push through a patch that was not agreed upon by others, he could set up a cron job to keep committing the patch, effectively ending any chance for other committers to have a say. However, another developer responded by explaining that commit access does not give permission to merge pull requests without consensus, which is required for any changes to be made to the Bitcoin codebase. The rules for Bitcoin development dictate that patches must have consensus before they can be merged, even for the five maintainers with commit access.</summary>
