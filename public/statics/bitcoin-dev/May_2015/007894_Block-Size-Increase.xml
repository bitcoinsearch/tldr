    <summary>Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are discussing the issue of hardforks in Bitcoin. Mike says that there should be "universally uncontroversial" agreement before a hardfork can occur, while Gavin believes that this is too vague and wants a market to exist prior to subsidies becoming low. They both agree that the Bitcoin network is decentralized and that there is no authority to decide on hardforks. However, they disagree on whether or not it is necessary to wait for "full blocks" to occur before a decision is made. Mike believes that hitting the block size limit will result in technological failure followed by rapid user abandonment, while Gavin argues that this is an opportunity to look into the future. The conversation ends with both parties agreeing that they have made progress in understanding each other's positions.</summary>
