    <summary>In an email exchange between Bitcoin developers, concerns were raised about dropping transactions in a way that is unpredictable to the sender. One developer suggested increasing the blocksize as the more conservative choice. However, another developer argued that transactions are already being dropped indirectly by people and businesses deciding not to use on-chain settlement. Increasing the block size may allow for more utility on-chain but does not fundamentally add more use cases, only more growth space for those already invested in being able to do things on-chain while externalizing costs to others. In terms of implementation, a recommendation was made to have the fork take effect when some specific large supermajority of the previous 1000 blocks indicate they have upgraded, which measures miner adoption. However, the question remains whether people using full nodes will upgrade, as their adoption is more relevant than miner adoption.</summary>
