    <summary>The discussion is focused solely on the block size increase. The concern is that a hard fork would allow for various individuals to insert their "pet feature" into the system, leading to a risky situation for Bitcoin. If it was guaranteed that the only change in the hard fork would be an increase in the block size limit, then support would be given. However, there is fear that a hard fork would be used as an excuse to modify other aspects of the system, leading to unintended and possibly disastrous consequences.</summary>
