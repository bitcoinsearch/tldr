    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Pindar Wong responded to Ricardo Filipe's post regarding miners' equation. Alex Mizrahi had mentioned that if there was a difference in network speed, the miner would be incentivized to invest in their network infrastructure. However, Pindar Wong disagreed with this assumption and stated that investing in internet network infrastructure may not be a free or open market everywhere. Similarly, easy ASIC access, low price electricity, etc are also not free and open markets. Alex Mizrahi had previously mentioned that being on a slow network could lead to a slight disadvantage for miners. He also said that bigger blocks give an orphan rate which is proportional to block size. Therefore, those who make big blocks have a disadvantage. However, Alex also contradicted himself by saying that no, those who make big blocks do not have a disadvantage. This led to the question of whether Alex lied to Chun.</summary>
