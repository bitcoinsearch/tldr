    <summary>In this email thread from 2015, Danny Thorpe raises a concern about the potential for fraudulent payment reversals using RBF (replace-by-fee) in Bitcoin transactions. Peter Todd responds by comparing the cost savings of RBF versus CPFP (child pays for parent) in various scenarios, such as increasing the fee on a single transaction, paying multiple recipients in succession, paying multiple recipients from a multisig wallet, and dust defragmentation. Todd argues that RBF is a significantly cheaper way of paying fees than CPFP, particularly for defragmenting outputs, with cost savings ranging from 30% to 90%.</summary>
