    <summary>In an email exchange, Gavin Andresen discusses the effects of the increase in orphan rate with Alex Mizrahi. The orphan rate increase will go to whoever is producing the 20MB blocks, not the miners. However, this all depends on how the miners are connected. If a miner is on a slow network, they will have a slight disadvantage. Mining profitability involves many equations such as the cost of power, internet cost and connectivity, cost of capital, access to technology other miners don't have, inexpensive labor or rent, inexpensive cooling, ability to use waste heat. An equation with lots of variables has lots of different maximum solutions, and that means better decentralization -- there is less likely to be one perfect place or way to mine.</summary>
