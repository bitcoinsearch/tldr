    <summary>Nicolas Dorier proposed a solution for the block size increase problem in Bitcoin that can be agreed upon without controversy and immediately applicable. The proposal aims to relieve core developers from the role of central bankers and promote decentralization. Dorier argues that decisions should only be taken based on technical and decentralization considerations, not on economic, political, or ideological principles. He suggests using block voting where miners vote for the size of the block they would like to have at the next deadline, and the median of the votes is then implemented as the new block size limit. The proposal addresses all objectives, including increasing the block size limit as demand grows, increasing network capacity and storage, and making Bitcoin what miners want. However, it remains unknown what effect this would have on Bitcoin's core stability or whether a better statistical function is possible. Dorier urges core developers to step out of the banker's role and focus on what they do best.</summary>
