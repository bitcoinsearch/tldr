    <summary>In this email conversation from December 7, 2012, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn discuss the implementation of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for payment requests. The discussion ranges from technical details on how to display payment outputs to more general questions about tipping and the use of root CAs in the system. Although not yet an official BIP, the two developers plan to move forward with prototyping. They also acknowledge that certain details, such as how to split payments or add gratuities, can be addressed later once they have input from potential users like restaurants. On the question of root CAs, Andresen suggests limiting inclusion to those who are authorized to issue EV certificates, but also notes that implementing the proposal will likely reveal additional edge cases to be resolved.</summary>
