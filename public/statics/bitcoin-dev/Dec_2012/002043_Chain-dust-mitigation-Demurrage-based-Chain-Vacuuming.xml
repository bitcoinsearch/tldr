    <summary>The messaging system of a payment protocol spec creates a new 1e-8 output for every losing play. This is not ideal as it can result in multiple outputs being created. However, the payment protocol spec has a solution for this issue. The merchants can reply to customers with text instead of outputs. This way, the customers will receive a message about their loss rather than a new output being created. It is important to use this feature to avoid cluttering the blockchain with unnecessary outputs.</summary>
