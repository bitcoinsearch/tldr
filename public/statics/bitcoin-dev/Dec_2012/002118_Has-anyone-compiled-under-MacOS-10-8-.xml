    <summary>The problem of Boost not playing nicely with default build instructions resurfaced. The solution this time is to add a magic incantation at the top, which may be related to how qmake is being used. To obtain a real makefile instead of an xcode project, qmake has to be run like "gmake -spec macx-g++". This might make gcc stricter than intended. Mike Hearn found that the issue was caused by using an older version of the Qt SDK with the new MacOS version. Reinstalling Qt fixed the problem. On the other hand, Mike had previously requested any recipe that fixes the problem since he could not dig in at that moment.</summary>
