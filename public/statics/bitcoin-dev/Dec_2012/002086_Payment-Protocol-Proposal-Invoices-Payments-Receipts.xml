    <summary>The author, Andreas, is discussing the need for a method to exchange public keys before or during a payment request in order to generate a common multisig address. The question posed is whether this should be handled in a different protocol or included in the current specification. Additionally, the author wonders if there is a way for the customer to verify that the specified BIP16 Output contains their address and that of an escrow service.</summary>
