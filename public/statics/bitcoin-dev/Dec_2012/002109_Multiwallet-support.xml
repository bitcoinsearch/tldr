    <summary>The developer proposes to add multiple wallet capabilities and specify upon creation whether a wallet is a full signing wallet or watch-only wallet. Disabling signing and privkey export operations for watch-only addresses is necessary but disabling them only for some keys in a wallet would complicate CreateTransaction logic, so adding multiple wallet support is proposed. Adding the ability to specify multiple wallets with associated names and passphrases in the config file should be straightforward. Exposing multiple wallets via RPC will be tricky as the existing RPC is not designed to support multiple wallets. To avoid breaking compatibility with existing RPC calls, a main wallet which is always used as the default wallet can be implemented. A whole separate set of calls that require a wallet name and passphrase (if the wallet is encrypted) may need to be created. The developer welcomes proposals or suggestions on how this should be done.</summary>
