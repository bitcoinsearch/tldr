    <summary>The discussion thread starts with a comment on the continuation of the conversation and suggests implementing a prototype version. The payment URI requirement is discussed with respect to Tor hidden service, where it is recommended that merchants use an encrypted connection. The behavior for paying more than the requested amount, such as a tip, is also suggested. The receiptURI is suggested to be replaced by receipt_url, which should be resolvable. The proposed outputs are questioned as to whether it is necessary to display them to the user directly. UI TODO is agreed upon but suggested to be taken out of the BIP and made into an alternative document. The root CAs and maximum number of certificates in a chain are also discussed. Finally, Mike Hearn approves the suggestion of keeping the signature field required.</summary>
