    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of more anonymity-based features in Armory, a Bitcoin wallet. The developer explains that while he is not against anonymity or privacy, his goal was to produce a versatile client, not one focused on any one aspect. However, a suggestion is made to maintain a clustering of already-linked addresses, which could be useful for hardcore SD players who have a lot of one-satoshi outputs that could use vacuuming. Another participant points out that privacy is essential because the market demands it, and if Bitcoin doesn't do it well, then eventually a competitor will do it better, potentially leading to the end of Bitcoin. The distinction between anonymity and privacy is also discussed, with privacy being a feature of the system and anonymity being less useful in certain cases. Mixing up the two concepts can lead to confusion from users when asked to provide ID proofs when trying to buy Bitcoins from an exchange.</summary>
