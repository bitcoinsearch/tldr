    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list revolves around the user experience of the SPV client, MultiBit. There is an expectation that Bitcoin needs to surpass PayPal and credit cards in order for people to give it a second chance. SPV clients provide an "instant-on" experience, which tends to encourage users to explore further into the economic theory behind Bitcoin. Many decide to install the full node out of a sense of community contribution to the security of the network.It is suggested that having a hybrid mode of SPV first then full node second should be something that a user has control over since it is their computing resources being used. However, there is a divergence of opinion on whether there is any real risk to the centralization of the network by promoting a SPV (purely-consuming) node to brand-new users. A sampling of the types of people wanting to use Bitcoin but having some difficulty was collected from Facebook. Most issues don't have to do with the SPV versus non-SPV problem; they're either based on misconceptions about Bitcoin as a whole or computer problems. It is suggested that before switching to another, reduced security model client, efforts should be made to improve the Bitcoin experience with full security model. Efforts are underway to improve the Satoshi client, but open-source development may not always go as fast as users would like. The current experience is believed to be really poor, and there is concern that users will be deterred if they wait a day for the full node to synchronize and then run into issues such as blkindex.dat corruption.The context also mentions a tool called Rescue that enables IT professionals to remotely access PCs and mobile devices, allowing them to provide instant support and improve efficiency. The tool aims to focus on delivering more value-add services, while still delivering what IT professionals know.
