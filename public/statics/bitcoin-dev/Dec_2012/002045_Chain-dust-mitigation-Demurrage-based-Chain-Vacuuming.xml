    <summary>One suggestion to improve Bitcoin's anonymity is to clean up dust from any address by default, with the option for users to disable that behavior. Armory already does this, but it was never implemented in bitcoinj. However, this may not be necessary over the long term as a successful payment protocol could stop the primary cause of dust accumulation, SatoshiDice. It's important to distinguish between "anonymity" and "privacy." While anonymity was never a core feature of the network, privacy is supposed to be. Users demand privacy, and mixing up the two concepts can lead to confusion. For example, when trying to buy Bitcoins from an exchange and asked to provide ID proofs. Therefore, it's important to carefully separate the two concepts to avoid public relations issues and user confusion.</summary>
