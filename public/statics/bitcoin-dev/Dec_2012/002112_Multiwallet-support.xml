    <summary>The conversation starts with an idea proposed by someone and the other person responds positively, stating that they are close to something similar. Then a suggestion is made for an rpc (remote procedure call) that generalizes all the rpcs. The discussion then moves on to how rpcs that don't make sense should return an error instead of being deactivated and how sendtoaddress on a watching wallet should return an unsigned raw transaction and a wallet-specific message that tells you where to find the private key. It's mentioned that while compatibility should not be broken, it shouldn't get in the way of doing the feature right.</summary>
