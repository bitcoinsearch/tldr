    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent developer in the Bitcoin community, has updated the PaymentRequest spec once again. The spec has been renamed to PaymentRequest/PaymentACK and now includes a 'network' field for differentiating between testnet and main network payment requests. The description for PaymentRequest.outputs has also been updated to clarify how payments are split among multiple outputs. In regards to escrow/multisig, Andresen suggests that it will require its own set of messages and should be left for a future specification. He briefly outlines the process for setting up a multi-person escrow, but believes it should only be tackled after the customer-pays-merchant flow is working smoothly.</summary>
