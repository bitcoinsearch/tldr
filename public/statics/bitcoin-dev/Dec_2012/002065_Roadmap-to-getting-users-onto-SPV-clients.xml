    <summary>The proposal for Alan's UTxO meta-chain has become easier to implement with the merger of ultraprune. This would allow the Satoshi client to determine its wallet balance and operate with a &gt;=SPV level of security during the initial block download, keeping users on the path to becoming a full node. It is suggested that bitcoin.org should only recommend an SPV-only client when it is being accessed from a mobile device. Mike Hearn proposes that instead of recommending the full client, users should be presented with a choice of wallet apps A or B. He suggests that MultiBit is maturing into a client that he would feel comfortable recommending to end users who take the fast-start path. The alternative is to make Bitcoin-Qt have an SPV mode, but this may not be the best use of time.</summary>
