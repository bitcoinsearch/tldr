    <summary>On December 6, 2012, Andreas Petersson discussed the need for a method to exchange public keys before or during the payment request process in order to generate a common multisig address. He questioned whether this should be handled in a different protocol or included in the current specification. He also asked about the possibility of a customer verifying that the specified BIP16 Output contains their address and that of an escrow service. While escrow/multisig can be complicated, having a payment protocol is an important step towards it. The email was posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
