    <summary>In an email conversation dated December 3, 2012, Andreas Petersson discussed potential features for a user interface that would allow users to switch between different coin selection policies. These options would include minimizing fees, maximizing privacy, defragmentation, and a general "I don't care" option. While Petersson thought this feature would be useful for personal use, he did not believe it would have a significant impact on the network's overall behavior. He emphasized the importance of having strong default settings in place, especially for small details like these.</summary>
