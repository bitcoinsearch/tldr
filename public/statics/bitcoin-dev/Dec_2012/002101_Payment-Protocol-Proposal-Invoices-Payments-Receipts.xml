    <summary>In this email thread from 2012, members of a technical community are discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using textual versus binary formats for data structures. One member suggests that a move to textual representation, specifically JSON, would make standards more accessible for developers. However, another member argues that JSON has significant disadvantages when it comes to creating precise data structures and that a middle layer would be needed to ensure consistency. The discussion then turns to the possibility of canonicalization algorithms for JSON, which could potentially solve some of these issues.</summary>
