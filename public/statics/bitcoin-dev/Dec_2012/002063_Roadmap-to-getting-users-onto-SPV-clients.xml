    <summary>The discussion is about the ideal first client for new Bitcoin users. The ideal client should be usable within a couple of minutes, support Windows, Linux and OSX and have deterministic wallets that can produce a permanent backup, preferably on paper. Encryption is also important but not necessary for new users who are not holding a lot of coins as long as they are aware of the risks associated with it. It is crucial for users to have a clear way to back up their coins to offline media or paper. MultiBit is considered an excellent choice for these features, although there are concerns about its staffing if it becomes the de facto client for new users. Bitcoin.org currently recommends downloading the full client, which may turn away potential users. There needs to be a roadmap or plan for presenting users with more wallet app options. MultiBit is seen as maturing into a client that could be recommended to end-users who take the fast-start path, though it still has some serious lacks such as encrypted wallets and catching up with newer features. There doesn't necessarily have to be one true client, and Bitcoin-Qt could potentially have an SPV mode. The discussion ends with a question posed to everyone on their thoughts regarding this matter.</summary>
