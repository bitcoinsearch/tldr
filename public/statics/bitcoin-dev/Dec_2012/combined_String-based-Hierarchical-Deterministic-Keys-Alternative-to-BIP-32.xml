    <summary>In 2012, Mike Koss proposed an alternative to the BIP32 proposal for a deterministic wallet system. His proposal was based on a hierarchical string representation and involved naming keys using a specific format. However, Pieter raised concerns about the proposed system, pointing out that blindly iterating through strings is not realistically possible and could result in losing the backup recoverability property of a deterministic wallet.Pieter further explained that maintaining a complete backup of the hierarchical string representation was essential to avoid losing any coins associated with it. In contrast, backing up a map equating the hdwallet indexes to strings in the BIP32 scheme would allow for no loss of coins (only metadata) in the event of a catastrophic loss where only the original ultimate root is left.Moreover, Mike's extended hierarchy of multipliers raised some concerns regarding the security and reliability of the proposed system. In contrast, the BIP32 scheme uses a HMAC in its construction to obtain strongly unstructured points, which ensures better security and reliability.However, Watson Ladd discussed the implications of being able to spend a coin sent to an address generated by a scheme and explained that it implies being able to spend any coin generated by the same scheme. Having only the plain ecdsa secret is not enough to spend anything but that specific address. Ladd then went on to discuss the construction of deterministic wallets, suggesting that using a stream cipher to generate random bytes for private keys in a wallet is the easiest method. However, he noted that this method does not add any additional benefits other than distinguishing transactions by sending to unique addresses, which could be done through other means.In response to a question about serializing points using a compressed format before going into the hash function, Pieter Wuille suggests standardizing on just compressed keys since they take less space in the blockchain and there is no additional value in uncompressed keys.Overall, while Mike's proposal had some merits, the concerns raised by Pieter highlight the importance of considering these issues when developing deterministic wallet systems. It is essential to ensure that the proposed system offers better security and reliability, and maintaining complete backups is vital to avoid losing any coins associated with it. Furthermore, using compressed keys is a better option as they take less space in the blockchain.</summary>
