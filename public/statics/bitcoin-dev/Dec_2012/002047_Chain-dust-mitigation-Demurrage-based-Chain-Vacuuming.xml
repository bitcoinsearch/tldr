    <summary>The email thread discusses the importance of separating "anonymity" from "privacy" in Bitcoin. The writer argues that privacy is a feature demanded by users, as outlined in Satoshi's paper. Anonymity, on the other hand, may not always be necessary or useful. The mixing up of the two concepts can lead to confusion for users, particularly in situations involving identity verification. Another writer agrees and adds that privacy is essential for Bitcoin's success, and if it fails to provide it well, competitors will arise. The debate about whether privacy was a core feature is deemed pointless.</summary>
