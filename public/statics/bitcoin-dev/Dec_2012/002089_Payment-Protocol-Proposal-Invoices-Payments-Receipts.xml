    <summary>The discussion starts with a suggestion to make the signature over the serialized protobuf minus the signature field instead of concatenation for better efficiency. The topic then transitions into designing an "EscrowEstablished message" or "mediation" system that includes a mediator proposal, which allows the seller to choose a mediator to resolve any disputes. It is suggested that mediation should be integrated with payment requests rather than having a separate message to maintain backward compatibility. Older clients would ignore the data they don't recognize while newer clients would ask the user to select a mediator if they want to use mediation. The payment protocol is considered a living document that can be amended by BIPs.</summary>
