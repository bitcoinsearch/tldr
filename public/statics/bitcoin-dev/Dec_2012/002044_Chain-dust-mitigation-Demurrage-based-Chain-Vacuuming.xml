    <summary>In an email exchange from 12/03/2012, Gregory Maxwell recommended making client software more aggressive about sweeping up dust inputs. The recommendation was to add extra inputs, smallest to largest, until an additional one would increase the cost of the transaction by 0.0001 BTC or more, without harming privacy. Armory already uses this logic to clean up dust outputs in user transactions, but there are enough conditions on it that it may not trigger often. The current condition is that if a transaction has less than five inputs, and there exist dust UTXOs from addresses already included in the transaction that are sufficiently small in priority, then Armory will add them to the input side and increase the change accordingly. The last condition of ensuring that the transaction already has a change output was lost in recent code reorganization. Alan suggested improving the process by cleaning up dust from any address by default, not just ones already included in the transaction. He proposed that anonymity wasn't a core feature of the network, and it made sense that the logic would reduce anonymity by default in exchange for a cleaner network. He further argued that most users don't actually care about anonymity and that the option should be available for those who do.</summary>
