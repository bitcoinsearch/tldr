    <summary>The conversation discusses various aspects of using protocols for payment requests, such as protobuf and JSON. It is suggested that sending an unsigned payment request via email may leave too much to chance, and other secure channels could be used instead. One idea proposed is the use of identities for communication rather than payment addresses, with encryption and signing being built into the system. The conversation also touches on the use of merchant_data, which allows for state to be stored within the invoice without the need for database lookups. Finally, it is suggested that a signed PaymentACK could be used as proof of payment, while a PaymentRequest and transactions would only prove that payment was made.</summary>
