    <summary>One user has noticed a few transactions that have zero-length input and/or output scripts. There are a couple of examples in block 0000000000000159a27442ee8b7f9ffad0cd799b003eafe007de9fbb47bd6ce7. The second transaction is particularly interesting as its output script is OP_HASH256 followed by the hash of the genesisblock hash. If someone can create something that, when hashed with sha256 yields the genesisblock hash, they can claim one BTC. This task is easy enough to do, but non-standard transactions are not relayed between standard clients. So only miners can create a transaction redeeming this 1BTC. It is speculated that perhaps Eligius creating that block might be playing a little Christmas game.</summary>
