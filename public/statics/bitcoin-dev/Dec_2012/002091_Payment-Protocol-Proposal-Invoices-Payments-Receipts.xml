    <summary>In an email exchange on December 6th, 2012, Gavin Andresen proposed a modification to the specifications regarding the digital signature over a protocol buffer serialized variation of the SignedPaymentRequest message. Mike Hearn suggested that the signature be made over the serialized protobuf minus the signature field, which would require less code. However, Andresen wanted to keep the signature field required and suggested making the signature over the serialized protobuf minus the signature field, with fields serialized in numerical order and using the public key in pki_data. He also noted that tags must be ordered, even though all implementations should already do that.</summary>
