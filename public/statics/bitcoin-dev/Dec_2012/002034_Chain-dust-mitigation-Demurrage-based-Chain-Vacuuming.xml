    <summary>In an email exchange from 2012, Michael Gronager and Pieter Wuille debated on the possibility of changing Bitcoin's policy. Gronager argued that implementing changes without planning ahead would go against what users initially signed up for when they started using the system. He also believed that changing policies would not be possible without a hard fork which would require at least 1-2 years of planning. On the other hand, Wuille disagreed with Gronager, stating that miners only have the power to decide the order of transactions and have no ability to control the rules for validity themselves. The rules that prevent double spending and monetary inflation are deliberately not left to miners.</summary>
