    <summary>The conversation between Mike Hearn and Will on the Bitcoin-development mailing list discusses the need for a better way to present Bitcoin wallet options to users. Currently, bitcoin.org recommends downloading the full client, which can be off-putting to some users. Will suggests directing users to a vetted list of cloud services as an alternative option with a lower entry cost than any client. He mentions that providers like blockchain.info seem well-engineered and offer low-cost entry, cross-platform support, and good security features such as two-factor authentication. Mike agrees that it's time to present users with something other than the full client and proposes presenting users with a fast-start path by recommending wallet apps A or B. He believes MultiBit is maturing into a client that he would feel comfortable recommending to end-users who take the fast-start path, but there doesn't have to be a one true client. The alternative is to make Bitcoin-Qt have an SPV mode, but Mike is not convinced this is the best use of time. MultiBit has unique features like integrating charting and exchange rate feeds that are quite useful. In conclusion, the discussion highlights the need to improve the presentation of Bitcoin wallet options to users and offers suggestions for alternative options such as cloud services and fast-start paths with recommended wallet apps.</summary>
