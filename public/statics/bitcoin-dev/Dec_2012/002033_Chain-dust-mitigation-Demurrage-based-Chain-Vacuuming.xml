    <summary>The author of this post expresses concern about changing the policy of Bitcoin as it may not be what people signed up for when they started using the system. Additionally, implementing a change would require planning at least 1-2 years in advance and could only be done through a hard fork. The author also notes that the economic landscape of Bitcoin may be vastly different by that time. However, the author agrees with changing the mining policy to prioritize transactions that reduce the number of UTXOs. They suggest adjusting the relay fee so that transactions that increase the number of UTXOs pay extra, while those that reduce it pay less. This could help to prevent dust spam and control the growth of UTXOs. The author suggests that clients should not be punished for getting rid of dust and that clients should be rewritten to do this automatically.</summary>
