    <summary>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient on December 3, 2012, the topic of 1 Satoshi payouts was discussed. The main source for these payouts was identified as being Satoshi Dice. However, it was clarified that these payouts were not due to people making 1 satoshi bets but rather part of Satoshi Dice's messaging system. Every losing play on Satoshi Dice results in a new 1e-8 output being created, which explains the prevalence of 1 Satoshi payouts. This information provides insight into how Satoshi Dice's messaging system operates and sheds light on the mechanics behind their payouts.</summary>
