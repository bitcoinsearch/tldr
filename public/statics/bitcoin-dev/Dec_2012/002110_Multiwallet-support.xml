    <summary>Eric Lombrozo proposed a new feature to allow watch-only addresses in wallets, but it will require disabling signing and privkey export operations for watch-only addresses. To integrate this feature into bitcoin, multiple wallet capabilities will need to be added, and upon creation, the wallet can be specified as a full signing wallet or a watch-only wallet. Exposing multiple wallets via RPC will be tricky since the existing RPC is not designed to support multiple wallets. A separate set of calls will be required that require a wallet name and passphrase if the wallet is encrypted. A proposal was made to have an RPC like "usewallet" that generalizes all the RPCs and instead of explicitly deactivating RPCs that don't make sense, simply have them return an error. Breaking compatibility should not get in the way of implementing this desirable feature.</summary>
