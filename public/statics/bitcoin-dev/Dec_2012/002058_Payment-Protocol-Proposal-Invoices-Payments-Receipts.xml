    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeff Garzik suggested that data should not need to be escaped or unescaped if it is not being interpreted in any way. However, it has been pointed out that most low-level links on the internet use bit-stuffing or byte-stuffing to escape certain sequences. The suitability of this method for the case at hand is not being agreed or disagreed upon, but the statement made by Garzik is not an absolute truth. The use of a terminator for variable-length data structures, instead of a length prefix, is a design choice that is not related to the text-versus-binary debate. Finally, the concept of Holerith constants is brought up as a reference.</summary>
