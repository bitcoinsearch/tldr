    <summary>In a discussion thread on 2012-12-21, Stephen Pair made an important distinction between "identity" and "trust-based identity". He stated that while identity is one thing, an elaborate trust based identity verification system (like CA's) is a whole other thing. This insight was praised by the participants in the thread. Pair also suggested that the first task at hand is to implement secure, private messaging, as it is easy to do and does not require solving the PKI problem.</summary>
