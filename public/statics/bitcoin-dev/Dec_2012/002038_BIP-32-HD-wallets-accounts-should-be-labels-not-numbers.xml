    <summary>In a 2012 email correspondence between Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, and Amir Taaki, the latter suggested that allowing users to input labels instead of numbers for account categorization in wallets would be more practical. However, Wuille explained that the current system assigns incrementing numbers to accounts in order to allow for disaster recovery and detect new accounts that come into use. He did suggest adding the ability for "non-standard derivations" using arbitrary strings, as long as recoverability is not compromised.</summary>
