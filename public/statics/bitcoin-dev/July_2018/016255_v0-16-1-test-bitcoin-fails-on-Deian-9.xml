    <summary>The email is a report of an issue encountered by Shigeya Suzuki on src/test/test_bitcoin when using Debian 9. The same test ran successfully on other platforms such as OS X High Sierra 10.13.6 and Ubuntu 16.04. Configuration 2 caused a core dump which Suzuki believes is due to toolchain differences. Marco responded that the issue was a known problem in test code only compiled during debugging and would be fixed in the upcoming 0.16.2 and 0.17.0 releases. Additionally, he provided a link to the Bitcoin Core code base issue tracker for technical issues.</summary>
