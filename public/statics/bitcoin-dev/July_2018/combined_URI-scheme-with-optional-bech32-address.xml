    <summary>A team of developers is working on a walleting application to generate bech32 and P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH addresses. The issue they face is that the payee cannot know in advance the technological capabilities of the payer. To solve this, the team proposed encoding both addresses in a Bitcoin URI, with legacy wallets only seeing the P2SH address and new wallets able to see and use the bech32 address for transactions. The assumption is that wallets using this scheme will monitor incoming transactions on both addresses. To keep compatibility with BIP21, the 'path' field of the URI can be used for the P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH address, while a new field (e.g. 'bech32') can be used for the bech32 address.The proposal for the adoption of bech32 QR codes in the Bitcoin network has been shared on Reddit. However, bech32 QR codes are not backward compatible, so many merchants and exchanges are opting for P2SH address QR codes instead. The proposed solution is a URI format which includes both bech32 and P2SH address options, allowing wallets to autopay using the lower transaction fee associated with bech32 addresses. If there is increased usage of bech32, it could create a network effect and ultimately lead to widespread adoption of bech32 QR codes.The team did not find any proposals addressing the same issue and is asking if anyone has already proposed something similar and if there are any major drawbacks to their proposal. The order of attributes should remain irrelevant, with clients checking all attributes of the same name. It is unclear if there is any precedence for the multiple use of an attribute in URI schemes. Overall, the proposal aims to make it easier for users to receive payments regardless of the technological capabilities of the payer and increase adoption of bech32 addresses in the Bitcoin network.</summary>
