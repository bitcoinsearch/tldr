    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tim Ruffing suggested that what was being proposed was already possible with Schnorr signatures. The BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) titled "Multisignatures and Threshold Signatures" also describes this concept. It is worth noting that Schnorr signatures have been gaining traction in the Bitcoin community as they offer advantages over the currently used ECDSA signatures in terms of efficiency, security and flexibility. This proposal would allow for more advanced multisignature transactions where multiple parties can securely sign off on a transaction without revealing their private keys to each other.</summary>
