    <summary>On July 10, 2018, Cory Fields sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list asking for input on what times developers are generally available to meet online. He created a poll so that developers could vote on the best time for weekly IRC meetings. The day of the week (Thursday) was fixed for now. The initial list of voters was based on previous meeting participation; however, if someone regularly attends the weekly meetings but did not receive a link to vote, they were encouraged to reply or ping Cory on IRC to be added. Polling will conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19th. The email included links to the mailing list and the poll.</summary>
