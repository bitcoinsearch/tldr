    <summary>On July 3rd, 2018, Rusty Russell started a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a new sighash flag called 'SIGHASH_NOINPUT'. Christian Decker had proposed this flag earlier as it would remove the commitment to the previous transaction output and make smart contracts more efficient. Gregory Maxwell and Rusty Russell both agreed that the name of the flag should be something like "SIGHASH_REPLAY_VULNERABLE" or "SIGHASH_WEAK_REPLAYABLE". However, some members pointed out that these names do not convey the actual function of the flag. There was also a concern raised about what name should be given to a future flag if it is replay vulnerable. Peter Todd provided his signature and his website link at the end of the email.</summary>
