    <summary>In an email exchange, Russell O'Connor suggested adding a note that the HRP (human-readable part) should be specified in lowercase or at least mention that uppercase and lowercase HRPs are considered equivalent and will be canonicalized to lowercase during validation. The HRP is required to contain 1 to 83 US-ASCII characters, with each character having a value in the range of 33-126, and its validity may be further restricted by specific applications. Bech32 forbids mixed-case and converts everything to lowercase, so it is good to warn against using uppercase in the HRP. While the BIP is marked as final, this would not be a normative change.</summary>
