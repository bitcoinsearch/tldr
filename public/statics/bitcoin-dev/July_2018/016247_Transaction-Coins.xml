    <summary>A proposal for deriving digital scarcity from bitcoin transactions is being considered, where coins are created based on the hash closest to the non-zero portion of the block hash. This results in only one coin per transaction, regardless of the size, and n coins per block. The existing blockchain can fully determine the initial coin supply and addresses, making them scarce as they can only be produced by transactions. There are also variants, such as creating computation puzzles from the previous block. The author seeks feedback on whether others have seen a similar method.</summary>
