    <summary>There has been a suggestion to standardize file names used when creating .psbt files to ensure reliability and avoid collisions. This would involve using an 8 character trim of the hash of the unsigned transaction, followed by the role that created the file (such as 'Signer'), and then a 4 character trim of the hash of data unique to that role (such as 'partial sig'). The purpose of this would be to help the combiner have a better understanding of the files they have. This suggestion was made by Jason Les.</summary>
