    <title>A BIP proposal for segwit addresses</title>

    <summary>In an email conversation, Pieter was advised to add a section to the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) that stated that the Human Readable Part (HRP) in the proposal should be lowercase. The HRP is intended to convey the type of data to the reader and can contain 1 to 83 US-ASCII characters. Each character must have a value in the range [33-126], but its validity may further be restricted by specific applications. The email also suggested warning against using uppercase in the HRP, as Bech32 forbids mixed-case and converts everything to lowercase. Although this change wouldn't be normative, it's good to include it in the BIP.</summary>
