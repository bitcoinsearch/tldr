    <summary>In an email exchange on Monday, July 2nd, 2018, Gregory Maxwell suggested that the formal name of a flag should be changed to something like "SIGHASH_REPLAY_VULNERABLE" or "SIGHASH_WEAK_REPLAYABLE" in order to highlight the insecurity of using the noinput feature for traditional applications. Luke disagreed with this suggestion, stating that address reuse is undefined behavior and should not be assumed to be safe or functional. Furthermore, Luke stated his intention to use SIGHASH_NOINPUT for ordinary Bitcoin transactions in a wallet he was working on, which explicitly does not support address reuse.</summary>
