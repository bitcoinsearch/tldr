    <summary>A poll has been created by Cory Fields for regular Bitcoin Core contributors to determine their availability to meet online. The poll is meant for scheduling the weekly IRC meetings to a time that would exclude fewer people. The meeting is unrelated to the research and discussion of Bitcoin itself but open to all. The polling began with an initial list of voters based on previous meeting participation, but if someone regularly attends the weekly meetings or can't attend at the current time, they can reply or ping Cory on IRC to be added to the list. The polling will conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19th. Cory Fields sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list requesting input on what times developers are generally available to meet online. He created a poll so that developers could vote on the best time for weekly IRC meetings. The day of the week (Thursday) was fixed for now. The email included links to the mailing list and the poll. The initial list of voters was based on previous meeting participation; however, if someone regularly attends the weekly meetings but did not receive a link to vote, they were encouraged to reply or ping Cory on IRC to be added. Anyone who regularly attends the weekly meetings or could attend at a different time but did not receive a link to vote was requested to reply to the email or ping Cory on IRC so they could be added to the list. A link to vote will be sent by civs at cs.cornell.edu, and the polling will conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19. If someone is interested in becoming a regular contributor to Bitcoin Core, they can refer to the Contributing doc provided in the email.</summary>
