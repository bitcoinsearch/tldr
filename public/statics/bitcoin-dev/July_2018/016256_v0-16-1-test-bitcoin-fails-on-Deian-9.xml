    <summary>Shigeya Suzuki reported observing a strange result when running src/test/test_bitcoin on Debian 9. The issue was not seen when the test was run on OS X High Sierra 10.13.6 or Ubuntu 16.04. Configuration 2 caused a core dump while running 264 test cases. Marco Falke via bitcoin-dev acknowledged that this was a known issue in test code that is only compiled when debugging. He assured that it will be fixed in the upcoming 0.16.2 and 0.17.0 releases. The technical issues related to the Bitcoin Core code base are tracked on their issue tracker. Shigeya Suzuki had doubts if the issue was due to toolchain differences.</summary>
