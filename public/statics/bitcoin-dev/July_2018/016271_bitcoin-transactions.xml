    <summary>The context talks about a web interface called https://peersm.com/wallet, which is for https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-transactions. The tool seems to be the only online tool that converts bech32 addresses and allows users to convert from any address to any address. It can also decode redeem scripts and create transactions. However, it is not advised to use private keys on this platform yet. Electrum wallet users have reported invalid bech32 addresses, which might be a result of bech32 confusion. The author provides links to other projects, including Bitcoin wallets made simple, Zcash wallets made simple, Peersm, torrent-live, node-Tor, and GitHub.</summary>
