    <summary>In an email exchange between Erik Aronesty and Pieter Wuille, Aronesty shared his idea of a non-interactive construction that can produce multisig signatures offline. The construction involves each device producing a signature using its own k-share and x-share, with only the interpolation of M of n shares being necessary. The security of the construction is based on Shamir and discrete log, and Aronesty believes it to be useful due to its ability to fix the need to be online. Pieter Wuille expressed interest in the idea but cautioned against including novel cryptography in Bitcoin without a more complete writeup.</summary>
