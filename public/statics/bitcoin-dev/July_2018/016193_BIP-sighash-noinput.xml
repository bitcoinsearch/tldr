    <summary>Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin developer, has expressed concerns about the use of the noinput flag and has proposed that it should be named "SIGHASH_REPLAY_VULNERABLE" or "SIGHASH_WEAK_REPLAYABLE". He believes that wallets may use this flag without realizing that funds could be lost if a third party reuses a script pubkey. While the use of noinput is secure for special protocols where mistakes are unlikely, it is materially insecure for traditional applications. Maxwell supports using the _unsafe suffix suggested by jb55 to signal the danger of using noinput. He also suggests marking all non-sighash_all sighashes as unsafe or communicating the danger on a higher level through documentation.</summary>
