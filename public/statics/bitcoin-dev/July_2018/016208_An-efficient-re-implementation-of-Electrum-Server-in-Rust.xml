    <summary>Roman Zeyde has developed a project that allows users to run their own Electrum server with hardware resources not much beyond those of a full node. The code and usage instructions can be found on GitHub. The server indexes the entire Bitcoin blockchain, enabling fast queries for any given user wallet, allowing the user to keep real-time track of his balances and transaction history using the Electrum wallet. With no need for the wallet to communicate with external Electrum servers, the privacy of the user's addresses and balances is preserved. The project supports the latest Electrum protocol, maintains an index of transaction inputs and outputs for fast balance queries, has low CPU and memory usage, and low index storage overhead. It also relies on a local full node for transaction retrieval and uses a single RocksDB database for better consistency and crash recovery. The project uses the `rust-bitcoin` library for efficient serialization/deserialization of Bitcoin transactions. The mempool tracker allows better fee estimation.</summary>
