    <summary>The links provided in the context are related to fixing graphics. The graphics being referred to are not scalable bitmap/png and have broken capitalization, making them difficult to edit plaintext for git. To provide an example of how to fix the issue with the graphics, the user is encouraged to view a suggestion on ShareLaTex. In addition to this, there is a non-text attachment called 'signature.asc' that serves as an OpenPGP digital signature. Overall, the main focus of the context is to address the issue with the graphics that are not scalable and have broken capitalization. The suggested solution can be found on ShareLaTex, which provides an example of how to fix the problem. Additionally, the inclusion of 'signature.asc' highlights the importance of using OpenPGP digital signatures to ensure data security and integrity.</summary>
