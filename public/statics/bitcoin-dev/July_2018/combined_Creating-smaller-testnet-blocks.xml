    <summary>Developers are working on a bitcoin wallet that can handle "free pressure" properly, but progress has been hindered due to the absence of a fee market on testnet. To address this issue, it has been suggested that the size of tesnet blocks should be reduced so they don't mine the entire mempool each block. This change could be implemented by adjusting the default mining maxBlockWeight to 50% of the current mempool weight. While some miners may not use the new default, it would still be beneficial for testing and aiding wallet developers with fixing issues such as stuck transactions. Overall, this adjustment could help in testing and aiding the development of the bitcoin wallet.</summary>
