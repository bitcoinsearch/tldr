    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty proposed changing the "e" term in the Schnorr algorithm to hash of message (elligator style) to the power of r instead of using concatenation. However, he had a question on how to compute s = x*e if e is an element of group G and also how to verify if e is an element of G. In response to this, Tim informed that a threshold signature scheme for Schnorr signatures already exists which makes it possible to achieve what Erik was proposing. He shared a link to a document on the same which provides further information on the topic.</summary>
