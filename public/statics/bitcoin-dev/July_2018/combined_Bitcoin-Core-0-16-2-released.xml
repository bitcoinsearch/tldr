Existing wallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this. Compatibility information is also included, stating that Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. However, Windows XP is not supported, and it should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.The change log for version 0.16.2 includes fixes for wallet issues, RPC and other APIs, GUI, build system, and tests and QA.
