    <title>Weekly IRC Meeting Time Poll</title>

    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, requesting that participants take part in a poll to ascertain when they are available for online meetings. The data obtained will be used to potentially move the weekly IRC meetings to a time that would exclude fewer people, according to last week's meeting. A link to vote will be sent by civs at cs.cornell.edu and the day of the week (Thursday) is fixed for now. The initial list of voters is based on previous meeting attendance, but if regular attendees have not received a link within the next hour, they should reply to the post or contact the poster on IRC. Polling will conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19.</summary>
