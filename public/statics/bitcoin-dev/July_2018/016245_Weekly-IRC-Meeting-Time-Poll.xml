    <summary>A poll has been created by Cory Fields for regular Bitcoin Core contributors to determine their availability to meet online. The poll is meant for scheduling the weekly IRC meetings to a time that would exclude fewer people. The meeting is unrelated to the research and discussion of Bitcoin itself, but it is open to all. The initial list of voters is based on previous meeting participation, but if someone regularly attends the weekly meetings or can't attend at the current time, they can reply or ping Cory on IRC to be added to the list. The polling will conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19th. If someone is interested in becoming a regular contributor to Bitcoin Core, they can refer to the Contributing doc provided in the email.</summary>
