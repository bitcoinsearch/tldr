    <summary>Shigeya Suzuki reported strange results when running src/test/test_bitcoin on Debian 9. Test cases were conducted on three platforms including OS X High Sierra 10.13.6, Debian 9 and Ubuntu 16.04. The first two platforms were tested with ./configure --enable-debug and the third one was tested with ./configure --with-debug --disable-wallet. Configuration 2 caused a core dump while others did not. The error message displayed during configuration 2 test cases revealed that it may have been due to toolchain differences.</summary>
