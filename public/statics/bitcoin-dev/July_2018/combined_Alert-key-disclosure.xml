    <summary>The Bitcoin alert system has been retired after vulnerabilities were discovered during a code inspection prior to the release of the Alert Key. The vulnerabilities in the alert system could allow an attacker with an Alert Key to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on nodes that still support the Alert system by sending large alerts or filling the map with many integers causing the node to run out of memory and crash. Less than 4% of Bitcoin nodes are vulnerable, and the Bitcoin Core developers have created a "final alert" that overrides all previous alerts and displays a fixed "URGENT: Alert key compromised, upgrade required" message on all vulnerable software.However, the final alert can be cancelled due to the order of actions when processing an alert. To mitigate the risks associated with the vulnerabilities, the Bitcoin Core developers have decided to retire the system and disclose its keys. The risks to those nodes affected by the vulnerabilities are minor, and the Bitcoin Core developers believe that it is safe to publish the Alert Key.Altcoins that still use the Alert system are recommended to limit the number of alerts, the size of setCancel and setSubVer, and only allow one final alert altogether. Outdated node software is still vulnerable, but a patch on top of Bitcoin Core 0.11 fixes these issues. Bryan Bishop and Andrew Chow authored the disclosure regarding the vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin alert system. They also proposed not disclosing private keys in WIF format to prevent users from importing and reusing them in their wallet key circulation.</summary>
