    <summary>On July 9, 2018, Erik Aronesty sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list in which he discussed Schnorr construction and its security assumptions. He mentioned that there is a need for a new Schnorr-based signature scheme that can match the original construction more closely in terms of security assumptions. However, it was not clear from his message what exactly this new scheme would be compared to.</summary>
