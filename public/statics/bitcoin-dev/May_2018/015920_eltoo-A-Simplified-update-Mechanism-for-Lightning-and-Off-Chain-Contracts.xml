    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of a fixed offset versus increased delta at each hop in the Lightning Network. The example route taken is A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E, where each node has a CLTV delta of 144 blocks. If the current time approaches the absolute CLTV, channel closure must be initiated to safely fetch the preimage on-chain, and be able to turn around and send it upstream. With eltoo, settlement transaction confirmation is required before the desired CLTV timeout delta begins to count down. The increased delta does not accumulate along the path, but rather is a fixed offset, with smaller actual impact for longer routes.</summary>
