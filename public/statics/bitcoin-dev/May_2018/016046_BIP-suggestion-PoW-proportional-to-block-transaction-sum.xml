    <title>BIP suggestion: PoW proportional to block transaction sum</title>

    <summary>A user named Darren suggested an idea on the Bitcoin Github page that could make it more difficult for malicious attackers to double-spend large amounts with a brief majority of the network hashing power. The suggestion is to introduce a hash workload that is proportional to the sum of transactions in a block, which would make it more difficult for attackers to hash-power their way through a few large transactions. However, this could result in greater transaction delays and fees for larger amounts. If there is value in the idea, Darren plans to follow-up with a better BIP proposal.</summary>
