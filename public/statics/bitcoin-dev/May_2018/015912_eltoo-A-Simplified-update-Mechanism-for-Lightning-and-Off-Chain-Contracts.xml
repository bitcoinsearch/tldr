    <summary>In an email exchange, ZmnSCPxj received a paper and questioned the use of terminology. They were unsure if the terms "input script" referred to witnessProgram and scriptPubKey, and "output script" referred to the witness or scriptSig. Additionally, they pointed out that Figure 2 contained what looked like a witnessProgram, scriptPubKey, or redeemScript but was referred to as an "output script". The figure showed an output script used by on-chain update transactions, which included OP_IF, OP_ELSE, OP_ENDIF, and various OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY operations.</summary>
