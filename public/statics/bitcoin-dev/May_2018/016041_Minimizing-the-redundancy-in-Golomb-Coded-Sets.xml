    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jim Posen shared his analysis of selecting a good P value to reduce total data downloaded using Golomb-Rice filters on mainnet. He determined that the optimal B parameter for different numbers of filter elements watched by the client ranges from 13 to 23. In particular, for C = 10, B = 13 is optimal; for C = 100, B = 16 is optimal; for C = 1,000, B = 20 is optimal; and for C = 10,000, B = 23 is optimal. Posen also attached some results and offered to share the CSV and raw notebook if people were interested. In response to Posen's findings, Pieter Wuille asked for the CSV to help with developing a Wallet that uses Golomb-Rice filters.</summary>
