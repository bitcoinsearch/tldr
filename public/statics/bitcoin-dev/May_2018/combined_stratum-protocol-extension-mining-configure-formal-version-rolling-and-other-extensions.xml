    <summary>Braiins Systems/Slushpool has implemented a stratum protocol extension that allows configuration of the stratum session for version rolling and enables a generic mechanism for requesting protocol extensions from the miners. This extension has already been implemented by several pools including Braiins Systems/Slushpool. The BIP aims to provide a generic mechanism for specifying stratum protocol extensions, allowing miners to request protocol extensions while communicating with the server. The extension code provides a namespace for its extension parameters and return values. The BIP defines three extensions: "version-rolling," "minimum-difficulty," and "subscribe-extranonce." The "mining.configure" message handles the initial configuration/negotiation of features in a generic way. The "version-rolling" extension allows the miner to change the value of some bits in the version field in the block header. The "minimum-difficulty" extension allows a miner to request a minimum difficulty for the connected machine.There are three different extensions in the mining protocol, according to the context. The first extension is "minimum-difficulty", which determines whether the minimum difficulty was accepted or not. It can be configured multiple times by calling "mining.configure" with "minimum-difficulty" code again. The second extension is "subscribe-extranonce", which is a parameter-less extension that allows the miner to advertise its capability of receiving message "mining.set_extranonce" message, which is useful for hash rate routing scenarios. Finally, the third extension is "info", which provides additional text-based information. The "info" extension has four optional parameters including "info.connection-url", which specifies the exact URL used by the mining software to connect to the stratum server; "info.hw-version", which is a manufacturer-specific hardware revision string; "info.sw-version", which is a manufacturer-specific software version; and "info.hw-id", which is a unique identifier of the mining device.
