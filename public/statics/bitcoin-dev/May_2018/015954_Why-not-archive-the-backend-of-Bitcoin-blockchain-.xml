    <summary>In March 2018, a user on the Lightning-dev list inquired about using Lightning without running a full bitcoin blockchain due to limited laptop space. Patrick Shirkey responded with an idea: periodically archiving old chapters of the blockchain on at least 150 computers across seven continents, which would not have to store every chapter, just the index. This suggestion was later posted on the Bitcoin-dev list and it was noted that the "prune" flag could be used to get a snapshot of the blockchain but may not be compatible with "txindex" and "rescan," potentially causing issues for lightning nodes.</summary>
