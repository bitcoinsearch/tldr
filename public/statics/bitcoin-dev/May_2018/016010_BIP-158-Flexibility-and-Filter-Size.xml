    <summary>Johan is encouraged by the fact that separating the elements into their own sub-filters wouldn't hurt the compression ratio or false positive rate. Jim Posen suggests constructing entirely separate filters for different types of elements and allowing clients to download only the ones they care about, which would prevent exponential blowup in the number of filters. Three separate filter types are suggested: one for output scripts, one for input outpoints, and one for TXIDs, each signaled with a separate service bit. The question of whether to separate or combine the headers is also discussed. Jim's analysis shows that not much compression efficiency is lost by separating the basic filter into sub-filters.</summary>
