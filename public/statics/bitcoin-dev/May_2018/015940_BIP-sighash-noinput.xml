    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Anthony Towns raised concerns about the proposed SIGHASH_NOINPUT feature. He pointed out that if an individual used the same key for multiple inputs, and signed one of them with SIGHASH_NOINPUT, they would have spent all of the inputs. While the proposal limits potential damage by still committing to the prevout amount, it still poses a big risk for people who reuse addresses. To mitigate this risk, he suggested having SIGHASH_NOINPUT be a flag to a signature for a hypothetical "OP_CHECK_SIG_FOR_SINGLE_USE_KEY" opcode instead. This would ensure that a NOINPUT signature is only ever valid for keys deliberately intended to be single-use rather than potentially valid for every key.</summary>
