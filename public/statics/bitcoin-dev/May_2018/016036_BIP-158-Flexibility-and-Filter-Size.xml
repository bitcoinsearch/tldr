    <summary>There is a question about whether an application can watch for output scripts without also watching for input scripts or outpoints. According to certain wallets, it may be possible to use only the output script filter if the application is the only one with access to private keys. However, using both input and output scripts allows for additional security measures such as watching for unexpected spends or transactions without unique addresses. The author suggests that being able to download an output script filter without any input elements would be a useful implementation.</summary>
