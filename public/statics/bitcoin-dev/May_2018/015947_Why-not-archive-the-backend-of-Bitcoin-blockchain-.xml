    <summary>A user named Yubin Ruan inquired about running the Lightning network without a fully-fledged Bitcoin blockchain due to space limitations on their laptop. In response, Segue suggested the idea of archiving chunks of the blockchain periodically on at least 150 computers across seven continents to avoid continuously adding onto an increasingly long chain. This suggestion was posted on the Bitcoin-dev list by Segue at the suggestion of a couple of Lightning developers. Additionally, pruning can be used to only store the last X MB of the blockchain while still keeping the UTXO set, which takes up a few GBs of space. A pruned node with pruning set to 1000 MB currently uses approximately 4.5 GB of space, but this may vary slightly depending on the number of UTXOs in existence.</summary>
