    <summary>The Bitcoin network is facing issues with BIP37, a lightweight wallet that connects to nodes in the network and requests an arbitrary bloom filter on their block files and mempool. This poses significant denial of service problems and introduces undue load on the network by default. Additionally, there are major privacy and load-distribution issues with BIP37, risking the breaking of existing SPV client models and pushing users towards complete centralized validation solutions, which may result in making privacy and security even worse.There is a growing consensus among developers to disable BIP37 in network nodes due to these issues. BIP37 was intended to have stronger privacy than it does in reality, as any node that can capture `filterload` and `filteradd` responses can trivially de-anonymize an entire wallet that has connected irrespective of the amount of noise they add to their filters.To address this, NODE_BLOOM has been implemented, which allows nodes to signal whether or not they support filtering. The author suggests that in the next major release, NODE_BLOOM services should be defaulted to zero, and any software relying on BIP37 move to using other filtering options or a dedicated piece of software to serve the requests. Future releases of reference software should remove BIP37 commands entirely.Links to mailing lists, GitHub issues, and research papers are provided to support the argument against BIP37. Overall, developers are working towards finding alternative solutions that do not pose risks to the network's security, reliability, and privacy.</summary>
