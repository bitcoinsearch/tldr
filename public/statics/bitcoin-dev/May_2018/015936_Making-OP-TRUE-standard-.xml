    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Johnson Lau suggested creating a “0 fee tx with exactly one OP_TRUE output” standard to ensure that CPFP will always be needed. However, Peter Todd responded saying that this wouldn't work as a zero-fee transaction won't get relayed even with CPFP due to the fact that package-based transaction relaying hasn't been implemented yet. Instead, Johnson proposed using ANYONECANPAY to sign the transaction and add more inputs for fees without asking for any protocol change. Todd didn't think this would work either and suggested a more flexible SIGHASH system in the long-term to allow people to easily add more inputs and outputs.</summary>
