    <summary>The input script/outpoint filter has an additional benefit of detecting unexpected spends or transactions without a unique change or output address. However, there is disagreement about splitting up the filters as it leads to additional round trips and complicates routine seed rescanning logic. Including the prev output script instead of the prev input script is suggested as the savings outweigh the additional bookkeeping required in implementation compared to using regular output points. The author plans to make modifications to the BIP, including using P=2^19 and M=784931 as GCS parameters, using the prev output script rather than prev input script in the regular filter, removing the txid from the regular filter, and doing away with the extended filter altogether. These changes should reduce the size of filters while ensuring they remain useful for the intended use case. The review of the BIP has been positive and welcomed, despite its delayed reception, and discussions have taken place on various platforms, including IRC channels.</summary>
