    <summary>A proposal for a new sighash flag called `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` has been put forth by Christian Decker. This would remove the commitment to the previous output and enable simple watch-towers, which outsource the need to watch the blockchain for channel closures and react appropriately if the counterparty misbehaves. The sighash flag is meant to enable some off-chain use-cases and should not be used unless the tradeoffs are well-known. It is suggested that contract-specific key-pairs be used in order to avoid having any unwanted rebinding opportunities. The proposal is very minimalistic and simple, but there are a few implementation details that need community input. Discussions have taken place on whether to use a separate opcode or a sighash flag. It has been decided to go with the sighash flag, but some feel it could lead to confusion with existing wallets. However, existing wallets will not sign things with unknown flags. Also, the amount of the outpoint being spent is still committed to as it maintains the value relationship between input and output. The deployment part of the proposal is left vague on purpose in order not to collide with any other proposals. It should be possible to introduce it by bumping the segwit script version and adding the new behavior.</summary>
