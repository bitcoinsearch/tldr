    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell addressed the issue of predicting future fees in the lightning protocol. He suggested including a 546 satoshi OP_TRUE output in commitment transactions to use minimal fees and then use CPFP. However, as 'OP_TRUE' is non-standard, it would have to be P2SH'd at present. Luke Dashjr proposed a solution to this problem, suggesting the creation of a template that uses a 0-value and is always valid only if spent in the same block, tied to a transaction version bit. This consensus rule would require that the bit is set for expected behavior, and that the bit may only be set when the last output is exactly 00000000000000000181. The dummy output should be added to allow coding of the transaction serialization later. Finally, Luke questioned whether there was any legitimate reason one would have multiple such dummy outputs.</summary>
