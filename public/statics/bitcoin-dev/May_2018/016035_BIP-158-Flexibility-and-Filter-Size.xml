    <summary>In an email conversation, Jim Posen suggested that certain wallets can use output scripts to watch for confirmations on sent transactions. This method assumes that the application is the only one with access to private keys. An added benefit of using input script/outpoint filter is to watch for unexpected spends or transactions without a unique change or output address. Posen believes this is a reasonable implementation and suggests that it would be nice to download the filter without any input elements. Posen also raises a question regarding accessing historical blocks. He argues that there may be little need to do so if the assumption is that one will never recover from a backup.</summary>
