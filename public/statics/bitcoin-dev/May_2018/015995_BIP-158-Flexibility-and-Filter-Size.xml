    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jim Posen brought up the advantages of monitoring inputs by scriptPubkey versus input-txid. One of the major benefits is the ability to parallel filter, which can speed up scanning significantly. Serial filtering has been implemented in btcwallet for rescanning after a seed phrase import, but implementing parallel filtering and batch querying for filters would further improve scanning speed. Despite this, the filtering model simplifies code and allows for leveraging identical logic for btcd. The conversation can be found on the bitcoin-dev mailing list archive.</summary>
