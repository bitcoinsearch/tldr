    <summary>The lightning protocol is facing a major problem in predicting future fees. A solution to this could be the implementation of the Eltoo protocol, but that may take time. In the meantime, the proposal to include a 546 satoshi OP_TRUE output in commitment transactions has been suggested. This would allow minimal fees to be used and then use CPFP. However, due to CSV delays on outputs, it would have to be P2SH at the moment as a raw 'OP_TRUE' is non-standard. The downside of just using p2wsh is that policy changes are pretty "fuzzy" and would require a near uniform rollout in order to ensure wide propagation of the commitment transactions. Rusty Russell via bitcoin-dev posted this query on May 8, 2018.</summary>
