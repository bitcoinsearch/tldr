    <summary>The `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` proposal has generated enthusiasm and little criticism. The proposer requests the BBEs to assign a BIP number for the proposal. The proposer has created an implementation of the hashing in Bitcoin Core but doubts it will pass review. Additionally, there is no groundwork on witness V1 scripts, so testing is not possible at this time. One issue raised off-list was that some fork coins have used sighash 0x40 as FORKID. However, the proposal only applies to segwit transactions, which fork coins have explicitly disabled. The proposer looks forward to discussing how to move forward with implementing the proposal and combining multiple proposals into the next soft-fork.</summary>
