    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo suggested that one of the proposed changes to the Bitcoin protocol could be skipped entirely. He argued that there is almost no reason why one would not be able to filter for the set of output scripts in a known transaction. However, he did concede that this suggestion is convincing only for the transaction IDs themselves.Corallo also proposed making input prevouts filterable based on the scriptpubkey being spent. This proposal would eliminate data type mixing and would make the processing more efficient. Although it may require some layering in the processing, Corallo believes that if you have validated the block, you already have the necessary data.</summary>
