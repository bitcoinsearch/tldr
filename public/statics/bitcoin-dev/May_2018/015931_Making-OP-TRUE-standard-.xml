    <summary>In a post, Rusty, a contributor to the lightning protocol, addresses a problem with predicting future fees. He suggests that using Eltoo could solve this issue, but in the meantime, they would like to include a 546 satoshi OP_TRUE output in commitment transactions to minimize fees and use Child Pays for Parent (CPFP). However, the team cannot currently use CPFP due to CSV delays on outputs. Rusty proposes P2SH as a solution, as a raw 'OP_TRUE' is non-standard. Rusty ends the post by asking if there are any reasons not to suggest this policy change.</summary>
