    <summary>In a recent discussion, Olaoluwa Osuntokun asked about the downsides of using p2wsh. The immediate implementation of this method seems to be more practical as compared to policy changes which can be quite fuzzy and would require a uniform rollout for the propagation of commitment transactions. Rusty expressed his expectation that the policy changes will eventually be implemented despite the challenges. He also mentioned his annoyance with people who work around issues without bringing them to his attention.</summary>
