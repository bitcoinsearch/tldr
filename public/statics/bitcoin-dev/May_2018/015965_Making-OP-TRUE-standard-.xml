    <summary>In this communication, Luke and ZmnSCPxj are discussing the possibility of having multiple dummy outputs in a transaction. They question if there is any legitimate reason for having multiple such outputs. However, they consider the use of `SIGHASH_SINGLE` flag, which may require adjustment of transaction inputs if a dummy output is added as the first output. Despite this, it is noted that the discussion is focused on transaction serialization, and it is unclear whether `SIGHASH_SINGLE` is affected by the presence of dummy outputs.</summary>
