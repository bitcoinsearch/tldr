    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Johnson Lau proposed creating a standard for "0 fee tx with exactly one OP_TRUE output" to ensure that CPFP would always be needed and the output wouldn't pollute the UTXO set. However, it was noted that this approach wouldn't propagate.Lau suggested using ANYONECANPAY to sign the transaction instead, allowing for more inputs to be added for fees without requiring any protocol changes. However, this was rejected due to the fact that it would change the TXID relied on for HTLC transactions.Instead, the group agreed that a more flexible SIGHASH system could allow for easier addition of inputs and outputs. This idea was further discussed in a previous thread linked in the conversation.Ultimately, the group anticipates that Eltoo and SIGHASH_NOINPUT will provide alternative solutions in the long-term.</summary>
