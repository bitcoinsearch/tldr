    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Matt Corallo expressed concern about BIP 158 filter size and suggested that some elements (such as txids) could be skipped entirely while others (such as output scripts and input prevouts) may need to be split out. He proposed exploring ways to make filters less bandwidth intensive, such as providing filters for certain script templates or only getting outputs that are segwit version X. Laolu Osuntokun responded that the current filter size may prevent adoption amongst wallets, but noted that the lack of support for notifying unconfirmed transactions is another factor that will likely prevent adoption amongst current BIP-37 mobile wallets. Osuntokun provided stats on the last 10k blocks, showing the median regular filter size to be 20KB and the median size of a modified regular filter (no txid) to be 19KB.</summary>
