    <summary>In an email conversation, Matt Corallo expressed his preference for a reasonable download logic to replace the current cross-check system for clients. He believes that implementing lite clients cross checking is unlikely and, even if implemented, would probably not stay working due to under-usage. Corallo cites three reasons for this belief: (1) the bandwidth overhead of performing the check, (2) the network-interacting-state-machine complexity of it, and (3) the multitude of sanity checks that lite clients already don't implement. However, he also notes that such checking would be moot if the filters were committed and validated. In fact, Corallo expects that eventually one of these filter-map designs would become committed, providing much stronger protection against malicious peers. Corallo also points out that even without this change, clients can still cross-check by asking multiple peers if they are telling them the same or different things, which he believes is the strongest testing we'd actually see them implement absent a commitment.</summary>
