    <summary>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell has proposed including an output of 546 satoshis with the OP_TRUE script in commitment transactions for lightning network. This is intended to allow minimal fees and use CPFP, but it would have to be P2SHed at present as raw OP_TRUE is non-standard. The aim is to solve the largest problem currently faced by the lightning protocol, which is predicting future fees. However, a reader responded on the thread asking what the practical difference is between sending to op_true and paying fees directly.</summary>
