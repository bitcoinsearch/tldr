    <summary>In an email exchange, Tamas Blummer discussed with Jim Posen the results of their calculations regarding a "basic" combined filter. They found that up to 0.5 GB filter data per month, with 100% segwith use, would be a high barrier for adoption, given that 1 GB is the usual data quota for an entry level mobile phone contract. Blummer repeated Posen's calculations and produced a slightly different graph showing the fraction of cumulative filter size to cumulative blockchain size. This confirms Posen's measurement but is less noisy. Blummer thinks that the data supports separation of filters as a combined filter does not seem to come with significant savings. His calculations are repeatable using a Rust implementation of an SPV client built on top of other libraries in the rust-bitcoin GitHub community.</summary>
