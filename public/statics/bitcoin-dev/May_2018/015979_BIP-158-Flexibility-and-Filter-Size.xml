    <title>BIP 158 Flexibility and Filter Size</title>

    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo suggests that filtering for the set of output scripts in a transaction could be skipped entirely. Gregory Maxwell responds to this suggestion by proposing an alternative method of filtering based on input prevouts and the scriptpubkey being spent. While this new method could potentially simplify the filtering process, it may also complicate the download logic as clients would need to be provided with all previous transactions, potentially making it infeasible to identify offending nodes while remaining lightweight. The discussion continues with the possibility of finding a different and more reasonable download logic to replace the current one.</summary>
