    <summary>On the Lightning-dev list, a user named Yubin Ruan asked if they could try out Lightning without having to run a fully-fledged bitcoin blockchain due to limited storage space on their laptop. In response, another user suggested that chunks of the blockchain should be periodically peeled off and archived on a minimum of 150 computers across seven continents in order to avoid an infinitely long chain. This would allow for old chapters to be stored in an evenly distributed manner across the planet, making it no longer a limitation for users like Yubin. The suggestion was then posted on the bitcoin-dev list by a couple of lightning developers.</summary>
