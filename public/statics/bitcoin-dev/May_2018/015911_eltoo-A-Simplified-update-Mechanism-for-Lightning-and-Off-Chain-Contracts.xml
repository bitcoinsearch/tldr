    <summary>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj discusses the implications of a proposed construction in Lightning Network. The construction would increase safe CLTV delta requirements because HTLCs cannot be timed out immediately on the settlement transaction. This means that the CLTV delta has to be greater than the CSV timeout, plus some extra, whereas it is currently safe to make it significantly shorter. ZmnSCPxj notes that only LN-penalty/Poon-Dryja channels do not have this drawback, as Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees also have the same drawback that the CSV and CLTV add up. However, the worst-case invalidation tree total CSV timeouts under Decker-Wattenhofer can grow quite massive. It seems that the new eltoo Decker-Russell-Osuntokun CSV timeouts can be shorter.</summary>
