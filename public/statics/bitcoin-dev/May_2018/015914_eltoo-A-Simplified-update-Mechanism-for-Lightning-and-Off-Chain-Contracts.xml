    <summary>In a discussion between ZmnSCPxj and Christian, ZmnSCPxj questions the use of terminology in a paper they are skimming through. The paper uses the term "input script" to refer to witnessProgram and scriptPubKey, while "output script" is used to refer to witness or scriptSig. However, Figure 2 in the paper contains an output script which appears to ZmnSCPxj to be a witnessProgram, scriptPubKey, or redeemScript instead. Christian acknowledges the mistake, stating they flipped the two definitions and will push a corrected version of the paper.</summary>
