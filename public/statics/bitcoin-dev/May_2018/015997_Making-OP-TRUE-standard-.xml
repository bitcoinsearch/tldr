    <summary>In a discussion about the possibility of using OP_CSV with a relative locktime of 0 to enforce RBF on spending transactions, it was noted that if the parent is RBF, the child inherits it. However, Matt Corallo pointed out that large-but-lowball transactions can still block RBF, as stated in BIP 125. The implementation of a single mempool requires up-front decisions on which transaction is better, but there may be consequences to dropping this heuristic. Peter was asked for his thoughts on the matter.</summary>
