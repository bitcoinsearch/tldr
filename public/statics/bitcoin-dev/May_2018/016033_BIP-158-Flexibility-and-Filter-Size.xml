    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Tamas Blummer shared his thoughts on the practicality of a "basic" combined filter that could potentially result in up to 0.5 GB filter data per month, which he believes may be too high of a barrier for adoption based on typical mobile phone data quotas. He produced a graph showing the fraction of cumulative filter size to cumulative blockchain size, which confirmed measurements made by Jim Posen. Blummer concluded that the data supports separation of filters as a combined filter does not seem to come with significant savings. Blummer also shared his calculations, which were repeatable through a Rust implementation of an SPV client built on top of other libraries, and provided links to the project hoping to attract more developers. In a previous message, Posen had attached a graph comparing input script filters to input outpoint filters, and another graph showing the ratio over time of combining input prev script and output script filters versus keeping them separate. The latter graph showed decreasing savings in recent blocks. A link to the main project and BIP158 implementation was also provided.</summary>
