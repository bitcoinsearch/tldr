    <summary>In an email on May 25, 2018 at 6:42 PM, Gregory Maxwell wrote about a configuration error in which the values for M and the rice parameter were incorrect. According to Maxwell, if the configuration was correct, then M should have been equal to 784931 and the rice parameter B should have been 19. The mistake was due to a paste error, as Maxwell had initially provided the values M=1569861 and B=19.</summary>
