    <summary>On May 24, 2018, Pieter Wuille initiated a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the usefulness of delegating the option to sign a delegation to a new script instead of authorizing an arbitrary transaction that spends a coin. The question is whether any useful applications would be impeded if a signing party had this option. Although the answer seems obvious, that being able to delegate is strictly less powerful than signing an arbitrary transaction, non-obvious counter examples should not be ignored. Andrews points out that there may be related issues with blindsigning.</summary>
