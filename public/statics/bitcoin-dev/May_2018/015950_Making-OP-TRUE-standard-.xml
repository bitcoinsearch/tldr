    <summary>In order to solve the problem of predicting future fees in the Lightning protocol, Rusty Russell proposed including a 546 satoshi OP_TRUE output in commitment transactions. This would allow for minimal fees and the use of CPFP, which is currently not possible due to CSV delays on outputs. However, this would require P2SH as a raw 'OP_TRUE' is non-standard. To address this issue, Jorge Tim√≥n questioned the practical difference between sending to op_true and giving coins as fees directly. The proposed solution involves sending 0 satoshis to OP_TRUE to create a UTXO, which would then be spent with a normal fee. The miner would need to confirm the original transaction with the 0-value OP_TRUE in order to receive the latter fee. It should be noted that the template-script idea does not make it mandatory to spend in the same block, but rather the UTXO would cease to be valid after that block. Additionally, the 0-value output would not take up a UTXO db entry when left unused.</summary>
