    <summary>The author of the BIP39 wordlist has stated that it can be used without any restrictions. However, a new standard called SLIP39 is being finalized which uses a different wordlist with better properties. The SLIP39 wordlist could be more suitable for certain projects, and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md and https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039/wordlist.txt.A user on the bitcoin-dev mailing list had inquired about using the BIP39 word lists for their own project, but was unsure if usage was permitted due to the lack of a license associated with the lists on GitHub. It is not clear if the user was made aware of the unrestricted usage of the wordlist by the author.</summary>
