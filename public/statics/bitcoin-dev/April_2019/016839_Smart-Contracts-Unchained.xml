    <title>Smart Contracts Unchained</title>

    <summary>In a recent post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj proposed an alternative method for implementing smart contracts without launching a separate blockchain or sidechain. The writeup suggests that by using this method, similar levels of security to federated sidechains can be achieved along with additional benefits to privacy and smart-contract-patching. One individual who responded to the post was Tamas Blummer, who expressed concern about the inability to determine which party colluded with the escrow agent in the scheme. The proposal addresses the traditional method of smart contract implementation as part of the consensus rules of some blockchain and offers a different approach.</summary>
