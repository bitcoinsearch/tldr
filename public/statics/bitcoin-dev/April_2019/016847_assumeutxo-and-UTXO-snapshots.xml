    <summary>In a recent IRC exchange between Greg Maxwell and Luke Dashjr, it was discussed that anyone with enough knowledge of C++ to audit the entire Bitcoin Core codebase is more than capable of running it with assumeutxo disabled and checking the hard-coded value themselves. Jim Posen suggested that learning C++ is something within everyone's capability, and even those who do not wish to learn it can hire someone to perform a review for them. The conversation started on line 205 at 2019-04-04T02:54:50 and the link to the full conversation is provided in the context.</summary>
