    <summary>The discussion is about the viability of UTXO commitments without committing to proof-of-work. It is suggested that there is no safe way to use UTXO sets without identifying who is telling you those sets are valid, or making it expensive to lie. The idea of acquiring the UTXO set at a particular block through an SPV node is discussed and the utreexo proposal by Tadge Dryja is recommended for further reading. An alternative to UTXO set commitments is proposed, where miners commit to the location of the UTXOs that are being spent. This allows full nodes to succinctly prove invalidity to SPV clients. However, this idea is deemed unworkable because in order to validate block N, one needs to know that every UTXO spent by a transaction in block N is valid and the UTXO to be validated is located in some other block, which would require downloading all blocks between that and the current block being verified.</summary>
