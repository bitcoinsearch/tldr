    <summary>It is suggested that a list be created of strong proposals and BIPs to be included in a future consensus-driven fork. This would provide momentum for valuable implementations that may otherwise not gain traction. It is acknowledged that not every proposal will be considered, but pre-consensus voting could help determine what should be included in the fork packages.</summary>
