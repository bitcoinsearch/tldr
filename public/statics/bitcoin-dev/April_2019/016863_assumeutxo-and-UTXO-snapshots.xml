    <summary>On April 3, 2019, Dave Scotese sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list proposing that the ratio of block hash to difficulty requirement could be used to identify "special" blocks. He suggests that such a system could be useful for sanity checking and could help popularize memorable details about unimportant blocks. However, Bitcoin developer Peter Todd responded to the proposal by warning against basing any features on this property, as it is arbitrary and has no significance to the Bitcoin consensus. Todd argues that using hash size as a basis for identification may confuse people about how the Bitcoin consensus works.</summary>
