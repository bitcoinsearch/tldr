    <summary>A list of potential softfork proposals for SegWit v1 has been provided, including Schnorr signatures, MuSig, Taproot, SIGHASH_NOINPUT, signature aggregation, and MAST. It is unclear whether this is an exhaustive list. Only SIGHASH_NOINPUT has a BIP (BIP 118), but it may not match the version that will eventually reach Bitcoin Core. To reduce the risk of incorrect use of SIGHASH_NOINPUT, it is proposed that every input signed with a SIGHASH_NOINPUT signature also require a signature without SIGHASH_NOINPUT. Further details are unavailable. Lord His Excellency James HRMH had originally requested a list of solid proposals for future consensus-driven forks to build momentum for useful and valuable implementations.</summary>
