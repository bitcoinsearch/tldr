    <summary>A proposal has been made to rewrite the Bitcoin codebase in Python for better pre and post merging abilities, faster operations, and improved understandability. However, according to Hampus, a consensus critical system like Bitcoin would be exposed to even greater risks if everything was rewritten in another language. Furthermore, he believes that there is no benefit in moving to a language like Python. Hampus also highlights that consensus problems between Bitcoin Core-versions have already occurred. The email conversation was shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on April 23, 2019.</summary>
