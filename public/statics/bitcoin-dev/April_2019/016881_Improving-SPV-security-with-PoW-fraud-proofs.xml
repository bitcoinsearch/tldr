    <summary>The email thread discusses the use of proof-of-work (PoW) fraud proof for SPV clients and how they only need to download one block for every fork. It is noted that mining a block that will never be accepted is an expensive way to make SPV clients download data. The discussion also touches on the possibility of splits not being relayed to SPV clients and the idea of having SPV clients slow down when a malicious miner with significant mining power is attempting to disrupt the network. UTXO commitments are discussed as a potential solution, but the question arises about how SPV nodes can acquire the UTXO set at a particular block. The email mentions utreexo proposal by Tadge Dryja and the old fraud proofs idea for segwit as alternatives to UTXO set commitments.</summary>
