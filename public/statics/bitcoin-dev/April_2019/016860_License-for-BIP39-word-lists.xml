    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Elia inquired about using the BIP39 word lists for their own project as there was no license associated with the lists provided on Github. Pavol Rusnak, the author of the wordlist, responded that the list can be used without any restrictions and suggested the use of the SLIP39 standard for splitting shares which uses a different wordlist with better properties. The SLIP39 standard can be found on Github along with its wordlist. It is not mentioned who else will adopt the wordlist or whether it is live in Trezor. At the end of the email, Aymeric signs off with regards.</summary>
