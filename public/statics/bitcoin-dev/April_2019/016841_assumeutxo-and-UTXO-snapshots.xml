    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Dave Scotese expressed his belief that learning C++ is something anyone can do, and even if someone chooses not to learn it, they can hire someone to perform a review for them. He also argued that developers deserve the trust put in them because they are accountable for any errors found in the repository, but he admits this does not mean that users should blindly trust developers. James suggested making it possible to download the entire UTXO Set if a commitment of it is hardcoded into the software, however, verifying a UTXO set commitment is impossible short of a real IBD. Luke argues that Bitcoin is not supposed to be a trust-based currency and there are plenty of fiat options for those who desire that type of system.</summary>
