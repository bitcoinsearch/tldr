    <summary>Michele, a bitcoin user, is seeking help on a discussion forum after experiencing inconsistency in the outputs of `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisigaddress` functions. She was working on deriving the pay-to-script-hash from a multisig script when she found that her output address was different from the bitcoin core's `addmultisigaddress` output. Michele tried using the `createmultisigaddress` method with the same public keys and found that the output matched hers. However, she was confused because she thought the outputs of both methods were supposed to be the same. Michele also noticed that the `redeemScript` was the same for both methods, only the addresses were different. Calling `decodescript` with it gave the same address as `createmultisig`. She is now seeking help to understand if this is a bug or if there is something she is missing.</summary>
