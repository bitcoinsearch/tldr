    <title>Smart Contracts Unchained</title>

    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a member of the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, shared a new mechanism for implementing smart contracts without launching a separate blockchain or sidechain. This method provides security similar to federated sidechains and additional benefits to privacy and smart-contract-patching. In his proposal, he suggests using an "as long as everybody agrees" escape hatch in case of a buggy contract. This allows all participants to agree to a new contract, abandoning the existing one and spending to the new contract. The post also includes an update to the original page, which now reflects this new information.</summary>
