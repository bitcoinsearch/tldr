    <summary>Michele, a user of bitcoin, has posted a question on a discussion forum asking for help regarding inconsistency in outputs of `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisigaddress` functions. She was working on a function to derive the pay-to-script-hash from a multisig script and was checking the results against the bitcoin core's `addmultisigaddress` output. Although she was confident in her implementation, her output address was different. To resolve this issue, she tried the `createmultisigaddress` method using the same public keys and found that the output matched hers. Michele is confused because she thought the outputs of `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisigaddress` were supposed to be the same, but instead, they are inconsistent with each other.She also noticed that the `redeemScript` is the same, only the addresses are different and calling `decodescript` with it gives the same address as `createmultisig`. Michele is wondering how this can be possible and is seeking help to understand if this is a bug or if she is missing something.</summary>
