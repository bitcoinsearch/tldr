    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, has proposed two Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to address the issue of Bitcoin being sold at unreasonably low prices. The first BIP proposes adding a signed price field to Bitcoin transactions, allowing the sender to affirm the value of bitcoins used in the transaction. The second BIP proposes a soft fork to require a minimum transaction price of $50,000 USD/BTC starting from block height 622370, expected around April 1, 2020. The BIPs have received support from some members of the Bitcoin community, but others have criticized the proposals as being too conservative.</summary>
