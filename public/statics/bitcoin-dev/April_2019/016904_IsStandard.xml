    <summary>The standardness of Bitcoin transactions and scripts is not described in a single document, and may change over time or across different implementations. However, commonly used scripts that are standard today are generally assumed to remain standard. To test if a script is standard and accepted by the current relay policy of a Bitcoin Core node, one can create a transaction that spends from it on mainnet or testnet and see if it is accepted to the mempool of the local node. Lightning transactions are considered standard as they propagate. Should the standardness-rules of a script type ever change, it will be announced and discussed on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
