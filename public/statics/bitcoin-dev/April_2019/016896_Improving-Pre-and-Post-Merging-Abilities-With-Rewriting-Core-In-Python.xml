    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Achow101 suggested that Bitcoin Core could be implemented in Python as it is open source software. However, he also noted that such a move was unlikely due to Python's inefficiency and the potential for introducing bugs. In response to this discussion, Peter Todd, the maintainer of python-bitcoinlib, expressed his opinion that using Python for security-critical codebases is not advisable as it is too easy to make mistakes. Instead, he recommended Rust as a language that offers significant benefits, particularly in its type system and handling of immutability. While Todd's preference for Rust does not preclude other languages being used for similar projects, he believes it fits well with his programming style.</summary>
