    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev discussion, Luke Dashjr warned against using UTXO snapshots as an alternative to an actual Initial Block Download (IBD) due to huge security implications. Ethan Scruples suggested that mandatory UTXO commitments could provide the benefit of a non-growing IBD if soft forked into Bitcoin. However, Dashjr disagreed and stated that there is no important security implication to be found in this scenario. He questioned what advantage Bob would have over Alice and what actionable information he gains and receives in return for validating previous blocks. Dashjr believes that the danger of adding UTXO commitments is itself a good reason not to ever add them.</summary>
