    <summary>The author of the post proposes a method to implement payjoin2swap using Lightning Network operations if the network supports Wumbo channels and dual-funded channels. The method involves creating two fake node addresses and assigning unique Tor hidden services to each. Two actual LN nodes with long uptime and short distance between them are selected, and channels are created with the UTXOs V and W. Satoshis are transferred over the LN from the channel of A to the channel of B, and both channels are cooperatively closed. The author mentions that existing LN implementations may not apply ZeroLink for onchain funds, which can erode privacy if either of the nodes connect to uses the result of the cooperative closes to later fund a published channel, possibly mixing it with other coins of their own.</summary>
