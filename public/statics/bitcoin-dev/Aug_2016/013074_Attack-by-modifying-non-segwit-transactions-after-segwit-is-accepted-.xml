    <summary>The consensus in Bitcoin is that adding witness data to a non-segwit script is invalid. A code snippet on Github's bitcoin repository highlights this consensus. A new pull request has been made to detect any such violation early and ban the peer. Additionally, another approach suggested is running the scripts of all incoming transactions, which is not too bad as utxos have already been fetched as part of validation.</summary>
