    <summary>The Open Asset protocol has been used in the wild since 2014 and cannot be easily modified. However, a new OA2.0 protocol can be created to address existing issues while ensuring that upgraded wallets continue to support both versions. The focus of OA has always been on integration rather than fixing the core protocol, which has resulted in various implementations being used by investors who need to install multiple wallets. To address this, it would be beneficial for major protocols to collaborate and develop a meta-specification that merges the features of existing implementations while avoiding potential issues. This could lead to a more streamlined process for investors and benefit the community as a whole.</summary>
