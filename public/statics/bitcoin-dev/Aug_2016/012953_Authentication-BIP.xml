    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, members debated whether to tie identity-public-keys with a guaranteed static IP address and whether or not to allow for DNS names. The purpose of this table is so the client knows which server ID to expect. The system is designed to inhibit fingerprinting, so if you don't publish your node pubkey, no one can use it to track your node around the network. If the design is to provide any protection against MITM, you need to know who you expected to connect to in any case. The client must know the identity of the server it is expecting. The server does not announce itself, so if it did, changing IPs would provide you with no privacy at all. There is no wildcard option and nodes should be able to have as many listening identities as they want. The original text may need to be revised slightly.</summary>
