    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.13.0 has been released with new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. However, Windows XP users are no longer supported due to the end of support from Microsoft in 2014 and various reports of Bitcoin Core randomly crashing on Windows XP. The database cache memory has been increased to 300 MiB to improve the performance of the UTXO set. The RPC command line client now has a new argument, '-stdin', which is used to read extra arguments from standard input. C++11 has been implemented, and Linux ARM builds have been added. Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation according to BIP32 is now being used for newly created wallets. Furthermore, Segregated Witness is included in this release, but it is not yet specified for mainnet. Mining transaction selection ("Child Pays For Parent") has also been replaced with an algorithm that selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions. The internal miner has been removed and replaced with a simpler implementation for the test framework.Bitcoin Core version 0.13.0 includes a number of significant changes, including the optional feefilter message to filter transactions below a certain fee rate. Low-level P2P and RPC changes have also been made, including the removal of the P2P alert system in PR #7692 and the addition of detailed statistics for individual mempool entries and the ability to calculate in-mempool ancestors or descendants of a transaction in RPC calls. The BIP35 `mempool` command is now subject to batch processing since PR #7840, and UTF-8 support has been added to the RPC API. Asm script outputs have also been changed, with OP_NOP2 renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by BIP 65, and OP_NOP3 to OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY by BIP 112. New RPC commands include `generatetoaddress`, `importprunedfunds`, `removeprunedfunds`, `signmessagewithprivkey`, `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry`, `createwitnessaddress`, and `addwitnessaddress`. The low-level ZMQ change involves the inclusion of an up-counting sequence number in each ZMQ notification that allows listeners to detect lost notifications. Other significant changes include the removal of the cs_main lock from `createrawtransaction`, the addition of tags to mempool's mapTx indices, and the use of SipHash-2-4 for various non-cryptographic hashes.The latest Bitcoin Core release, version 0.13.0, includes a series of changes to its P2P protocol and network code, build system, and GUI. Changes to the P2P protocol include the removal of the P2P alert system and vfReachable, and the implementation of “feefilter” P2P message. The network code changes include improved AlreadyHave functionality, several performance and privacy improvements to inv/mempool handling, the use of SipHash for node eviction, and the prevention of fingerprinting and disk-DoS with compact blocks. Changes to the build system include updates to boost and check macros, and the integration of leveldb into the build system. Changes to the GUI include the addition of InMempool() information to transaction details, increased font size options, and autocomplete in the console window.The latest updates to the Bitcoin Core software have been listed in a recent release. These updates include the removal of the reflection from the 'about' icon and the removal of 0-fee from the send dialog. There have also been improvements to the wallet feature, such as the reduction of inefficiency for the GetAccountAddress() function, the warning on unexpected EOF while salvaging wallet, and the addition of import/removeprunedfunds rpc call. The CWallet API has been improved with new AccountMove and GetAccountPubkey functions, and there is now an HD keypath in CKeyMetadata. Additionally, the OpenSSL AES has been replaced with a ctaes-based version and the importaddress'ed scripts are no longer treated as change. Other updates include fixing bugs, improving the user interface, and adding network-specific examples.</summary>
