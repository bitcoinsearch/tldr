    <summary>BIP 111, also known as NODE_BLOOM service bit, has been implemented in Bitcoin Core and derivatives, but it is unclear if clients are using it yet. The developers of such clients are requested to confirm if their software supports this BIP or intends to support it in the future. Multibit is adding detection of the NODE_BLOOM bit in the next 2-3 weeks. SPV wallets must update to respect NODE_BLOOM as bloom filtering is CPU and disk intense and some node operators have disabled it. Failing to detect the NODE_BLOOM bit is causing problems for SPV wallets, resulting in panic among less technical users. Additionally, SPV wallets should make use of the new DNS seeder filter option, which allows them to only get nodes that signal support for NODE_BLOOM. The syntax for the filter option is x.seed.bitcoin.... Example for NODE_NETWORK together with NODE_BLOOM can be found by running "dig x5.seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch (NETWORK = (1".</summary>
