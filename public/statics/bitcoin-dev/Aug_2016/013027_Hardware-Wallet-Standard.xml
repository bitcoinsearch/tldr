    <summary>Bitcoin developers have suggested standardising the hardware protocol to improve user experience. Some hardware wallets have already started implementing Trezor's interface, which could be a good place to start. The specification could have two layers - raw messages and transport mechanism (USB HID, QR code, audio). The split exists in the draft specification but isn't very clear. The existing URI scheme allows disambiguation by manufacturer but doesn't provide a way to enumerate available manufacturers or enabled wallets. This means that the driver would have to include a GUI to select this. Passing return URIs seems rather fragile, and there are no other examples of protocols that use URIs for bidirectional IPC.</summary>
