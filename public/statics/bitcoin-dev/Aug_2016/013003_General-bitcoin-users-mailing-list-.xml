    <summary>In an email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on August 13, 2016, user Cannon inquired about a general users mailing list for bitcoin related topics that may not necessarily be related to development. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is specifically for topics relating to development, and Cannon was seeking a platform for more general discussion. The email also included contact information for Cannon, including a PGP fingerprint, Bitmessage address, and Ricochet-IM. As a response to Cannon's inquiry, other users suggested checking out the /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin subreddits on Reddit as potential forums for more general discussions about Bitcoin.</summary>
