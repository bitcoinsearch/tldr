    <summary>A proposal for a fast, robust, and standardized method to represent Bitcoin addresses over audio has been made by Daniel Hoffman. The proposed method takes the binary representation of the Bitcoin address in little endian format, chops that up into 4 or 2 bit chunks depending on whether the audio quality is high or low, and generates a tone based upon the value. This protocol comes with built-in error correction and could be used to donate to podcasts easily. Hoffman has updated the GitHub page and made some samples available. He asks if this is good enough to warrant an official BIP number, and requests suggestions for improvements. Some people on Reddit also want to "allow for decoding experiments". Justin Newton suggests adding additional tones to optionally denote an amount in satoshis. Trevin Hofmann wonders if it would be feasible to transmit an entire BIP21 URI as audio; he points out that encoding any extra information such as an amount would require a checksum for the entire message and that this checksum could possibly replace the checksum in the address.</summary>
