    <summary>The message from Tier Nolan suggests a new way of encoding BIP32 public seeds rather than broadcasting addresses. The idea is to link the email address and allow users to send bitcoin donations to it, with TXT records containing the address details. The method can be used across various mediums without much infrastructure change. Additionally, in the same email thread, Nolan mentions CDMA as an alternative that has the advantage of sounding like noise. While codes would take longer to send, multiple bits could be sent at once with orthogonal codes.</summary>
