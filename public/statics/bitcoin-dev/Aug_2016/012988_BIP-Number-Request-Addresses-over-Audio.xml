    <summary>In an email thread on August 10, 2016, Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev stated that there is no way for someone to use a transmitted address and trace the total amount of payments to it if a public seed is sent. However, Pieter argued that revealing a public seed could be worse because anyone who has seen it, including those who have paid through it, can identify all payments to any address derived from that seed.</summary>
