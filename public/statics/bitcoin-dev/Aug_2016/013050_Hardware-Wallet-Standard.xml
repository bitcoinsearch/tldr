    <summary>The writer of the message has experience with hardware wallet development and integration, but believes it is too early to define rigid standards. They mention that the TREZOR concept goes against the proposal of wallet software as a workflow manager and therefore cannot support it. The current question is whether or not to work together on a signing protocol. The writer admits their draft proposal may not be the best option and is willing to reconsider it for a better one. They strongly recommend working together on a standard that benefits the end user.</summary>
