    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of audio-based transference, which is not suitable for podcasts or radio ads but could be used to transmit payment details between phones that don't have cameras. The suggestion is to define a standard for transmitting information over audio without specifying the type of information to be conveyed. This would allow developers to use the method for sending public keys, payment protocol requests, or any other desired data. There is speculation about the existence of a data-over-audio standard, in which case the bip could say "we use [standard] to convey any bitcoin-related data." In an email thread, Pieter Wuille warns against revealing a public seed as it would allow anyone who has seen it to identify all payments to any address derived from that seed.</summary>
