    <title>BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio (fixed link)</title>

    <summary>The email sender apologizes for a previous message and provides a corrected link to their BIP repository, which contains their idea for a standardized method of representing Bitcoin addresses through audio. The process involves taking the binary representation of the address and generating tones based on 4 or 2 bit chunks, depending on the type of audio being used. The goal of this idea is to make it easier for consumers to donate to podcasts and other media by having an app or media player automatically provide the Bitcoin address. Error correction is built into the protocol for added reliability.</summary>
