    <summary>In an email exchange on August 16, 2016, Jonas Schnelli and Pavol Rusnak discussed the need for a better way to validate input amounts in Bitcoin transactions. Schnelli expressed his belief that the current approach was not sustainable long-term and that SegWit was a step in the right direction. Rusnak agreed that a standard should be created for new forms of transactions, such as SegWit and Lightning, rather than the existing ones, which he described as "ugly." The email also included Rusnak's signature in the form of an OpenPGP digital signature.</summary>
