    <summary>On August 24, 2016, Andreas Schildbach discussed the BIP44 protocol on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The protocol does not encode a seed birthday which is necessary for SPV wallets to scan from the beginning of the blockchain. However, there are some wallets that interoperate on this standard. The status of the protocol depends on whether or not people are using it, irrespective of whether it's a good idea or not. BIP2's BIP comments would have provided an opportunity for Thomas and Andreas to criticise the BIP, but it was too controversial. Additionally, Andreas suggests that BIP43 should be made final as it only advises other BIPs on how they could do things. Therefore, it goes into Draft-&gt;Active Status flow instead of Draft-&gt;Accepted-&gt;Final.</summary>
