    <summary>The discussion revolves around standardizing hardware interaction and the proposed URI scheme approach. Jochen agrees with a support for wallet-creation with an extended public key (xpub) from the signing device, and suggests loading multiple public keys into a keypool from the device to support hardened derivation at all levels. Luke opposes setting Trezor's USB communication as the standard and believes each hardware wallet should provide custom software for backups, recovery, firmware upgrade, etc. He also suggests diversity in the hardware interface to reduce centralized risks for weak security/vulnerabilities. The URI scheme is suggested as a modern way to interact between applications without directly knowing each other, while the stdio/piping approach does not work for mobile platforms. Thomas supports the URI scheme but cautions against over-standardization of the interaction with the device itself to allow flexibility on the hardware wallet vendor side. They agree on putting end user experience in the center of the problems-to-solve and not overweighting ideal code/API/hardware-interaction-design. Operating systems allow checking if a certain URL-Scheme is supported to check for known major vendors. The URI return scheme works well and is the proposed way of application intercommunication in Apple iOS and Google Android.</summary>
