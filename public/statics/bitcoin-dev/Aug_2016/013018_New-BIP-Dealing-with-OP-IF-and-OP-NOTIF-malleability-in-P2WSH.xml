    <summary>The email thread discusses the concept of transaction malleability and how to minimize its impact on the p2p network. One suggestion is to create a separate CHECKBOOLVERIFY opcode that fails unless the top item on the stack is a minimally encoded true or false value, allowing script writers to opt into this behavior. The proposed BIP behavior would offer lower costs for enforcing OP_TRUE or OP_FALSE with the option to save bytes and push potential DoS costs onto the network. However, it is noted that enforcing OP_TRUE byte in OP_IF would create costs for those who want to evaluate pushdata, so it has to be explicitly opted-in from an optimization/convenience standpoint. Overall, minimizing areas of transaction malleability should be easy to resolve and well-understood by script writers in the future.</summary>
