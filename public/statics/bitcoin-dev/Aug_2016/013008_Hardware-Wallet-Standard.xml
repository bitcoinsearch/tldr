    <summary>The lack of a standard for desktop and mobile wallets to interact with hardware devices has resulted in wallet vendors adding proprietary code for non-standardized interfaces. In response, Jonas Schnelli has created an early stage draft BIP titled “Detached Signing” to address this missing part of the ecosystem. The BIP describes a generic interface for wallets to interact with signing-devices resulting in better user experience, less critical code and simpler adaption for various signing-devices. The BIP describes two approaches: process pipe and URI call. If possible, the modern URI approach should be chosen. The smartphone/URI app intercommunication approach is available for smartphones and uses predefined URI schemes. The returnurischeme must contain a URI schema where the result of the signing process should be returned to. To support multiple signing-devices, wallets and signing-devices can optional add support for brand based URI-schemes.</summary>
