    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty proposed the idea of encoding BIP32 public seeds instead of plain addresses to broadcast Bitcoin donations. The idea was met with approval from Theo Chino, who suggested that sound could be used for watches that cannot use cameras. Tier Nolan suggested the use of CDMA, which has the advantage of sounding like noise and allowing for multiple bits to be sent at once with orthogonal codes. Erik Aronesty further explained how this method could be implemented using TXT records and DNS-SEC validation. This approach would require very little infrastructure change and could work with various publishing formats such as audio, video, and web.</summary>
