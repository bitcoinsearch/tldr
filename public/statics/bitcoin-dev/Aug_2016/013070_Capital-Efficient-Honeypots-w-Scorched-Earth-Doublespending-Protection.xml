    <summary>A discussion about a smart contract incentivizing publication of a hacked server was held on August 25, 2016. The funding for the contract was handled by storing all coins in the same address and associating each server with a unique signature. This allows identification of which server was hacked without reducing the incentive for an attacker. The suggestion was made to split the coins into different outputs that could optimally be redeemed by the owner at different points in the future to incentivize the attacker to act quickly. However, it was noted that the owner can redeem the coins at any time and there is no way to prevent this. The intruder needs to collect the honeypot as fast as possible to maximize their chances of being rewarded before the honeypot owner attempts to recover the funds.</summary>
