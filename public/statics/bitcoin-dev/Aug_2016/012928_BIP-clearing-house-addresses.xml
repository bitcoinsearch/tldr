    <summary>In a mailing list post, Matthew Roberts discusses the suitability of existing OP codes and transaction types for a secure clearing mechanism. He suggests adding an opcode called SPENDTO which requires that an output be set to a specific script. This would allow for a purely local check and could be used with check sequence verify to lock the spending script for a period of time. There would be a 24-hour window where spenders can reverse the transaction. The script can be created by someone with the live public key and once the transaction hits the blockchain, someone with access to the script has 24 hours to spend the output before the person with the live keys can send the funds onward.</summary>
