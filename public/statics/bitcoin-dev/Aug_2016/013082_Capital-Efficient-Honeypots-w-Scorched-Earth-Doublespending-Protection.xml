    <summary>In an email thread on bitcoin-dev, James MacWhyte questioned the effectiveness of honeypots in deterring cyber attacks. He wondered if honeypots - computer systems meant to look like real systems but with weak security - that were set up with non-standard transactions and presigned documents would be immediately identified by attackers as honeypots. If so, he posited that attackers would avoid them and instead wait for a non-bait target to appear. The response from the thread was that whether or not attackers trip the tripwire depends on the value of the compromised machine.</summary>
