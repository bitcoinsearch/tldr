    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion, Erik Aronesty raises a question about the process of determining if an address was derived from a BIP32 public seed. He wonders if it would be necessary to compute all 2^31 possible public child addresses to achieve this. The estimated time for a quad core laptop with competent software to perform this computation is 8 hours. It is assumed that not the entire 2^31 space needs to be used in order to avoid placing the burden of this computation on the receiver.</summary>
