    <summary>On August 9, 2016, a user named Daniel Hoffman asked if a proposal was good enough for an official BIP number on the bitcoin-dev forum. Another user responded positively and suggested that they name it BIP 170. The next steps were outlined, including fixing the BIP number in the file, formatting it in the usual BIP mediawiki format instead of markdown, adding it to a fork of the bitcoin/bips git repository, and opening a pull request against bitcoin/bips. In addition to the discussion about the proposal, a postscript question was added about why telephones are considered 4-tone when DTMF has 16 tones.</summary>
