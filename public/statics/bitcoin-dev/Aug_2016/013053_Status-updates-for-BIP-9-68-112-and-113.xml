    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, announced on the mailing list that he plans to update the status of BIPs 9, 68, 112, and 113 to Final in one month. BIP 9 was previously unclear on whether it required implementation and fell under Draft/Accepted/Final classification or Draft/Active classification like process BIPs. However, Dashjr believes that since BIPs 68, 112, and 113 have already been deployed successfully, BIP 9 now falls under the Draft/Accepted/Final class as an informational BIP. Therefore, BIPs 68, 112, and 113 also ought to be Final status. Dashjr needs at least one author from each BIP to sign-off on promoting them to (and beyond) Accepted, as all four BIPs are currently in Draft status. The links to the background of the discussion can be found on the Github BIPs repository.</summary>
