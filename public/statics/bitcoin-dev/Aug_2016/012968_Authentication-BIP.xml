    <summary>The conversation is about the privacy protection of OpenSSH users. The person asks if OpenSSH has the same problem as Bitcoin Core and the response is that it doesn't because OpenSSH doesn't make an effort to protect user privacy. The discussion then moves on to the topic of authenticated peers and the limitation of one identity-key per listening network interface for each peer. The person suggests that this limitation should be removed and responding nodes should be able to have multiple identity-keys per network interface. They also mention that different identity-keys should be used for each network interface. The conversation ends with a signature attachment.</summary>
