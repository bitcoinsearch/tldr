    <summary>Bitcoin Core and derivatives have implemented BIP 111, also known as the NODE_BLOOM service bit. However, it is unclear if clients are using it. The developers of such clients are requested to comment regarding whether their software supports this BIP, and if not, whether they intend to support it in the future. If any clients are already using this service bit, BIP 111 will be updated to Final Status in two weeks. Multibit plans to add detection of the NODE_BLOOM bit in the next 2-3 weeks as SPV wallets are experiencing issues without this detection. If a wallet connects only to nodes that don't support bloom filtering, the wallet never gets updates, causing panic among less technical users who lose their transaction history after rescanning the blockchain. Other SPV wallets may also face similar issues, and BIP 111 should be considered mandatory for them.</summary>
