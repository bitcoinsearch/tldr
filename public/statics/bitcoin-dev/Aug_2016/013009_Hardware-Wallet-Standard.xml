    <summary>In a message sent by Pavol Rusnak from SatoshiLabs, he expressed his opinion that it would not be sensible to standardize the extended validation of inputs for current Bitcoin transactions as they are too complex. However, he suggests that it would be interesting to have something similar for Segwit and Lightning transactions. He also mentioned that TREZOR performs extended validation of the inputs by streaming all of prev-txs into the device and validating them, which is not tackled by the standard. As a result, he believes that making this standard unnecessarily complicated is not worth it.</summary>
