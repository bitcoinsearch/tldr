    <summary>In this context, the discussion is about whether certain BIPs should be treated as final or not. Marek Palatinus noted that BIP44 is already being used by many wallets without any real-world issues, and while it may not be perfect from all perspectives, it works for most use cases. He suggested setting it as final and proposing competing standards to address any remaining concerns. Jonas Schnelli expressed his disagreement with the development paradigm of "maybe detect funds," stating that it should not be encouraged for Bitcoin. However, he later clarified that he had added an extra "not" in his previous statement. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
