    <summary>The email conversation between Erik Aronesty and Tier Nolan via bitcoin-dev discussed various ways to use audio for sending bitcoin donations. One potential use for audio would be for watches that can listen but cannot use a camera, such as the Samsung S2. Addresses were not intended to be broadcast in this manner and BIP32 public seeds should be encoded instead. Erik suggests using TXT records with DNS-SEC validation to contain the address information and link it to an email address. This method would require little infrastructure change and could be used with various publishing formats. Tier Nolan suggests using CDMA, which would allow for multiple bits to be sent at once and have the codes orthogonal.</summary>
