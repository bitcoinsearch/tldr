    <summary>BIP44 is a widely used standard by many wallets, and people generally have no real-world issues with it. Despite not being perfect from all points of view, it works for most use cases. The email chain between Luke and Jonas Schnelli on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the development paradigm of "maybe detect funds" and whether it should be encouraged for Bitcoin. There seems to be some confusion over the use of the word 'not' in one of the statements made by Jonas Schnelli. The discussion concludes with a proposal to create competing standards that cover all concerns.</summary>
