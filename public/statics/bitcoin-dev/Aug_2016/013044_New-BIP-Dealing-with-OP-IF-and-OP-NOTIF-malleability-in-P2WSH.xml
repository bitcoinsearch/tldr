    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner suggested that the real problem with witness data size is that it is not signed. However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that this is not possible for the general case as you may not know the witness size in advance. Maxwell believes fees are not the problem, but rather the fact that the maximum witness size may be changed by a miner which could cause issues for devices like IoT or side-chains that have certain restrictions on transaction sizes they can accept. He proposes that if the witness size is higher than the expected size by the sender, the transaction becomes invalid.</summary>
