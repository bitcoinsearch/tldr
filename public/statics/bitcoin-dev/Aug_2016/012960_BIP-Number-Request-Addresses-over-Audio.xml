    <summary>The proposal of a fast, standardized, and robust protocol for representing Bitcoin addresses over audio has been made. This would allow the binary representation of Bitcoin addresses to be chopped up into 4 or 2 bit chunks and then generate tones based on those values. The resulting audio could be used to transmit an entire BIP21 URI, with a checksum possibly being used instead of the checksum in the address. The BIP idea was proposed as a way to donate to podcasts easily, and it comes with error correction built into the protocol. To further enhance the usefulness of this protocol, Justin Newton suggested adding additional tones to optionally denote an amount in satoshis. The full specification of the BIP can be found on the GitHub page provided.</summary>
