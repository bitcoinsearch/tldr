    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, James MacWhyte expressed concern over the proposal to obscure transaction values in order to enhance privacy. He worried that it would disallow miners from verifying whether transactions have been spent and create an altcoin not supported by the main bitcoin project. However, while miners do verify transactions, this is merely an optimization. The prevention of double-spending is a fundamental requirement of Bitcoin and this proposal does prevent it. This proposal is similar to one proposed earlier by Peter Todd, which can be found on his website. Todd's website also includes an article on disentangling crypto-coin mining.</summary>
