    <summary>Christian Decker, a member of the Bitcoin development community, suggests that if someone gains unauthorized access to a company's system and their intention is to use it as a foothold for further compromising the company or sending spam, they will likely try to avoid tripwires. The value of their activity compared to the value of the coins would determine whether they would attempt to bypass covert or shared tripwires. It is noted that spamming doesn't pay much, making covert tripwires more preferable. However, using shared tripwires may be a good trade-off if it allows for 100 times the funds available.</summary>
