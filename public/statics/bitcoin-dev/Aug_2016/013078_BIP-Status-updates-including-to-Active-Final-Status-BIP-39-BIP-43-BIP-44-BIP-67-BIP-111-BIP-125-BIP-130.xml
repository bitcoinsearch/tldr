    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, developer Jonas Schnelli raised a potential issue with BIP44, in that it might not detect funds sent to certain addresses, if those addresses were generated beyond the gap limit. This could be problematic for merchants who generate multiple addresses for their customers, as orders may be filled at a later date. The lack of consideration for this issue is seen as another problem with BIP44. While there was no consensus reached, some suggested overhauling the BIP39 and BIP44 proposals.</summary>
