    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tier Nolan and Matthew Roberts discussed a clearing mechanism for exchanges. Nolan suggested adding an opcode that requires an output to be set to a specific value, which would allow for a check sequence verify to lock the spending script for a period of time. This would not allow for transaction reversal, but would give a 24-hour window for spenders to reverse a transaction. Another user commented that this idea was very smart and would meet the needs of a clearing mechanism/fraud prevention system for exchanges with minimal changes to software.</summary>
