    <summary>A honeypot is a technique used to isolate and monitor data that appears to be legitimate but in reality is designed to attract attackers. The presence of Bitcoin private keys on most servers is a sure sign that they are part of a honeypot. While there are ways to make a honeypot look like it is not one, the proposed honeypot in this context is meant to be obvious. The scorched earth disincentive to doublespend the intruder involves wasting the honeypot and additional funds belonging to the honeypot creator, making it a good strategy from a game theory perspective.</summary>
