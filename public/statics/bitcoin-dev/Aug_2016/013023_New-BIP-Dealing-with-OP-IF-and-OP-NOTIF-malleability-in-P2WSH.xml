    <summary>The context of this conversation is about a potential soft fork over an issue. The question is raised as to why not just make it a relay rule instead. It is argued that miners are already incentivized to modify transactions to drop excess witness data and prioritize based on their cost. If a miner chooses to mine a block with excess witness data, then it is mostly their own loss. A question is then asked about whether something similar can be done with replace by fee or if there are limits on that. Pieter Wuille responds by stating that BIP125 and mempool eviction both require the replacing transaction to have a higher fee to compensate for the cost of relaying the replaced transaction(s).</summary>
