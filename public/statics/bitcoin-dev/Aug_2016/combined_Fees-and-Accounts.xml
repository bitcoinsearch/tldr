    <summary>Using bitcoind as a platform can be made easier with the use of pre-built solutions like BitGo, which is a company that provides such services. However, the writer of the message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has two problems with bitcoind that make the platform unusable for many projects.Firstly, it is necessary to ensure that account holders do not overcharge their accounts which can be managed through an integrated account system in bitcoind. Secondly, without accounts, bitcoind is only a person-to-person manual client, making it difficult to build many-to-many automatic "organizations" on top of bitcoind. The writer suggests that deprecating accounts is not a good idea because it makes the platform unusable for many projects.The writer hopes that developers will understand the genuine issues faced by many developers and provide suitable alternatives. Building many-to-many automatic organizations is difficult without accounts, and fees need to be predictable. Currently, it's the best workable option despite the privacy problems with using accounts for off-chain microtransactions.Although not completely trusted, external systems like BitGo can still be useful in detecting incoming payments and moving funds elsewhere for long-term storage. This allows companies to effectively utilize the benefits of bitcoin without having to worry about the technical aspects of using the platform.</summary>
