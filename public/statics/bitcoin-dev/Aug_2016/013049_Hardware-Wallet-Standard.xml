    <summary>In an email thread between Jonas Schnelli and Slush, the former expressed his agreement with the notion that BIP70 is a mess. He also mentioned that he has experience in hardware wallet development and integration, which he describes as "a mess." However, he believes it is too early to define such rigid standards. In response to Slush's proposal of wallet software as a workflow manager, Schnelli stated that the TREZOR concept goes directly against this proposal, as the device itself acts as a server and primary source of workflow management. Therefore, he issued a NACK (Not Acknowledged) for the proposal. The email thread was reminiscent of an XKCD comic strip about competing standards.</summary>
