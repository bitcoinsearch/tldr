    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email, Sergio Demian Lerner raised concerns about transactions sent to IoT devices, which may be rejected if their witness program is too large for the device's implementation-imposed limit. This can result in the loss of bitcoins as the private key is stored on the device, rendering it unable to accept the cloned transaction. Lerner suggests invalidating transactions with a higher witness size than expected by the sender. The design of segwit means that resource constrained devices don't need to receive witness data to verify lite-client merkle-path proofs, which are useless for lite-clients anyway.</summary>
