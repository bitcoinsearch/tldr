    <summary>The proposed BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) is a standardized system for representing Bitcoin addresses over audio. The idea is to take the binary representation of the Bitcoin address in little endian format, divide it into 4 or 2 bit chunks (depending on quality of audio), and generate tones based on those values. The primary motivation behind this proposal is to make it easier to donate to podcasts. The proposal includes error correction built into the protocol. The full specification of the BIP can be found on the proposer's GitHub page at https://github.com/Dako300/BIP-0153.</summary>
