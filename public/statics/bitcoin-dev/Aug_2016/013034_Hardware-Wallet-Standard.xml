    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd expressed his unawareness of any ECC-enabled smart-cards that can sign the specific curve used by Bitcoin. Additionally, he noted that such smart-cards generally only speak higher level protocols than raw signature generation, which would preclude them from signing bitcoin transactions. In response, Nicolas Bacca, CTO of Ledger, suggested that any Java Card supporting ECC can sign on user-supplied Weierstrass curve parameters. He provided a shopping list of such cards at http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvenda/jcsupport.html and recommended the NXP JCOP platform (found in Yubico Neo) as a popular choice. Custom logic for validation can be added to the card.</summary>
