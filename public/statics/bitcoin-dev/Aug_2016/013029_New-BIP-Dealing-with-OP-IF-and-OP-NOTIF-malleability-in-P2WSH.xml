    <summary>The conversation in this context is about a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to fight script malleability. One person expresses concern that any attempt to fight script malleability may be futile, as even leaving one avenue of malleability open is just as bad as having many avenues open. Another person suggests making it a relay rule instead of a soft fork, but Gregory Maxwell argues that relay rules are fragile and it's better to avoid blocking things with relay rules unless they could be made invalid someday. He also brings up the possibility of adversarial behavior by miners who could mine blocks with mutated witnesses using a shared key to gain a propagation advantage. Although it's not the biggest concern, parties doing this would be able to leave behind fee-paying public transactions while using malleability.</summary>
