    <summary>A proposal has been made to enhance the privacy of Bitcoin transactions. The proposed solution involves hiding all inputs and outputs and only publishing the hash of inputs and outputs in the blockchain. The plaintext of inputs and outputs is sent directly to the payee via a private message, and each new owner of the coin will have to store its entire history. To protect against double-spends, the payer also has to publish another hash, which is the hash of the output being spent.However, there are limitations to this proposal. For example, users will know when the coin was spent by the recipient but nothing more. Larger outputs will likely be split into many smaller outputs whose amounts are not much greater than their denominations, and exchanges and large merchants may accumulate large coin histories. To address these limitations, a new privacy-preserving currency called Bitcoin Blockchain Confidential Transactions (BBC) that operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain has been proposed without requiring a hard or soft fork. The same private keys and addresses can be used for both BBC and the base currency BTC.The proposal discusses concerns about the possibility of duplicate spend proofs, where trolls can reference the same output as the authentic transaction and trick miners into mistakenly verifying it. The proposal suggests that to avoid double spends, the proof needs to be signed by the same user who made the original transaction. However, James MacWhyte argues that this is not enough protection against trolls.The design has been questioned for any flaws, but no feedback was given due to other issues being prioritized such as bitfinex drama and mimblewimble. The discussion continues on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, where Henning Kopp from the Institute of Distributed Systems at Ulm University in Germany provides his contact information.Another proposal called Bitcoin Blender Coin (BBC) has also been made, which involves burning regular BTC and sending it to unspendable addresses. Each new owner of the coin will have to store its entire history and when they spend the coin, they must forward the entire history to the next owner and extend it with their own transaction. The proposal goes beyond existing techniques such as CoinJoin and ring signatures, which only obfuscate the transaction graph and Confidential Transactions, which only hide the amounts. However, the proposal has limitations, such as shifting the burden of verification to owners of the coin who would have to back up entire histories of every output that has been sent to them, and requiring them to be online to receive payments.A proposal has been put forward to create a new privacy-preserving currency called Bitcoin Blockchain Confidential Transactions (BBC) that operates on top of the existing Bitcoin blockchain. The goal is to hide both the inputs and outputs of Bitcoin transactions by only publishing their hash in the blockchain, while the plaintext of these is sent directly to the payee via a private message. To ensure that there are no double-spends, the payer must also publish the spend proof, which is the hash of the output being spent. Each transaction must have exactly one input so that coin histories do not grow exponentially but linearly, and only the current owner of the coin needs to store its history. BBC does not require a hard or soft fork and uses the same private keys and addresses as BTC. The proposal acknowledges some limitations such as privacy leakage for users sending a lot of private transactions and the possibility of large merchants accumulating fragmented, outdated, and incomplete coin histories. It suggests using multiple addresses and storing a relatively small amount on each address to avoid this.The proposal also discusses the verification process of transactions on the blockchain and the potential for trolls to reference the same output as an authentic transaction and trick miners into verifying it. While there is no foolproof method to protect against such trolls, the proposal argues that for a double spend to occur, the proof needs to be signed by the same user who made the original transaction.In a separate discussion, James MacWhyte raises questions about whether a transaction is signed by the key pair referenced in the on-chain output and whether verification by miners may be needed. Tony Churyumoff responds that a duplicate spend proof should also be signed by the same user to be considered a double spend and that the troll mentioned in MacWhyte's example is harmless. The author seeks feedback from the community on the proposed design.</summary>
