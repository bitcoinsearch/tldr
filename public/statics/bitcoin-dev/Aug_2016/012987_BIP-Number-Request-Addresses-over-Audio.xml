    <title>BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange on August 10, 2016, members of the bitcoin-dev community discussed the advantages of transmitting a BIP32 public seed instead of a plain address. By sending a public seed, it is impossible for someone to use the transmitted address and trace the total amount of payments to it. One suggestion was to send btc to rick@q32.com and query the TXT record _btc.rick.q32.com, which would contain the address information. This method could work with audio, video, web, and other publishing formats with very little infrastructure change needed. Another suggestion was to use CDMA, which has the property that it just sounds like noise and multiple bits can be sent at once with orthogonal codes. Overall, the discussion centered around finding new and innovative ways to transmit bitcoin payment information without compromising privacy or security.</summary>
