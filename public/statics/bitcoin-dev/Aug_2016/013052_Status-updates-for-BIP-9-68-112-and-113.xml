    <summary>The conversation is about BIP 9 being labeled as only "Informational" in the first place, as it is part of the consensus logic. Luke Jr. mentions that BIP 9 is just informational in advising how other BIPs might deploy themselves, and thus it's a grey area. Wladimir J. van der Laan thinks such an important deployment mechanism shouldn't be just an informational BIP. None of the Authors has commented on changing the type, and it has already been a month. Luke asks if anyone minds if he updates BIP 9 to Final status.</summary>
