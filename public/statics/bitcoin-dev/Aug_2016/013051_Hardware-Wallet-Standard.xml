    <summary>In an email exchange dated August 18, 2016, Jonas Schnelli via Bitcoin-dev raised concerns about defining rigid standards for hardware wallet development and integration. He noted that TREZOR's concept of a device as a server and primary source of workflow management goes against the proposal of wallet software as a workflow manager. Schnelli ultimately gave a NACK or negative acknowledgement to the proposal. Nicolas Bacca, CTO of Ledger, however, provided an ACK or positive acknowledgement for Ledger. He stated that what's necessary to sign a transaction is already well-known and he sees no difference in driving any hardware wallet from the wallet itself or from a third-party daemon implementing a URL scheme. Bacca believes this approach would provide better devices interoperability and easier maintenance and update paths for wallets.</summary>
