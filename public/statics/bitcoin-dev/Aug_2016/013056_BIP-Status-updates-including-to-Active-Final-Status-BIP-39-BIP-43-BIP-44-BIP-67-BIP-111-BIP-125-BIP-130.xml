    <summary>Luke, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) coordinator, has proposed to update several BIPs in two weeks if no objections are raised. The BIPs that seem ready for updating to Final Status are BIP 39, BIP 44, BIP 67, BIP 125, and BIP 130. BIP 39 is used by many wallets and hundreds of thousands of users. BIP 44 appears to be implemented by multiple wallets, while BIP 67 has implementations in multiple wallet software. BIP 125 has been implemented in Bitcoin Core and derivatives and is in regular use on the network. BIP 130 has also been implemented in Bitcoin Core and derivatives.Luke has also proposed to upgrade the Status of BIP 43, an informational BIP, to Active because it appears to guide the creation of new BIPs. Additionally, Luke has asked developers of Bitcoin clients to comment on whether their software supports BIP 111 (NODE_BLOOM service bit) and if they intend to support it in the future. If any clients are using this service bit already, Luke will update BIP 111 to Final Status in two weeks.</summary>
