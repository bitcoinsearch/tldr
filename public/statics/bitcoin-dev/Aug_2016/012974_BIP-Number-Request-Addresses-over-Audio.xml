    <summary>A proposal has been made for a fast, robust and standardized method of representing Bitcoin addresses over audio in the form of a BIP. The binary representation of the Bitcoin address is taken (little endian), chopped up into 4 or 2 bit chunks (depending on type), and generates a tone based upon that value. This idea came about as a way to donate easily to podcasts. The proposed BIP includes error correction built into the protocol. Existing implementations of audio modems should be considered when creating the design. Selected frequencies being harmonics of each other will make nonlinear distortion and detection more difficult, so it may be better to use techniques such as trellis modulation or other convolutional codes. Defining channel models to simulate various use cases will help to determine if requirements have been met. Thomas briefly considered using audio to exchange transactions with a hardware wallet, and found that using GNU Radio made the implementation much easier.</summary>
