    <summary>Bitcoin Knots version 0.13.0.knots20160814 has been released with various new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Windows XP is no longer supported from this release onwards, therefore users are suggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows or install an alternative OS that is supported. With Compact Blocks support, ordinary non-mining nodes can download and upload blocks faster if those blocks were produced by miners using similar transaction filtering policies. Various code modernizations have been done including C++11 and Python 3. The mining transaction selection algorithm has been replaced with an algorithm that selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions. Low-level P2P changes have been made and the P2P alert system has been removed. Bitcoin Knots 0.13.0 also brought low-level RPC and ZMQ changes, transaction relay mechanism redesign, and updating the mempool command. There have also been several other RPC changes including new commands and the removal of old ones. Other changes include improved block and transaction handling with more efficient mapTx indices and the implementation of "feefilter" P2P message.The latest version of Bitcoin Core, v0.13.1, includes a number of performance and privacy improvements, as well as bug fixes and updates to the build system. There are also several GUI improvements, including the ability to show details for multiple transactions, user confirmation delay for sending, an option to disable the system tray icon and more. Additionally, there are a number of updates to the build system, including support for C++11, and various bug fixes. The release notes detail each individual change, including links to the relevant pull requests on Github. The Bitcoin core developers have released a new version of the software, version 0.13.1, which contains a number of bug fixes and improvements. Among the changes for the network are #8288, which introduces a network-specific example address, and #8407, which adds a dbcache migration path. Additionally, there have been several changes to the wallet, including #8219, which improves the CWallet API with new AccountMove function, and #8035, which adds a simplest BIP32/deterministic key generation implementation. Other changes include #8256, which fixes a bitcoin-qt crash, and #8129, which fixes an issue with the RPC console auto completer.Finally, some changes have been made to the user interface, such as adding a link to the Bitcoin-Core repository and website to the About Dialog, and adding a bitcoin address label to request payment QR code. The release notes provide more detail on these changes.</summary>
