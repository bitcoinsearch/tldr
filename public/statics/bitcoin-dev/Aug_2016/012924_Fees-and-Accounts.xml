    <summary>The writer has two problems with bitcoind that make the platform unusable for many projects. First, if there are accounts, it is necessary to ensure that account holders do not overcharge their accounts. To do this, the writer can use "createrawtransaction() + fundrawtransaction() + signrawtransaction()" and then make sure the transaction can be paid by an account. However, since accounts have been deprecated and there is no sendrawtransactionfrom() method, the writer either has to build their own account system or speculate that they will not be able to untangle the account code and hack their bitcoind to have a sendfrom with a fixed fee parameter that overrides the size multiplication. The second problem is that without accounts, bitcoind is only a person-to-person manual client. To build many-to-many automatic "organizations" on top of bitcoind, accounts and predictable fees are necessary. The writer suggests that deprecating accounts is not a good idea because it makes the platform unusable for many projects. The writer claims to have been mining since 2011 on FPGAs and built bitcoinbankbook.com two years ago. When discovering that once transactions will require fees and that the system is not able to handle fees with accounts, the writer stopped developing everything related to bitcoin. Finally, the writer hopes that the developers understand that they are not trolling but rather pointing out genuine issues faced by many developers. Without accounts, building many-to-many automatic organizations is difficult, and fees need to be predictable. The privacy problems with using accounts for off-chain microtransactions notwithstanding, currently, it's the best workable option.</summary>
