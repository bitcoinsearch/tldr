    <summary>On the Bitcoin development mailing list, Johnson Lau announced a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to deal with OP_IF and OP_NOTIF malleability in P2WSH. However, Luke Dashjr questioned the need for such a proposal since SegWit transactions are already non-malleable. Although SegWit txids cannot be modified, SegWit transactions as a whole can still be tampered with, posing potential legal issues and increasing fees. A better approach, according to Peter Todd, would be to introduce a separate CHECKBOOLVERIFY opcode that ensures the top item on the stack is a minimally encoded true or false value, allowing script writers to opt into this behavior.</summary>
