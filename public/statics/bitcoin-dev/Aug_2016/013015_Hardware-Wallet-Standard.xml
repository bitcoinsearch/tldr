    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread on August 16, 2016, Jonas Schnelli proposed two approaches to communicate with signing-devices app. However, he suggested that the pipe approach could be dropped as major platforms support the URI approach. Luke-Jr disagreed and stated that while the plugin implementation posed a security risk, it would be best if the hardware protocol were standardized. This would eliminate the need for any sort of plugin installation. Some hardware wallets have already started implementing Trezor's interface, which could serve as a good place to start.</summary>
