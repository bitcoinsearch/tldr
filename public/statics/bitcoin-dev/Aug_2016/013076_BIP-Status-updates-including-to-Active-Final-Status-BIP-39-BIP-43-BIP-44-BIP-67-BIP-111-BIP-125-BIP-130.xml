    <summary>In this conversation thread, a method for sequentially scanning blockchain transactions is discussed. The technique involves starting with the genesis block or a block around the time BIP44 was written and generating new addresses when necessary. The discussion then raises a hypothetical scenario where a user has given out 21 addresses, but only address21 has received funds immediately while address0 receives funds after +180 days. This scenario triggers a resize+20 of the address-lookup-window, but the scanning process would need to go back 180 days to detect the transaction on address21 in that case. The discussion ends with a question about whether there is a misunderstanding in this hypothetical scenario.</summary>
