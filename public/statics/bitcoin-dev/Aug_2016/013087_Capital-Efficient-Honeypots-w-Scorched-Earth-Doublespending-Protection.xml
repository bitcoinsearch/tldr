    <summary>In a discussion on honeypots, James MacWhyte clarified that honeypots are not meant to look like regular but poorly-secured assets. He explained that most servers have no reason to have Bitcoins accessible through them, so if there are BTC private keys present, it is an indicator that the server is part of a honeypot. In response to a question about whether intruders would avoid touching anything in a honeypot and wait for a non-bait target to appear, MacWhyte referred to the "scorched earth" disincentive to doublespend the intruder.</summary>
