    <summary>In an email exchange on August 16, 2016, Pieter Wuille and Russell O'Connor discussed a method of preventing transaction mining. O'Connor suggested that not relaying a transaction would be more effective than messing with the witness to prevent mining. However, Wuille pointed out that if there are two conflicting transactions, only one will end up paying the fee. Wuille also stated that relaying two transactions for the price of one could expose the p2p network to a cheap DDoS attack. O'Connor then asked if replace by fee could be used similarly or if there were limits to it.</summary>
