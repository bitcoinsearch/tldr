    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.13.0 has been released with a number of new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. However, users of Windows XP are no longer supported due to the end of support from Microsoft in 2014 and various reports of Bitcoin Core randomly crashing on Windows XP. The latest version includes an increase in database cache memory to 300 MiB to improve the performance of the UTXO set. Additionally, Segregated Witness is included in this release, but it is not yet specified for mainnet. Mining transaction selection ("Child Pays For Parent") has also been replaced with an algorithm that selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions.Low-level P2P and RPC changes have also been made, including the removal of the P2P alert system and vfReachable, and the implementation of “feefilter” P2P message. Other changes include the addition of detailed statistics for individual mempool entries and the ability to calculate in-mempool ancestors or descendants of a transaction in RPC calls. Asm script outputs have also been changed, with OP_NOP2 renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by BIP 65, and OP_NOP3 to OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY by BIP 112.New RPC commands include `generatetoaddress`, `importprunedfunds`, `removeprunedfunds`, `signmessagewithprivkey`, `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry`, `createwitnessaddress`, and `addwitnessaddress`. The low-level ZMQ change involves the inclusion of an up-counting sequence number in each ZMQ notification that allows listeners to detect lost notifications.Changes to the GUI include the addition of InMempool() information to transaction details, increased font size options, and autocomplete in the console window. The latest updates to the Bitcoin Core software have been listed in a recent release. These updates include the removal of the reflection from the 'about' icon and the removal of 0-fee from the send dialog. The CWallet API has been improved with new AccountMove and GetAccountPubkey functions, and there is now an HD keypath in CKeyMetadata. Additionally, the OpenSSL AES has been replaced with a ctaes-based version and the importaddress'ed scripts are no longer treated as change. Other updates include fixing bugs, improving the user interface, and adding network-specific examples.</summary>
