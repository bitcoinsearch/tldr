    <summary>Peter Todd has raised the reward for a Bitcoin transaction test on the lightning network to 0.02 BTC (approximately $400 USD). The reward was donated by a few hundred dollars worth of donations. The transaction was mostly claimed at 0.014 BTC ($235) with a fee of 9238 sat/vb. The block it was claimed in was about an hour after the default mempool filled up. The block included two alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org transactions, one paying $7.88 (309sat/vb). The timeline shows that block 763148 was mined at 13:12 UTC, which was the last one that had a minimum fee.</summary>
