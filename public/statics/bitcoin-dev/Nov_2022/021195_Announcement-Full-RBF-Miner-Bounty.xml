    <title>Announcement: Full-RBF Miner Bounty</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Erik Aronesty pointed out that technically, all that's needed is for miners to consistently mine "full RBF" transactions or the ones with the highest fee-rate. This can incentivize miners to mine transactions that double spend a previous transaction that isn't RBF. In response, Peter Todd announced a full-RBF bounty program for miners. The program involves broadcasting full-RBF replacements that pay extremely high fees to reward miners who turn on full-RBF, starting at $100 per block in times of congestion. According to Todd, miners will earn more money and help transition Bitcoin to a more secure mempool policy based on economic incentives rather than trust. Miners can participate by using the mempool full-rbf=1 option in the upcoming Bitcoin Core v24 release or modifying the code themselves. They would also need a full-RBF peer, which Todd runs.</summary>
