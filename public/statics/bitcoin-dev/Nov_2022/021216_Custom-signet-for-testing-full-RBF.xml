    <summary>A person has set up a custom signet for testing full Replace-By-Fee (RBF), and Bitcoin Developers are invited to participate. The nodes can be connected using `addnode` with the given IP address or through i2p or onion nodes. An example configuration is provided, and a simple test case is presented where two nodes are run and connected, and Tx1 is broadcasted using one node and replaced with Tx2 using `bumpfee` RPC on the other node. Bitcoin addresses can be posted in the "full-rbf room" to show interest in testing. The experiment may proceed towards setting up an explorer if it proves successful. The email was sent using Proton Mail secure email.</summary>
