    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, has launched a full-RBF bounty program for miners. This program rewards miners that turn on full-RBF by broadcasting full-RBF replacements paying high fees. Although this program is starting small, just ~$100/block in times of congestion, Todd notes that miner and pool profit margins are pretty small, so it doesn't take much more money to make a difference. The purpose of the program is to help transition Bitcoin to a more secure mempool policy based on economic incentives rather than trust. Miners interested in participating can use the mempoolfullrbf=1 option in the upcoming Bitcoin Core v24 release or modify the code themselves by removing the opt-in RBF check. Once miners have enabled full-RBF, they need a full-RBF peer. Todd runs a few of these nodes using a preferential peering patch to ensure that full-RBF nodes are interconnected with each other and replacements can easily propagate. He also invites interested parties to contact him if they want to peer with a private node.To donate to the effort, individuals can send BTC to bc1qagmufdn6rf80kj3faw4d0pnhxyr47sevp3nj9m. While some people may be hesitant to donate based on their opinions of Todd's Twitter activity, others may see the importance of the program and choose to contribute. Todd acknowledges that miners could collect this bounty in other ways, such as raising minimum fees, but he is not too concerned about this possibility because it would also break zeroconf.</summary>
