    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bram Cohen suggested that Bitcoin should consider using verkle trees instead of merkle trees for their lower size and cost. However, Peter Todd responded that implementing verkle trees would introduce significant complexity and new cryptographic assumptions, and it may be better to let other crypto-systems get more experience with them before adding them to Bitcoin. Todd also argued that even having merkle trees in Bitcoin could be considered a mistake, as they allow for weak security modes like SPV. Todd's full response can be found on his website.</summary>
