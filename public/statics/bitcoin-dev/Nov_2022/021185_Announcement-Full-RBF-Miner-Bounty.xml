    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, has started a full-RBF bounty program for miners. He is broadcasting full-RBF replacements with extremely high fees to reward miners that turn on full-RBF. The rewards are starting small at just around $100/block in times of congestion, but he has received a few hundred dollars worth of donations and has raised the reward to about 0.02 BTC or $400 USD at current prices. However, this does not mean that there will always be a $400 fee transaction in the full-rbf mempool. Todd has to take precautions to avoid the double-spend transaction being mined by accident, such as only spending txouts with &gt;2 confirmations, and waiting significant amounts of time before the first transaction is sent to allow for maximal propagation. If someone wants to donate to this effort, they can send BTC to bc1qagmufdn6rf80kj3faw4d0pnhxyr47sevp3nj9m.</summary>
