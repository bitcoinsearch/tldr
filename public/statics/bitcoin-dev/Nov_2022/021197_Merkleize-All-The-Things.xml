    <summary>Salvatore Ingala, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, has shared his approach on using covenants to enable general smart contracts in Bitcoin. The notes can be found on Merkle.fun. The proposal is being questioned for its similarity to Gregory Maxwell's script on zero-knowledge contingent payments (ZKCP) from 2016. Dave, another member of the mailing list, is requesting Salvatore to describe how his proposal significantly differs in application from ZKCP.</summary>
