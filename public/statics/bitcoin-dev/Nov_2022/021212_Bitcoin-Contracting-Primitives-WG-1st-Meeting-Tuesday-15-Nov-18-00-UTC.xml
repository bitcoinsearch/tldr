    <summary>On November 15th, a new community process began for Bitcoin developers to discuss various topics such as anyprevout, recursive covenants, introspection, new malleability flags, ZK rollups, new contracting protocols, and many other ideas. CTV: BIP-119 OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY was suggested as the easiest and best possible way to get covenants aka tx introspection, with a lot of research and development. The communication venue for this is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat. Contributions are welcome, and attendees are encouraged to share their expectations, ideas, and subjects of interest related to this new covenants/contracting primitives R&amp;D process. The frequency of these meetings will be monthly for now. The first session happened on November 15th, which included listening to everyone's thoughts about what could be the scope discussed by this new community process. There is no consistent agenda beyond this, and it would be great to have a schedule inclusive of most time zones. If someone has been working on a contracting protocol/side-chain/roll-up or any other use-case that could benefit from extended Bitcoin contracting primitives, they are encouraged to open an issue at https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg/issues. Antoine Riard reminded the group of the first session on November 14th, and proposed Tuesday, November 15th at 18:00 UTC as the start date for the meetings. He also suggested thinking about a monthly frequency for now. The communication venue is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat. There has been a suggestion of jitsi/audio-based meetings rather than IRC, but this comes with trade-offs.</summary>
