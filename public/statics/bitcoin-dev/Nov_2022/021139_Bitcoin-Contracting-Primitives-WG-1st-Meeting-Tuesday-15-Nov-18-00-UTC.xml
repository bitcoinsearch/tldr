    <summary>A Bitcoin contracting primitives research and development group will hold its first meeting on Tuesday, November 15th at 18:00 UTC. The group is looking for attendees' expectations, ideas, and interests for the covenant/contracting primitives R&amp;D process. The monthly meeting will be held in the #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg channel on Libera Chat. If a better schedule needs to be arranged to avoid conflicting with other public engineering meetings in the Bitcoin space, it can be discussed during the first session. There is no consistent agenda beyond discussion of topics of interest to attendees. An issue tracker has been created on GitHub for anyone working on contracting protocols, side-chains, rollups, or other use-cases that could benefit from extended Bitcoin contracting primitives. The group may use jitsi/audio-based meetings instead of IRC, but there are trade-offs. The meeting time may not be inclusive of all time zones, so a schedule change may be considered.</summary>
