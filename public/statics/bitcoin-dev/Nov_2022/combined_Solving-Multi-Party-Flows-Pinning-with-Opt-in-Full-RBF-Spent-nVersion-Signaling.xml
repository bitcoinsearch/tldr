    <summary>The conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the issue of pinning contracting protocols funding flows with opt-out double-spend. The problem arises when multi-party collaborative flows are subjected to a low-cost and high-success DoS vector with asymmetric damages, where a single input can bleed the time value of the remaining inputs or engage in a MEV attack. Currently, there is no mechanism to require replacement signaling provable to a third party only on the knowledge of the UTXO spents.A solution proposed is implementing an opt-in Full-Replace-by-Fee Spent-nVersion Signaling policy where a confirmed transaction is considered to have opted-in to allowing replacement of any of its spends if the last bit of the nVersion field is set. This protects the collaborative participants of a multi-party flow that the target transaction should propagate to the miners if the fee/feerate offered are the best ones without opt-out based pinning. Although this new policy enforcement efficiency is still dependent on the existence of relay paths and support at the endpoints that matter, the miner mempools.The conversation also discusses the impact of rule #3 and rule #5 on coinjoin scenarios. Even with fullrbf-everywhere and V3, pinning via these rules can be an issue. Double-spending counterparties can cause pain per peer, and violating rule #5 is contained to coinjoins with around 50 peers. However, there's no hard technical reason for rule #5 to exist, and it's simply a conservative DoS limit. It's important to note that exploiting these rules costs money, and while we shouldn't assume they will always exist, they do impact things today.In the same context, the conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list mentions Antoine Riard suggesting an alternative solution to solve multi-party funding pinning instead of wide deployment of full-RBF. However, Peter Todd strongly disagreed and said that incurring engineering costs and harming privacy for the sake of a very marginal use case like zeroconf is ridiculous. He added that if anything, they should be moving to full-RBF so that the privacy cost of opt-in-RBF can be undone. Greg Maxwell also mentions that even with fullrbf-everywhere and V3, pinning via rule#3 and rule#5 are still an issue in coinjoin scenarios.The conversation concludes that although there are potential solutions to these issues, it's necessary to realize incentive alignment with hashrate is what matters in terms of transaction-relay rules.</summary>
