    <summary>Alicexbt has set up a custom signet for testing full RBF and has provided nodes to connect to along with an example configuration and test case. The -mempoolfullrbf configuration option is available on the recent Bitcoin Core 24.0 release for mainnet and default signet, but there may be advantages to testing on a smaller custom signet network starting from scratch. Alicexbt had no issues setting up the signet using instructions from the Bitcoin wiki, but noted that some people have struggled with this in the past. They are the sole block signer and are mining blocks regularly with default settings, running the custom signet node on the same machine as other nodes without issue. While mainstream miners and dictators did not respond or agree to use full RBF, Alicexbt believes testing is important and encourages others to try the experiment.</summary>
