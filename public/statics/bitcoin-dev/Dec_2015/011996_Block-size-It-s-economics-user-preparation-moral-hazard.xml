    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Pieter Wuille suggested that it is important to communicate that deciding consensus rules is not within anyone's power. He also mentioned that nobody has the power to change consensus rules legitimately but can only build it and hope enough people find it acceptable to adopt. In response, someone offered a reward of bitcoin to those who can prove they suffered from a May 5, 2016 hardfork to 2MB blocks. Jeff Garzik chimed in with his support for an early and conservative increase to avoid a radical "Economic Change Event" at least in the next halving cycle and proposed May 5, 2016, as the hard fork date, giving enough buffer before halving for caution and iteration. They also discussed the dynamic between devs and Chinese miners who want concrete proposals from them and the potential timeline for SW implementation.</summary>
