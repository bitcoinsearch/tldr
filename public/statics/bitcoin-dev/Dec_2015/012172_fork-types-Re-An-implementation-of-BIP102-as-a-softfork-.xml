    <summary>The context discusses the difference between soft forks and hard forks in the context of segregated witness (SW) implementation. Segregated witness is a soft-fork that is backwards and forwards compatible by design, similar to P2SH. Soft forks have an advantage over hard forks as they do not leave behind a weak chain that could result in the loss of money. However, there is another type of fork called firm hard fork that can do the same but for format changes that are not possible with a soft-fork. Extension blocks show that a more general backwards and forwards compatible soft-fork is also possible, but segregated witness is simpler. The context also mentions the use of the strategy pattern to help with code structure.</summary>
