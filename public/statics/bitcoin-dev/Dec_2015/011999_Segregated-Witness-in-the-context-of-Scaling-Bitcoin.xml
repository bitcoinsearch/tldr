    <summary>The Bitcoin community is debating whether to implement Segregated Witness (SegWitness or SW) as a soft fork or opt for a hard fork block size increase. Matt Corallo via bitcoin-dev argues that SW will be quicker to deploy than a hard fork, which could take up to two years after the code is shipped. However, Jeff Garzik via bitcoin-dev raises concerns about the slow pace of rollout (as it would require months of analysis and upgrades to software) and the fact that SW creates two fee markets with separate and distinct behaviors and resource values, thus creating more complexity and risks. Additionally, there are new under-analyzed attack surfaces to consider, such as the possibility of some network attacks that cause some clients to degrade down from extended block to core block mode temporarily. Garzik concludes that a "short term bump" hard fork block size increase may better address economic and ecosystem risks than SW, and recommends pursuing both options independently.</summary>
