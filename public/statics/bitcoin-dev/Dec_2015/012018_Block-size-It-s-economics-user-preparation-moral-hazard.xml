    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, responded to Jeff Garzik's proposal that the development team should sign a note stating their desire to transition to a new economic policy. Wuille stated that the Bitcoin Core development team is not responsible for making changes to network consensus rules in order to satisfy economic demand as it would indicate that Bitcoin has failed. Wuille proposed using Segregated Witness as a first step towards addressing some of the issues, including the degree of certainty needed for a hard fork. However, Garzik argued that Segregated Witness does not solve all of the problems and there remains major economic risk due to the core block size freeze, which could cause major market and actor disruption. He suggested a short term bump to address this problem.</summary>
