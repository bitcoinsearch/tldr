    <summary>The author of a post is appealing the moderator's decision and believes that their post was not off-topic, but rather a compromise proposal for developers. The proposal involves both a hard fork and a soft fork, with gradual growth instead of big step functions. The details of the proposal include a gradual growth hard fork with a 95% activation threshold and a one-month grace period, as well as a soft fork Segregated Witness limited to 1MB for the first two years after deployment.The author suggests that the hard fork be coded, merged, and deployed first, followed by the soft fork, and then the hard fork activated provided it passes its vote. The proposal does not preclude further hard forks at any time, either before or after the proposed compromise hard fork, although it is specifically intended to discourage contentious hard forks.The proposal aims to provide immediate relief on fees and growth potential while locking in a temporary modest growth path. It is made up of uncontroversial elements of other proposals that would discourage a contentious hard fork.</summary>
