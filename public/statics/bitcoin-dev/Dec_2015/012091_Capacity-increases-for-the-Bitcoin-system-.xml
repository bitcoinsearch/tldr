    <summary>On December 20, 2015, Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev discussed solving several unrelated problems at the same time, such as fraud proofs, script extensibility, and malleability. There was a question whether this meant "actually implementing" or just making future implementation theoretically possible. The implementation of SW (Segregated Witness) would involve the creation of a new network message for relaying fraud proofs, a specification that SPV wallet developers can use to validate these messages, and the ability to automatically generate and broadcast these proofs in Bitcoin Core. Two non-text attachments were included: an application/pgp-keys file and an application/pgp-signature file.</summary>
