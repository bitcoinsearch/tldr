    <summary>On December 20, 2015, Jeff Garzik via bitcoin-dev proposed adding a new type of transaction output in the Bitcoin protocol, to reduce the amount of data required for spending old transaction outputs. Chris Pacia responded with concerns that this would reverse the useful minimization attribute of HD wallets and suggested extending the bip37 filter matching algorithm to serve up the proof. Pacia also noted that server-based wallets could preserve the "just backup the seed" functionality if they did the same. In response, it was argued that there is no difference from the status quo as the information necessary to generate the TXO-unspent proof required to spend an old txout is already out there. The discussion took place on the Linux Foundation's mailing list for Bitcoin developers.</summary>
