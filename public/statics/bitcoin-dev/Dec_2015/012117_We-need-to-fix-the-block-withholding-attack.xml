    <summary>On December 26, 2015, Eric Lombrozo via bitcoin-dev posted a message discussing the effects of longer confirmation times, lower throughput, and lower miner revenue. According to Lombrozo, confirmations would represent more proof-of-work (PoW), meaning that fewer confirmations would be needed to achieve the same level of security. However, a reader responded by stating that if mining revenue per unit of time drops, total PoW per unit of time should also drop. It is unclear whether increasing the inter-block time would necessarily result in higher PoW per block.</summary>
