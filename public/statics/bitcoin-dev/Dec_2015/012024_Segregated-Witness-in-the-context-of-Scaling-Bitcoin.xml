    <summary>The email conversation between Anthony Towns and others in the Bitcoin development community discusses the potential gains of implementing Segregated Witness (SegWit) alongside BIP 102. SegWit provides a 75% discount to witness data with the same limit, allowing for more efficient use of block space. For example, at a 1MB limit, this might result in 2.05MB made up of 650kB of base block data plus 1.4MB of witness data. With 2-2 multisig transactions using SegWit, there is about a 2.03x gain compared to P2SH. Pay to public key hash with SegWit can also move about half the transaction data into the witness, giving a 1.6x improvement by Anthony's calculations. The email concludes that BIP 102 + SW would bring a gain between 2*1.6 and 2*2, potentially allowing for a maximum virtual block size of 3.6 MB.</summary>
