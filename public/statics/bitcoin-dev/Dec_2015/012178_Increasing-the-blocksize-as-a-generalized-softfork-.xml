    <summary>In an email from Jonathan Toomim, he stated that the generalized softfork method has the advantage of being merge-mined. However, there are two types of soft-forks regarding mining. The first kind involves new validation rules by data-hiding from non-upgraded modes, and the second kind involves no new validation logic. Those who aren’t validating transactions should be deprived of revenue because their role is transaction validation, not brute forcing sha256d. This makes Toomim strongly against the idea of a generalized soft fork. He also stated that upgraded nodes and non-upgraded nodes cannot end up with the same UTXO set. Toomim went on to express his liking for the “zombie mode” method which would enter into effect once a chain is seen to be six or more blocks ahead of the chain tip. However, he noted that voluntary action was a problem since nodes would need to upgrade to a version long before the fork. Bob McElrath contributed to the conversation quoting H.L. Mencken saying, “For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.”</summary>
