    <summary>The email conversation between Luke Durback and Jorge Timón on the Bitcoin developers mailing list discusses the feasibility of using Bitcoin's scripting language for voting on proposals. Durback proposes a design that would allow users to "mark" their BTC as being "For Proposition X" and cancel the vote as soon as the BTC is spent again. However, he struggles with finding a design that would allow this to work in the context of transactions. Timón suggests time locking the votes and using covenants instead of recursion or Turing completeness. The conversation also touches on charging fees for complex scripts and the use cases for decentralized exchanges and paying creators through Bitcoin functions.</summary>
