    <summary>The discussion revolves around two proposals for increasing the block size of Bitcoin. The first proposal is SegWit soft fork, which limits non-witness data to 1MB and provides features such as opt-in malleability protection, required by higher-level scaling solutions. The second proposal is BIP102, a hard fork with a simple increase of the block size to 2MB, which requires everyone to upgrade. The author argues that despite being a soft fork, SegWit is complex and may take longer to deploy than BIP102, which can be deployed in less than a month. However, some counter-argue that once the code for SegWit is ready, it can be deployed quickly. The author suggests two proposals: the primary proposal is to consult major miners and merchants if they support an one-off rise to 2MB, release 0.11.3 with BIP102 with ISM vote requiring 80% of hashing power, and allow the first day a 2MB block on June 1, 2016, followed by releasing SWSF before December 31, 2016. The secondary proposal is to work on SWSF and have a deadline of June 1, 2016, and push an urgent BIP102 if the deadline is not met.</summary>
