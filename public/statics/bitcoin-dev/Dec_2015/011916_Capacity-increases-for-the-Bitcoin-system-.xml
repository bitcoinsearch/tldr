    <summary>On December 9th, 2015, Jorge Timón and Gregory Maxwell discussed the possibility of a hardfork for Bitcoin. Timón disagreed with Maxwell's suggestion that making a softfork and then moving the commitment later would be less disruptive. He asked how long after the softfork they should do the hardfork. Maxwell responded that it would be logical to do as part of a hardfork that moved commitments generally and suggested including a better position for merged mining, room for commitments to additional block back-references for compact SPV proofs, and/or UTXO set commitments. However, he noted that the requirements for these other things are not yet well defined, and the additional overhead would be more meaningful than for fraud proofs.</summary>
