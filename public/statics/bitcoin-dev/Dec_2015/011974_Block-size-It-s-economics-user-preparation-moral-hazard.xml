    <summary>In an email exchange with Jeff Garzik on Dec 16, 2015, Pieter Wuille expressed his opinion that the Bitcoin Core development team's responsibility should be to keep the system running and merge uncontroversial consensus changes. He believes that hard forking changes require widespread agreement, as merging them without it would undermine the system's value and establish the development team as the de-facto central bank. Wuille is personally fine with a short-term small block size bump if that is what the ecosystem desires, but only if he is convinced that there is no strong opposition to it from others. Instead of hard forks, Wuille proposed a soft fork approach that includes Segregated Witness as a first step, which solves several issues at the same time without requiring the degree of certainty needed for a hardfork.</summary>
