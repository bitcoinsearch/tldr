    <summary>A thread from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses a proposal to simplify the BIP number assignment process by allowing anyone to open a pull request and use the PR # as the BIP #. This would avoid conflicts and eliminate the need for manual assignment. However, it may result in some numbers going unused if PRs are opened to update existing BIPs. The process can still be independent from approving/merging the BIP into master, provided it meets quality standards. One user suggests that assigning BIP numbers should only occur after significant adoption to avoid headaches caused by the current system. Another user notes that the Bitcoin consensus protocol development process is often backwards, with the code being written before the human-readable reference explaining it (the BIP).</summary>
