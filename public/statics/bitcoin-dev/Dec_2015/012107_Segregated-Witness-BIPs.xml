    <summary>A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been drafted for the SW payment address format and is currently awaiting BIP number assignment. This is the third BIP for segwit, with the second one for Peer Services being prepared by Eric Lombrozo. The BIPs are based on earlier discussions from Pieter Wuille's implementation. Three separate BIPs are being considered: a Consensus BIP, a Peer Services BIP, and an Applications BIP. The Consensus BIP has already been submitted as a draft and deals with witness structures, cost metrics and limits, scripting systems (witness programs), and the soft fork mechanism. The other two BIPs will be drafted soon. The Peer Services BIP will cover relay message structures, witnesstx serialization, and other issues pertaining to the p2p protocol such as IBD, synchronization, tx and block propagation. Lastly, the Applications BIP will focus on scriptPubKey encoding formats and other wallet interoperability concerns.</summary>
