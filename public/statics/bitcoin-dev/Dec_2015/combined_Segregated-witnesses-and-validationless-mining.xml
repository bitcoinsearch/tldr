    <summary>Segregated witnesses is a feature in Bitcoin that separates transaction information from the information proving those transfers were legitimate, making validationless mining easier and more profitable than the current status quo. However, this can be fixed by changing the protocol to make having a copy of the previous block's (witness) data a precondition to creating a block. Validationless mining is when a miner creates a new, valid, block building upon another miner's block without validating it. With segregated witnesses, miners can reduce latency and improve their profitability. To fix the issue of the main code path that creates blocks doing no validation at all, there should be a previous witness data proof requirement for creating a block with transactions. This solution is a soft-fork. It is also proposed that adding a random selection of previous blocks to the previous witness data proof solution could solve the problem of miner theft and currency inflation. In an IRC discussion, there was a debate about what should be required from the current block to calculate the previous block possession proof. The requirement of coinbase outputs restricts some mining setups while requiring a commitment to the current block's transaction outputs restricts tx selection outsourcing schemes. It was suggested that the nonce can be picked arbitrarily and if it is arbitrary then a future soft-fork can add commitments to the current block contents. Thus, the previous block proof can be simple H( + ). Fraud proofs in relation to previous block content proofs were also brought up by Pieter Wuille. If the possession proof is structured as a merkle tree then fraud can be easily proven with a merkle path.On December 28th, 2015, an IRC discussion took place regarding various updates related to Bitcoin. The discussion involved topics such as prior-block possession proofs, fraud proofs, non-fraud correctness proofs, commitments and segwit. However, the details of the IRC discussion remain unknown. In an email thread, the author of the email requested for the link to the IRC discussion.Peter Todd, a bitcoin developer, proposed a solution to return segregated witnesses to the status quo. This requires making having the previous block's witness data be a precondition to creating a block with transactions. Blocks must include the previous witness data, hashed with a different hash function that the commitment in the previous block. This solution is a soft-fork and is compatible with existing miner/hasher setups. However, it may face pushback from miners who are currently using validationless mining techniques. In conclusion, there are ongoing discussions and proposals to fix issues related to segregated witnesses and validationless mining in Bitcoin. The proposed solutions include requiring a previous witness data proof for creating a block with transactions and adding a random selection of previous blocks to the previous witness data proof solution. Additionally, there have been debates on what should be required from the current block to calculate the previous block possession proof.</summary>
