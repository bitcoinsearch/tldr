    <summary>In a thread on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Vincent Truong expressed his concern about the possibility of users losing their unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) due to a change in the Bitcoin protocol. However, he misunderstood jl2012's post, which clarified that the UTXOs would still be spendable, but transactions would require a membership proof to spend them. This means that users don't have to store the data themselves, but they must obtain it from somewhere, such as archive nodes that serve this purpose. Peter Todd has proposed a similar approach with "STXO commitments," but some argue that the membership proofs can become too large and may trade bandwidth for storage. Nonetheless, the membership proofs could be omitted when transmitting to nodes that have signaled they have kept historical data. Participants in the Bitcoin-dev list were urged to be conservative with the send button and avoid reflexive opposition to moderately complex ideas that they don't understand to maintain the utility of the list.</summary>
