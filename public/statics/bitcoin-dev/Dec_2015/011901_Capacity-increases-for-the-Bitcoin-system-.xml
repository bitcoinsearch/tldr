    <summary>On December 9, 2015, Gregory Maxwell initiated a discussion on bitcoin-dev regarding the possibility of moving the height to a more accessible place. Gavin Andresen, in response, stated that the height has almost never been problematic and is already consensus critical enforcement. He also mentioned that it would be preferable to perform the primary change in a backwards compatible manner to reduce risk and avoid introducing technical debt. Maxwell proposed replacing CBlockHeader::hashMerkleRoot (and CBlockIndex's) with a hash of the following struct: struct hashRootStruct{uint256 hashMerkleRoot;uint256 hashWitnessesRoot;int32_t nHeight;}In response to Maxwell's proposal, Andresen argued that all wallet software would need to adapt their software twice if the change were made. He suggested avoiding controversy and splitting up risks by deploying uncontroversial hardforks with small risks as described in BIP99.</summary>
