    <summary>During a trip to China, the author conducted an informal survey with miners regarding block size increase proposals. The results of the survey are presented in a table that shows what each miner would accept or prefer for a block size increase, and what they consider too slow or too fast. F2Pool prefers the 2-4-8 proposal, while AntPool/Bitmain suggest getting miners and developers together for a few rounds of voting to decide on which plan to implement. Bitfury suggests fixing performance issues before increasing block size to 4 MB, and evaluating a plan that includes 8 MB blocks in the future assuming the performance fixes will be implemented. KnCMiner is okay with anything reasonable, while BTCC Pool would rather have support from Bitcoin Core but may be willing to run a fork if necessary. The author notes that positions are subject to change and that SegWit was not discussed during the conversations with miners. The author's brother is working on a tool to facilitate further voting on block size increase proposals.</summary>
