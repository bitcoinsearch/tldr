    <summary>In an email exchange, Bryan Bishop denies the claim of stalling in deploying hard-fork and says that there has been extensive discussion about various block size proposals. The other person accuses him of being condescending and trying to prevent uncomfortable questions from being asked by banning him from the mailing list. He further claims that there have been years of stonewalling, deception, conflicts of interest, and outright crimes. He warns that those who squandered time for preparing a smooth upgrade will own the result if the network experiences a painful upgrade. Two attachments of application/pgp-keys and application/pgp-signature were also included in the email.</summary>
