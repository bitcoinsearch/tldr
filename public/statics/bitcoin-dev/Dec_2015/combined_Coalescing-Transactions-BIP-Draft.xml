    <summary>In a recent post, the author discussed the implementation of "coalescing transactions" using an opcode. However, the author now believes that a new "transaction type" field would be a better approach. The new type field could have various uses, with wildcard inputs being the first. One of the main issues that need to be resolved is limiting the number of inputs included in the coalesce to prevent nodes from taking too long to count them all. To address this issue, the proposed solution is to limit wildcard inputs to 10,000 items. If there are more inputs, they must be coalesced in chunks to avoid slowing down the nodes. Another issue that needs to be addressed is limiting wildcard inputs to only confirmed inputs older than a certain block age. This is to avoid potential problems caused by re-orgs. A draft of the proposal can be found on Github for further review.Overall, the author suggests that implementing a new transaction type field would be a better approach than using an opcode. This new field could have many uses, with wildcard inputs being just one example. The proposed solutions for limiting the number of inputs and avoiding potential problems caused by re-orgs show that careful consideration must be taken when implementing any changes to the system.</summary>
