    <summary>A developer named Jannes Faber has proposed the idea of creating Segregated IBLT (Invertible Bloom Lookup Table) for Bitcoin once Segregated Witness (SW) is implemented. He suggests segregating transactions from signatures and tuning the parameters so that transactions have a slightly higher guarantee and save some space on the signature side. Rusty Russell, a Linux kernel hacker and Bitcoin Core developer, responds to Faber's proposal by stating that if the peer does not want the witnesses, they will not be serialized into the IBLT.</summary>
