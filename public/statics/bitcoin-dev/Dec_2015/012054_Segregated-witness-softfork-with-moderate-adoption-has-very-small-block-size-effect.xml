    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, jl2012 raised concern over the adoption rate of segwit, stating that P2SH has been introduced for 3.5 years and only about 10% of bitcoin is stored this way, and therefore a 1-year adoption rate of 40% for segwit is clearly over-optimistic unless the tx fee becomes really high. Douglas Roark responded by saying that one can not necessarily conflate P2SH and SegWit uptake as P2PKH works just fine for an awful lot of Bitcoin users. He thinks wallet developers will see the value in it and enable it by default, which is the only way SegWit will gain serious traction. The big question, of course, is when they'll enable it by default. Douglas Roark hopes for aggressive timeframes but expects the conservative ones. He also thinks that 40% within a year of deployment is not out of the realm of possibility.</summary>
