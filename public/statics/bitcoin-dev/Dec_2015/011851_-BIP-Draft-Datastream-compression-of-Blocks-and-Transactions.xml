    <summary>In an email conversation between Emin GÃ¼n Sirer and Gavin Andresen on December 2, 2015, Sirer proposed a programming challenge/contest to compress Bitcoin. He suggested that this would be an excellent way to find the best possible, Bitcoin-specific compressor, and it would bring new programmers into the ecosystem. Andresen loved the idea and suggested building a standardized dataset using real data from the network to test against. The proposed dataset would include starting network topology, changes to network topology, transaction broadcasts, and block broadcasts. Proposed transaction/block optimizations could then be measured against this standard dataset.</summary>
