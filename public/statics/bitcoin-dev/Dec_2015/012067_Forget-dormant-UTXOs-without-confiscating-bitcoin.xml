    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in December 2015, Peter Todd proposed the inclusion of a consensus-critical maximum unspent transaction output (UTXO) age as part of the protocol. Under this proposal, UTXOs younger than the maximum age would be expected to be cached, while older ones could be dropped from the cache but still spent with the provision of proof that counts as blockchain space, reflecting the need to broadcast it on the network. Responding to the proposal, another contributor suggested that wallets should generate these proofs now, ahead of introducing the max-age as a planned hard fork several years hence. However, two issues were raised: the status of “grandfathered” UTXOs generated in 2009 and, more fundamentally, the reversal of the useful minimisation attribute of hierarchical deterministic wallets.</summary>
