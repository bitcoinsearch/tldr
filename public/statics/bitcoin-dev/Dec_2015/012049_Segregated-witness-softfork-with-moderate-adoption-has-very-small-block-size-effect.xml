    <summary>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, jl2012 questioned the effect of a soft fork Segregated Witness (SW) implementation on the actual total block size. In response, Peter Todd argued that client-side adoption of SW is a clear sign that the ecosystem as a whole has opted-into a blocksize increase. However, another user commented that client-side adoption of SW only indicates that implementers saw value in it greater than the cost of implementation and not necessarily that they preferred larger blocks. They suggested alternative methods for businesses to explicitly state their preferences such as attaching an OP_RETURN output to transactions or providing hand-signed letters from business heads. Todd acknowledged that SW adoption is not as good as a direct proof-of-stake vote, but it is an interesting side-effect.</summary>
