    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in December 2015, Eric Lombrozo raised concerns about the impact of a soft fork on Bitcoin's confirmation times, throughput and miner revenue. However, another participant in the discussion pointed out that the difficulty would be adjusted to compensate for any decrease in the number of blocks being mined, meaning that the same level of security could be achieved with fewer confirmations. The block interval would also only increase until the next re-target, and slowly increasing the proportion of blocks being discarded would give the algorithm time to adjust. Instantly changing the rule so that 95% of blocks were thrown away could lead to up to 40 weeks until the next retarget and 200 minute block times until adjustment.</summary>
