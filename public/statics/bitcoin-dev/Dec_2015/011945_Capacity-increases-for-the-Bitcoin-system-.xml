    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón in December 2015, they discussed a proposed struct hashRootStruct. The struct included hashMerkleRoot, hashWitnessesRoot, and hashextendedHeader. Timón's design did not calculate other_root, as it was deemed unnecessary for compatibility with Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes and wallets. Andresen pointed out that any code checking merkle paths would have to change if the structure of the merkle tree changed to a three-headed structure at the top; however, if it remained a binary tree, then no changes would be necessary. He also stated that having a merkle tree that is not a binary tree is strange.</summary>
