    <summary>In a message to bitcoin-dev, Ittay expressed concern about the connotations of treating a pool block withholding attack as a weapon, but another user argued that such attacks could be necessary to combat mining centralization via pools. The user stated that miners have a financial incentive to stay relatively small, while pools do not, and suggested that making pooled mining less profitable than solo or p2pool-style mining could be a solution to the problem. Block withholding attacks were proposed as one way to achieve this, despite their negative reputation. The user made it clear that they personally did not intend to perform such an attack, but would condone it if someone else did. They also apologized to pool operators, stating that they had nothing against them personally, but believed that pools are dangerous and wish they did not exist.</summary>
