    <summary>The email thread discusses the minimal consensus rule changes needed for segwit softfork. The changes are listed and include renaming OP_NOP4 as OP_SEGWIT, requiring a script with OP_SEGWIT to fail if the scriptSig is not completely empty, and placing the witness commitment in the block either in coinbase or an OP_RETURN output in a specific transaction. The format of the witness commitment includes a hash-sum tree with the number of sum criteria committed in rule 12, and each sum criterion is a fixed 8 byte signed number. A voting mechanism could be a softfork over rule 12 and 13 to mitigate the risk described in rule 17. The size limit of the witness needs to be determined, and there should be an upper limit for the number of sum criteria to prevent malicious miners from feeding unlimited amounts of garbage to other nodes. All other functions that are mentioned in the wish list could be softforked later to this system.</summary>
