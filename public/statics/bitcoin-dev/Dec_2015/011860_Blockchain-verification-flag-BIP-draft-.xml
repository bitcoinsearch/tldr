    <summary>The email thread discusses the cgminer tool, which powers the majority of the Bitcoin mining network, and its inability to allow a pool to revert to mining on the previous block due to the way chain tracking is implemented. Gavin Andresen suggests a write-up describing the 'accidental selfish mining' problem that this mitigates would be helpful and recommends using bit 0 instead of bit 30 in the draft versionbits BIP and BIP101 to avoid confusion. The discussion also touches upon how SPV clients should be informed about fully validated headers without penalizing the blocks too much. Rusty Russell agrees with Andresen's suggestions and adds that it's easy for SPV clients to decide for themselves.</summary>
