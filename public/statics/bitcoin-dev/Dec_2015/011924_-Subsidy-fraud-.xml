    <summary>A user named "xor" inquired about the term "subsidy fraud" mentioned by Pieter Wuille in his talk, which he had linked to. The user was unable to find any information on the topic through Google or Bitcoin Wiki. The context of the discussion was a miner claiming more in the coinbase's output than allowed by the subsidy and fees. The user suggested that if this is a known issue, it should be explained somewhere for the benefit of others.</summary>
