    <summary>On August 12, 2015, Gavin Andresen via bitcoin-dev proposed a change in the deployment of segwit via a soft fork. He suggested that instead of putting the segwitness merkle root in the coinbase, it should be put in the first output of the generation transaction as an OP_RETURN script. According to him, this is a better pattern because coinbase space is limited while output space is not. In the future, if there's a need to tie another merkle tree to a block, that proposal can be designated for the second output of the generation transaction.The proposal was made via email and included two non-text attachments: 0xEAD9E623.asc (application/pgp-keys) and signature.asc (application/pgp-signature).</summary>
