    <summary>In the discussion thread, several developers are debating over the best method to determine the maximum block size in Bitcoin. One developer suggests using height activation and one step per block, while another argues for median time of the previous block. The original developer expresses interest in hearing from others about possible attacks with different approaches before diverging from the default community approach of switch-based-on-time. Some developers prefer height-based activation because it is simple to code, but others argue that time-based activation is more stable. Easy changes can be made to switch between height and time-based activation. Additionally, some developers suggest using bip9 for 95% miner upgrade confirmation and always picking a difficulty retarget block. They also propose using the sign bit as the "hardfork bit" and adding an initial height in bip9 for soft forks. Finally, there is a brief mention of ntime roll and how it affects pool's ability to issue a job with the max block size unknown.</summary>
