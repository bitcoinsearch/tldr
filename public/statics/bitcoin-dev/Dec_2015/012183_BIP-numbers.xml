    <summary>The process of assigning BIP numbers is questioned by Marco Pontello, who believes it should be a formality to avoid conflicts and BIP spamming. He notes that this process can take months due to the lengthy PR request list, and wonders if there is some historical context he is missing. Peter Todd responds that getting a BIP # assigned is usually the last thing the better-known Bitcoin Core developers do, and explains that the development process is backwards - first, write the protocol specification (code), then write the human-readable reference (BIP). Todd suggests that BIP numbers should only be assigned after significant adoption to prevent headaches caused by the current system.</summary>
