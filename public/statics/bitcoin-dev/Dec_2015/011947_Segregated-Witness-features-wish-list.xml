    <summary>The suggestion of creating a segregated IBLT, to segregate transactions from signatures and tune the parameters such that transactions have a slightly higher guarantee and save space on the signature side, was brought up by Jannes. While IBLT should convey all transactions and all signatures most of the time, in suboptimal situations, at least the receiving miner will be more likely to have all the transactions but possibly not all the signatures. This improvement does not improve the worst adversarial case for IBLT block propagation, but it should improve the effectiveness in cases where the "normal" IBLT would fail to deliver all transactions. The unused space in coin base input script allows the soft-forking of an additional SW Merkle tree root into the design, according to Tamas Blummer.</summary>
