    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in December 2015, a member named Chris Priest questioned whether pools should be responsible for preventing block withholding attacks, rather than the Bitcoin protocol itself. However, it was noted that anonymous hashers in particular make it difficult for pools to effectively prevent such attacks, and changing the Bitcoin protocol may be necessary. The email was signed by a member named Peter with a PGP signature attached.</summary>
