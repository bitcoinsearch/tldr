    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Akiva Lichtner proposed a new method of scaling the Bitcoin network by dividing it into partitions, which would be handled by different miners. This proposal is similar to the sharding proposals, and clients will have to send more than one message in order to spend money under this system. Offloading work to clients for spends has been well-received in the past, as seen with the linearized coin history idea.</summary>
