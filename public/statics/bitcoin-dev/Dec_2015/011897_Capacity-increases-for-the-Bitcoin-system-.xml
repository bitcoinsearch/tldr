    <summary>In an email exchange from December 8, 2015, Jonathan Toomim questioned the safety factor of a block size increase caused by SegWit. According to Toomim, while SegWit would allow for up to 4 MB of data in the worst-case scenario, it would only allow for about 1.75 MB on average. This meant that the mining and block distribution network would need a larger safety factor to handle worst-case situations.However, Toomim argued that SegWit does not reduce the safety factor for the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, which many hold as a greater concern overall. He also noted that concerns about witness safety factors were only necessary in cases of malicious or strategic behavior by miners, something that large block size increase supporters have often disregarded as unrealistic.Despite these concerns, Toomim believed that the other improvements described in his post could address the risks created by the possibility of malicious behavior by miners.</summary>
