    <summary>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeff Garzik raised concerns about the potential risks of maintaining the block size at 1MB while transaction volumes continue to rise. He suggested that if the block size remains unchanged, the Bitcoin Core development team should sign a collective note stating their desire to transition to a new economic policy, one of "healthy fee market", and strongly urge users to examine their fee policies, wallet software, and transaction volumes. Pieter Wuille challenged this suggestion, arguing that it implies that the Bitcoin Core team is responsible for making changes to satisfy economic demand, which he believes would indicate a failure of the network. Garzik responded by reiterating his belief that avoiding a decision on increasing the block size still creates real economic risk, and that hitting a fee event could potentially reshuffle economic actors to a notable degree. He questioned when it would be acceptable to let an economic change event happen and when the policy of fixed 1MB supply would end.</summary>
