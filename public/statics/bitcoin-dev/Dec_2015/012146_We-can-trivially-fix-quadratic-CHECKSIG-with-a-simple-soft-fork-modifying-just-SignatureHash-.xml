    <summary>It is suggested that there is no need to worry about the scenario where someone may have a timelocked big transaction with a lost private key, unless there is a specific reason to suspect such a situation. If a soft fork is announced a few months prior to it becoming active and nobody complains about it destroying their secret stash, then the process can proceed fairly. This was discussed in a message posted on bitcoin-dev by jl2012 on Dec 28, 2015.</summary>
