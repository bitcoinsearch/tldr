    <summary>In this email thread, a user named jl2012 is trying to list the minimal consensus rule changes necessary for segwit softfork. The list includes several changes such as renaming OP_NOP4 as OP_SEGWIT, making sure that the scriptSig is completely empty when using a script with OP_SEGWIT, and requiring that the scriptPubKey only contain OP_SEGWIT as the last opcode or else it must fail. Additionally, the most significant byte of the serialized script is designated as the version byte and if it is 0x00, the script must fail. If the version byte is between 0x02 to 0xff, the rest of the serialized script is ignored. There is some discussion about allowing P2SH inside segwit, but it's argued that it's better to allow segwit scripts to push the hash of the redeemscript in the scriptPubKey instead. This allows old clients to send to new wallets without modifications while also providing malleability protection. The summary concludes by outlining an equivalent list of changes reflecting the current prototype, which includes rules for different versions of the witness program. Finally, Pieter will write a separate email on the block commitment structure.</summary>
