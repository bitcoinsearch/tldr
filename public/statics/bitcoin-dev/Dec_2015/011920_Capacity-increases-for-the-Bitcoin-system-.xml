    <summary>In a conversation among Bitcoin developers in 2015, it was suggested that creating a hardfork to move commitments generally could be a logical step. This would allow for better merged mining, compact SPV proofs, and UTXO set commitments. However, the requirements for these other applications were not yet well-defined, so designing ahead for future uses was suggested. The proposed design involved creating a Merkle tree with reserved space for future use, which could be any arbitrary 256-bit value chosen by the miner and sent along with block data until a future block version. This approach would minimize future disruptions to code that produced or consumed Merkle proofs of transaction or segwitness data.</summary>
