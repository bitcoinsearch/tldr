    <summary>Akiva Lichtner proposed an idea for scaling Bitcoin by running more than one simultaneous chain, each chain defeating double spending on only part of the coin. The coin would be partitioned by radix (or modulus). For example, in order to multiply throughput by a factor of ten, you could run ten parallel chains, one would work on coin that ends in "0", one on coin that ends in "1", and so on up to "9". The number of chains could increase automatically over time based on the moving average of transaction volume. Blocks would have to contain the number of the partition they belong to, and miners would have to round-robin through partitions so that an attacker would not have an unfair advantage working on just one partition.</summary>
