    <summary>In a message sent to bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd discussed the power of miners in the Bitcoin network. He stated that if Bitcoin remains decentralized, miners would have veto power over any blocksize increases. However, he also mentioned that it is possible to soft-fork in a blocksize reduction in a decentralized blockchain. Todd further suggested that schisming hardfork miners out could also be an option. This means that if the majority of miners were against a blocksize reduction and wanted to increase it, those who disagreed could break away and form their own blockchain. Overall, Todd's message highlights the potential influence of miners on the direction of the Bitcoin network and the options available for those who disagree with their decisions.</summary>
