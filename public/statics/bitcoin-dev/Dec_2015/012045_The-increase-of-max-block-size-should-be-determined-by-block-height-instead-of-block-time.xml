    <summary>Chun Wang, a bitcoin developer, has raised concerns over the use of block time to determine the maximum block size in many Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), including the latest BIP202. He argues that it is difficult for mining pools to issue a job with the maximum block size unknown due to the existence of ntime roll and suggests that block height would be a simpler and more elegant solution. Peter Todd, another bitcoin developer, responds by proposing that size be calculated from the median time past, which is fixed for a given block and has no dependency on the block header's nTime field.</summary>
