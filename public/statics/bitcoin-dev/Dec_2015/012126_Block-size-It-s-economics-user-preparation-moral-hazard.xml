    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille expressed concern that setting the switchover point for a proposed hardfork at 75% would lead to a temporary forked off chain of 25%. He suggested a grace period of 4000 to 8000 blocks (1 to 2 months) in addition to the 75% threshold. Wuille also mentioned that from his discussions with miners, it seems possible to create a hardfork proposal that would receive around 90% support or even higher. He promised to post a summary of those discussions within the next 24 hours. The email included HTML and a non-text attachment.</summary>
