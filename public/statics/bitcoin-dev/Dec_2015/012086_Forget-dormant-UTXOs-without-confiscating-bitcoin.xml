    <summary>In an email thread, members of the bitcoin-dev community discussed a proposal by Peter Todd to upgrade the Bitcoin wallet format. Chris Pacia suggested extending the bip37 filter matching algorithm to serve up the proof and preserve the "just backup the seed" functionality. However, Todd argued that there is no difference from the current status quo because the necessary data needed to generate the TXO-unspent proof for his proposal is already required to spend an old txout. The upgraded format would require significant network sync, which would impact user experience and security parameters, according to Todd. This led to issue/recommendation #1 being raised.</summary>
