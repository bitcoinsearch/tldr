    <summary>Two years ago, a similar idea to the recently proposed 'generalized' soft fork which would allow for an increase in blocksize limit was presented on bitcointalk.org. However, it has been pointed out that implementing this idea would kill all existing full and SPV nodes, rendering them unable to send or receive any transactions. Despite this issue, the proposal suggests that an increase in blocksize limit could be achieved through a generalized softfork rather than requiring a hardfork, as is generally assumed. This type of softfork would only require a miner majority, rather than global consensus, to be implemented.</summary>
