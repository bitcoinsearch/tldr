    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of paper wallets and their ability to include UTXO data. The absence of UTXO data in paper wallets necessitates the existence of archive nodes. However, the inclusion of such data does not solve the core problem as someone can still flood the network with many UTXOs, provided they spend them quickly. A user wanting to sweep a paper wallet created in 2013 would need to contact an archive node to obtain the UTXO data before making the TX, which is similar to how the system works today. This situation would be the same for any paper wallet that only has a private key. In that case, users would need to contact a public index or synchronize the full blockchain history to find the assigned coins and their TXids.In conclusion, adding UTXO data to paper wallets will not make Bitcoin better or worse, but it does not solve the core problem. The need for archive nodes will still exist, and users would have to reprint every paper wallet with UTXO data included.</summary>
