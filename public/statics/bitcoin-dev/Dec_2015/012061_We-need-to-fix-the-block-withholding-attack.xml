    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Chris Priest stated that block withholding attacks are only possible if the attacker has a majority of hashpower and that this is currently just a theoretical attack. However, another participant in the discussion pointed out that an attacker with only 0.5% of hash rate could sabotage 10% of a pool's income, making it enough to bring down a pool. It was also noted that this attack had already happened to Eligius in the past. The proof of such an attack is probabilistic, not deterministic, and a smarter attacker could pretend to be many small miners to make it even more difficult to prove who is attacking. The solution proposed was KYC registration or a cryptographic solution that does not require a consensus fork.</summary>
