    <summary>The Bitcoin Core development team has no authority to decide the network consensus rules, according to a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One member argued that the authority to make such decisions should not rest with developers, but with the ecosystem as a whole. While Core developers may propose changes to the ecosystem via code, it is ultimately up to the participants to voluntarily adopt those changes. Although some members of the ecosystem have requested proposals from the Core developers in order to make a choice, others argue that the responsibility for consensus changes should be shared by all network participants. In light of this debate, it has been suggested that there will be no hard fork in 2016, which would give the ecosystem much-needed clarity and time to prepare for future changes.</summary>
