    <summary>The discussion on moving towards a world with hard-fork only upgrades, while interesting, is not deemed feasible at the moment. The focus is on reaching consensus by being pragmatic and constructive. Mixing in what-ifs or long-standing problems will only make it more complicated. Jeff Garzik of bitcoin-dev explains that soft forks degrade the security of non-upgraded nodes. In contrast, the core design of Bitcoin is that trustless nodes validate the work of miners rather than trust them. Soft-forked features lean heavily on miner trust rather than P2P network validation.</summary>
