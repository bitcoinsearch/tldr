    <summary>Upon reviewing a new transaction blocking feature, a concern has been raised about the safety of old clients not being able to see transactions. Even though these transactions are confirmed on the new chain, there is a possibility that a person might attempt to send similar transactions multiple times, resulting in them paying someone several times. The suggestion has been made to require the tx version number to be increased, so transactions sent from old clients would never confirm. It remains to be seen if this idea is already included in the code.</summary>
