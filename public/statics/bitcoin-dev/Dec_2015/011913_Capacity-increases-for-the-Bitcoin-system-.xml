    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Gregory Maxwell raised the issue of the location of the witness commitment and whether it should be placed in an available location compatible with the existing network or if block hashing data structure needs to be immediately changed in an incompatible way to accommodate it. The witness commitment is consensus critical regardless of where it is placed. There was a discussion on whether making a softfork first and then moving the commitment would be less disruptive or if people would need to adapt their software twice, thus making it more disruptive. Some members disagreed that making a softfork first and then moving the commitment would be less disruptive, but if the intention is to never do the second part, then it would be less disruptive. The question was asked about how long after the softfork the hardfork would take place: 1 year after the softfork, 2 years, or never?</summary>
