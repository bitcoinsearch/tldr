    <summary>Akiva, who has 20 years of experience in development and works in the payment industry, is seeking expert feedback on an idea to scale Bitcoin. The idea involves running more than one simultaneous chain, with each defeating double spending on only part of the coin, partitioned by radix or modulus. For example, ten parallel chains could be run to multiply throughput by a factor of ten, with one working on coins that end in "0", another on coins that end in "1", and so on up to "9". The number of chains could increase automatically based on transaction volume, and blocks would have to contain the partition number they belong to.Miners would round-robin through partitions to prevent attackers from having an unfair advantage working on just one partition. There wouldn't be much impact on miners, but clients would have to send more than one message to spend money, and client messages would need to enumerate coins using compression to save space. This seems okay since client software often has to break things up into equal parts. As a humorous aside, Akiva found an anagram for SATOSHI NAKAMOTO: "NSA IS OOOK AT MATH".</summary>
