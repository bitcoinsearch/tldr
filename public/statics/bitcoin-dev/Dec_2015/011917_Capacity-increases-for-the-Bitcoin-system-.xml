    <summary>On August 12th, 2015, Gavin Andresen via bitcoin-dev sent a message regarding segwitness being implemented as a soft fork. There was discussion about the complications that would arise from stuffing the segwitness merkle tree in the coinbase, and how it would complicate consensus-critical code. Gavin agreed with this sentiment and questioned why segwitness was being implemented as a soft fork rather than a hard fork. He noted that he thought the rule was to avoid contentious hard forks, but it seemed that hardly anyone opposed the change and there was widespread agreement that a hardfork version would be much cleaner.</summary>
