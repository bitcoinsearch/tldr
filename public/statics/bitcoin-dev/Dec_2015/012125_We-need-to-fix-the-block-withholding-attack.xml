    <summary>One way to combat block withholding attacks is to give a bonus to the miner who finds the block, which could be included in the coinbase transaction. Block withholding attacks are effective because they cost the attacker nothing while costing the pool everything. By offering a bonus to the miner, such as 5% of the coinbase transaction, block withholding attacks would become more expensive for the attacker without greatly impacting reward variance for smaller miners. Pools can respond to an attack by increasing the bonus ratio, which makes the attack unfeasibly expensive and encourages the attacker to give up. P2pool already has a similar system, with a 0.5% reward bonus for the block's finder. It is unclear if a detailed analysis of the game theory math exists for this proposal.</summary>
