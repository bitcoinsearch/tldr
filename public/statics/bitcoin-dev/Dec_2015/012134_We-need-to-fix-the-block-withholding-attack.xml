    <summary>There is a discussion among bitcoin developers regarding the issue of block withholding attacks and how to prevent them. It was believed that the miner had created their own mining client and that the block withholding was an unintended bug rather than a feature. Multipool Admin suggested making mining more decentralized by allowing anyone to submit proofs of work to Bitcoind and receive payment if they are valid, which Eligius already does for their payouts. There is no known way for pools to prevent block withholding attacks without changing the Bitcoin protocol. To fix this issue, it is suggested to address the larger and more dangerous potential issue of selfish mining first.</summary>
