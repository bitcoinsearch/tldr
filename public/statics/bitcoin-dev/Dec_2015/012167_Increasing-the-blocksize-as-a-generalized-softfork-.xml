    <summary>A proposal has been made to solve the problem of users continuing to use an outdated client after a conventional hardfork, leading to a split in the currency. According to joe2015 via bitcoin-dev, old clients would be forced into "zombie" mode, requiring users to upgrade. However, Bob McElrath suggests a simpler way to enter zombie mode. By tracking valid PoW chains rejected for other reasons and entering zombie mode once a chain is 6 or more blocks ahead, there would be no need for modifications to block structure. The quote "For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong" by H.L. Mencken serves as a warning against overly simplified solutions.</summary>
