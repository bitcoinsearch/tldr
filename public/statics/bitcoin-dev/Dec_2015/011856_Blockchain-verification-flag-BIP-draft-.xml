    <summary>The email thread discusses various aspects of a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to mitigate the 'accidental selfish mining' problem. The author requests a write-up explaining the problem and how validation-skipping helps in mitigating it. The use of bit 0 instead of bit 30 is suggested to avoid confusion. Another participant suggests that SPV clients should only be informed about fully validated headers. The idea of immediately relaying full-proof-of-work blocks before validation with an indication of non-validated status is also discussed, which did not reach a consensus earlier.</summary>
