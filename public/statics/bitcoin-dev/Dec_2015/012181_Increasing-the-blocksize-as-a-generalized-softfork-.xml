    <summary>The UTXO sets can diverge in case of a block limit change hard fork, but they will still be subsets/supersets of each other. The reason behind this is that no transaction would be invalid on one fork as compared to another unless the hard fork lasts longer than 100 blocks. However, the generalized softfork idea has been opposed by some people, including joe2015. He argues that non-upgraded nodes cannot end up with the same UTXO set as upgraded nodes, and the only way for them to have the correct set is to upgrade. It's important to note that the generalized softfork proposal was intended as an alternative to hard forks, which can also lead to UTXOs diverging for upgraded and non-upgraded clients.</summary>
