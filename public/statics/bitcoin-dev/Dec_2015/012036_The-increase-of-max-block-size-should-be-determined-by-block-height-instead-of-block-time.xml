    <summary>In an email thread on December 18, 2015 at 9:43 PM, Peter Todd discussed the use of median time in block creation. He argued that median time should be used to set a time that the block creator does not have direct control over, while still tying the rule to wall clock time for planning purposes. However, he also acknowledged that using "human friendly clock time" was not necessarily valuable if there was a need to wait for the next difficulty retarget and then wait for 95%. Todd suggested that using median time of the previous block would achieve the same goal of not giving the creator of the current block direct control over the activation process. Todd recommended that a decision be made on whether to use median time or height approach and always use it for both hardforks and softforks as part of bip9. He also noted that an initial time threshold is not necessary for uncontroversial softforks but can simplify bip9's implementation. Todd urged for a final decision to be made, updating bip9 and bip99, and stopping the practice of doing something different on every hardfork patch.</summary>
