    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list has proposed adding opcodes to make Script Turing Pseudo-Complete, as suggested by Wright. The proposal includes adding a return stack alongside the existing control stack and several new opcodes, including OP_DEFINITION_START, OP_DEFINITION_END, OP_FUNCTION_NAME, OP_CALL, and OP_RETURN_FROM_CALL_AND_CONTINUE. Additionally, the proposal suggests adding OP_NAMESPACE to allow a function to pay its creator, with the ability to create transactions arbitrarily. While acknowledging that this is just a starting point, the proposal hopes to generate discussion on the topic.</summary>
