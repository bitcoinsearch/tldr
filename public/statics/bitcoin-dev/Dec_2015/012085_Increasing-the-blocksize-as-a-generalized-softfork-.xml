    <summary>On December 21, 2015, Bryan Bishop responded to a post by joe2015 on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding an arbitrary block-size increase via a generalized soft fork. Bryan suggested that this proposal is conceptually similar to "extension blocks" and provided links to relevant discussions on the topic. Joe clarified that his proposal differs from extension blocks in that it does not introduce different tiers of blocks or require users to manually move coins between them. Instead, it uses a single flat block format that is essentially the same as the current block format, only larger. He also explained that this change would not require a hard fork with global consensus but can be deployed like a soft fork using the method described in his original post.</summary>
