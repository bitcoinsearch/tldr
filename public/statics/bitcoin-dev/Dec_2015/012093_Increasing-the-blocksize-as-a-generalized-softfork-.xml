    <summary>In a post made on December 21, 2015, jl2012 proposed an idea that was similar to something he suggested two years prior. However, there were some notable differences. In response to jl2012's post, another user commented that implementing the proposal would render existing full and SPV nodes useless, forcing users to upgrade. The original poster acknowledged this as the point of the proposal, as after a conventional hardfork, everyone needs to upgrade but there is no way to force users to do so. Under this proposal, instead of letting those users who don't upgrade continue using the old client and splitting the currency, old clients will enter "zombie" mode, which will require users to upgrade.</summary>
