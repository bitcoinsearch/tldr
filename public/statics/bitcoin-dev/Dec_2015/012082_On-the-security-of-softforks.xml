    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Pieter Wuille addressed the risk associated with an old full node wallet accepting an invalid transaction according to new rules. He explained that the receiver wallet selects what address/script to accept coins on and will upgrade to the new softfork rules before creating an address that depends on the softfork's features. Jonathan Toomim raised concerns about fraud and suggested Mallory could defraud Bob by using an invalid SegWit transaction which Bob cannot validate and pays into one of Mallory's wallets. However, Rusty pointed out that Bob's wallet would be looking for "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG" scriptSig, and the SegWit-usable outputs would look different.</summary>
