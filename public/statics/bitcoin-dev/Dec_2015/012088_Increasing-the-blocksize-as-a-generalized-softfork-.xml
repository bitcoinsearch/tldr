    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, user joe2015 raised concerns about hard forks, stating that they include or will include miner lock-in and will not activate if global consensus is not reached. Jeff Garzik replied, correcting Joe2015's statement by saying that hard forks activate with a miner majority, not global consensus. In addition, Garzik clarified that nothing stops the miner minority from continuing the old chain with a hard fork, whereas with a soft fork, the miner minority is forced to upgrade. Joe2015 proposed a solution that achieves a hard-fork-like block size limit increase but also forces the miner minority to upgrade, similar to a soft fork.</summary>
