    <summary>In a Bitcoin developers' discussion thread, Pieter Wuille proposed a timeframe of 6 to 12 months for an uncontroversial hardfork. However, this suggestion was met with skepticism as there had been a previous effort to start the process six months ago, which was met with denial and stonewalling. The need for proactive measures is being recognized now, but without any reference to the delay. The discussion emphasizes the importance of planning ahead, so that the network does not have to make hasty forced upgrades during capacity emergencies.</summary>
