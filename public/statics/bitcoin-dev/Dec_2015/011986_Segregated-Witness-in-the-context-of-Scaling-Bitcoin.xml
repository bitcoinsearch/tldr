    <summary>In an email conversation dated December 16, 2015, Jeff Garzik discussed the nature of SW's service. According to Garzik, SW presents a blended price and basket of two goods. Customers can interact with the service through the blended price, but it should be noted that the basket contains two separate but similar resources. The email does not provide further details about what these resources are or how they are related.</summary>
