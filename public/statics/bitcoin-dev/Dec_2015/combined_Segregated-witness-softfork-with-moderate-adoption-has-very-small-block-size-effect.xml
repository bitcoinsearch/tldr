    <summary>On the Bitcoin developer mailing list, there have been discussions surrounding the implementation and adoption of Segregated Witness (SW) as a short-term solution for scalability. One member, jl2012, questioned the effectiveness of a SW softfork on the actual total block size in 2015. However, Peter Todd argued that client-side adoption of SW is a clear indication that the ecosystem has opted for a blocksize increase.Another user pointed out that client-side adoption only indicates implementers saw value in it greater than the cost of implementation. Santino Napolitano suggested alternative methods for businesses to explicitly state their preferences. The author analyzed the effect of a SW softfork on the actual total block size through calculations and defined several related terms. They noted that P2SH adoption is low and questioned the over-optimism surrounding the expected adoption rate of segwit.In another discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, jl2012 raised concern over the adoption rate of segwit, stating that P2SH has been introduced for 3.5 years and only about 10% of bitcoin is stored this way. Douglas Roark responded by saying that one cannot necessarily conflate P2SH and SegWit uptake as P2PKH works just fine for an awful lot of Bitcoin users.Peter Todd also discussed how the implementation of Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) in wallets is also voting for an increased block size. This is because P2SH results in smaller transactions, similarly to Segregated Witness (SW). In response to jl2012's calculations on the effect of a SW softfork on the actual total block size, Todd notes that the fact that SW requires client-side adoption for an actual blocksize increase can be a good thing as it shows that the ecosystem as a whole has opted into a blocksize increase.However, Todd acknowledges that SW adoption is not as good as a direct proof-of-stake vote, but it is an interesting side-effect. Another user expressed doubt that SW was relevant to scalability and that fraud-proof systems were important for network security as the current system places too much trust in miners.In a discussion about client-side adoption of SW, Santino Napolitano disagrees with the belief that it indicates a preference for larger blocks. He suggests that businesses could attach an OP_RETURN output indicating their preference or provide hand-signed letters and media interviews to explicitly state their desires. The discussion ends with Todd's signature.</summary>
