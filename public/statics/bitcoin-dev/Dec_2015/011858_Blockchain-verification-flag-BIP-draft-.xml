    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Gavin Andresen expresses agreement with an idea presented regarding the accidental selfish mining problem. He suggests that a link to a detailed description of the issue and how the proposed solution mitigates it be included in the BIP. In terms of implementation, Andresen notes that using bit 30 could cause confusion with BIP9 and recommends using bit 0 instead. Another member of the discussion, Jannes Faber, suggests that SPV clients only be informed about fully validated headers. Rusty agrees but points out the need for a delicate balance between penalizing blocks too much and disincentivizing the use of the proposed solution. He also believes that it is easy for SPV clients to decide for themselves. The group plans to further discuss the matter at a later time.</summary>
