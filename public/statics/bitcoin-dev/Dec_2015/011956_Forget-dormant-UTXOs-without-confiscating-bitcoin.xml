    <summary>The proposed scheme to limit the UTXO set in Bitcoin has been met with criticism by some developers. The scheme requires users to contact an "archive node" in order to get the UTXO data before making a transaction, making it harder for people to use Bitcoin. Additionally, this change will affect all users who hold BTC long-term, as archive nodes will be essential to the network's operation. However, proponents of the scheme argue that it is necessary to limit the UTXO size, which is a function of the number of users on the network. Critics also point out that the membership proofs required for transactions under this scheme could become too large, trading bandwidth for storage. Overall, there are differing opinions on whether this scheme will make Bitcoin better or worse.</summary>
