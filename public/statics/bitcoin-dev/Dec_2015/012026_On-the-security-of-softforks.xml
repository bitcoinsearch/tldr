    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Eric Lombrozo raises concerns regarding the risks of any consensus rule changes. He notes that such changes can lead to non-full-validating or non-upgraded nodes seeing invalid confirmations, but if a large supermajority (i.e. &gt; 95%) of hashing power is behind the new rule, it is unlikely that many invalid confirmations will be seen by anyone. This is because the majority will continually reorg the non-upgrading chain, ensuring that the # of invalid confirmations remains small. In contrast, with a hard fork, the non-upgraded miners will continue mining on their own chain, and while that chain's length will increase more slowly than normal, the # of confirmations that non-upgraded clients will see on it are unbounded. Lombrozo suggests that this issue should be written up as a BIP due to the misinformation and lies floating around on the subject.</summary>
