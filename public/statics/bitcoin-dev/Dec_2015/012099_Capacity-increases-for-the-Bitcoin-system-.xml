    <summary>In a recent statement, the defender of the deployment of segwit as a hardfork clarified that they have no strong opinion on whether it should be done as a softfork first or not. However, they strongly oppose never doing the later hardfork. They still supported segwit for Bitcoin even if it was only possible as a hardfork, but since there is a softfork version available, it will hopefully accelerate its deployment. The plan seems to be to do a softfork first and then a hardfork to move the witness tree outside of the coinbase. The defender shows support for this plan and finds it very exciting.</summary>
