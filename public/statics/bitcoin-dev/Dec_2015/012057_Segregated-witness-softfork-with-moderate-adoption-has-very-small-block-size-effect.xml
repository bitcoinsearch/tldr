    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, Peter Todd discusses how the implementation of Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) in wallets is also voting for an increased block size. This is because P2SH results in smaller transactions, similarly to Segregated Witness (SW). In response to jl2012's calculations on the effect of a SW softfork on the actual total block size, Todd notes that the fact that SW requires client-side adoption for an actual blocksize increase can be a good thing as it shows that the ecosystem as a whole has opted into a blocksize increase. However, he acknowledges that this method is not as effective as a direct proof-of-stake vote and can be seen as coercive since lower fees are paid. The discussion ends with Todd's signature.</summary>
