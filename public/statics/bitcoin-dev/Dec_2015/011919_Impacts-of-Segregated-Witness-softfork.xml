    <summary>The implementation of Segregated Witness (SW) with a softfork may result in breaking important components of the Bitcoin network that are not consensus critical. This includes the definition of "Transaction ID," which may require dealing with two or three IDs for each transaction. These include the backward-compatible txid, witness ID, and global txid, where the latter is only needed for the relay of transactions between full nodes.As the backward-compatible txid only defines part of a transaction, any relay protocols between full nodes must use the global txid to identify a transaction, making them vulnerable to malleability attacks targeting the relay network. Additionally, getblocktemplate needs to be upgraded to handle witness data and witness IDs, while protocols relying on the coinbase tx, such as P2Pool and merged mining, may be impacted depending on the location of witness commitment.Overall, the implementation of SW with a softfork may require redefining crucial aspects of the Bitcoin network, potentially disrupting various protocols and components.</summary>
