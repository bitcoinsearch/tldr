    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille expressed his opinion that it would be immoral and dangerous to merge any hard forking changes without extremely widespread agreement. While he is personally fine with a short-term small block size bump to appease those who desire it, he can only agree with merging it in Core if he is convinced that there is no strong opposition from others. Soft forks only require a majority of miners to accept them, so Pieter has proposed Segregated Witness as a first step, which solves several issues simultaneously and does not require the degree of certainty needed for a hard fork. Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet, added that the bitcoin-core release has become a Schelling point in the consensus game due to strong incentives for consensus, meaning that everyone is looking for an obvious reference point that they think everyone else will also pick. While whoever controls such a focal point has unavoidable moral hazard, the cost and risk of settling on another focal point is high.</summary>
