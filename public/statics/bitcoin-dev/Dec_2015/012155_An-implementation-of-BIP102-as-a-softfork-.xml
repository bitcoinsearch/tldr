    <summary>In this conversation, Marco questions whether a proposed approach is actually a soft fork. He notes that just because something is not a hard fork doesn't necessarily make it a soft fork. The main issue he has with the approach is that it requires nodes to upgrade in order to work properly.According to Marco, true soft forks don't need any nodes to upgrade. However, the proposed approach relies on nodes upgrading to avoid missing transactions and being vulnerable to double spends. Marco asks if there is something he is missing about the proposal. The link provided explains the implications of soft forks in general.</summary>
