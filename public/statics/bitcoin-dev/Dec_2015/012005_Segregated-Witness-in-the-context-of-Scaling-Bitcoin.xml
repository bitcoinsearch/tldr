    <summary>In an email exchange between Jorge Timón and an unknown recipient, Timón questions the need for compromise in regards to the proposed 2-4-8 block size increase. He notes that combining bip102 and Segregated Witness (SegWit) would already equal the proposed compromise of a 2-4-8 increase. The recipient responds by questioning if Timón is missing something, pointing out that SegWit has a gain of approximately 75%, leading to a theoretical gain of 3.5 when combined with a 2mb increase. The recipient also notes that the 4x gain only applies to 2-2 multisig transactions.</summary>
