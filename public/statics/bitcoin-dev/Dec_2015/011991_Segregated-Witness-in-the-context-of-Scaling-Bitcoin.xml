    <summary>The issue of fee events is not related to scaling solutions, but rather economics. There are concerns about subsidizing transactions and who should pay for them. Increasing validation costs may work against adoption, even if it keeps fees low, and a fee event will have to be dealt with sooner or later. The discussion also includes the deployment of Segregated Witness (SW) and its potential impact on scaling. While it is a scaling solution, most of its benefits are long term, and there are risks associated with building up fee pressure. A hard fork is seen as a simpler solution but will take longer to deploy, and there are concerns about killing nodes and reducing their security model. Hard forks restore trustless nature and create a more predictable market for users and a more secure network. Finally, SW does not eliminate short-term problems with scaling.</summary>
