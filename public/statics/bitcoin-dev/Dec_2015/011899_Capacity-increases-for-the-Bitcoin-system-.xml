    <summary>On December 9, 2015, Luke Dashjr proposed pursuing a SegWit softfork and simultaneously working on a hardfork to simplify proofs and reduce the complexity of merge-mining. This would avoid delaying the improvements of SegWit until the hardfork is completed. However, it was questioned whether parsing the blockchain for sigwit data in both places would be an improvement, and why not just do it as a hard fork. A link to an HTML attachment and a non-text attachment with a signature were also provided.</summary>
