    <summary>In an email exchange, a user named jl2012 argues that the implementation of BIP65 and CLTV tx does not make transactions any less secure. They cited that only about 1/3 of nodes support BIP65, therefore having more nodes to fully validate non-CLTV txs won't make them any safer. The same logic also applies to SW softfork. A response was given stating that this logic applies to all soft forks as each one degrades the security of non-upgraded nodes. The core design of bitcoin is that trustless nodes validate the work of miners, not trust them. Soft forks move in the opposite direction where each new soft-forked feature leans heavily on miner trust rather than P2P network validation.</summary>
