    <summary>The discussion on the deployment of Segregated Witness (SegWit) via soft fork or hard fork took place in a Bitcoin-dev mailing list. Jonathan Toomim and Justus Ranvier expressed their opinions about the matter. Toomim believed that a hard fork is better for SegWit, as it would reduce the size of fraud proofs, make the design more elegant, and be safer for clients who do not upgrade in a timely fashion. However, he disagreed with the idea that SegWit would invalidate the security assumptions of non-upgraded clients, including Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets. On the other hand, Ranvier stated that if the change will be deployed via a soft fork, then putting the SegWit merkle root in the coinbase is not ideal. Instead, he suggested putting it in the first output of the generation transaction as an OP_RETURN script, as coinbase space is limited while output space is not.</summary>
