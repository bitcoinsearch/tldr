    <summary>In this conversation between Bitcoin developers Jorge Timón and Luke Durback, they discuss the implementation of a voting system using BTC as voting shares. Durback mentions that he plans to add a fee for the creator of the system, but Timón points out that each scriptSig is only executed once with its corresponding scriptPubKey. They also briefly discuss the idea of a decentralized exchange between colored coins, which Durback suggests may take a small fee on each trade. Timón notes that he has been researching decentralized exchange designs and none of them require turing completeness. Throughout the conversation, Timón asks for more concrete examples and details in order to better understand Durback's proposals.</summary>
