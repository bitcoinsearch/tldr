    <summary>The context is a discussion about using short-circuit evaluation and the possibility of complaints arising. One person suggests that humans have the ability to respond to novel situations without predetermined rules and algorithms, so they should use that ability sometimes. Another person raises concerns about complaints and the need for general consensus rules as a social contract. Jonathan Toomim responds that it is unlikely to be an issue and if they announce the intention to perform a soft fork ahead of time and nobody complains about it destroying their secret stash, they could proceed. The discussion also considers the possibility of someone having a timelocked big transaction with a lost private key. The conversation takes place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
