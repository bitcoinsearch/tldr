    <summary>One proposal for fixing block withhold in mining pools is by not letting miners know which block candidates are valid before the pool knows. This can be done by having the pool use unique per-miner nonces as a kind of seed/commitment value, where one in X block candidates will be valid. The pool then looks at which commitment value the miner used and hashes that together with the partial PoW to see if it hits the target. The computational work of the pool remains low and this method is not harder than partial PoW validation already performed.</summary>
