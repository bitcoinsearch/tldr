    <summary>The context discusses the difference between soft forks and hard forks in the context of segregated witness (SW) implementation. Segregated witness is a soft-fork that is backwards and forwards compatible by design, similar to P2SH. Soft forks have an advantage over hard forks as they do not leave behind a weak chain that could result in the loss of money. However, there is another type of fork called firm hard fork that can do the same but for format changes that are not possible with a soft-fork.Extension blocks show that a more general backwards and forwards compatible soft-fork is also possible, but segregated witness is simpler. The use of the strategy pattern is mentioned to help with code structure. The email thread discussed various types of forks, including firm hard forks that can make format changes which are not possible with soft-forks. There were several links provided on discussions about auxiliary blocks, evil soft-forks or forced soft-forks, as well as soft-fork block size increase using extension blocks. Generalized soft-forks and bip102 forced soft-forks were also discussed. Extension blocks and sidechains were talked about in older conversations. Discussion about evil forks and evil soft-forks and extension blocks were also included.Segwit soft-fork was mentioned as making use of a similar idea. The concept of "forced soft-fork" was discussed and explained as being pretty much the same thing as an "evil fork."</summary>
