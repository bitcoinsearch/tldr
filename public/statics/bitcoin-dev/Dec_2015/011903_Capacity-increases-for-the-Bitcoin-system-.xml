    <summary>In an email exchange, Gregory Maxwell and Gavin Andresen discussed the need to fix the O(n^2) sighash problem as an additional BIP for any blocksize increase. The attack involves creating a 1-megabyte transaction with all of its inputs spending segwitness-spending SIGHASH_ALL inputs. Since segwitness inputs are smaller in the block, more of them can fit into 1 megabyte, and each will hash very close to one megabyte of data, making it O(n^2) worse than the worst case of a 1-megabyte transaction with signatures in the scriptSigs. Gavin Andresen believes that designing for success is crucial and that technical debt should not be piled on consensus-critical code. He also thinks that working harder to make things simpler whenever possible is essential. However, worries about future problems have prevented consensus on simple solutions.</summary>
