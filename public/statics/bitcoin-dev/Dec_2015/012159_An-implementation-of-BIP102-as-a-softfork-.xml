    <summary>The Bitcoin developer community is discussing a proposal called "forced soft-fork", which would force all nodes on the network to upgrade to the latest version of the software. The idea has been met with mixed reactions, with some calling it "crufty and hackish" and others saying that the fear of recursion is misplaced. The proposal would involve a multi-levels-deep block-within-a-block-within-a-block approach, but proponents say that this could be simplified with careful planning. The forced soft-fork would make it easier for developers to implement new features and upgrades, but there are concerns about the potential impact on the security and stability of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
