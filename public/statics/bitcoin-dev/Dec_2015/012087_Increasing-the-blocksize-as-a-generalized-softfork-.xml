    <summary>The email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the proposal of using a generalized soft fork as an alternative to hard forks in the Bitcoin network. Hard forks are considered a "nuclear option" and carry significant risks, such as permanently splitting Bitcoin into two chains if global consensus is never reached. On the other hand, a (generalized) soft fork can avoid this problem. It is noted that current hard fork implementations, including those that will be implemented in the future, will include miner lock-in, just like any soft fork. The activation of these hard forks will not occur if global consensus is not reached.</summary>
