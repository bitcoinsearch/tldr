    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Jeff Garzik proposed that wallets should generate proofs of past transaction and then introduce the max-age as planned hard fork down the line. However, there are open questions concerning "grandfathered" UTXOs and reverses attribute of HD wallets in just backup seed. Additionally, a change (#6550) has been made to Bitcoin core to remove merkle branches from the wallet, which could make it difficult to spend older coins if pruning gets turned on. Jeff Garzik suggests not removing wallet merkle branches as a solution.</summary>
