    <summary>The BIP number assignment process is not just a formality, but a process that can take months. It seems to provide an aura of officiality and makes it easy to refer to a particular BIP. While adding a BIP to the main repo and eventual approvation should come eventually with subsequent steps, having a BIP number assigned is important. The process can take time due to the PR request list. The reason for this may be some historic context.</summary>
