    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Martijn Meijering expressed concerns about blocking old clients from seeing transactions. They discussed the possibility of sending multiple transactions and increasing fees in an attempt to get it confirmed. However, Peter Todd warned against this as it is dangerous to simply send multiple transactions without knowing for sure that the longest blockchain is being seen. He suggested designing software with fee-bumping to avoid this mistake. Additionally, increasing the tx version number could mess up pre-signed transactions, such as refunds.</summary>
