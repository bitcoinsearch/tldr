    <title>Forget dormant UTXOs without confiscating bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposed softfork to solve the issue of dormant UTXO set that keeps on increasing and creating storage problems for full nodes. The proposal suggests creating Lite UTXO nodes that store only UTXOs created in the past 420,000 blocks. With the proposed softfork, if the UTXO is created within the last 420,000 blocks, the key holder may consult any type of full node, including a lite UTXO node, to create the transaction. However, if the UTXO has been confirmed by more than 420,000 blocks, only an archive node can provide all the information required to spend the coin. The proposal aims to avoid forcing thousands of volunteer full nodes to store UTXO records indefinitely. Currently, there are three types of full nodes: Archive nodes that store the whole blockchain, Full UTXO nodes that fully store the latest UTXO state, but not the raw blockchain, and Lite UTXO nodes that store only UTXO created in the past 420,000 blocks. The proposal suggests that if the UTXO is created within the last 420,000 blocks, the key holder may consult any type of full node, including a lite UTXO node, to create the transaction.The proposal requires extra information to construct the membership prove, which includes knowing the TXO state of all outputs in block Y at block (Y + 420000) and whether there was any spending of any block Y UTXOs after block (Y + 420000). It is designed this way so that lite UTXO nodes won't need to store any dormant UTXO records, not even the hash of individual dormant UTXO records. The Bitcoin Bank (miners) is not going to shred your record and confiscate your money. Instead, the Bank throws your record to the garage (raw blockchain).</summary>
