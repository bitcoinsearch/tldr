    <summary>The block size debate in the Bitcoin community has sparked concerns about selfish mining, as noted by Gavin Andresen and others. However, initial reactions may not always be accurate and people's views can change over time. In this case, science has played a role in convincing some individuals of the potential negative effects of larger blocks on the network. The paper discussing selfish mining has been peer-reviewed, cited, and even built upon by other researchers. Ayelet Sapirshtein, Yonatan Sompolinsky, and Aviv Zohar have extended the work done on selfish mining in a very nice manner, according to one source. As the debate continues, it is important to elevate the discussion beyond initial reactions and consider all available evidence and perspectives.</summary>
