    <summary>In an email exchange on December 9th, 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n questioned the intentions behind a statement made by an individual in regards to a proposed hardfork. The individual clarified that they meant it when they said "we can do the cleanup hardfork later," but that it would make more sense to include it as part of a larger hardfork that would also address other issues such as merged mining and UTXO set commitments. This is because the additional overhead required for these other applications is more significant than that required for the cleanup hardfork. The individual did not provide a specific timeline for when this proposed hardfork would take place, as the requirements for the other changes are not yet well defined.</summary>
