    <summary>The Bitcoin community discussed the best way to trigger changes in block size limits. The initial version triggered on block height but was later changed to time, as it was believed to be more stable. There is a preference for a single flag trigger (height or time), however any combination of those will work. In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim√≥n suggested using the median time from the previous block, or always picking a difficulty retarget block for miner upgrade confirmation. He also proposed using the sign bit as the "hardfork bit" and updating bip99 with these suggestions. Chun Wang suggested that block height is much simpler and elegant than time, making it easier to implement and understand.</summary>
