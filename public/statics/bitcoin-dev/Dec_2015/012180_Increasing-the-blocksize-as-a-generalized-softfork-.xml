    <summary>In a discussion on December 31, 2015, David Chan pointed out that the UTXO (unspent transaction output) sets may diverge in the case of a hard fork in the blockchain. However, he noted that they would still be strict subsets or supersets of each other as no transaction would be invalid on one fork compared to another unless the hard fork lasted longer than 100 blocks. Another factor that can cause divergence in the UTXO sets is double-spending. For example, if transaction A-&gt;B is confirmed on the old chain and A-&gt;C is confirmed on the new chain, this would result in two different unspent transaction outputs. These details highlight some of the complexities and challenges involved in implementing and managing hard forks in the blockchain. It also underscores the need for careful planning and consideration of potential consequences before proceeding with any significant changes to the protocol.</summary>
