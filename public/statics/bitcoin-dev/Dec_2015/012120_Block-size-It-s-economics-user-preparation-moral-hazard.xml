    <summary>Pieter Wuille, via a bitcoin-dev email thread in 2015, stated that the role of Bitcoin Core maintainers is to judge whether consensus for a hard fork exists and if it is technically necessary and safe. He stressed that a hashpower vote is not needed to decide whether a hardfork is accepted or not, rather full nodes must accept it and adopt it in time. However, a hashpower vote can still be used to ensure that miners also agree. Wuille clarified that this is the role of Bitcoin Core maintainers solely because they decide what goes into Bitcoin Core, not because they have authority over other full node implementations such as libbitcoin. Ultimately, no one has such authority over alternative implementations, not even the creator of the system if they were still maintaining Bitcoin Core.</summary>
