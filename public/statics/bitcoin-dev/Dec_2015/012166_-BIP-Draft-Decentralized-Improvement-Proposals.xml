    <summary>In a recent discussion, Tomas expressed his opinion on the inefficiency and bloatiness of a specification which appears to be a reinvention of version bits. The allocation of version bits was not clear from the specification, leading to confusion regarding the implementation of proposed changes. Tomas also addressed the issue of forward-incompatible changes by proposing a solution that prevents hard-forks from occurring, ensuring that every implementation agrees on the active set of rules even if it has not implemented them. This crucial aspect seems to be missing in the version bits proposal.</summary>
