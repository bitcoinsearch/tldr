    <summary>In an email exchange between Eric Lombrozo and another individual, the discussion centered around whether or not increasing validation costs works against adoption. Lombrozo argued that it does, even if it artificially keeps fees low, and that a fee event will occur sooner or later regardless. The other individual clarified that their previous email had focused on economics and transition issues, and that the problems and risks associated with not lifting the 1M limit remain regardless of whether or not SegWit (SW) is implemented. Finally, the second email addressed the claim that no 1M hard fork is needed because SW can serve as a scaling solution.</summary>
