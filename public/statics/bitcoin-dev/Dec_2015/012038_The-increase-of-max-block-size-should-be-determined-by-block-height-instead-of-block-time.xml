    <summary>Jeff Garzik, a developer of Bitcoin, suggested a proposal for Bitcoin block size increase. He prefers height activation and one step per block (also height). Under this scheme, the size of the step-per-block increase could be decreased every 210,000 blocks at the time of reward halvings. This suggests a linear growth rate that decreases every ~4 years, ultimately grandfathering max_block_size increases on the same block-schedule that reward decreases.</summary>
