    <summary>The thread discusses block withholding attacks and selfish mining. Ittay Eyal was the first to analyze these attacks and discovered that an attacker pool can use a portion of its hashpower to mine on behalf of a victim pool, furnish partial proofs of work, but discard any full blocks discovered. This attack could make more money than using 100% of the pool's hashpower for its own mining. Chris Priest confused these attacks with selfish mining, which is guaranteed to yield profits for any pool over 33%. However, this may not pay off depending on the makeup of the rest of the pools as well as the network characteristics. Ittay's discovery put pressure on big pools to not grow and led to their profitability dropping. Peter alluded to a specific suggestion from Luke-Jr.</summary>
