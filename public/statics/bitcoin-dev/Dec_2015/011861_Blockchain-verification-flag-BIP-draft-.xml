    <summary>In an email chain from December 6th, 2015, James Hilliard brought up a concern regarding cgminer and its inability to allow for a pool to revert to mining on the previous block due to the way chain tracking is implemented. This issue could be significant for anyone who isn't validating. In response to this concern, an interesting potential use for a flag suggested in a draft was discussed. The flag would allow for non-monotone mining for non-verified blocks. The email suggests adding a recommendation for this potential use to the draft.</summary>
