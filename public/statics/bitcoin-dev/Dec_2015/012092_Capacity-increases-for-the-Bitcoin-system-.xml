    <summary>In December 2015, Pieter Wuille responded to Gregory Maxwell's proposal for a soft-fork SegWit 4MB block. Wuille stated that the block size debate had caused too much confusion and distraction from needed engineering work. He believed that while a hard fork required the entire world to switch to new consensus rules simultaneously, a soft fork could give a short-term capacity bump, improve scalability, and solve several unrelated problems at the same time. Wuille hoped that the community would work towards this plan as it allowed progress without being forced to make a potentially divisive choice for one hard fork or another. He urged everyone to stop arguing endlessly and actually do work that will benefit everyone.</summary>
