    <summary>During a discussion among developers regarding the addition of a compression library to financial software, Matt Corallo expressed his concern calling it a "really scary idea". Pavel Janík shared similar concerns but suggested that compression could be used on local block storage as an option for saving up to 20% space in use cases such as pruning and obfuscating. The idea was compared with an issue raised earlier on Github.</summary>
