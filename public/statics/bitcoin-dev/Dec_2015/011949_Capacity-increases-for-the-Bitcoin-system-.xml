    <summary>The email thread discusses the need for a segwit supporting server to relay segwit transactions. A non-segwit server can inform a wallet of segwit txns observed, but it cannot relay all necessary information to validate. Non-segwit servers and wallets will continue to function as usual. The author suggests that a hard fork for deploying this non-controversial change is cleaner and safer in terms of affecting user experience. The discussion then moves on to the design of the hashRootStruct and the compatibility with SPV nodes/wallets. Any code that checks merkle paths up into the block header would have to change if the structure of the merkle tree changed to be three-headed at the top. It is suggested that if the tree remains a binary tree, the code that produces the merkle paths will just send a path that is one step deeper. Finally, Gavin Andresen mentions that having a merkle tree that isn't a binary tree is weird.</summary>
