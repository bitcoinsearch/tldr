    <summary>In an email conversation on Dec 27, 2015, Jonathan Toomim expressed his belief that mobilizing people to upgrade their nodes for a hard fork to increase the blocksize will not be difficult as a supermajority of users and miners have been requesting this change for years. However, he does not believe that miners should have the power to trigger the fork until a certain percentage of visible full nodes have upgraded, as relying on miners to make such a judgement call goes against the principle that the consensus system of the Bitcoin network should be hard to change. Toomim also made it clear that while he cannot dictate what code to run, he can decide what system he finds interesting to build. He mentioned that many people have agreed to work towards a plan that does not involve scheduling a hard fork at present, as evidenced by the information available on the Bitcoin.org website regarding capacity increases.</summary>
