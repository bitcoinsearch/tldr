    <summary>The Scaling Bitcoin Workshop in HK has finished and many proposals were presented. Gregory Maxwell proposes to work immediately towards the segwit 4MB block soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability, with recent speedups and incoming relay improvements making segwit a reasonable risk. BIP9 and segwit will also make further improvements easier and faster to deploy while building additional tools that would make bandwidth increases safer long term. Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing the groundwork to make them justifiable. There are multiple ways to get involved in ongoing work, where the community can help to make this happen sooner by reviewing the versionbits BIP, CSV BIPs, and Segwit BIP which is being written but has not yet been published. A testnet for Segwit is expected later this month.</summary>
