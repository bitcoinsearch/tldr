    <summary>Gregory Maxwell, a well-known Bitcoin developer, has shared his view on the near term arc for capacity increases in the Bitcoin system after the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop held in Hong Kong. He believes that the community is ready to deliver on a clear forward path with a shared vision that addresses the needs of the system while upholding its values. Maxwell also noted that there is a large discrepancy between what developers are doing and what's more widely known. Sometimes, evaluating inefficient proposals can exhaust our time completely, making consensus building a difficult task. Commenting on this, Bryan, another developer, suggested that summaries of recent work and efforts should be made and posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. This would help increase the ability of the community to coordinate and figure out what's going on. The contributions from the scalingbitcoin.org workshops are a welcome addition, and the proposal outlined in the above email contains a good summary of recent progress.</summary>
