    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in December 2015, Justus Ranvier suggested that stuffing the segwitness merkle tree in the coinbase was not a good idea for soft fork deployment. Instead, he recommended putting it in the first output of the generation transaction as an OP_RETURN script. This is because coinbase space is limited while output space is not. He suggested that the last transaction in the block would be a far better place than the generation transaction to save, on average, half of the hashes in the Merkle tree. The proposal for tying another merkle tree to a block could then be designated for the second output of the generation transaction.</summary>
