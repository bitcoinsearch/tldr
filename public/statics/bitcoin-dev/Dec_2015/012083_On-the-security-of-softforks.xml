    <summary>On a Bitcoin developers' forum, Jonathan Toomim raised concerns about the risk of an old full node wallet accepting a transaction that is invalid to the new rules. However, Pieter Wuille responded that the risk is not significant as the receiver wallet chooses what address/script to accept coins on, and they will upgrade to the new softfork rules before creating an address that depends on the softfork's features. But Toomim argued that fraud is still possible if Mallory defrauds Bob with a 1 BTC payment for some beer using an invalid SegWit transaction. Rusty Russell chimed in saying that Bob's wallet will be looking for "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG" scriptSig, and the SegWit-usable outputs will look different. Finally, it was concluded that this is not an issue if Bob waits for a few confirmations.</summary>
