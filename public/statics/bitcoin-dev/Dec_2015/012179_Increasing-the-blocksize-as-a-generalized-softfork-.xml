    <summary>The idea of a "generalized softfork" is being strongly opposed by Joe as he believes that upgraded nodes and non-upgraded nodes cannot end up with the same UTXO set. It is mentioned that the only way for non-upgraded nodes to obtain the correct UTXO set is by upgrading. It is emphasized that this proposal was suggested as an alternative to a hardfork, where the UTXOs also diverge due to different chains being followed by upgraded and non-upgraded clients. This information is provided by Joe.</summary>
