    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, commented on the assumption that robust adoption rates by up-layer ecosystem software are needed for Segregated Witness (SegWit) to be successful. He argued that this is not required because everyone who individually switches to new transactions gets to do 1.75x more transactions for the same price while also getting safer contracts, better script upgradability, and more security models at their disposal. This increase in capacity would be completely independent of whether anyone else in the ecosystem does the same. Assuming wallets/payments processors/full nodes adoption takes six months to get to 50% after the SegWit soft-fork activation, the actual network capacity will be increased by 1.375 after six months. In comparison, a hard fork would bring an increase of 1.75 since the activation.</summary>
