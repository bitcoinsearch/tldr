    <summary>The process of assigning BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) numbers is a lengthy process which can take months due to the PR (Pull Request) request list. This process is questioned by Marco Pontello, who believes it should be a formality to avoid conflicts and BIP spamming. He notes that this process can take months due to the lengthy PR request list, and wonders if there is some historical context he is missing.Peter Todd responds that getting a BIP # assigned is usually the last thing the better-known Bitcoin Core developers do, and explains that the development process is backwards - first, write the protocol specification (code), then write the human-readable reference (BIP). Todd suggests that BIP numbers should only be assigned after significant adoption to prevent headaches caused by the current system.A thread from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses a proposal to simplify the BIP number assignment process by allowing anyone to open a pull request and use the PR # as the BIP #. This would avoid conflicts and eliminate the need for manual assignment. However, it may result in some numbers going unused if PRs are opened to update existing BIPs. The process can still be independent from approving/merging the BIP into master, provided it meets quality standards.One user suggests that assigning BIP numbers should only occur after significant adoption to avoid headaches caused by the current system. Another user notes that the Bitcoin consensus protocol development process is often backwards, with the code being written before the human-readable reference explaining it (the BIP).</summary>
