    <summary>The discussion between Eric Lombrozo and Jorge Timón revolves around the effects of a soft fork on hashpower, confirmation times, throughput, and miner revenue. Eric argues that increasing the difficulty through a second independent PoW check after the activation of a soft fork can lead to longer confirmation times, lower throughput, and lower miner revenue but compensating for these economic shifts is possible by increasing block size and rewards. However, Jorge is not convinced that the pow per block would necessarily be higher if mining revenue per unit of time drops as total pow per unit of time should also drop. Eric admits that his model is overly simplistic and unrealistic as hashpower is not constant in reality. Despite this, they explore the extent of what's possible with only a soft fork.</summary>
