    <summary>On Dec 19, 2015, a member of bitcoin-dev named jl2012 calculated the effect of a SW softfork on the actual total block size. Segwit needs client-side adoption to enable an actual blocksize increase, which can be seen as a good thing because it is a clear sign that the ecosystem as a whole has opted-in to a blocksize increase. This is not as good as a direct proof-of-stake vote and somewhat coercive as a vote as you pay lower fees, but it's an interesting side-effect. The email includes a signature attachment, indicating its authenticity.</summary>
