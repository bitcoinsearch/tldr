    <summary>Bryan Bishop, a bitcoin developer, has shared a list of links to transcripts from the Scaling Bitcoin workshops held in Hong Kong and Montreal. The transcripts include talks on topics such as block size proposals, scalability, zero-knowledge proofs, and lightning network. Bishop notes that the transcripts are not exact due to his typing while listening, but they offer valuable insights into the discussions at the workshops.</summary>
