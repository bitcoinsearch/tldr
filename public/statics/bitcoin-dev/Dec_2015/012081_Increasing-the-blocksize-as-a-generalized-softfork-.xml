    <summary>On December 20, 2015, a member of bitcoin-dev named joe2015 raised the idea of an Arbitrary Block-size Increase Via a Generalized Softfork. He referred to the concept of "extension blocks" which was discussed previously on the Bitcoin development mailing list and on Bitcointalk forum. The idea of extended blocks was also mentioned in another thread on Bitcointalk. Bryan, who signed off the email, provided his contact information including his website and phone number.</summary>
