    <summary>In an email thread dated December 9th, 2015, Jorge Timón raises concerns about how SPV nodes will validate transactions with the new format. He argues that unless they adapt to the new version, the nodes won't think they are validating transactions with the new format. He suggests that making it a hardfork would be better on the grounds of simpler design and smaller fraud proofs. Timón admits he doesn't understand how a sigwit payment would look like to the current software and adds learning about it to his to-do list. The email thread includes HTML and non-text attachments.</summary>
