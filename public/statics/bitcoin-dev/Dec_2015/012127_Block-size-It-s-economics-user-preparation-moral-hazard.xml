    <summary>In a discussion between Jonathan Toomim and Pieter Wuille on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Wuille expressed his concern that 75% consensus is not a sufficient switchover point for a hardfork. Wuille argued that this would result in a 25% forked off chain temporarily. Toomim agreed with Wuille's concerns, suggesting that a grace period of about 4000 to 8000 blocks (1 to 2 months) would be better. However, he also pointed out that this timeframe is overly optimistic given the slow adoption rate of full nodes even for uncontroversial changes like BIP65 and BIP66. Toomim suggested that the shortest reasonable timeframe for an uncontroversial hardfork would be 6 to 12 months, but for controversial ones, not at all.</summary>
