    <summary>In December 2015, Tomas proposed a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to reduce developer centralization and minimize the risk of forks introduced by implementations other than bitcoin-core. However, Luke criticized the motivation behind this proposal stating that BIPs are required to have a reference implementation, but it need not necessarily be for Bitcoin Core specifically. He also commented on the specification, saying that it looked like an inefficient and bloaty reinvention of version bits.</summary>
