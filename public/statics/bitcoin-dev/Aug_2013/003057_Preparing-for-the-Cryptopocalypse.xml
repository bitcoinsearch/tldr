    <summary>In a conversation between Peter Vessenes and an unknown person, Vessenes discusses the possibility of layering NTRU onto Bitcoin. NTRU is a lattice-based algorithm that is one of the few recommended quantum-resistant algorithms by NIST. However, the algorithm to produce signatures, NTRUsign, was broken last year. Despite this, Vessenes believes that it could still be acceptable for Bitcoin as long as only one signature is created per key, although he acknowledges that it is a bet that improving the attack from a few thousand signatures to one is not possible. Additionally, if NTRUsign is broken, there are always alternatives such as Lamport signatures.</summary>
