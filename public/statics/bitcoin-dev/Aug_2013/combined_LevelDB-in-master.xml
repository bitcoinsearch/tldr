    <summary>On August 16, 2013, a pull request (#2702) was merged into the master branch of Ripple on an unofficial Ripple fork of LevelDB instead of just updating to LevelDB 1.12.0. While Vinnie had somewhat disclosed this, it was not fully understood by others. The "Ripple and Bitcoin fork" was believed to be just LevelDB with changes already made, but there appeared to be other changes included in what was finally merged. Furthermore, Ripple's fork did not do a proper git merge of upstream, creating a break in git history, and several upstream fixes were not included in the merge. As a result, Luke-Jr pushed three branches to https://github.com/luke-jr/leveldb: bitcoin-1.5 for reference, bitcoin included in 0.8.x, and bitcoin-up merged with upstream LevelDB 1.12. A diff from current master (Ripple LevelDB 1.12 fork) to bitcoin-up can be found at https://gist.github.com/luke-jr/6248543. Pieter Todd suggests reverting to a codebase as close to upstream LevelDB 1.12 as possible to fix the issue. The diff between bitcoin head and bitcoin-up shows a few reverted patches that were included during 0.9's merge window.Pieter cleaned up the history of the LevelDB subtree in the http://github.com/bitcoin/leveldb repository (branch bitcoin-fork) and used git-subtree to create a pull request (#2907) which switches the src/leveldb directory to this tree. It lists the reverted changes in the squashed commit and corresponds to the actual diff produced by Luke-Jr. Peter Todd responded to the issue, noting that he had run into a similar problem while auditing Litecoin. He stated that tools to audit whether a set of git patches/merges matched upstream or downstream don't exist yet. Although manually checking individual files could work, automating the process would be helpful.</summary>
