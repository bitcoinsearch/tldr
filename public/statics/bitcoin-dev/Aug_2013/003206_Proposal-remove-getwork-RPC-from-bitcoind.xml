    <summary>In an email exchange on August 22, 2013, Mike Hearn discussed the annoyance of testing and how regtest mode can be useful. Regtest mode allows for the creation of a new block by running "setgenerate true." However, it was suggested that a simple miner should be packaged with the main repository as a separate program when the internal miner is removed. This would prevent the core code from being burdened. The discussion on this topic can be found in the GitHub pull request #2917. Wladimir contributed to the conversation.</summary>
