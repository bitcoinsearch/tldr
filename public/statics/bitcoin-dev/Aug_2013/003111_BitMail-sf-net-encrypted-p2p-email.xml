    <summary>In a message dated 08/09/2013, Randolph D. asks if anyone has tested the secure encrypted p2p email found at http://bitmail.sf.net. The Doctor, developer of Project Byzantium, responds that they have not tested it recently as it is CPU and network intensive, which could be harmful to the user's needs. They recommend reading the security analyses of Bitmessage but haven't had the time to do so themselves. The security analyses can be found at https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php?topic=1666.0 and http://www.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1fwyx7/a_security_analysis_of_bitmessage/. The Doctor signs off with their PGP key and a link to their website.</summary>
