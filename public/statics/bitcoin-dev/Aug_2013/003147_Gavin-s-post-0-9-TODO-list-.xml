    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter Todd inquired about UPNP (Universal Plug and Play) on Android, to which Gavin Andresen responded that it could be investigated. However, he was skeptical of how useful it would be, as not everyone who has access to wifi can necessarily use UPnP for reconfiguration. Instead, he suggested prioritization through signed timestamps, which would require no state on the node side. This method would allow nodes to give priority to those with older timestamps. Andresen believed that this approach would align better with Satoshi's original vision of supporting millions of users with only 100,000 nodes.</summary>
