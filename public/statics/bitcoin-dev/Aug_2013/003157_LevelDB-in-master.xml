    <summary>A pull request (#2702) merged into the master branch has put it on an unofficial Ripple fork of LevelDB instead of just updating to LevelDB 1.12.0. Though Vinnie had somewhat disclosed this, the nature of the change was not fully understood. The "Ripple and Bitcoin fork" was believed to be just LevelDB with the changes already made. However, there were other changes in the final merge a few weeks ago. This resulted in a break in git history and prevented upstream fixes (including some reported to the Bitcoin issue tracker) from being included. Luke-Jr pushed three branches to https://github.com/luke-jr/leveldb: bitcoin-1.5 for reference, bitcoin included in 0.8.x, and bitcoin-up merged with upstream LevelDB 1.12. A diff from current master (Ripple LevelDB 1.12 fork) to bitcoin-up is available at https://gist.github.com/luke-jr/6248543.The changes appear harmless, but Pieter Todd suggests reverting to a codebase as close to upstream LevelDB 1.12 as possible. The diff between bitcoin head and bitcoin-up shows a few reverted patches that were included during 0.9's merge window. Pieter cleaned up the history of the LevelDB subtree in the http://github.com/bitcoin/leveldb repository (branch bitcoin-fork) and used git-subtree to create a pull request (#2907) which switches the src/leveldb directory to this tree. It lists the reverted changes in the squashed commit and corresponds to the actual diff produced by Luke-Jr.</summary>
