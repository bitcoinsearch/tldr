    <summary>On August 19th, 2013, Jeff Garzik wrote an email discussing the removal of the internal miner in Litecoin 0.8.x and how getwork will be removed in the next major version. He suggested that Pooler's CPU minerd could add GBT support to help remove the internal miner and getwork. However, it was noted that the internal miner is still actively used for testnet. Another individual expressed concern that removing the easy way to mine blocks would be a negative outcome.</summary>
