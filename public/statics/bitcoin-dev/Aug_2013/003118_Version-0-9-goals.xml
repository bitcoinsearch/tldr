    <summary>In an email exchange dated August 15, 2013, Mike Hearn and Pieter discussed the success of a new optimization technique. Pieter reported that headers first cut sync time to 45 minutes for him with a hexacore Xeon CPU, libsecp256k1 for verification, and a very good network connection. The code is available on GitHub and seems to be stable, but there are some things that need cleaning up before it can be pull requested. Pieter, Matt, and Mike also discussed the importance of shipping payment protocol support in at least two clients simultaneously to send a powerful message that they really mean it. They hope to get updates out for Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit once bcj has support. BitPay expressed interest in being a leader in support for the protocol. Pieter believes that wider support than just Bitcoin-Qt is necessary, as the number of people using the reference client as a wallet is quite low. The goal is to have several clients and merchants start support for it in a short timeframe.</summary>
