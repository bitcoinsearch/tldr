    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development mailing list, Alan, has expressed skepticism regarding the validity of claims that elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a much more secure alternative to RSA. He posits that factoring and discrete logarithm problem (DLP) are intimately related in quantum computing, meaning that breaking one could lead to breaking the other. Additionally, quantum computers use an efficient DLP-solving circuit to "shortcut" the factoring problem. However, it is unclear whether this relationship exists outside of the scope of quantum computing. Despite his skepticism, Alan still acknowledges that the presentation shared by Melvin Carvalho on advances in cryptography is good, but he is not convinced that ECC is the solution to the cryptopocalypse.</summary>
