    <summary>In a discussion about making the bitcoin address optional in the bitcoin URI, Gavin Andresen expressed his agreement that sometimes merchants may not need backwards compatibility or want to include an arbitrary bitcoin address. In response to a suggestion that customers' machines should not broadcast transactions right away, Andresen requested input from other wallet implementors regarding "locked inputs" and whether there would be any issues with payment processing servers having "broadcast transaction" functionality. He also expressed concern that the payment protocol may not receive widespread support if it is too difficult to implement.</summary>
