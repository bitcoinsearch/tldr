    <summary>In this email exchange, Chris Evans suggests the idea of having a name server in the Bitcoin client software that can be used to assign an alias to wallet IDs. He believes that using English names to describe wallet public key addresses would make it easier to recall them. However, Luke points out that addresses are not meant to be remembered but rather sent electronically or through QR codes as single-use destinations for transactions. Bitcoin currently does not have a person/wallet identity system, but there are other mechanisms like PGP. Luke goes on to say that Gavin has been working on a new Payment Protocol that allows users to publish a URI for a website, which can be reused to pay them more than once. Therefore, it seems that Chris's idea has already been satisfied by this new protocol. Overall, while Chris's idea of assigning aliases to wallet IDs may seem helpful, it is not necessary given the current mechanisms available and the purpose of addresses as single-use destinations.</summary>
