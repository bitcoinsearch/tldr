    <summary>This context is about a proposal for a new BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) called "NODE_BLOOM service bit". The BIP aims to extend the existing BIP 37, Connection Bloom filtering, by introducing a service bit that allows peers to explicitly advertise their support for bloom filters. BIP 37 did not specify a service bit for bloom filter service which assumed that all nodes that serve peers data support it. However, there are cases where a node may want to provide data but may not have implemented bloom filtering. The proposal was authored by Peter Todd and created on August 17th, 2013. Gregory Maxwell also contributed to the discussion by asking if a BIP number could be assigned to the proposal as the next available number, 38, was already listed on the wiki as "Passphrase-protected private key" by Mike Caldwell. The NODE_BLOOM protocol bit, added by the proposed BIP, can be used as an option for full-node operators who want to donate only a small amount of bandwidth for providing services to the public. By allowing nodes to advertise their support for bloom filters explicitly, the proposal aims to improve the granularity of the services provided by nodes to the public.</summary>
