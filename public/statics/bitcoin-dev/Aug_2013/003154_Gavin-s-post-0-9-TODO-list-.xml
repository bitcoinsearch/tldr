    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik, the former expressed disapproval towards the idea of having a "smaller subset of Bloom filtering nodes" as optional. He deemed this idea as stupid and suggested that instead of trying to break features that work, real fixes should be implemented to address concerns about Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Jeff Garzik, a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, replied to Hearn's message and stated that it is not just an abstract worry.</summary>
