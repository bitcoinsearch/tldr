    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, a member corrected another member who had mixed up BitMail with BitMessage. The correction included a link to BitMail's website, which offers secure encrypted peer-to-peer email services. The member also mentioned that BitMessage security analyses were available in various forums, but they had not yet been able to review them due to limited compute cycles. The email signature of the message included links to Project Byzantium, a developer project, and the personal website of The Doctor, who sent the email. Additionally, the email contained an advertisement for AppDynamics Lite, a troubleshooting tool for Java and .NET code.</summary>
