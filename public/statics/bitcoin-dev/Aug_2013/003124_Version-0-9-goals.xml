    <summary>The plan is to add support for payment protocol into v1 firmware. However, this depends on the readiness of surrounding infrastructure, specifically if there will be support for payment protocol in Multibit at the time of v1 release. It is believed that Multibit will be the first wallet compatible with Trezor and supporting payment protocol. Supporting HD wallets is the trickiest part of the process. Gary is working on TrezorJ, and Matija has already completed the core algorithms. If necessary, a basic HD wallet implementation can be done that only iterates a key once and does not generate new keys for each transaction. This is because generating new keys for each transaction leads to memory bloat on phones.</summary>
