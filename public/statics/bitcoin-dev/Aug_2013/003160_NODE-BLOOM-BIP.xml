    <summary>During a discussion, Mike and Gavin Andresen both expressed their opposition to the NODE_BLOOM service bit. They both agree that making different parts of the protocol optional is not a good idea as it can have negative effects on privacy and decentralization. Adding more bits can also lead to an exponential number of combinations that need to be tested by QA teams. Gavin emphasized that he would say the same thing about NODE_TRANSACTION and does not know much about NODE_BLOCK bits.</summary>
