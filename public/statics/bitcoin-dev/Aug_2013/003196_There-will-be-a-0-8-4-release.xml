    <summary>The Bitcoin team has announced a new 0.8.* release that will address some not-quite-serious-enough-to-justify-a-release security fixes and some serious bugs. The announcement reveals that the changes from the 0.8.3 release will include security-related improvements such as RPC password resistance to timing attacks, performance optimization for bloom filters to help mitigate potential DoS attack, as well as simplified storage of orphan transactions with CVE-2013-4627 fix. Bug fixes have also been included such as fixing Gnome bitcoin URI handler, non-standard disconnected transactions causing mempool orphans, multi-block reorg transaction resurrection, and mempool consistency check. The new release is based on the 0.8.3 branch, and the team will cherry-pick from the master branch. Although there are many little fixes that could be included in the new release, they will wait for the 0.9 release.</summary>
