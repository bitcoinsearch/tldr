    <summary>NativeClient code has the same access level as JavaScript and can be used to execute things faster. Chrome app distribution via the Chrome store is a viable option, but it has its pros and cons. The APIs Chrome exposes are a strict subset of what a real OS provides, limiting what users can do with the app. Wendell suggests using special browser features to bundle the wallet in Chrome, but Mike Hearn says that a web app cannot make raw TCP socket connections due to restrictions. However, browser-specific things like extensions or installable apps can give code greater access permissions, essentially using Chrome as an app platform instead of a JVM. But, this means that users would need to install an entire browser to run the wallet app, which could deter some. Mike does not find this design compelling because JavaScript is less safe, performs worse, has fewer features, and lacks mature tools compared to other languages/platforms.</summary>
