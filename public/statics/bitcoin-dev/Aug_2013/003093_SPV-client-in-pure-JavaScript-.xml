    <summary>Chrome apps and extensions can make raw TCP socket connections using the TCP Listen API, although they are not standard APIs. HTML5 is unlikely to support USB access anytime soon, but packaged Chrome apps do. Packaged apps have their own windows, run offline, and are more similar to native apps. Code that runs inside NativeClient has the same access level as JavaScript, but it is a way to do things faster. Chrome for mobile does not do apps at the moment, and users are still limited by the APIs Chrome exposes. Wendell suggests using special browser features and bundling them in an app platform like Chrome. Mike Hearn believes that this approach uses Chrome as the app platform instead of a JVM, which assumes that more users have Chrome than a JVM. However, users who do not have Chrome would probably hesitate to install an entire browser to run a wallet app. Hearn also believes that using JavaScript outside the browser results in less safety, performance, features, and mature tools compared to languages/platforms designed for it.</summary>
