    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn discussed the implementation of bitcoinj and BitPay taking the lead to promote it. He mentioned that payment protocol support should be shipped in at least two clients simultaneously with a big merchant signed up for maximum impact. Someone volunteered to do it for bitcoinj, and if he doesn't pull through, Mike has some old code from EOY 2012 that he could update to the latest spec and ship basic support. They hope to get Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit updates out once bitcoinj has support. Jeff said that BitPay wants to be a leader in support for the protocol, so they plan to co-ordinate release dates to grab the ecosystem's attention.</summary>
