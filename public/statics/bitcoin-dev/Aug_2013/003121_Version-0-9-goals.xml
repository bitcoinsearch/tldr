    <summary>On August 15, 2013, Gavin Andresen discussed the final release of Bitcoin 0.9. He suggested that they were near a feature freeze and start of the release cycle. He listed some issues like fixing leveldb corruption issue, payment protocol support, sipa's "header first" initial block download optimization, coin control, autotools work, Gitian-build with the latest openssl and Qt5, and updating the version of Debian VMs. Andresen planned to spend half his time on code review and the other half on code that probably wouldn't make it into the 0.9 release. The email received positive feedback from one member.</summary>
