    <summary>In an email thread from August 15, 2013, Wladimir expressed agreement with implementing payment protocol, autotools, and a Qt5 build. However, he was hesitant about coin control due to its previous introduction of statefulness into the wallet model, which could be problematic for concurrency. Despite this concern, Wladimir acknowledged that many people seem to want it and as long as the issues are resolved, he is fine with its inclusion. Pieter weighed in on the discussion, stating that the state issue has been resolved and is now passed in a separate object to the transaction-creation methods. Pieter believes that coin control can be helpful in understanding the difference between the high-level abstraction of the wallet and the underlying implementation of individual coins. He suggests that this could be even more important than the ability for micro-management that coin control offers. Pieter also mentions that multiwallet would be more appropriate for avoiding linkage between identities, but there has been little progress on that front at the time.</summary>
