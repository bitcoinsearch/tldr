    <summary>In this email thread, Mike Hearn suggests removing the 'getwork' RPC from bitcoind. However, Wladimir argues that it would be annoying for testing and proposes that a simple miner should be packaged with the main repository as a separate program. He suggests that the miner code's hashes/sec are a function of how much CPU time it gets and that there is no burden to the code when it is not mining. Ron also contributes to the conversation by admitting that he has modified the miner code a little and uses every allowable nonce to check for a new block in a timed fashion.</summary>
