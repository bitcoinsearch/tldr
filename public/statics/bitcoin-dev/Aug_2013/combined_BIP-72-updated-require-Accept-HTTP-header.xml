    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a developer of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 72 (BIP 72), has proposed a requirement for wallets to include an Accept HTTP header in HTTP requests. The specific header he suggested is `Accept: application/bitcoin-paymentrequest`, which was suggested by Stephen/Jeff at BitPay. He submitted a pull request for this change to be included in the proposal. Andresen also plans to make a similar change to BIP 70 by requiring wallets to set another Accept HTTP header, specifically `Accept: application/bitcoin-paymentrequestack`, when sending and expecting a PaymentACK message in return. This requirement will ensure that wallets are able to properly handle payment requests and responses in a standardized way. By adding these requirements to the proposals, Andresen is aiming to improve the functionality and interoperability of Bitcoin wallets. These changes will ensure that all wallets are able to communicate with each other in a standardized way, making it easier for users to transact with Bitcoin.</summary>
