    <summary>In an email exchange dated August 19, 2013, Gregory Maxwell expressed his opinion on the removal of the ability to mine in the stock package, saying that it would be regrettable. However, he assumed that Jeff's patch had removed the internal CPU miner, which is necessary to get rid of most of the getwork code. He later clarified that Jeff's patch did not remove the internal CPU miner.Maxwell still believes that the internal miner is mostly a pretext for integrated mining and that it only works on testnet, making it unsuitable for testing the production software. He suggests removing the internal miner altogether to get rid of extra code and complexity and instead packaging up a GBT miner that can be used on the mainnet.</summary>
