    <summary>Bitcoinj, a Java library used for writing Bitcoin applications, has released version 0.10. This release includes several new features and improvements. Micropayment channels have been added along with a sublibrary that provides async IO based client/server classes that transmit length prefixed protocol buffers. The BIP 32 deterministic wallet algorithm has also been implemented in this release. Additionally, there is a new Maven plugin that checks the SHA1 hashes of downloaded dependencies against a hard-coded list to prevent corrupted versions from being downloaded unnoticed. The release also includes support for automatic wallet key rotation, acceptance of timelocked transactions, and custom PeerFilterProvider implementors registration. Other changes include nullity annotations to the API, better control over Wallet toString() dumps, rewritten documentation including the getting started tutorial and PingService example, and bug fixes.To obtain bitcoinj 0.10, users can visit the following page: https://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/wiki/UsingMaven. However, users are advised to visit the limitations and missing features page for more details on known issues and missing features.</summary>
