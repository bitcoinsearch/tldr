    <summary>In a recent statement by Peter, he suggested that SPV peers should be deprioritized and served only with whatever resources a node has spare if they don't contribute back to the network. However, Gavin Andresen argued that SPV peers are incredibly important to the growth of Bitcoin and should not be deprioritized. In fact, they are much more important than nodes that have the bandwidth and disk I/O capability of being a full node. Andresen believes that Bitcoin will be just fine if there are never more than 10,000 big, beefy, full nodes forming the backbone of the network, but it will be nothing if we don't support tens of millions of lightweight SPV devices.Andresen also acknowledged that Bitcoin would be just fine in an Electrum model where tens of millions of lightweight devices rely 100% on a full node to operate. However, he prefers the more decentralized, less-trust-required SPV model. Therefore, prioritizing SPV peers and supporting their growth seems to be essential for the healthy development of Bitcoin.</summary>
