    <summary>In an email conversation on Aug 19, 2013, Warren Togami Jr. stated that Litecoin had removed the internal miner in version 0.8.x and warned users that getwork would also be removed in the next major version. He suggested that Pooler's CPU minerd, which supports both sha256d and scrypt, add GBT support to help completely remove the internal miner and getwork. However, Jeff Garzik pointed out that the internal miner was still actively used for testnet purposes. Jeff Garzik is a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
