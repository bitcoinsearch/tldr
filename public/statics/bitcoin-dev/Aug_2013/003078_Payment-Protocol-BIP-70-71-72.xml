    <summary>In an email conversation between developers Mike Hearn and Pieter Wuille on August 7, 2013, Hearn raised concerns about ensuring that wallet applications could function without supporting the P2P protocol. He felt that this would drop a huge implementation overhead for simple wallets, which might be hardware-based. Wuille questioned how such wallets would get transactions into their wallet in the first place. Hearn suggested that these wallets could connect to some other client, such as a small hardware client that is able to do payments via NFC/QR with a merchant and can get recharged by connecting with a desktop client. Wuille did not have a strong opinion either way but felt that doing more work to prevent transactions being announced to the network felt weird.</summary>
