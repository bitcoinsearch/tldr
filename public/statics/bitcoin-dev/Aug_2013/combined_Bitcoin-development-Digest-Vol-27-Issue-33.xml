    <summary>The email thread discussed the removal of the 'getwork' RPC from bitcoind. Mike Hearn proposed its removal, but Wladimir argued that it would cause inconvenience during testing and suggested that a simple miner should be packaged with the main repository as a separate program instead. Wladimir also stated that the miner code's hashes/sec are dependent on how much CPU time it gets, and there is no burden to the code when it is not mining. Ron provided input by admitting that he modified the miner code to check for a new block in a timed fashion by using every allowable nonce. The conversation ultimately concluded with the decision to keep the 'getwork' RPC in bitcoind and include a separate program for a simple miner in the main repository.</summary>
