    <summary>A letter to Bitcoin developers suggests that trading arbitrary amounts of Bitcoins makes it easier to trace transactions. The suggestion is to enforce discipline that only keeps a power-of-two amount of satoshis in use-once wallets except for public donation addresses. Although the particular discipline may not be the best to implement, some discipline should be enforced to make tracing harder. Merchants would generate a series of new addresses at each transaction, and customers would send appropriately sized buckets of satoshis to each address. A standard way to specify an amount and a list of addresses as a target for payment should be established, but it might require higher resolution QR codes. It is suggested that this idea has already been considered before, but it's unclear if it was accepted or rejected.Bitcoin developers are struggling with a shortage of testers and full-time contributors, resulting in delays in implementing new functionality. Instead of focusing on adding new features, the development team is asking for help in testing existing features. Addressing a specific user's suggestion, the developers noted that addresses should only be used once to ensure privacy and reduce the ability to trace transactions. Though ideas such as using power-of-two amounts for transactions were appreciated, they may not necessarily improve privacy. Using only single-use addresses is considered best practice by Bitcoin developer Luke-Jr. He also suggests that keeping change amounts as powers of two would hurt privacy and potentially upset users. He suggests transaction fees could be paid separately by small-bucket transactions. While it is already recommended to use a unique payment address for each transaction, Luke-Jr acknowledges that merchants might consider using multiple addresses/coins as a privacy extension. However, he notes that it may not be urgent enough to make it worthwhile. In conclusion, while Bitcoin developers are looking for more contributors to help with testing existing features, there are suggestions on how to improve Bitcoin's privacy. These include enforcing discipline on the amount of satoshis kept in wallets, generating new addresses at each transaction, and using single-use addresses. While there is room for improvement in Bitcoin-Qt's "Receive coins" tab to discourage address reuse, other ideas such as using power-of-two amounts for transactions may not necessarily improve privacy. The use of multiple addresses/coins for a single payment could be discussed as a possible privacy extension but is not considered an urgent issue.</summary>
