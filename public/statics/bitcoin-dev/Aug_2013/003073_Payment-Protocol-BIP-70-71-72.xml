    <summary>In an email conversation dating back to August 8, 2013, Gavin Andresen suggested that if payments are allowed to fail without being broadcasted, it is highly desirable for the wallet to invalidate the transaction as soon as possible by spending the outputs in a pay-to-self transaction. This is because, without such an action, malicious receivers or temporary failures could result in a user being told that a transfer didn't happen only for the coins to leave the wallet later on.</summary>
