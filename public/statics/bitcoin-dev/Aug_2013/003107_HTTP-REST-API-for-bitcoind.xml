    <summary>The conversation revolves around implementing an HTTP REST wrapper around bitcoind's RPC interface in Python. The goal is to create a simple HTTP server that can translate HTTP GET requests into relevant RPC request and respond with the required data. There is a discussion about adding usual HTTP authentication/SSL stuff to the REST API so that SPV users could decide to run their own instance of the API. It was suggested that a trusted party could set up the server for users of Bitcoin Wallet. However, it was argued that anyone who wants HTTP authentication or TLS can wrap it with nginx or something similar and put appropriate restrictions in place on incoming requests to keep it secure. Overall, the discussion revolved around the implementation and security of the HTTP REST wrapper around bitcoind's RPC interface.</summary>
