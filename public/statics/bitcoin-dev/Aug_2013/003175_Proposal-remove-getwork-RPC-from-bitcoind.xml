    <title>Proposal: remove "getwork" RPC from bitcoind</title>

    <summary>A pull request has been submitted to remove the "getwork" RPC from Bitcoind, as it is no longer widely used. On mainnet, almost everybody uses a pool and not "getwork" directly to Bitcoind. Those who solo mine use a pool server to communicate with Bitcoind via "getblocktemplate" or other means. Tests have shown that attempting to solo mine on mainnet via "getwork" leads to delays and problems. Although getwork may continue to work on testnet, there are open source pool servers available for testnet, which eliminates the need to support getwork. However, at one time, getwork was widely used, and Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, wanted to gauge response to removing "getwork." If there is a driving use case that they are unaware of, they have requested users to speak up so they do not break anything unnecessarily.</summary>
