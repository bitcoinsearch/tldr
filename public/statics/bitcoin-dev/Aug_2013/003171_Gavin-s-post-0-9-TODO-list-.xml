    <summary>In this context, John Dillon raises a question about the proof size that UTXO commitment people have in mind. The response is that the size should be more than a kilobyte and probably less than a few tens of kilobytes depending on tweakable parameters such as branching factor and script vs. hash(script) with long-term/short-term tradeoffs. Additionally, an interesting concept is mentioned where a transaction with some txin proofs can be safely relayed by SPV nodes. The message is also signed with PGP signature to ensure authenticity.</summary>
