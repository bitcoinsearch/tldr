    <summary>The discussion revolves around removing the "getwork" RPC from bitcoind, which was once widely used but is now unnecessary and problematic. Jeff Garzik proposes to remove it as almost everyone now uses a pool and not "getwork" directly to bitcoind. Those who solo mine use a pool server to talk to bitcoind via "getblocktemplate" or other means. Attempts to solo mine on mainnet via "getwork" lead to delays and problems. Tests show that getwork has a better chance of continuing to work on testnet. However, the same tools (open source pool servers or p2pool) are available for testnet, making it unnecessary to support getwork. Matt agrees that there is no reason to leave broken things that aren't necessary and that no one has the developer resources to fix.Jeff wanted to gauge the response to removing "getwork" and if there is a driving use case that they are unaware of, they don't want to break anyone needlessly. Overall, it seems that removing "getwork" would be a logical step forward as it is no longer widely used and has proven to be problematic in certain situations.</summary>
