    <summary>The Bitcoin development community is discussing the proposal to remove "getwork" RPC from bitcoind. While some members believe that mining code in bitcoind &amp; qt is not so hard to improve and even use, others think that it would be a pity if the easy way to mine blocks was removed. Jeff Garzik noted that Litecoin 0.8.x entirely removed the internal miner and warned people that getwork will be removed in the next major version. Though the internal miner is still actively used for testnet. Gregory Maxwell suggested packaging up a modern mining tool that supports CPU/GPU/FPGA/ASIC mining against a current bitcoind. Andreas Schildbach thinks that the easy way to mine blocks should not be removed. Ron agrees with Andreas, saying that he doesn't mind having a "snow ball's chance in hell" of solving the "next" block. Ron also believes that separating the wallet code or mining code, ought to be much easier if the code was properly commented, formatted, organized, etc. The aim is to first clean up the code enough so that it can be understood and eventually taken over to a real Windows project/solution where it can be made into an executable that is palatable for the masses.</summary>
