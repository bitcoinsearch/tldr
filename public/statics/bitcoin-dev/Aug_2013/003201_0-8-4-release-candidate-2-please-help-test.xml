    <summary>Bitcoin has released the 0.8.4 release candidate 2, which is a maintenance release to fix a critical bug and three minor security issues; it contains very few changes from the 0.8.3 release. The release can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.4/test/. Two changes that need testing include OSX FD_FULLSYNC leveldb corruption fix and Bloom filter optimization. The developers ask users who have experienced database corruption on OSX to try this release and let them know if it helps, as well as for those with code that uses the bloom-filtered block (merkleblock) protocol to try it against this release and report any issues. A critical last-minute bug was found in release candidate 1, which was never released.</summary>
