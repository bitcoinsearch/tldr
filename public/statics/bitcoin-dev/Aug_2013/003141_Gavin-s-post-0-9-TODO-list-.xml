    <summary>In an email conversation on August 16, 2013, Peter Todd discussed the vulnerabilities of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes in Bitcoin. According to Todd, SPV honeypots can attract a disproportionate percentage of the total SPV population and be used to harm SPV nodes by dropping transactions deterministically or degrading the capacity of honest nodes. He suggested that creating fake transactions with the same scriptPubKeys and amounts as the dropped ones could lock users out of their money. Todd also raised concerns about bitcoinj's protection against peers flooding users with useless unconfirmed transactions that match the bloom filter.</summary>
