    <summary>The email exchange between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen reveals their plans for developments in the Bitcoin network. Hearn suggests the creation of a new anti-Denial of Service (DoS) framework, which he believes will be better filled in by other people once the outline is in place. He also suggests postponing writing whitepapers on block size limits since there is still enough space in block sizes post-April. Meanwhile, Andresen shares his three priorities: smarter fee handling on the client side, first double-spend relaying and alerting to support low-value transactions, and working on two to three whitepapers explaining why the 1MB block size limit must be increased or removed and debunking arguments against it. The email concludes with Hearn suggesting another development update on the foundation blog.</summary>
