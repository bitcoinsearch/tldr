    <summary>Bitcoinj, a Java library used for writing Bitcoin applications, has released version 0.10. The release includes the addition of micropayment channels, a simple sublibrary providing async IO based client/server classes that transmit length prefixed protocol buffers, and the implementation of the BIP 32 deterministic wallet algorithm. Additionally, there is a new Maven plugin that checks the SHA1 hashes of downloaded dependencies against a hard-coded list to prevent corrupted versions without anyone noticing, as well as improved callback and exception handling. The release also includes support for automatic wallet key rotation, acceptance of timelocked transactions, and custom PeerFilterProvider implementors registration. Other changes include nullity annotations to the API, better control over Wallet toString() dumps, rewritten documentation including the getting started tutorial and PingService example, and bug fixes.
