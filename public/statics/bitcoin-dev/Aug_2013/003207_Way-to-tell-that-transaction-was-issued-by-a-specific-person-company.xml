    <summary>The current Bitcoin protocol does not allow arbitrary data to be included in transactions, as this would make them non-standard and unrelatable by clients. This means that if a user has multiple addresses, they cannot sign them with a single private key and include the signature in the transaction for the other party to verify against their public key. However, it is suggested that a reputable wallet service could issue transactions that require zero confirmations from the other party by adding a signature to show that the transaction is from a trusted source, similar to Mt.Gox's "green address". To achieve this without forking the chain, a feature could be added to the protocol by adding support for specific scripts. The script should not exceed 34 bytes, and further definition of the script is required for its use. It is possible that this could be achieved using other mechanisms present in the Bitcoin protocol, but this idea raises the question of whether such a feature should be considered and added to the protocol.</summary>
