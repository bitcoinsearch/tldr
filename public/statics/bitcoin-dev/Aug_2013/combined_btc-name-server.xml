    <summary>Chris, a software developer from Tawhakisoft.com, suggested the idea of having an alias to wallet ID nameserver in client software where individuals can use an English name to describe a wallet public key address. This would make it easier to remember and recall. He feels that wallet IDs are hard to remember and recall, hence the need for an alternative solution. In response, Luke pointed out that addresses are not meant to be remembered but rather sent electronically or through QR codes as single-use destinations for transactions. Bitcoin currently does not have a person/wallet identity system, but there are other mechanisms like PGP. Gavin has been working on a new Payment Protocol that allows users to publish a URI for a website, which can be reused to pay them more than once. Therefore, it seems that Chris's idea has already been satisfied by this new protocol.In August 2013, Chris Evans suggested the idea of having a name server in the Bitcoin client software that can be used to assign an alias to wallet IDs. Rick had previously suggested leveraging DNS for mapping names to numbers but expects no support. The email thread also includes a link to an article discussing how to put SQL databases under version control. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge.The Namecoin blockchain has an id/ and a/ (alias) namespace which is used to store bitcoin addresses, bitmessage IDs, and other data. This allows people to use human-readable names rather than long alphanumeric strings to represent their wallet public key address. However, Rick Wesson noted that there would be no support for DNS as a mapping tool for names to numbers. The Namecoin blockchain's id/ and a/ namespace has been spam squatted by several actors recently. Several bitmessage IDs are stored here along with Bitcoin addresses. The purpose of Namecoin is to provide secure identity management, domain name registration, and decentralized data storage, all using a blockchain. It is also designed to be a merge-mined sidechain of Bitcoin, meaning that miners can mine both chains at the same time without any extra effort.Version control is standard for application code, but databases haven't caught up. Steps can be taken to put SQL databases under version control.</summary>
