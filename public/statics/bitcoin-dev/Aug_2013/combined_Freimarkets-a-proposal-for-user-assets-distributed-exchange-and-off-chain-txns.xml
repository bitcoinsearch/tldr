    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n and Mark Friedenbach have developed an extension of the Bitcoin and Ripple distributed protocols which allows for user-specified bearer instruments, distributed peer-to-peer exchange, off-chain accounting, auctions, derivatives, and transitive transactions. This opens up a multitude of financial contract possibilities. They are now looking for public comments about this or related approaches from the community. The specification is available for viewing at http://freico.in/docs/freimarkets-v0.0.1.pdf. The two developers spent a significant amount of time figuring out how to coordinate private accounting servers with the public chain and derivatives contracts. Both of these are essentially cryptographic protocols expressed as bitcoin scripts. Any input from resident cryptographers would be greatly appreciated.</summary>
