    <summary>In a 2013 email thread, Warren Togami Jr. discussed the potential benefits and drawbacks of limiting TCP connections between nodes on the Bitcoin network from the same IP or subnet. While Togami acknowledged that prioritizing inbound slots based on source IP could be a reasonable protective measure, he argued that outright limiting is worse and that it would not be effective against attacks that exhaust memory, CPU, IO, or bandwidth without trying to exhaust sockets. Additionally, Togami pointed out that such limitations would be nearly useless for IPv6-connected hosts and hidden service hosts. He suggested instead prioritizing based on certain criteria, including network mask commonality, when necessary to drop an inbound connection.</summary>
