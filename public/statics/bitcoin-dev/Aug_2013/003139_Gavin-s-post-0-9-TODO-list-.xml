    <summary>In a mailing list post from August 2013, Mike Hearn proposed the development of an anti-Denial of Service (DoS) framework for Bitcoin. This framework would include measures to make it easier for people to contribute back to the network, such as allowing SPV nodes with spare bandwidth to relay whole blocks to reduce the load on full-nodes. Additionally, SPV peers with bandwidth could do bloom filtering on behalf of peers that don't have spare bandwidth. Making it easier to run a full node was also suggested, and partial mode was proposed as the way to go here. However, from a legal perspective, it is important to ensure that running full nodes and mining p2pool or solo continue to be something ordinary users do, so that regulators don't see it as unusual or rare. Finally, possession proof needs to be created to prevent miners from mining blocks with fee paying transactions without actually having the full UTXO set.</summary>
