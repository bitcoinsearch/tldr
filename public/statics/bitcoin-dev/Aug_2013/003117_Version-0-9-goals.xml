    <summary>Pieter, Matt, and Gavin Andresen are discussing improvements to Bitcoin's sync time. Pieter shared that headers-first cut his sync time down to 45 minutes, which is a great improvement. They also agree that for maximum impact, payment protocol support should be shipped in at least two clients simultaneously, with a big merchant signed up. Jeff from BitPay wants to be a leader in support for the protocol. The goal is to coordinate release dates to make a big splash and grab the ecosystem's attention. Gavin plans on spending half his time on code review and helping get pull requests tested, and the other half working on code that probably won't make it into the 0.9 release. They discuss possible non-0.9 code improvements, such as fee rework and DoS work.</summary>
