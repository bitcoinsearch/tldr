    <title>Payment Protocol: BIP 70, 71, 72</title>

    <summary>The author of the comment wonders if there should be a discussion included in the BIP 72 specification regarding how the BIP 21 amount, message and label parameters should be processed when using the payment protocol. The author questions whether the amount parameter should be completely ignored and if the total amount requested by the PaymentRequest is required to match the amount parameter when present. Additionally, the author asks if the client is permitted to complain if they don't match. Regarding the message parameter, the author believes that the memo from PaymentDetails should take precedence, but if it's not present, what happens if message is present? The author suggests that this area may be more suited to SHOULDs and MAYs rather than MUSTs, but still believes it is worthy of mention.</summary>
