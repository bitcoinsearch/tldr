    <summary>In a discussion about the impact of removing "getwork" from the Bitcoin client on the "setgenerate" RPC call, Jeff Garzik stated that his pull request does not affect "setgenerate", but another proposal does remove the internal miner completely. This led to concerns about the usefulness of testnet-in-a-box for testing and its ease of setup. The regtest mode was suggested as an alternative, which allows for easy creation of new blocks by running "setgenerate true". It was also noted that setting up a complicated set of separate programs just to use regtest mode would be a step backwards. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in August 2013.</summary>
