    <summary>In August 2013, a proposal for a new BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) called "NODE_BLOOM service bit" was created with the aim of extending the existing BIP 37 by introducing a service bit that allows peers to explicitly advertise their support for bloom filters. The proposal was authored by Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell also contributed to the discussion by asking if a BIP number could be assigned to the proposal as the next available number, 38, was already listed on the wiki as "Passphrase-protected private key" by Mike Caldwell.BIP 37 did not specify a service bit for bloom filter service which assumed that all nodes that serve peers data support it. However, there are cases where a node may want to provide data but may not have implemented bloom filtering. The NODE_BLOOM protocol bit, added by the proposed BIP, can be used as an option for full-node operators who want to donate only a small amount of bandwidth for providing services to the public. By allowing nodes to advertise their support for bloom filters explicitly, the proposal aims to improve the granularity of the services provided by nodes to the public.The author of the email is opposing the proposed BIP, which suggests extending BIP 37 by defining a service bit for Bloom filters. The author argues that making every possible feature optional is not smart design and notes that there are currently no nodes that cannot support this feature. If a node does not support Bloom filters but receives a "filterload," "filteradd," or "filterclear" message from a peer, the node should disconnect that peer immediately. The proposed change is backward compatible, and nodes that require the Bloom filter service can set NODE_BLOOM for peers advertising an unchanged protocol version. The proposed BIP also suggests that DNS seeds and other peer discovery mechanisms support the ability to specify the required services.During a discussion, Mike and Gavin Andresen both expressed their opposition to the NODE_BLOOM service bit. They both agree that making different parts of the protocol optional is not a good idea as it can have negative effects on privacy and decentralization. Adding more bits can also lead to an exponential number of combinations that need to be tested by QA teams. Gavin emphasized that he would say the same thing about NODE_TRANSACTION and does not know much about NODE_BLOCK bits.In an email conversation from August 2013, Mike Hearn argued that the Bloom filtering feature in Bitcoin should not be optional, as it is not a lossless function and making every possible feature optional is not smart design. He compared it to making re-sharing optional in BitTorrent and expecting users to never upload data to peers that needed it. This argument suggests that certain features should be mandatory for optimal functionality. The document has been placed in the public domain, and a reference implementation is available on GitHub.</summary>
