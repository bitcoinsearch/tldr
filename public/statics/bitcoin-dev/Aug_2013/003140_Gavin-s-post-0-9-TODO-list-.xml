    <summary>Warren Togami Jr. suggested a method to mitigate DoS attacks on Bitcoin nodes by limiting the number of TCP connections from a single IP address or subnet using an iptables firewall-based example. Although this method has almost no drawbacks, it is too complicated for most people to deploy and may block legitimate connections. Configurable limits with sane defaults enforced by bitcoind itself would be a significant improvement over the current situation where one host address can consume limited resources of many target nodes. Peter Todd replied, suggesting the application of IP diversity tests for outgoing connections to incoming connections as the code is already available.</summary>
