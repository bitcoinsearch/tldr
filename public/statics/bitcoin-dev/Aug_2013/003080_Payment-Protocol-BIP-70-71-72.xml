    <summary>In many applications, there is a need to provide a single URL. Existing point-of-sale systems that display QR codes for the user to scan live within the limitations of existing Bitcoin URLs but would no doubt benefit from the payments protocol. However, it's not realistic for the terminal operator in a retail establishment to have to select which protocol will be used before generating the QR code. Therefore, the effect of the proposal is to require the lowest common denominator and effectively prevent such systems from using the payments protocol until it is sufficiently ubiquitous that they feel happy to simply require its use.Roy Badami has some concerns regarding BIP 72 and suggests including discussion in the specification as to how the BIP 21 amount, message, and label parameters should be processed when the payment protocol is used. He believes this area is more suited to SHOULDs and MAYs rather than MUSTs but is worthy of mention.</summary>
