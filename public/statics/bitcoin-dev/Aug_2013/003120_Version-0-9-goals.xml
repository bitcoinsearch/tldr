    <summary>Pieter, Matt and the author of the message are discussing the implementation of payment protocol support in multiple Bitcoin clients simultaneously. They believe that having at least two clients and a big merchant signed up would send a powerful message about their commitment to this feature. If necessary, the author has some old code from 2012 that could be updated for basic support. Once bitcoinj has support, they hope to release updates for Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit quickly. In addition, the author mentions that they plan to support payment protocol in Trezor, as they believe it is a missing piece in absolute security of hardware wallets.</summary>
