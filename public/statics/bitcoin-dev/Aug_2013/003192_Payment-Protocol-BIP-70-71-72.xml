    <summary>In this email conversation from August 2013, Andreas Petersson is asking Gavin Andresen about a standardized invoice serialization for integrating the Payment Protocol into their products. Gavin suggests using an existing standard or a subset of one, rather than reinventing the wheel. He also mentions that the 'invoice' field extension in the PaymentDetails message could encapsulate an XML-based standard for electronic invoicing. When asked about communicating acceptance levels of transactions, Gavin explains that it can't be done using several PaymentACK because the Payment-&gt;PaymentACK communication round-trip is done in one non-persistent HTTP request-response round-trip. Gavin expresses concern about allowing merchants to push messages to the wallet and vice versa, but suggests that a PaymentACK extension could be added in version 2.0 of the payment protocol that would allow wallets to ask how the transaction is going at a specific URL after a certain amount of time.</summary>
