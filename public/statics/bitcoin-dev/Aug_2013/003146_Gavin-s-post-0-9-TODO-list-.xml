    <summary>The context of the conversation is about a potential solution for phones that are plugged into power and on wifi for long periods of time. However, the issue with this solution is that phone IP addresses often change as the user moves onto different networks. Currently, peers can only keep track of a peer's IP address for anti-DoS authentication, as there is no roaming pseudo-identity cookie due to the separate goal of anonymity. It is unclear whether it would be possible to have both privacy protection and unique node identifiers for anti-DoS authentication at the same time. Peter Todd suggests a simple user interface for contributing bandwidth back to the network: "How much bandwidth will you contribute back? If you contribute more bandwidth back, other peers will prioritize you and your wallet will be more reliable."</summary>
