    <summary>In an email thread dated August 10, 2013, Mike Hearn mentioned that Chrome apps/extensions can establish raw TCP socket connections using the API introduced by Google in November 2012. He provided a link to the blog where this API is explained. The W3C has also proposed a Raw Sockets specification that includes TCP sockets. Firefox OS has an API under discussion that could be part of this standardization effort. This suggests that a standardized approach for establishing raw TCP socket connections may emerge in the future.</summary>
