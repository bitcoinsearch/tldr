    <summary>In an email conversation on August 9, 2013, Wendell expressed his excitement over a demo application called "wally". However, Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist of BitPay, clarified that the application is just a command line client to prove a technology. The main development is taking place in platforms like "node-libcoin" where a wallet platform is being developed. BitPay is committed to the blockchain engine side of bitcoind while also catering to the enterprise wallet needs which do not necessarily align with standard bitcoind wallet. The future use of bitcoin in large enterprises requires advanced features such as multi-sig, P2SH etc. Managers, CEOs, and other functionaries at corporations may have their own wallets/keyrings and cooperate to sign large value, high security bitcoin multi-sig transactions.</summary>
