    <summary>The author, Wendell, asks if it is possible to build an SPV wallet entirely in JavaScript and how it can be safely distributed. It is not clear what specific SPV wallet he is referring to, but he is seeking input from those knowledgeable about modern browser technology. He also suggests that a signed Chrome plugin could potentially serve as a secure distribution method. Wendell provides his contact information including his website grabhive.com, Twitter account @grabhive, and GPG key.</summary>
