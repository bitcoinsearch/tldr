    <summary>In August 2013, Bitcoin developers were discussing various improvements to the system. Gavin Andresen, one of the lead developers for Bitcoin, announced that they were close to a 0.9 "feature freeze" and the start of the release cycle. He listed several items he'd like to see included in the final 0.9 release, including a fix for the leveldb corruption issue, adding Payment Protocol support, headers first initial block download optimization, coin control, and autotools work. Andresen also discussed the importance of including payment protocol support in multiple clients simultaneously, with at least two clients and a big merchant signed up. Pieter, Matt, and Mike agreed on this and hoped to coordinate release dates for maximum impact.The implementation of payment protocol support was also being planned for Trezor, a hardware wallet, but it depended on the readiness of surrounding infrastructure. Multibit was believed to be the first wallet compatible with Trezor and supporting payment protocol. Supporting HD wallets was deemed the trickiest part of the process, but there were already core algorithms completed, and a basic HD wallet implementation could be done if necessary.There were also discussions about the inclusion of coin control in the Bitcoin model, with Wladimir expressing concerns about its introduction of statefulness into the wallet model. However, he acknowledged that many people wanted it and was fine with its inclusion as long as the issues were resolved. Pieter weighed in on the discussion, stating that the state issue had been resolved, and that coin control could be helpful in understanding the difference between the high-level abstraction of the wallet and the underlying implementation of individual coins.Pieter, Matt, and Gavin Andresen were discussing improvements to Bitcoin's sync time. Pieter shared that headers-first cut his sync time down to 45 minutes, which is a great improvement. They also agree that for maximum impact, payment protocol support should be shipped in at least two clients simultaneously, with a big merchant signed up. Jeff from BitPay wants to be a leader in support for the protocol. The goal is to coordinate release dates to make a big splash and grab the ecosystem's attention. In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and slush in 2013, the two discussed the possibility of adding payment protocol support to Trezor, a hardware wallet. Slush stated that supporting payment protocol would be important for absolute security of hardware wallets. Mike confirmed that this had always been the plan and asked if it would be a feature in the v1 firmware or added later via firmware update. The plan was to add support for payment protocol into the v1 firmware, but it depended on the readiness of the surrounding infrastructure, specifically if there would be support for payment protocol in Multibit at the time of v1 release.In another email conversation, Mike Hearn discussed the implementation of bitcoinj, and BitPay taking the lead to promote it. He mentioned that payment protocol support should be shipped in at least two clients simultaneously with a big merchant signed up for maximum impact. Someone volunteered to do it for bitcoinj, and if he doesn't pull through, Mike has some old code from EOY 2012 that he could update to the latest spec and ship basic support. They hope to get Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit updates out once bitcoinj has support. Jeff said that BitPay wants to be a leader in support for the protocol, so they plan to coordinate release dates to grab the ecosystem's attention.Overall, various ongoing discussions among developers related to different improvements and implementations within the Bitcoin ecosystem were taking place. These include improving sync time, adding Payment Protocol support, and enhancing hardware wallet security. Additionally, there is a focus on coordinating release dates and ensuring multiple clients and merchants support these features simultaneously for maximum impact. Gavin Andresen is leading the charge towards a 0.9 release and has outlined various features he'd like to see included. Meanwhile, BitPay is eager to take a leadership role in supporting the Payment Protocol.</summary>
