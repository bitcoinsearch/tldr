    <summary>The Bitcoin-development mailing list has been discussing a new payment protocol and alternate address serialization that could provide better security than relying on SSL/PKI infrastructure. The proposed format is binary_to_base58(idbyte + parentpubkey + multiplier + checksum), which could be used for certain services between wallet software and a business/exchange where the exchange would like to send addresses to the user for deposit without risk of MITM or even if their public server is compromised.Developers are implementing multi-chain ideas, which requires much work to support compared to the simple alternate encoding. BIP 32 already specifies how to use the first three tree levels: M/i/j/k, i~wallet, j~Internal/External, k~address. For generating new receive chains from a watch-only wallet, the options are to either keep a cache of PubKey/ChainCode for unused [m/i'] or simply increment 'j' past 1 for an existing [m/i'/j]. Two proposals were suggested for generating and receiving payments into BIP32-style addresses. Jeremy Spilman suggested a mechanism for generating address chains for long-term relationships by combining two ideas to get all the benefits by creating a data structure consisting of ParentPubKey, Addend, and ChainCode. This mechanism involves using the same ParentPubKey across multiple services, and each service gets its own 'j', with ParentPubKey + Addend giving the PubKey of [m/i'/j]. The receiver can then generate [m/i'/j/k] for monotonically increasing 'k' with the ChainCode. All transactions under [m/i'] can be presented in a single ledger or not, depending on the user perspective.If designing for persistent long-term relationships, a mechanism for generating address chains could be built in so that no further communication is needed after the initial exchange, without complicating the wallet.Finally, Alan Reiner has proposed an alternate address serialization in the payment protocol, which would preserve privacy but allow the sender to provide more information than currently contained in the 25-byte hash160 form. The alternate encoding preserves privacy and allows the sender to send a reliable payment address for deposit without risk of MITM or any compromise. It can be used between wallet software and an exchange where the exchange would like to reliably send addresses to the user for deposit. In a discussion about the payment protocol, Mike mentioned that bitcoin addresses are not used in the protocol. The payment protocol is built to be easily extensible and can include additional fields such as "publickey" and "multiplier" in the PaymentDetails or Output messages if the server needs to send them to the wallet software. Gavin Andresen provided this information in response to the discussion.Additionally, there was an interesting idea of using static public keys as a means for persistent identity and security from MitM attacks. The suggestion was to combine both ideas by making the data structure { ParentPubKey, Addend, ChainCode } where the ParentPubKey is a common value across multiple services, corresponding to the user's identity rooted in [m/i']. Each service gets their own 'j', and ParentPubKey + Addend gives you the PubKey of [m/i'/j]. With the ChainCode, the receiver can then generate [m/i'/j/k] for monotonically increasing 'k'. All transactions under [m/i'] can be presented in a single ledger or not, depending on the user perspective.</summary>
