    <summary>On August 16th, 2013, Gavin Andresen wrote an email to discuss the non-0.9 code he was working on. He listed three priorities at the top of his list: smarter fee handling on the client side, "first double-spend" relaying and alerting, and work on whitepapers regarding the 1MB block size limit and how it can be safely removed or increased. Gavin had spent his day generating scatter-plots and histograms to gain insight into what miner policies look like currently in relation to transaction fees versus priorities. The second priority was related to supporting low-value in-person transactions, such as buying a snack with Bitcoin.</summary>
