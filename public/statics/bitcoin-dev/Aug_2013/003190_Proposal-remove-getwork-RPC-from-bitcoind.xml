    <summary>The removal of getwork and old miners and packaging a better miner is considered the best solution. Freicoin plans to remove accounting features as they do not want to adapt them for demurrage and believe businesses should code their own accounting system instead. However, the first exchange to support freicoin (Cryptonit) used this feature for accounting user balances on the exchange. The question arises whether there is any good reason to maintain these features or if any serious business is using them at all. The plan is to remove certain rpc calls and modify others, which would result in a cleaner API. Jorge Timón wonders if this sounds crazy and if they should reconsider or proceed with their removal for Freicoin and create a pull request for Bitcoin.</summary>
