    <summary>The email thread discusses the need for anti-DoS measures in Bitcoin. Warren Togami suggests using source IP or subnet connection limits to make it more expensive for attackers to use a single host to exhaust a target node's resources. This measure would be easy to audit and improve the current situation where there are no limits. However, it does not eliminate the risk of a network-wide connection exhaustion attack by a determined attacker. Mike Hearn suggests automated heuristic driven prioritization as a better long-term solution to anti-DoS measures. Meanwhile, Gavin Andresen lists three non-0.9 codes he is working on, including smarter fee handling, "first double-spend" relaying and alerting, and whitepapers on increasing or removing the 1MB block size limit.</summary>
