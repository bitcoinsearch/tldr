    <summary>In August 2013, Gavin Andresen and Peter Todd exchanged emails discussing the importance of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) peers to the growth of Bitcoin. While Peter suggested deprioritizing SPV peers on account of their lack of contribution back to the network, Gavin argued that they are incredibly important and prioritizing their growth is essential for the healthy development of Bitcoin. Gavin acknowledged that serving SPV nodes should not come at the expense of maintaining consensus, primarily distributing new blocks around the network so the blockchain keeps moving forward.Gavin believes that Bitcoin will be just fine if there were never more than 10,000 big, beefy, full nodes forming the backbone of the network, but it will be nothing if tens of millions of lightweight SPV devices were not supported. However, Wendell and John Dillon support decentralization and criticize Gavin's target of 10,000 full nodes, believing it to be too few for a distributed system. John also criticizes Gavin's priorities, specifically the payment protocol's lack of options beyond SSL certified merchants and the absence of a safe way to get money into wallets.Recently, Peter Todd suggested that SPV peers should be served only with whatever resources a node has spare if they don't contribute back to the network. In contrast, the writer of this post conducted some tests with a variant of attack and discovered that it is easy to saturate a node's disk IO bandwidth, which makes the node fall behind in consensus and becomes useless to its peers. The writer suggests that SPV peers should be served only with whatever resources a node has spare and proposes a scoring function for node importance to prevent attacks.Overall, supporting SPV peers while ensuring the network maintains consensus and security seems to be essential for the healthy development of Bitcoin. Prioritizing the growth of SPV peers is significant, considering that Bitcoin will be nothing if tens of millions of lightweight SPV devices are not supported. Maintaining consensus and security without compromising SPV nodes should also be ensured by adopting basic measures to limit abuse, such as "sign up with your bitcointalk" account or "pay 10 cents for an account to discourage spammers".</summary>
