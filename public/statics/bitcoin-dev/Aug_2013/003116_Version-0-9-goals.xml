    <summary>Gavin Andresen, one of the lead developers for Bitcoin, has announced that they are close to a 0.9 "feature freeze" and the start of the release cycle. Andresen has listed several items he'd like to see included in the final 0.9 release, including a fix for the leveldb corruption issue, adding Payment Protocol support, the headers first initial block download optimization, coin control, and the autotools work. He also plans to spend half his time on code review and helping get pull requests tested, and the rest of his time working on code that probably won't make it into the 0.9 release.</summary>
