    <summary>During a conversation with Mike, Gavin Andresen listed the top three non-0.9 codes he is currently working on. The first code involves smarter fee handling on the client side, eliminating hard-coded fees. To gain insight into miner policies, scatter-plots and histograms of transaction fees versus priorities were generated. The second code focuses on "First double-spend" relaying and alerting in order to better support low-value in-person transactions. Additionally, there is a related article titled "Have a Snack, Pay with Bitcoins." Finally, Gavin aims to write 2-3 whitepapers on why we need to increase or remove the 1MB block size limit, how it can be safely done, and address common arguments against it.</summary>
