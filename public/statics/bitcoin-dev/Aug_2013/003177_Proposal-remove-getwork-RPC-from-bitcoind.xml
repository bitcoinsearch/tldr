    <summary>In an email dated August 19, 2013, Frank F strongly objected to the removal of the getwork protocol from Bitcoin. He argued that getwork was the only mechanism that allowed anyone to say that Bitcoin was truly peer-to-peer (p2p) and that removing it would favor pool operators and private mining interests, leading Bitcoin towards a monopoly/cartel model. Frank believed that denying individual novice miners the ability to mine at a small scale, even if it may be inefficient now, would not be a good path to start down.However, Luke pointed out that Frank had missed getblocktemplate, which does everything getwork did and more. He stated that individual solo miners were not being locked out at all and that the removal of getwork was simply the removal of an obsolete protocol that had been in use for over a year.</summary>
