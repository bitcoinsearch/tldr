    <summary>In an email conversation in August 2013, Gavin Andresen and Mike discussed the idea of a NODE_BLOOM service bit and persistent node-specific identifiers. Gavin opposed the idea of making various bits and pieces of the protocol optional as it would be bad for privacy and decentralization. He believed that every additional bit added could give an exponential number of combinations for the QA team to test. Fingerprinting nodes at this level is trivial due to IP addresses. However, they agreed that options were necessary for people to contribute to relaying and the health of the network, and that edge cases such as disabling bloom filtering would be tested anyway.</summary>
