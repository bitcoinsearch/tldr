    <summary>The master branch of Ripple has been put on an unofficial Ripple fork of LevelDB, rather than just updating to LevelDB 1.12.0. Although some disclosure was made regarding this, it is unclear whether the nature of this was fully understood by others. The pull request appeared to include changes beyond the ones already made and Ripple's fork did not do a proper git merge of upstream. A number of upstream fixes were not included in this merge. Three branches have been pushed for reference which include an old/unreleased LevelDB 1.5 fork and a LevelDB 1.7 fork, merged with upstream LevelDB 1.12. A diff from current master (Ripple LevelDB 1.12 fork) to bitcoin-up can be found via the link provided.</summary>
