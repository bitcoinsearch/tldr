    <summary>Bitcoin has released its 0.8.4 release candidate 2 as a maintenance release that contains very few changes from the 0.8.3 version. This update aims to fix a critical bug and three minor security issues. Users who have experienced database corruption on OSX are asked to try this release and report if it helps, while those with code that use the bloom-filtered block (merkleblock) protocol are requested to test it against this release and report any issues. The release candidate can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.4/test/. Additionally, two changes that require testing include the OSX FD_FULLSYNC leveldb corruption fix and Bloom filter optimization. It is worth noting that a critical last-minute bug was discovered in release candidate 1, which was never released. The developers encourage users to try this new release candidate and provide feedback regarding the improvements and any issues encountered.</summary>
