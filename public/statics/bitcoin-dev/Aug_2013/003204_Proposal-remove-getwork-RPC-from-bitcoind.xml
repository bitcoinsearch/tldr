    <summary>In an email exchange between Maciej Trebacz and Jeff Garzik on August 22, 2013, the former inquired if removing "getwork" from a client would affect the "setgenerate" RPC call. He was interested to know if it would still be possible to generate coins on testnet-in-a-box or if a dedicated miner would be needed for that purpose. Garzik replied that while his pull request did not affect setgenerate, there was a separate proposal being discussed that would remove the internal miner completely. Garzik is a senior software engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
