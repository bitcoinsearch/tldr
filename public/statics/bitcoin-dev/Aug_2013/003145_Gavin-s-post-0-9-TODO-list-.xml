    <summary>In this email conversation, Mike Hearn discusses user complaints about battery life and bandwidth impact with Bloom filtering. He suggests that using people's bandwidth for relaying blocks would not be feasible, especially since most Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes are behind NAT. The question is then raised about the situation with Universal Plug and Play (UPNP) on Android, as it seems to work well for the reference client. Peter Todd suggests a simple user interface for contributing back bandwidth, which could lead to better reliability for wallets. A digital signature is also included in the email.</summary>
