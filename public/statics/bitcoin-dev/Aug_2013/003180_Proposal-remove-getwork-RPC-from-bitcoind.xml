    <summary>In an email thread from 2013, a user named Frank F strongly objected to the removal of the getwork API in Bitcoin mining, claiming that it was the only mechanism allowing anyone to say that Bitcoin is peer-to-peer in the truest sense. He also argued that getting rid of this API would favor only pool operators and private mining interests, leading Bitcoin towards a monopoly/cartel model. Pieter Wuille responded by explaining that the getwork API had been replaced with a more decentralization-friendly successor API called getblocktemplate, which allows callers to see what transactions the daemon is trying to put into a block and modify them. Wuille clarified that the suggestion was not to remove functionality but rather to remove an obsolete API. The email thread concludes with a quote from Serj Tankian about the tyranny of money.</summary>
