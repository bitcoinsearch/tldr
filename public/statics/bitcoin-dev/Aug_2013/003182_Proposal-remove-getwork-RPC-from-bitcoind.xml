    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Frank F, the discussion was about the technical problems with getwork and its replacement, getblocktemplate. Maxwell suggested that they should remove getwork but also package along a proper getblocktemplate miner to ensure they are providing a full network node. He noted that the choice of miner is easy as only luke's bfgminer can mine directly against bitcoin getblocktemplate with no pool in the middle and supports a huge variety of hardware and a superset of their target platforms. The email ended with a quote from Serj Tankian about the tyranny of money.</summary>
