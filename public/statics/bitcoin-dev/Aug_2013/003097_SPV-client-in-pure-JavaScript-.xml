    <summary>Packaged app pages always load locally, providing independence from the network. Once installed, users have full control over the app's lifecycle and can quickly open, close or fully uninstall them. These apps are launched and maintained from within Chrome itself, making them more similar to native apps. Technical stuff could be made to work within the context of the limited API, thereby making it an interesting and user-friendly way to distribute Bitcoin wallets. Additionally, Chrome apps/extensions can make raw TCP socket connections. Packaged apps provide support for USB access which HTML5 may not support anytime soon.</summary>
