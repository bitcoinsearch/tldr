    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jeff Garzik asked whether it is possible to combine two bloom filters created by different wallets into a single filter. Pieter Wuille responded that, assuming both filters use the same seed and number of hash functions, combining them would result in a worse filter if they were already optimal for their given false positive rate. It is unclear from the thread why Garzik was interested in combining the bloom filters or what the specific use case was. The thread also includes a promotional message for AppDynamics Lite, a troubleshooting tool designed for Java and .NET code.</summary>
