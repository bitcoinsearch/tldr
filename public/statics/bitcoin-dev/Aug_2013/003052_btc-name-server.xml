    <summary>In this email thread from August 2, 2013, Chris Evans suggests the idea of having an alias to wallet id nameserver in client software where a person can use an English name to describe a wallet public key address, making it easier to remember and recall. Rick had previously suggested leveraging DNS for mapping names to numbers but expects no support. The email thread also includes a link to an article discussing how to put SQL databases under version control. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge.</summary>
