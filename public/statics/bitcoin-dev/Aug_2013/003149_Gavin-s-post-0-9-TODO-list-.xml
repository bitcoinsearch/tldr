    <summary>In an email thread between Mike Hearn and Peter Todd, the topic of UPNP protocol implementation on Android is discussed. Mike suggests that it could be implemented by a userspace library, but is not certain about its feasibility on Android. He also raises concerns about the potential workload for little gain and the fact that having millions of users supported by 100,000 nodes aligns with Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin. Peter challenges this appeal to authority and questions the definition of a peer and what would stop someone from pretending to be multiple peers. They discuss prioritization of peers based on signed timestamps, which would give priority to older peers and force attackers to wait. However, Peter asks what the plan would be for an attacker willing to wait.</summary>
