    <summary>In an email exchange between the developers of the hardware wallet, Trezor, and a user named slush, it was revealed that they plan to support payment protocol in their product. The feature is seen as a "missing piece in absolute security" for hardware wallets. The developers confirmed that implementing this feature has always been part of their plan. However, it is unclear how much work it will entail and whether it will be included in the initial release or added later through a firmware update.</summary>
