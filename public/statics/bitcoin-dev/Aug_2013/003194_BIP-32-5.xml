    <summary>In August 2013, Gregory Maxwell suggested the creation of a BIP32 addendum to make signing related recommendations. He also pointed out that there seemed to be another DSA duplicated K disaster occurring, specifically in relation to blockchain.info's mywallet. Maxwell had already discussed the issue with Pieter, who was positive about it, and was planning to create an actual BIP document for the recommendations.</summary>
