    <summary>Hive, a wallet app, is considering implementing an auto-updater for usability purposes. However, they are concerned about security and have been exploring options for a safe way to do this. Bitcoin-QT lacks such an updater due to security reasons, but it is unclear if this decision has been revisited. One idea being considered is to place a server behind a Tor hidden service that would output a checksum of the update package, which would theoretically be immune to tampering at the physical hosting level if well-secured. The author, Wendell, seeks thoughts or advice on this matter.</summary>
