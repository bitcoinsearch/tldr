    <summary>In an email dated August 19, 2013, John Dillon offers a bounty of 2.5BTC for the implementation of the first attack and 0.5BTC for the second one. The implementation of the attacks should be easy to do as a patch to satoshi bitcoin, and it must include a RFC3514 compliant service bit to let peers know of the operators' intentions. Additionally, Dillon donates 3BTC to adding service bit selection to DNS seeds. Peter Todd responds to this email requesting for a few weeks delay before implementing these bounties so that things can settle down.</summary>
