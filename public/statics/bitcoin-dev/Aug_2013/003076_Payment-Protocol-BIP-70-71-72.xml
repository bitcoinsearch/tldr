    <summary>In an email exchange from 2013, Gavin Andresen asked other wallet implementors if they had a notion of 'locked inputs'. The issue with constructing a transaction but not broadcasting it right away is that the inputs must be locked to avoid double-spending. Alan Reiner, the creator of Armory for offline wallets, has avoided any notion of locking inputs in his product because it is non-intuitive and difficult to explain. He has considered marking inputs to indicate to the user that the transaction they are creating may not be valid unless all previous transactions have been broadcasted. However, even if the user somewhat understands the concepts behind locking, there can still be a mess of some coins being locked and rejecting transaction creation randomly, especially when they create transactions that they later decide not to execute. Reiner suggests doing one transaction at a time or bundling payments into a single multi-output transaction to avoid invalid transactions that have to be re-created and signed. As more businesses started to use Armory, the issue of locked inputs will need to be addressed somehow.</summary>
