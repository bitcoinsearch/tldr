    <summary>The hashrate in the Bitcoin network is growing at such a rapid pace that soon, all desktop CPUs combined won't be able to make a significant impact on it. This is due to the retirement of the slow integrated CPU miner which couldn't keep up with the network's demands. However, for just $20, one can purchase a USB stick capable of reaching 500MH/s, which manufacturers could potentially ship with a built-in miner program.</summary>
