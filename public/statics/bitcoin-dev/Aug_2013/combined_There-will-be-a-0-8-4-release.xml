    <summary>The Bitcoin team has announced the release of a new version, 0.8.*, which will address both minor and major bugs. The release includes security-related improvements such as RPC password resistance to timing attacks, performance optimization for bloom filters to help mitigate potential DoS attack, as well as simplified storage of orphan transactions with CVE-2013-4627 fix. Additionally, bug fixes have been included such as fixing Gnome bitcoin URI handler, non-standard disconnected transactions causing mempool orphans, multi-block reorg transaction resurrection, and mempool consistency check. The new release is based on the 0.8.3 branch, and the team plans to cherry-pick from the master branch. While there are many little fixes that could be included in the new release, they will wait for the 0.9 release. The Bitcoin community can expect better security features and improved functionality with this new release.</summary>
