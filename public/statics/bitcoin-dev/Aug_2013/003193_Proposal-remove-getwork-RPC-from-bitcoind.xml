    <title>Proposal: remove "getwork" RPC from bitcoind</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange from 19th August, 2013, Warren suggested the idea of shipping a miner that automatically reads the Bitcoin.conf file to find RPC authentication information. This would be faster and more efficient than the unoptimized miner and simplify the bitcoind code. Andreas Schildbach had earlier warned that the internal miner will be removed in the next major version of Litecoin 0.8.x. Jeff Garzik responded by stating that the internal miner is still actively used for testnet. Pooler's CPU minerd supports both sha256d and scrypt recently grew stratum support, which could help in completely removing the internal miner and getwork. Andreas Schildbach expressed his concern that it would be a pity if the easy way to mine blocks would be removed.</summary>
