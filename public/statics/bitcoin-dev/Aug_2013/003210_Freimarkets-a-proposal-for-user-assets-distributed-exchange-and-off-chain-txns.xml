    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n and Mark Friedenbach have developed an extension of the Bitcoin and Ripple distributed protocols which enables user-specified bearer instruments, distributed peer-to-peer exchange, off-chain accounting, auctions, derivatives and transitive transactions, and the multitude of financial contracts having such primitives would make possible. They are now seeking public comments about this or related approaches from the community. The specification is available for viewing at http://freico.in/docs/freimarkets-v0.0.1.pdf. They have spent a fair chunk of time working out how to handle coordination of private accounting servers with the public chain and derivatives contracts, both of which are basically cryptographic protocols expressed as bitcoin scripts. Input from any of the resident cryptographers would be very appreciated.</summary>
