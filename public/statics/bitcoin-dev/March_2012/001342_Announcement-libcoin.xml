    <summary>The context begins with Thiago reporting an error while trying to build libcoin, a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The error message suggests missing libraries and provides suggestions for resolving the issue. Thiago then asks if libcoin project can be used as a chain agnostic tool. He proposes having a regular file/symlink where libcoincore will interpret ARGV[0], initiate the appropriate internal functions and then execute for each string when he installs it. Michael Grønager responds that the bug Thiago reported has been fixed and suggests doing a git pull. Martinx-James reports a new problem on /usr/local/bin/bitcoind getaccountaddress "" command and /usr/local/bin/bitcoind listaccounts, which returns an empty result. Michael explains that since 401 is a permission denied error, username and password need to be set up either in the bicoin.conf file or on the command line to access those commands. Thiago also mentions having trouble compiling libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04, and Michael advises him to upgrade the libboost-dev-all library to version 1.46.1. The email thread then shifts to a release announcement for libcoin, which includes details about its features such as being a drop-in replacement for the bitcoin client and having faster block chain downloads. The email also notes that libcoin is chain agnostic and can be used for research and educational purposes. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The license for libcoin is LGPL v. 3, allowing for use in both open source and commercial projects. Finally, the email includes contact information and links to the libcoin wiki, Twitter account, and download page.</summary>
