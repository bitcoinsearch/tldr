    <summary>In a discussion about the limitations of using HTTP and JSON-RPC as a client-server model, Gavin Andresen pointed out that it is not practical to expect clients to run their own JSON-RPC server since many cannot listen on WAN ports. However, he was corrected by another participant who cited section 2.1 of the JSON-RPC spec which shows that it is possible to use JSON-RPC over other transports besides HTTP. As a result, Andresen updated his draft to include long polling and remove assumptions of using HTTP for transport.</summary>
