    <summary>On March 6, 2012, a user named "slush" inquired about the status of support from Deepbit. The user was curious as to why Deepbit had not supported anything yet. In response, another user stated that nobody had discussed P2SH with Tycho recently, as the priority at the time was to get BIP 30 deployed first.</summary>
