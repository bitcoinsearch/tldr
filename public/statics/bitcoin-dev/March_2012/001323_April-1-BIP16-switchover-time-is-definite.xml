    <summary>In a recent communication, Gavin Andresen shared a link to a graph that shows support over the last 100 blocks. However, he later corrected the URL by providing the correct link to the pretty graph which can be found at http://blockchain.info/P2SH. It is unclear what the support referred to in the graph measures, but it is most likely related to the Bitcoin blockchain. The corrected link leads to a website that provides information on Bitcoins and allows users to explore the network's activity. Overall, the communication seems to be aimed at those interested in tracking the activity of the Bitcoin network, particularly as it relates to support for certain features or protocols.</summary>
