    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a developer has been writing apps that require real-time event notifications which cannot be provided by JSON-RPC API. He has been taking two approaches to solve this problem, one is writing his own library for dealing with raw bitcoin structures and connecting to bitcoin nodes via the bitcoin protocol and the other is making custom builds of the satoshi client putting callback hooks in key points. However, these approaches are not ideal as (1) involves a lot of code duplication and (2) involves patching the satoshi client source each time he grabs a later version and there is always a risk of something breaking. He proposes adding callback hooks to the main branch and is willing to help locate these key points, reorganize the code to place these methods in separate source files, define a callback mechanism, and contribute source code.</summary>
