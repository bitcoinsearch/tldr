    <summary>In an email conversation, Watson Ladd discusses the importance of a verifiable mix to avoid any potential misconduct by one of the mixers. If the final step fails, the mixes can be challenged to disclose half of their correspondences in order to identify any defectors. Ladd believes that it may even be possible to avoid the need for a fancy protocol and instead publish everything if the final stage fails, which would instantly and provably identify any cheaters. However, care must be taken to avoid fake-failures. Ladd also suggests using private keys and signatures as better proofs of knowledge than hashes in P2SH conversations. He notes that P2SH tends to be a superset of other schemes, allowing for a signature to prove access to a private key and control of a P2SH address. Ladd sees potential for constructing interactive proofs for knowing the preimages of hashes in Bitcoin.</summary>
