    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin developer, wrote to the Bitcoin-development mailing list proposing to add callback hooks to the main branch of the Satoshi client in order to improve apps that require real-time event notifications. Lombrozo had been using two approaches to accomplish this goal: writing his own library for dealing with raw bitcoin structures and making custom builds of the satoshi client. He found both approaches less than ideal due to issues such as code duplication and patching the satoshi client source. Lombrozo offered to help locate key points, reorganize the code, define a callback mechanism, and contribute source code if the proposal were accepted. He suggested that the callback hooks would be beneficial to many developers and would remove the need for them to use workarounds. Matt recommended checking out libcoin, a fork of the satoshi client.</summary>
