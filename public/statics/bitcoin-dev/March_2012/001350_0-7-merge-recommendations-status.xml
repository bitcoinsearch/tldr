    <summary>Luke-Jr suggested that there are enough changes waiting to start the RC process for 0.7, but the first merge will need rebasing. Hearn's "pong" message and Wladimir's Visual C++ 2010 fixes have already been acknowledged for 0.7. getmemorypool BIP standardization is also acknowledged, but it might be better to wait until later in the merge window. Joel has optimized the ToHex function and Scott has a pull request for Bitcoin-Qt to behave more like other close-to-systray applications by toggling the hide/show action. Coderrr has rebased his Coin Control features to the latest version and it should be merged soon. Pieter's IPv6 support is still unknown, but Luke-Jr thinks it will take extensive testing before it's ready for 0.7.</summary>
