    <summary>Pieter Wuille has proposed a patch for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 30 (BIP30), which has been tested and verified to make a potential attack impossible. The patch is backward compatible, meaning old clients can continue to function without risk if a supermajority of mining power implements it. However, after private discussion, Ben Reeves pointed out two potential small weaknesses in the proposed patch that seem viable to him. The first weakness is extremely hard to pull off, as it requires reverting a chain of at least 120 blocks long. Still, the fix is very easy, which is to allow EraseTxIndex to fail. The second weakness is related to the order of events. Pieter Wuille updated the patch, and will update the BIP soon.</summary>
