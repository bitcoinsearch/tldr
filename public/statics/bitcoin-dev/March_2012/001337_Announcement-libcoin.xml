    <summary>Ceptacle, a company founded by Michael Grønager, has announced the release of a cryptocurrency library called "libcoin" based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. Libcoin is chain-agnostic and all chain-specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain), making it easy to experiment with various chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client.In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for e.g. thin clients. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.The libcoin license is LGPL v.3., meaning that it can be used in both open-source and commercial projects, with improvements going back into the libcoin library. More people are always welcome to contribute to Libcoin. Michael Grønager, the creator of Libcoin, hopes to push Libcoin to Bitcoin in the future but intends to keep the two synced. Bip 16 is part of Libcoin, but the generation of P2SH has been postponed until after being certain of 16 vs 17.In response to a question about running multiple instances of bitcoind, Michael suggested using btcd, which keeps the blockchain but no wallet, along with btc, which keeps the wallet and contacts the btcd to get transaction information. Michael also fixed a bug reported by Martinx. Thiago had issues with listing default accounts, which required authentication. Michael recommended upgrading to boost 1.46.1 library to avoid conflicts with openssl 1.0.Aside from his work on Libcoin, Michael Grønager is the Director of Ceptacle. His contact information includes his name, title, address in Copenhagen, mobile number, email, and website, which is listed as http://www.ceptacle.com/.</summary>
