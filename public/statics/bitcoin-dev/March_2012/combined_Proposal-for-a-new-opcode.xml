    <summary>In an email conversation, Gregory Maxwell proposed a new protocol for purchasing equal amounts of Bitcoin without the exchange being able to link their future transactions. The protocol involves N parties who each put up the relevant amount of gold/whatever at the exchange and then the exchange provides its public key and the user provides a public key for signing. Each participant generates a new bitcoin address which is encrypted with the public keys of the exchange and all the mixers using an appropriate communicative homomorphic scheme.Watson Ladd also proposed a new opcode for anonymous transactions called OP_CHECKEXPSIG that enables scripts to be given proof that the receiver can carry out or has carried out a previous transaction. Using this opcode, scripts can pass the nth note value proof that the notes {1,...n-1} were turned in and are distinct. It couples the strong double spend protection of Bitcoin with traditional digital cash's strong anonymity. Preexisting digital cash techniques relied on keeping track of a list of turned in notes to forbid double spending.Ladd's protocol works differently from Maxwell's: it involves a mix that needs to be verifiable to avoid one of the mixers inserting their own key and removing a key that should be in there. There is a lot of online computation required, but it avoids the problem of de-anonymizing through having the protocol run incompletely. It also avoids all the problems with modifications to the bitcoin clients and miners. Ladd suggests private keys and signatures have better proofs of knowledge than hashes which could be used to make even better methods for enhancing anonymity.Ladd discusses the importance of a verifiable mix to avoid any potential misconduct by one of the mixers. If the final step fails, the mixes can be challenged to disclose half of their correspondences in order to identify any defectors. Ladd believes that it may even be possible to avoid the need for a fancy protocol and instead publish everything if the final stage fails, which would instantly and provably identify any cheaters. However, care must be taken to avoid fake-failures.On March 2, 2012, an individual named Michael Gronager expressed confusion about how OP_CHECKEXPSIG maintains protection against double spend. He requested clarification about any point he might have missed regarding this matter. Michael Gronager is the director of Ceptacle, located in Copenhagen, Denmark.</summary>
