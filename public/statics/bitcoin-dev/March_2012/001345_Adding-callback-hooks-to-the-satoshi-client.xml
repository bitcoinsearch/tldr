    <summary>Eric Lombrozo is interested in obtaining detailed information about message format errors that occur when nodes connect to bitcoind for debugging purposes. He wants to know if a transaction gets rejected due to an invalid signature, being out of range, or if the output couldn't be connected. Additionally, he wants to know if a transaction is claiming an output that has already been claimed by another transaction. To address this issue, Lombrozo has had to insert tracers and stubs into bitcoind. He would prefer to write an error log and inform the connecting node about what went wrong using callbacks, which could be configured in a similar way to the RPC in the bitcoin.conf file. Lombrozo notes that these messages should not be part of the Bitcoin protocol itself as it could lead to various attacks. Instead, he suggests having a separate channel for this type of data.</summary>
