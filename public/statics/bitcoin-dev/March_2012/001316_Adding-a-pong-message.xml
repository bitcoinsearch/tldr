    <summary>On March 13, 2012, Mike Hearn proposed a new "pong" message feature on Github's bitcoin repository. The goal of this feature is to allow clients to check if a connection is stale with ease and avoid talking to an overloaded remote node. The feature echoes back a 64-bit nonce contained in the ping if the protocol version is new enough. This feature would be particularly useful for mobile clients. However, one question was raised regarding why TCP keepalives couldn't be used instead of the new feature.</summary>
