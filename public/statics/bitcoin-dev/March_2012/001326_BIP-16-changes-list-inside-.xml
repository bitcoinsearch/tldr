    <summary>Amir Taaki reached out on March 18, 2012 to inquire about the accuracy of a summary regarding changes needed for P2SH and BIP 16. To assist with this, he suggested utilizing his 0.4.x backport found on GitHub. However, Amir cautionned that the backport would still need auditing since no one else has reviewed it yet. He believed that the backport could cover the minimal changes necessary for P2SH validation, but not the standard rule changes required to accept them into blocks.</summary>
