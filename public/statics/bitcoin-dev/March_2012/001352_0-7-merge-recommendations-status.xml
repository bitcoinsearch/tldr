    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, brought up the issue of nodes accidentally connecting to themselves in an email thread on March 31, 2012. He mentioned that with the switch to IPv6 and multiple local addresses, the chances of this happening become greater. There are also risks involved as it could potentially open up DoS or other vulnerabilities. However, Pieter later corrected himself and meant to refer to two nodes connecting twice to each other, for which there is already protection in place.</summary>
