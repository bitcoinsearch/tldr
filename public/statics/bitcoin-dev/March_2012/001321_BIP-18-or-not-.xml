    <summary>On March 14, 2012, Amir Taaki wrote an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list discussing BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). It was mentioned that luke-jr withdrew BIP 16 and supported BIP 17 which led to a consensus to move forward. However, luke-jr submitted BIP 18 which Amir Taaki reviewed and concluded that it might not be technically sound and may not serve any purpose as they were already adopting BIP 17. Amir Taaki further explained how BIPs are generally evaluated and accepted in the community. He stated that a draft BIP should be presented to bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net after which the proposal is discussed and evaluated based on certain minimum criteria. Amir Taaki also mentioned that some BIPs, including BIP 18, have not followed this process before being accepted.In conclusion, the discussion was focused on whether BIP 18 should be accepted into the repo or not and the importance of following the proper protocol for evaluating and accepting BIPs.</summary>
