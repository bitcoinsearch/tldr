    <summary>On March 6, 2012, Luke-Jr sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list sharing updates on BIP16 and BIP17. He reported that BIP16 had received 37% support and only 4% opposition, while BIP17 had received 4% support and 0% opposition. A user named slush replied to the email asking for a status update from Deepbit, and wondering why it still does not have support for anything. The email also included an advertisement for LearnDevNow, an online learning library for Microsoft developers.</summary>
