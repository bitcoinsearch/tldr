    <summary>Bitcoin is set to release version 0.6.0 on Wednesday pending any major issues that may arise. Release candidate 5 will be the official version, with users asked to help identify any last-minute problems. The new features from release candidate 4 include faster writing of blkindex.dat during initial blockchain downloads using modified bdb environment cache settings and a new policy for wallet.dat upgrades. Additionally, new wallets will have access to new features such as compressed public keys. A bugfix introduced in rc4 for an assertion failure during blockchain reorganizations has been addressed, along with new code for managing the addr.dat file. Users are encouraged to help test the new release to ensure a smooth rollout.</summary>
