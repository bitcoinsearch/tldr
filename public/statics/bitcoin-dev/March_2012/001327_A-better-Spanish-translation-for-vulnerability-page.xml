    <summary>A potential security flaw has been discovered in Bitcoin-Qt for Windows between versions 0.5 and 0.6, which could allow an attacker to hang the program or execute remote code if an unexpected closure occurs. As a result, users with those versions of Bitcoin-Qt are advised to update to version 0.5.3.1 or 0.6rc4 immediately. However, this flaw does not affect the Mac, Linux, or command line (bitcoind) versions of Bitcoin-Qt. The severity of this incident is deemed critical due to its potential for remote code execution. Users with any questions may visit the IRC channel #bitcoin-dev on Freenode. The updated software can be downloaded from SourceForge for both Windows and Linux versions.</summary>
