    <summary>On 3/3/2012, there was a discussion between Luke-Jr and Gavin Andresen regarding the use of JSON-RPC for server to client calls. Gavin mentioned that JSON-RPC and HTTP are client-server models which do not allow the server to make calls to the client, and it is not practical for clients to run their own JSON-RPC server. However, Luke-Jr updated the draft to include long polling and remove some assumptions of using HTTP for transport. He wasn't aware that anyone was considering JSON-RPC over anything other than HTTP. The context also contains a link to a page about virtualization and cloud management using capacity planning. It highlights how cloud computing uses virtualization to deliver computing as a service. Finally, the context provides information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list with a link to sign-up for it.</summary>
