    <summary>A proposal on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal draft called "getmemorypool" has been submitted by Luke-Jr. He requested a review and comments regarding the proposal which he is looking forward to implementing in his pool backend and miner. The proposal contains some comments made by Geir Harald Hansen who suggests specifying the term "transactions" mentioned in the first table of the JSON-RPC response object as adding or removing transactions and not mutations as it could be misleading. Furthermore, Hansen suggests adding another entry called "longpollid" in long poll responses that enables the server to see if the client has missed any block changes. Additionally, Hansen suggests including "height" in the getmemorypool response so the miner can include the correct height in the coinbase. Lastly, Hansen suggested making some things optional for a client to implement like "noncerange," which he believes is of limited use and has a good chance of getting the endianness wrong.</summary>
