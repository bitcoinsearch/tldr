    <summary>In the context provided, it has been reported that TCP keep-alives are not always implemented reliably. This has led to difficulties in keeping connections to the network especially on mobile devices when roaming into areas with poor connectivity. Although the network stack does not entirely drop access, it is important to quickly check if the connection is really there with some kind of bounded, app layer deadline. The implementation of some kind of bounded, app layer deadline for checking connections would be useful as it is cheap and would help in cases where the network stack does not entirely drop access. This will enable quick checks of the connection's reliability.</summary>
