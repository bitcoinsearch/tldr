    <summary>A potential security flaw has been discovered in Bitcoin-Qt for Windows versions between 0.5 and 0.6. Users are advised to exit the program and update to version 0.5.3.1 or 0.6rc4 immediately. However, the command-line application (bitcoind), Mac and Linux versions of Bitcoin-Qt, and versions prior to 0.5 are not affected. The nature of the flaw makes it difficult for an attacker to do anything more than block the process of Bitcoin-Qt, but due to the possibility of unexpected closure allowing remote code execution, it is considered a critical incident. The updated software can be downloaded from SourceForge: 0.6rc or 0.5.3.1 for Windows and 0.5.3 for Linux. For further questions, users can visit the IRC channel #bitcoin-dev on Freenode.</summary>
