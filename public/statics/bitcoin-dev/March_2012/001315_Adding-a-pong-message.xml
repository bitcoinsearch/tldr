    <summary>A recent pull request on Github for Bitcoin introduces a new "pong" message that will echo back a 64-bit nonce from the initial ping. This change is aimed at improving the connectivity of clients, particularly mobile clients, to check if a connection is stale or if a remote node is overloaded. By doing so, users can avoid talking to nodes that are busy with other tasks such as downloading the blockchain. The purpose of implementing this feature is to make it easier for clients to operate on the network. If there are any concerns or objections about this update, they have not been specified.</summary>
