    <summary>The BIP16 switchover time of April 1 has been announced as final, with approximately 70% of hashing power supporting it for the last two days and 54% over the last week. Pools and miners that haven't upgraded their software are encouraged to do so in the next two weeks to avoid hashing on a minority chain. Support will continue to be monitored to ensure no slipping before April 1. Gavin Andresen is drafting a document that suggests how to make the next upgrade process less painful. He also shared data showing support over the last 30 days using search_coinbases.py command and bitcointools. A graph of support over the last 100 blocks can be found at github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/.</summary>
