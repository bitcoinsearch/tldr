    <summary>Luke-Jr has compiled a list of updates for bitcoin in preparation for the 0.7 release candidate, including multithreaded JSON-RPC with keep-alive support, optimized ToHex function, FastGetWork, getalltransactions and getblock_full. He also calls for better encapsulation of wallet and blockchain data structures to allow for safe multithreaded RPC. Additionally, Pieter's IPv6 support is near completion, but there are still some issues to address such as how relaying will work and potential risks for DoS or other vulnerabilities. Supporting IPv6 would allow Bitcoin to function as a Tor or I2P hidden service.</summary>
