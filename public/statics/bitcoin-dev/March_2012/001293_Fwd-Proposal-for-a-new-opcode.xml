    <title>Fwd: Proposal for a new opcode</title>

    <summary>In a proposal to the Bitcoin community, Watson Ladd has suggested a new opcode, OP_CHECKEXPSIG, for anonymous transactions. This opcode allows scripts to be given proof that the receiver can carry out or has carried out a previous transaction, providing strong double spend protection and anonymity. While preexisting digital cash techniques required keeping track of a list of turned in notes to prevent double spending, the use of this new opcode would allow for passing the script that gives the nth note value proof that the notes {1,...n-1} were turned in and are distinct. Ladd is currently working on a paper discussing the use of this opcode for anonymous transactions.</summary>
