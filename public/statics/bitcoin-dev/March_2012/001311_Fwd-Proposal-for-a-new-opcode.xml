    <summary>In March 2012, Watson Ladd proposed a new opcode for anonymous transactions. The opcode would enable scripts to prove that the receiver has carried out a previous transaction. Ladd was working on a paper about using this opcode for anonymous transactions. The purpose of the opcode is to validate an opaque signature and allow for anonymity in transactions.However, one person questioned how the opcode would enable anonymous transactions. They pointed out that it seemed isomorphic to a hash locked transaction from the perspective of the blockchain. This equivalence is more obvious when considering how Lamport signatures turn simple hashing into a one-time signature.Overall, Ladd's proposal aimed to enhance anonymity in transactions through the use of a new opcode. Despite some confusion about its implementation, the idea behind the opcode showed promise for improving the security and privacy of transactions.</summary>
