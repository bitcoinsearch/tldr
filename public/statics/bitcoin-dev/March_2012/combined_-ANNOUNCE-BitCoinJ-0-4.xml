    <summary>The BitCoinJ 0.4, a leading Java implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, has been released. This library implements simplified payment verification, a lightweight mode in which no central server or authority is required, making it usable on smartphones. The new version includes several features such as the ability to use "getheaders" to quickly catch up new users to the head of the chain and ECKeys that no longer require the private part, allowing for "watching wallets." A new API is added that implements transaction confidences giving detailed information about how much confidence one can have that a given transaction won't be reversed. Additionally, a new DerbyBlockStore that stores block headers and related data in the Apache Derby relational database is included, and Protocol buffers are now a supported serialization format for the wallet.Various new event listeners are added that help learn when the state of the wallet or transactions change. Support for post February 20th version handshakes, new APIs that allow offline transactions and pending relevant transactions are recorded and announced to all newly connected nodes. Wallet now can now take an invalid transaction and complete it by adding sufficient inputs and a change output, enabling the creation of multi-sends, as well as making experimentation with contracts easier. Support for BIP 14, updated DNS seeds list, a new WalletTool program for command line usage, and a ToyWallet app showing how to set everything up is also included. In the next release cycle, the focus will be on real support for transaction fee calculations, a better block chain API, having the library manage save points for the wallet itself, further chain download time optimizations, and more support for moving apps onto "work done" as a confidence measurement.</summary>
