    <summary>The BIP16 switchover time of April 1 has been announced as final, with approximately 70% of hashing power supporting it for the last two days and 54% over the last week. Pools and miners who haven't upgraded their software are encouraged to do so in the next two weeks to avoid hashing on a minority chain. Gavin Andresen is drafting a document that suggests how to make the next upgrade process less painful. He also shared data showing support over the last 30 days using search_coinbases.py command and bitcointools. A graph of support over the last 100 blocks can be found at github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/.In a recent communication, Gavin Andresen shared an incorrect link to a graph that shows support over the last 100 blocks, which he later corrected. The correct link is http://blockchain.info/P2SH. It is unclear what the support referred to in the graph measures, but it is most likely related to the Bitcoin blockchain. The corrected link leads to a website that provides information on Bitcoins and allows users to explore the network's activity.Overall, the communication seems to be aimed at those interested in tracking the activity of the Bitcoin network, particularly as it relates to support for certain features or protocols. Support for the BIP16 switchover will continue to be monitored to ensure no slipping before April 1, and pools and miners who haven't upgraded their software are encouraged to do so in the next two weeks to avoid hashing on a minority chain. Gavin Andresen's document aims to suggest ways to make the next upgrade process less painful.</summary>
