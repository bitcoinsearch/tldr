    <summary>Pieter Wuille has written a post in BIP30 about a security update for Bitcoin's reference client. He has created patches for git master, v0.4.0, v0.3.24, v0.3.24+vinced and v0.3.19. After receiving responses from Deepbit, bitcoin.cz (slush), MtRed, Bitlc and BTCmine, the security update is set to be deployed on March 15, 2012. The change is backward compatible similar to BIP16, where old clients can continue functioning without risk if a supermajority of mining power implements it. Pieter has asked pool operators to upgrade and confirm when they have done so. Miners or pool operators who have the ability to upgrade are also urged to do so.</summary>
