    <title>Urgent: Windows Bitcoin-Qt update</title>

    <summary>A security vulnerability has been detected in the Windows version of Bitcoin-Qt. Users running versions 0.5 through 0.6 on Windows are advised to shut down and upgrade to either version 0.5.3.1 or 0.6rc4 immediately. It is important to note that the command-line bitcoin daemon (bitcoind), Mac and Linux versions of Bitcoin-Qt, and versions prior to 0.5 are not affected by this vulnerability. Although it is believed that an attacker would find it challenging to do anything more than crash the Bitcoin-Qt process due to the nature of the vulnerability, it is still considered a critical issue since there is a chance that a remote code execution could occur from such a crash. Binaries of the updated versions are available for download at SourceForge. In case of any queries, users can visit the #bitcoin-dev channel on FreeNode IRC. The message is signed off by Gavin Andresen, Gregory Maxwell, Matt Corallo, Nils Schneider, and Wladimir J. van der Laan.</summary>
