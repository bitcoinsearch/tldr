    <summary>In an email conversation between Tom Zander and Jonathan Toomim, Tom shared a Linux command for measuring memory usage more accurately. He advised Jonathan to be careful while measuring memory usage on Linux as tools like top can provide misleading information. The command used by Tom was 'grep VmRSS /proc/$pid/status', and he compared it with Jonathan's method, which was 'cat /proc/$1/smaps | grep Pss | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's#^#+#' ) | bc'. Tom's method provided the Virtual Resident Set Size (VmRSS) in kB, while Jonathan's method gave the Proportional Set Size (PSS). Both methods had slightly different memory usage values. Tom's advice was to use his method to measure memory usage correctly on Linux.</summary>
