    <summary>Byron Gibson, a software developer, is seeking information about the use of simulators like Shadow and BTCSim to test proposed changes to Bitcoin. He posted his query on an online forum, asking for insight into their capabilities and limitations. The two simulators he mentioned, Shadow and BTCSim, are free and open-source software tools used to simulate and test blockchain protocols.Shadow is designed to simulate large-scale networks of nodes, making it ideal for testing the scalability of blockchain protocols. Meanwhile, BTCSim is built to test the behavior of Bitcoin nodes in different scenarios, such as network partitions and malicious attacks. Both simulators can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and bugs in proposed changes to the Bitcoin protocol before they are implemented on the actual network.Byron provided links to his personal website and Keybase profile, indicating that he is actively involved in software development and may be working on a project related to Bitcoin. However, the purpose of his inquiry was not explicitly stated. Nonetheless, it is clear that he is interested in using simulators to test proposed changes to the Bitcoin protocol and wants to learn more about their capabilities and limitations.</summary>
