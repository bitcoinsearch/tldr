    <summary>The issue of bitcoind process getting killed every few days on a server when it reaches around 55gb of usage has been raised in a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Jonathan Toomim claimed that he had this memory usage issue on Linux, but not on Mac OS X, under a GBT workload in both situations. Tom Zander responded to this by suggesting to measure the memory usage correctly on Linux since it is easy to get misleading information from tools like top. He provided a script to check memory usage and stated that poor memory allocation may cause fragmentation issues.</summary>
