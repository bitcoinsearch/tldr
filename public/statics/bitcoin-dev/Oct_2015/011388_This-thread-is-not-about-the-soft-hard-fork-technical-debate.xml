    <summary>The context of the message is a clarification from a developer named Mike Hearn, who has only one objection to CLTV deployment that it should be a hard fork. He has been answering all the various reasons being brought up why he is wrong and soft forks are awesome. Mike states that many developers other than him have noted that hard forks are cleaner and have other desirable properties. As controversial changes to the consensus rules must not happen, it's clear that CLTV cannot happen in its current form. However, Mike expects the Core maintainers to ignore this controversy and do CLTV as a soft fork anyway. He hopes he is wrong but if he is not, then everyone will see what Gavin and he have been talking about for so many months. Finally, Mike proposes that the opcode is tweaked, as there are real financial risks to a soft fork.</summary>
