    <summary>The conversation started on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the copyright notice on the code. One of the contributors stated that the copyright notice refers to the fact that each contributor owns the copyright to his own contributions, but there is no legal group that owns the copyright to the entirety of the code. Another contributor disagreed and mentioned that the legal owner's name or author's name with all the copyright rights should be mentioned in the copyright notice. The correctness of the copyright notice was discussed using references from Nolo and USPTO. It was concluded that the copyright notice is merely informative to humans reading them, and it is not development related. Therefore, any further discussion on this topic should be directed to Luke directly.</summary>
