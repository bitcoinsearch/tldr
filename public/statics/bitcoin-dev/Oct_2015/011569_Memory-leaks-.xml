    <summary>The discussion is about the issue of high memory usage by Bitcoin Core nodes. One user reported an excess memory usage on the order of 100x higher than the mempool "bytes" value, which is unlikely to be normal behavior. Another user reported 35 GB of RSS usage. The issue appears to be related to CreateNewBlock() and getblocktemplate. One user suggested mitigating mempool growth by setting "-mintxfee". Valgrind did not show anything super promising. The users will continue testing and recording results to find a solution. The thread caused some cross-post confusion and consequent flamewar fallout.</summary>
