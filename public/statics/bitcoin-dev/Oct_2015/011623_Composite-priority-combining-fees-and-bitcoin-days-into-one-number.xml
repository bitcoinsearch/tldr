    <summary>On October 28, 2015, Jonathan Toomim expressed his opinion on assigning block space based on bitcoin-days destroyed (BDD) and fees. He found the approach awkward and believed it would make code harder to write, maintain, and execute due to the need for two code paths in procedures dealing with a constrained resource such as mempool and CNB. He emphasized the importance of easy modification and customization of node policy in a flexible manner. Simplifying other code at the expense of making policies harder to configure is not a welcome change. Therefore, it is better to leave the main code less simple if custom policies such as the current default become harder. Luke concluded that this issue falls under the realm of node policy.</summary>
