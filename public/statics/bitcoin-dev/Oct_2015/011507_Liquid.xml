    <summary>On October 13th, 2015, Benjamin sent an email to a group inquiring about an announcement made by Blockstream. Blockstream had announced that it will implement sidechains for Bitcoin exchanges [1], [2]. Benjamin expressed confusion over the announcement and asked several questions regarding its implications. He questioned how Bitcoin was related to existing financial institutions and what was meant by "rapid transfer" and "settlement". Additionally, he questioned how Bitcoin was connected to "market liquidity" and "capital requirements". Furthermore, he asked whether Blockstream has commercial products now and posed several questions regarding the partners that were mentioned in the announcement.</summary>
