    <summary>On a Bitcoin developer mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner criticized those who discussed the technicalities of a soft/hard fork. He explained that the discussion was not about technical arguments, but rather Mike Hearn's intention to critique the informal governance model of Bitcoin Core development. Lerner believed that Hearn had strategically pushed the discussion into a dead-end where the group either ignores him or responds to his objections one after another, causing the project to standstill. Lerner thought that having a more formal decision-making process would not be too bad for Bitcoin and could actually be good. However, Luke-Jr pointed out that this discussion is necessarily about soft/hard fork technicalities since there is no governance in Bitcoin beyond the nature of the consensus protocol.</summary>
