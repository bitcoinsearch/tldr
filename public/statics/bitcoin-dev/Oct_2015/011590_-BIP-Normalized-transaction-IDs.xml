    <summary>In an email exchange on October 21, 2015, Danny Thorpe proposed to keep canonical ordering separate from the normalized transaction ID proposal. He suggested that normalized transaction IDs would provide immediate benefits against third-party manipulation of transactions in the mempool without needing canonical ordering. However, Luke argued that third-party manipulation is not much more of a problem than signing-party manipulation and solving the former without solving the latter would not be worth the high cost.</summary>
