    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of multi-GB memory usage in Bitcoin nodes while running getblocktemplate and getinfo. The excessive memory usage is suspected to be related to CreateNewBlock() and getblocktemplate, rather than mempool behavior. Testing with PR #6410's better mempool reporting showed that the actual in-memory usage by CTxMemPool is about 2.5x to 3x higher than the serialized transaction sizes. Another user reported 35 GB of RSS usage. To mitigate the mempool growth, the -mintxfee flag can be set. However, the issue persists even with high min fees and a small mempool size. The email author plans to conduct more testing and provide updates on the issue. Valgrind did not reveal any promising results, but the author plans to run it for longer durations and test with getblocktemplate while valgrind is running.</summary>
