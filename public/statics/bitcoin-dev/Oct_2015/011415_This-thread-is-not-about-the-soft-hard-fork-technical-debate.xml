    <summary>In an email exchange on October 5, 2015, Tom Zander responded to a contributor's concern about the readability of opinions. He stated that while they value opinions, actions should be examined as well, referring to the group's adherence to the consensus rule. The other contributor then asked for clarification on which consensus rule he was referring to. Tom suggested looking at Bitcoin Core's changes to see how contributors have followed the consensus rule rigorously and noted that there were no regulator contributors who disagreed with the changes. He also mentioned that there have been changes made in the past that affected system consensus but were not hard-forks. Tom argued that these differences begin with technological fundamentals and that the standard for hard-forks is different.</summary>
