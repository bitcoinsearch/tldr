    <summary>On October 1, 2015, Marcel Jamin questioned why bitcoin is still being used in production. While he acknowledged that it is safe to say that it is being used, he believes it is not yet ready for production. He listed his expectations for the upcoming 1.0 release including an API that makes implementing a full node practical, a reasonably usable Bitcoin Core GUI for non-technical people, and a reasonably safe wallet through the Bitcoin Core Daemon. The backup-resistant accounting system currently blocks this last feature. Luke also contributed to the discussion.</summary>
