    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer forum, Lucas Betschart shared that Facebook has a fork of LevelDB called RocksDB which is maintained and uses an API similar to LevelDB. This could potentially be used as a replacement for LevelDB in Bitcoin. However, it is noted that RocksDB was optimized for big databases running on multiple cores and may not work as well on spinning disks. It is also mentioned that RocksDB is optimized for flash. Links to RocksDB's website and Github page were provided for reference.</summary>
