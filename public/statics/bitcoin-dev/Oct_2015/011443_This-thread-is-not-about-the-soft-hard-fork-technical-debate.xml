    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Milly Bitcoin called out another user for being a "concern troll and bully." The accused user responded by calling for more professional language in the discussion and suggesting using the term "cultist" instead of "troll." Another user replied to the message, preferring to use the term "clown" and requesting that the conversation moves forward. The email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation.</summary>
