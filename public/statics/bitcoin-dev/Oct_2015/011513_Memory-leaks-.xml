    <summary>In an email thread dated October 13, 2015, a user named odinn reported excessive memory consumption on three machines that run Debian. The machines run p2pool and bitcoind, with two running XT and one running Core. When asked to compare the issue to having set up a node on a completely clean computer, odinn responded that he could not afford to do so and did not see how other processes running on the same machine were relevant unless RPC calls (e.g., getblocktemplate) might be responsible. Odinn also requested that users report their mempool size and total bitcoind resident set size for their running full nodes.</summary>
