    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Daniele Pinna asked if an algorithm could be created to protect against ASIC/FPGA optimization. However, it was pointed out that this is impossible as anything that can be done with software can also be done with hardware. BIP99 suggests "anti-miner hardforks" in order to prevent mining centralization, but not for the sake of promoting so-called "ASIC-resistance" altcoins.</summary>
