    <summary>In a post dated October 22, 2015, Peter Todd announced that multi-push OP_RETURN outputs would become standard in version 0.12.0 of Bitcoin. He also expressed his desire to define a version 2 payment code that uses an improved notification system once the prerequisites for it are available on the network. In the meantime, each mined block showed consistent 70% address reuse, and reducing this number was deemed desirable. Even if version 1 payment codes could only reduce this number from 70% to 30%, they would still be worth using while waiting for version 2. The post included two non-text attachments related to digital signatures.</summary>
