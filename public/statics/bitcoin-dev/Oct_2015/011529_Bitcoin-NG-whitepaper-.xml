    <summary>A new technique called Bitcoin-NG has been released to address scalability challenges in Bitcoin. This technique can increase throughput while reducing latency without impacting Bitcoin's open architecture or changing its trust model. The whitepaper provides details of the technique, which is compatible with both Bitcoin and Blockstream-like sidechains. The creators of Bitcoin-NG do not plan to compete commercially with either technology, as they see it as complementary. They hope their work will advance the state of blockchains and inspire even better solutions. Feedback is welcome from the community. One comment notes that a miner could choose the key block time in order to generate about 400 miniblocks instead of the average 60 blocks, which should be taken into account.</summary>
