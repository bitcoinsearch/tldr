    <summary>A recent paper proposing an asymmetric memory-hard PoW has been published, which may potentially alter the bitcoin PoW protocol should an algorithm that guarantees protection from ASIC/FPGA optimization be found. The author is interested in the dev-list's stance on this matter and acknowledges that this would represent a very contentious hard fork due to the large amount of money invested by some miners into their industrial farms. However, a novel optimization-resistant algorithm could greatly ameliorate decentralization in the bitcoin network due to a resurgence of desktop/cellphone mining. The author seeks to know where the core devs stand on this hypothetical matter.</summary>
