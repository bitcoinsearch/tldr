    <summary>The author of the message is concerned that someone will always call "off topic" regardless of how on-topic something actually is since there is no objective measure of on-topicness here. The proposed list moderation policy and conduct document aims to facilitate constructive discussion of issues related to technical development of the bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation, which means on-topic conversations would necessarily be related to technical development. However, the author thinks that the current language in the proposed list moderation policy and conduct document needs much more discussion and refinement. The author argues that it would be a shame if every time someone brings up something innovative, new or wonderful, or explores something on the boundaries, they are shouted down with cries of "Off Topic!".Regarding the subject of disclosure, the author suggests people disclose potential conflicts. Participants expect to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and disclose those interests to other project members. However, the author notes that those who work for three-letter agencies or have simply signed NDAs will not disclose anything, but will be here anyway, pushing their personal interests.Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev suggested that only development help is appropriate for the list since some conversations may not be suitable for the list, and off-topic threads will be directed to other venues. Moreover, entirely new threads should be new messages, not merely a reply with a changed topic. Although discussing conduct on-list, either as part of another message or as a standalone thread, is always acceptable, Luke expresses his concern about its noise.</summary>
