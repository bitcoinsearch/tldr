    <summary>On October 5, 2015, Mike Hearn proposed a new flag for Core called --scriptchecks=[all,standardonly,none], which would prioritize correctness by default and allow nodes to opt into pseudo-SPV behavior of a soft fork if desired. Hard forks, when done right, produce a much cleaner system for users and have been argued to be simpler and conceptually cleaner than soft forks. The counter-argument that hard forks require everyone to upgrade and soft forks don't is misguided as those who can't or won't upgrade their full node but can no longer verify the change can simply restart with -scriptchecks=standardonly and get the soft fork behavior or upgrade and get their old security level back. Similarly, the idea that hard forks are bad or immoral because they can lead to "schisms" is not a reason to avoid holding votes as individuals can refuse to accept changes with soft forks too.</summary>
