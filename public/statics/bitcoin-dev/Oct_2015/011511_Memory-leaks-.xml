    <title>Memory leaks?</title>

    <summary>The author noticed that several running bitcoind processes were using over 3 GB of RAM, even though the mempool was under control. The mempool size was only 37 MB, which is quite unusual as normally memory usage is around 600 MB when there aren't a lot of unconfirmed transactions floating around the network. After restarting the process and letting it run for a few minutes, the mempool size decreased to 0.67 MB and RAM usage to 317 MB, which is much more reasonable. Another node running longer had a mempool size of 39 MB and total memory usage of 3540 MB before restarting. After restarting, the mempool size decreased to 39 and total memory usage decreased to 247 MB. The author asks if anyone has any guesses about where the memory leak might be or what is using the additional 2.4 GB. The issue appears to happen with both Bitcoin Core 0.10.1 and Bitcoin XT 0.11B, and the author wonders if there's a leak in the minrelaytxfee code path.</summary>
