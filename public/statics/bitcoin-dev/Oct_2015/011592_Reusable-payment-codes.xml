    <summary>On April 24, 2015, Justus Ranvier shared an RFC link for a new type of Bitcoin address called a "payment code". However, Luke expressed concern about the "notification address" requirement that entails address reuse and blockchain spam. He explained that this requirement forces the recipient to either leave the addresses unspent forever or spend them, potentially compromising the private key and the entire wallet. Instead, Luke suggested using a single zero-value OP_RETURN output with two pushes: a hash of the recipient's payment code and the encrypted payment code. This method can be searched with standard bloom filters or indexed with other optimized algorithms, while never using any space in the UTXO set and eliminating the need to spend/mix/dust the address.</summary>
