    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Jorge Timón responded to Daniele Pinna's question about an algorithm that could protect against ASIC/FPGA optimization. Timón stated that it is impossible to guarantee protection from hardware optimization because anything that can be done with software can be done with hardware. He encouraged the authors of a manuscript titled "Asymmetric proof-of-work based on the Generalized Birthday problem", Alex and Dmitry, to submit their paper to Ledger for review. Although some may question the usefulness of memory hardness in regards to cryptocurrency, analyzing memory-hard proof-of-work schemes can aid in determining its value.</summary>
