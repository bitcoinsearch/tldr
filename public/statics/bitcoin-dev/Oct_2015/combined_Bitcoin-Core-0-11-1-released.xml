    <summary>Bitcoin Core has released version 0.11.1, which contains security fixes and requires users to upgrade as soon as possible. The update includes a fix for buffer overflow in bundled upnp, updating miniupnpc to version 1.9.20151008, which fixes a buffer overflow in the XML parser during initial network discovery. Upnp has been disabled by default, which may result in a lower number of reachable nodes on IPv4; however, this prevents future libupnpc vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network.The node now requires the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when relaying or mining, which removes a nuisance malleability vector. Additionally, the default for the `-minrelaytxfee` setting has been increased from `0.00001` to `0.00005`. This change was necessitated by the current transaction flooding, causing outrageous memory usage on nodes due to the mempool ballooning. It is important to note that this increase is only temporary and will bridge the time until a dynamic method for determining this fee is merged. Overall, Bitcoin Core's version 0.11.1 provides important security fixes and enhancements, and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible to ensure the safety and efficiency of their transactions.</summary>
