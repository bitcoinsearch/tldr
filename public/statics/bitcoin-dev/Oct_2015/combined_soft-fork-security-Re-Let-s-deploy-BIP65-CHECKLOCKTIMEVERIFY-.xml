    <summary>On October 7, 2015, a discussion occurred on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list about the possibility of an attack on the new version of Bitcoin even with a 99% hashpower supermajority. Eric Lombrozo suggested that attackers could perform this attack once per day by waiting for a non-upgraded miner to win a block. However, Jonathan Toomim of Toomim Bros argued that this wasn't a new or strong issue to worry about. Toomim explained that in Bitcoin's game theory, there are three types of miners: honest (following protocol), agnostic/lazy (just run software, upgrade when they lose money and/or get shouted at), and dishonest. Honest miners are bolstered by financial incentives to remain honest, such as subsidies and fees. Toomim stated that Bitcoin remains secure with various combinations of percentages of these types of miners. However, he cautioned against assuming anything, as it can lead to trouble.</summary>
