    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal was made to implement dual modes in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 65. Some users support BIP 65, while others do not. The proposal suggests that both versions can run alongside each other and users can switch back and forth between them. However, additional constraints on transaction validation will be imposed to ensure that transactions made in a specific way will always look valid to non-CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) users but will require CLTV rules to be followed by CLTV users. The concern is that non-CLTV users might receive invalid payments, but this is not considered a problem since their software is already set up to request payments in a non-CLTV way. SPV clients can choose to only connect to nodes which are non-CLTV. The discussion turned tense when some users resorted to name-calling, with one user calling another a "concern troll" and a "bully". Another user suggested using the term "cultist" instead of "troll" to appear more professional. Finally, the proposal to implement dual modes was presented as a solution to the debate, and the mailing list ended on a harmonious note.</summary>
