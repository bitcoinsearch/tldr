    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev community, Will White, wrote to inquire about creating a website that would enable his bitcoin wallet program to donate to multiple addresses simultaneously. He was looking for a way to send his wallet a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) containing all the necessary information rather than having to include a URL and then have the wallet locate the information. A response from another member suggested using BIP70 payment requests, which allow users to specify multiple scripts or addresses to pay to along with the corresponding amounts. These requests can be transmitted via various methods such as NFC, Bluetooth, HTTP(S), and Mail. For more information on payment requests, visit https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/wiki/Payment-Requests.</summary>
