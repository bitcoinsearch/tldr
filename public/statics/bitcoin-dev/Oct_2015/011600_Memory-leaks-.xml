    <summary>In this discussion, the issue of bitcoind process getting killed after reaching around 55gb usage on a server was raised. Multipool Admin suggested adding a cron job to restart bitcoind every day or two as a damage control mechanism until the issue is resolved. Jonathan Toomim agreed with the suggestion and advised that the thread be moved to an issue on Github instead of continuing to CC the bitcoin-dev list. Tom Zander emphasized the need to measure memory usage correctly on Linux and shared his script for doing so. The email ended with standard mailing list information and links for unsubscribing and accessing more options.</summary>
