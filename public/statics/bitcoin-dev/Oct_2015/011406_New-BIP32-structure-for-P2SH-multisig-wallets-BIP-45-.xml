    <summary>The context discusses the use of m/i'/45' as a multisig "account" number in a BIP45 wallet. It is mentioned that using the same derivation always simplifies the workflow for establishing new multi-signature accounts significantly, and you can give every cosigner only that single piece of information, that single xpub. However, adding a new dimension to it will make things harder. If all wallet information is lost except for the mnemonic and extended public keys from all people established multi-signature accounts with, it becomes harder to restore the wallet from the initial mnemonic if something goes wrong. One would need to know the piece of data too in such a case.</summary>
