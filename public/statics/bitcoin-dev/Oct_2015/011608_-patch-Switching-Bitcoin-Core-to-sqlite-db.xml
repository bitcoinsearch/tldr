    <summary>On October 22, 2015, Jeff Garzik via bitcoin-dev wrote about an implementation to replace leveldb with sqlite. He shared a link to the beginnings of the implementation and mentioned that it still needed work before passing tests. Leveldb was noted as being unmaintained, so this was part of researching alternatives that are maintained and reliable. The discussion also touched on benchmarks and the perceived speed of the implementation.</summary>
