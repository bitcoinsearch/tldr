    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Bob McElrath suggested that to shut down Bitcoin-NG, all he needed to do was to figure out the current leader and DDoS him off the network. Emin Gün Sirer responded by saying that NG is compatible with Bitcoin and can increase throughput while reducing latency without changing its trust model. The actual leader in NG is a key, not a specific node, which makes it possible to deter DDoS attacks by dynamically migrating where in the network the leader is operating in response to an attack. Similar defenses against DDoS attacks on miners can also apply here, as they seem rare, partly due to the success of Matt Corallo's high-speed bitcoin relay network.</summary>
