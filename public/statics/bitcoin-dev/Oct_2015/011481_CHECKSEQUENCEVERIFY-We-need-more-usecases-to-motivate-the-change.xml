    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin developers mailing list, Rusty Russell noted that while nSequence may not be the only way to implement an opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) policy, it is the neatest and most straightforward method seen. Peter Todd asked for further clarification on the practical applications of nSequence, and Russell pointed out two: Gregory Maxwell had proposed using nSequence as a way of discouraging miners from reorganizing chains by including some of the low order bits of a previous block header in nSequence; and a few people had proposed implementing proof-of-stake block size voting with nSequence. Russell also noted that BIP68 already reserves much of nSequence for future use, although a few low-order bits are available for use with relative lock-time verify (RCLTV) functionality.</summary>
