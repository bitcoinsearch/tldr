    <title>CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY - We need more usecases to motivate the change</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposed change in BIP 68 to use 16 bits for sequence number in both the block and time versions, making time-based sequence numbers have a resolution of 512 seconds. The change removes ambiguity and leads to 14 bits for further soft forks within the semantics of BIP 68. The proposed change was added to the PR, but the BIP text still needs to be updated. The email also mentions proposals by Gregory Maxwell and others for using nSequence in discouraging miners from reorging chains and implementing proof-of-stake blocksize voting. The proposed change is seen as the most straightforward approach.</summary>
