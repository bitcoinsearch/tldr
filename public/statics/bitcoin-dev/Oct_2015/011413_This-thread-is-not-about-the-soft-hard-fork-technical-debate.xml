    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Tom Zander on October 5, 2015, the topic of discussion seems to be about a change that was made. Tom Zander suggested that they should argue on the topic rather than attacking each other personally. However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that he wasn't complaining about the man, but the behavior of stating an opinion that no one has held as theirs and attacking it. He explained why this type of behavior is not productive for holding a discussion. The conversation then shifted to the importance of looking at people's actions rather than their opinions, as sometimes opinions can be hard to read. Maxwell shared a short story he read as a child about a man who vowed never to lie and how his stories fell apart when faced with someone who had years of practice in the same. Zander complimented Maxwell's eloquent writing style and agreed that interactive improvement of explanations on the list may not be the best use of everyone's time.</summary>
