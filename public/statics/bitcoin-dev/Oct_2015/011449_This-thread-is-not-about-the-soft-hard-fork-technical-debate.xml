    <summary>On October 7, 2015, Venzen Khaosan wrote an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, challenging Mike Hearn to a public debate in Hong Kong. He accused Hearn of being "too stupid" to handle client funds and the innovation behind Bitcoin, and promised to dismantle his "intellectual bankruptcy" in front of the world. Meanwhile, Hearn had been raising objections to the implementation of CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) as a soft fork and argued that it should be implemented as a hard fork instead. He believed that many developers shared his concern and saw a big question mark over soft forks. However, he also expected the Core maintainers to ignore this controversy and go ahead with CLTV as a soft fork anyway.</summary>
