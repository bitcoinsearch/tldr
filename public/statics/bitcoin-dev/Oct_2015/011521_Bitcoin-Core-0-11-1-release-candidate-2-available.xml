    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1 and 0.10.3 have been released and are ready for gitian builds, according to a post by Wladimir on the Bitcoin Forum. Gitian builds are a method of ensuring that the binaries being distributed were produced from the exact source code as verified by a third party, which increases security and trust in the software. This is especially important for open-source projects like Bitcoin, where anyone can contribute code but not all contributions may be trustworthy. The release notes for version 0.11.1 indicate several bug fixes and improvements, including changes to how transactions are relayed, better handling of orphaned blocks, and an increase in the default number of outbound connections. Version 0.10.3 is a maintenance release with some security fixes and backports of some changes from the 0.11.x branch.These releases come at a time when the block size debate continues to rage within the Bitcoin community. Some users are advocating for a larger block size limit to allow for more transactions per block, while others argue that this would make it harder for individuals to run full nodes and thus decentralize the network. The development team behind Bitcoin Core has yet to take a stance on the issue, though they have stated that they will prioritize security and stability over any specific block size limit. Overall, the release of Bitcoin Core versions 0.11.1 and 0.10.3 represents a step forward for the Bitcoin ecosystem, as it demonstrates the ongoing commitment to improving the protocol and ensuring its security and reliability. By using gitian builds, users can be confident that the code they are running is exactly what was intended by the developers, and that there have been no unauthorized changes or additions.</summary>
