    <summary>The writer has proposed a new block size algorithm based on unneeded data and is seeking to identify any potential flaws in their proposal. The proposed solution is provided in a BIP that replaces the current static block size with a 2-part algorithm, which balances power between miners and users. This proposed consensus mechanism takes into account various factors such as transaction volume and buzzword usage, which have grown heavily correlated over the past six years. The writer suggests that using buzzwords as a basis for block size could reasonably scale with demand. For more information about the specifics of the proposal, interested parties can visit the GitHub link provided at https://github.com/whitj00/bips/blob/master/bip-whit.mediawiki.</summary>
