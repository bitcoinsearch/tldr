    <summary>On October 19, 2015, Christian Decker proposed a new implementation for normalized transaction IDs and storing them with coin state. However, Luke Dashjr expressed concern that this proposal doesn't completely close malleability and suggested specifying flags upfront in the UTXO-creating transaction to allow for fully malleability-proof wallets. He also pointed out that the flag to control whether the opcode behaves as VERIFY or not must be mandatory to guarantee successful evaluation on non-updated clients.</summary>
