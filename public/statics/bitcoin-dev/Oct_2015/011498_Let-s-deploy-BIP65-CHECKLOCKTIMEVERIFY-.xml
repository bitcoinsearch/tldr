    <summary>The discussion revolves around the technical aspects of a soft fork in Bitcoin. The fragility of a soft fork showing incorrect confirmations is dependent on the percentage of hash power that didn't upgrade; if only 5% of the hash power did not upgrade, the attack would be effectively ineffective unless the attacker knew an exact merchant that was on the minority of the network. Non-upgraded nodes will experience total breakage and will receive a push alert telling them to upgrade. Any non-upgraded miners will realize they're wasting hash power and stop doing so pretty quickly. Remaining miners will create blocks slowly without possibility of difficulty adjustment due to reduced hash power. Un-upgraded nodes will dump new blocks from the upgraded miner majority as invalid. Users who don't upgrade will try to do transactions but won't see them confirm for hours or days due to lack of hash power. However, this only applies to transactions for users who are using the new OP code; regular transactions will get relayed by both upgraded and un-upgraded nodes and miners alike.</summary>
