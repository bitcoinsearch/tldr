    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion, the issue of who coined the term "simplified payment verification" (SPV) was debated. Mike Hearn claimed that he used the term in a 2011 forum post, but another user pointed out that "coin" as a verb means to invent a new word or phrase, so technically anyone who used the term SPV was "coining" it. The discussion then shifted to the definition of an SPV client and whether header-only clients without fraud detection mechanisms are incomplete implementations according to Satoshi's original definition. It was suggested that eventually, SPV clients should be able to detect any rule violation on the blockchain, including block size. Additionally, the terminology around SPV clients was discussed, with the term "client only mode" and "headers only client" being used before the term "SPV wallet" became more widely adopted.</summary>
