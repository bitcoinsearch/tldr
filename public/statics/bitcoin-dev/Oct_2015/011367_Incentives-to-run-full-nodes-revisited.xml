    <summary>The developer has posted an update to a previous post about a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy. The original post had fractured links, but the new implementation can be found at http://abis.io. The concept is feasible in BTC as well as it has already been implemented in BCN - GUI wallet. The developer's blog can be found at https://bytecoin.org/news/bytecoin-wallet-1.0.8-release-introduces-micro-donations/. This link can also be found at http://abis.io. The developer invites comments on the implementation. Another interesting link related to this topic can be found at https://odinn.cyberguerrilla.org/index.php/2015/10/03/greater-giving-potential/.</summary>
