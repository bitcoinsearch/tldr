    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn and Jorge Timón discuss the potential advantages of hard forks in the roll-out process. They discuss how, while a non-upgraded full node and an upgraded full node will converge on "the most-work valid chain", the point of fully verifying is to not converge with the miner majority if something goes wrong and they aren't following the same rules as you. This is because defining "work" as "converge with miner majority" is fine for SPV wallets, but not for fully verifying nodes where non-convergence is an explicit design goal. They also discuss BIP65 and its security compared to SPV nodes, and how it's not necessary to produce a BIP65 hardfork alternative. Finally, they ask for an example of an attack in which a non-upgraded full node wallet is defrauded with BIP65 but could not with the hardfork alternative.</summary>
