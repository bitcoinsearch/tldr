    <summary>The context is a conversation between developers about the terminology used for "simplified payment verification" (SPV) clients. The term SPV wallet was not yet in use at the time, with Satoshi referring to them as "client-only mode" and Jeff Garzik calling them "headers-only client". Mike Hearn claimed to have coined the term SPV and implemented it in bitcoinj and BreadWallet. However, some members of the community have accused Hearn of making false statements and attempting to harm and divide the community through his actions, such as the contentious Bitcoin XT fork. There is a discussion about whether or not Hearn should be expelled from the Bitcoin-devs mailing list. The list admin suggests a cooling-off period before any further action is taken.</summary>
