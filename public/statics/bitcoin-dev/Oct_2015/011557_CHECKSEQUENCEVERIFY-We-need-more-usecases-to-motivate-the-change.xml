    <summary>BTC Drak communicated with Alex regarding the changes made in BIP68, which explicitly uses 16 bits with a bitmask. Although the change was added to the PR, it still needs to update BIP text. The link to the PR is provided for reference. BTC Drak likes the technical perspective of the changes but finds it impractical from a blackbox testing perspective. There is currently no way to play with bitcoind's perception of time, so it requires a long sleep to test. Hence, he makes a feature request to consider this issue.</summary>
