    <summary>On Tue, Oct 13, 2015 at 5:08 PM, Jonathan Toomim (Toomim Bros) expressed his concern over the anomalous behavior of memory usage scaling in bitcoin. According to him, the total bitcoind process usage was about 50-100x higher than he would have expected if the mempool was the main determinant of memory usage scaling. He requested Dave Scotese to tell him how much memory Task Manager is reporting your bitcoin process as using both today and tomorrow. Dave Scotese had shared that it has been running about a day on a Windows 8.1 box, and also provided the size and bytes of recent spam transactions. It was estimated that 16 million divided by 1085 transactions is almost 15Kb per transaction which seemed unlikely to Jonathan. Meanwhile, the size of an unidentified file increased from 360MB to about 460MB within half an hour (exact time not mentioned). In the email signature, the author mentioned providing some work for free as a way to prove their value and introduced their ownership in Litmocracy and Meme Racing (in alpha), being the webmaster for The Voluntaryist which now accepts Bitcoin, and coding for The Dollar Vigilante. A quote by Satoshi Nakamoto was also included - "He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules".</summary>
