    <summary>In an email exchange between Tom Zander and Gregory Maxwell, the question arises as to whether a fork in the Bitcoin protocol should only be listened to by regular contributors. Maxwell had stated that he did not believe there were any regulator contributors who disagreed with the proposed fork. Zander points out that this is not necessarily the case, as there have been disputes in the past involving regular contributors. He invites Maxwell to look for examples and suggests that it would be informative. However, Zander also acknowledges that his previous message may have been unclear and that Maxwell's selective editing had altered the meaning of his words.</summary>
