    <summary>On a Bitcoin development mailing list, Venzen Khaosan challenged Mike Hearn to a public debate about Bitcoin. Peter Todd disagreed with the off-topic discussion and stated that there was no consensus. As a result, he proposed two options to resolve the issue. NMH questioned Peter's motives and challenged him to a public debate on the topic of Bitcoin with certain conditions. However, Peter told them to go away. The email thread ends with Peter's signature and a footer for the mailing list.</summary>
