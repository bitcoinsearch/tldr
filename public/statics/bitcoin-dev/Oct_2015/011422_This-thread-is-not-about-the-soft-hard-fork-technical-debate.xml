    <summary>On October 5, 2015, Gregory Maxwell and Peter R had a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Peter R suggested that they use the current gridlock in the development process as a basis for decision-making. However, Gregory Maxwell disagreed with this suggestion and stated that there was no gridlock in the Core Dev development process. Maxwell warned against manufacturing a gridlock for political reasons as it would not be successful. Despite this, Peter R maintained his disagreement with Maxwell and claimed that there is indeed gridlock in the Core Dev development process.</summary>
