    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Mike Hearn mentioned that the term "SPV wallet" was coined by him to refer to what apps like BreadWallet or libraries like BitcoinJ do. He stated that at that time, nobody used this term and Satoshi had referred to them as "client only mode", while Jeff called them "headers only client". However, another member of the discussion pointed out that the term 'client mode' was already in use within the implementation of Bitcoin. They also argued that it is preferable to make decisions about limitations of BitcoinJ and other implementations by referring to their specific properties rather than using the term SPV. They stated that the origin of the term is irrelevant and that Jtimon's post on the misuse of fallacious arguments should have been enough to understand this.</summary>
