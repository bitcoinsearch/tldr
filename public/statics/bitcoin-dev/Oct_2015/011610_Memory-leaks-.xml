    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Btc Drak suggested that it was time to move the conversation to an issue on Github rather than continuing to CC the bitcoin-dev list. Another user agreed and opened an issue on Github for the topic in question. The link to this issue is provided in the message. It seems that the participants want to keep the conversation focused and organized by using Github to track it.</summary>
