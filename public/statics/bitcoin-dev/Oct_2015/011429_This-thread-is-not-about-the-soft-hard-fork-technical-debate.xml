    <summary>In an email thread dated 10/5/2015 at 1:56 PM, Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev stated that there were no regulator contributors who disagreed with a certain issue. However, the question was raised whether it was appropriate for someone who is part of a small group responsible for deciding whose contributions are accepted to the Core project should refer to "regular contributors" as a bar for opinions being worthy. The concern was that this could lead to accusations of squelching opinions and branding them as worthless simply because they did not come from a "regular contributor".</summary>
