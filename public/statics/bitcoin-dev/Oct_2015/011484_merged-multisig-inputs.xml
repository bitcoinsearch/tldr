    <summary>In an email conversation on October 8, 2015, Boris Neklabaro via bitcoin-dev asked if it was possible to merge two Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) spending from multiple Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) inputs. Additionally, he asked if it was possible to combine inputs P2SH and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) in a single transaction. In response to these queries, the answer is affirmative. The signatures for separate inputs are entirely separate, allowing for the merging of multiple UTXOs spending from various P2SH inputs, as well as combining P2SH and P2PKH inputs in a single transaction.</summary>
