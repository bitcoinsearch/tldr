    <summary>In this email exchange between Rusty Russell and Peter Todd, they discuss the implementation of a feature in Bitcoin through nSequence. While Russell argues that nSequence is the most straightforward way to implement this feature, Todd questions why it needs to be done via nSequence. Todd cites three other proposals for the use of nSequence, including Gregory Maxwell's proposal to discourage miners from reorganizing chains by including some of the low-order bits of a previous block header in nSequence and proof-of-stake blocksize voting. Russell responds positively to the PoS voting idea, but notes that the "prevbits" idea would require more bits. He suggests that the BIP wording be changed to allow for flexibility in implementing the feature.</summary>
