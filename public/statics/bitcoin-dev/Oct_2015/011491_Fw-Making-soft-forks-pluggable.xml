    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core Developer, proposed the idea of defining soft forks as standalone units that can be easily merged with Bitcoin Core. This would enable unit tests for each soft fork to be built independently and compared against enforcement of different combinations. The proposal would require some changes in the consensus code, but it could be done without disrupting large amounts of code and with hooks that are easily documented for simple backports. Lombrozo has expressed concerns about needing to convince everyone that nothing will break and whether supporting such a feature is a good idea at all. One motivation behind this initiative is the VersionBits BIP0009 which aims to make deployments faster. Lombrozo plans to write up a detailed plan if others think this is a good idea.</summary>
