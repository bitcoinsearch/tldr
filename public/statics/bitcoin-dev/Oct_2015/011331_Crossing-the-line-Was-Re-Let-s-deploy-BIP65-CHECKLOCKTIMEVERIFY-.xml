    <summary>Mike Hearn, one of the developers of Bitcoin, has been accused of making false and damaging statements about the cryptocurrency, including coining the term SPV. He also attempted to steal control of Bitcoin via the contentious Bitcoin XT fork. Some members of the community believe that Hearn has crossed a line and should be expelled from the community. However, it is unclear if there is such a line in the Bitcoin-devs mailing list. Hearn's website, Vinumeris.com, refers to him as a core developer of Bitcoin, and there are embedded videos on plan99.net that also refer to him as such. Additionally, Hearn has recently claimed to be Satoshi, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. These actions by Hearn have caused division and harm within the Bitcoin community for several years.</summary>
