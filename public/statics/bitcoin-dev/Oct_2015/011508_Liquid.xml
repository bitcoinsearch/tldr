    <summary>The email thread discusses the implementation of Sidechains for exchanges by Blockstream, as announced in their blog post [1]. The new construction is said to establish a security profile that is superior to existing methods of rapid transfer and settlement, which has direct applicability to other problems within existing financial institutions. However, some members of the email thread raise questions about the announcement. They ask what Bitcoin has to do with existing financial institutions, market liquidity, and capital requirements. Additionally, they inquire whether Blockstream has commercial products now and what the launch partners, including Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin, and Xapo, mean for the industry. One member suggests that Bitcoin could benefit from adding a way to transfer money to/from sidechain without requiring trusted third parties.</summary>
