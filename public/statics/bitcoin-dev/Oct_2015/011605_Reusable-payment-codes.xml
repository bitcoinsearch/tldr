    <summary>In an email exchange on October 22, 2015, Justus Ranvier and Luke Dashjr disagreed about adopting Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) version 1. While Justus said that the proposal was deployable by wallet implementers without requiring network-level changes, Luke stated that he disagreed with adopting it as is. He argued that multi-push OP_RETURN outputs were not standard transactions and therefore could not be relied upon to be relayed through the network. Luke believed that any improvement to the protocol which requires that feature was not appropriate for version 1. He suggested waiting until additional capabilities are deployed in the network before specifying a version 2 payment code that uses those features.</summary>
