    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, Marcel Jamin forwarded an email from Btc Drak regarding versioning of Bitcoin. He asked if there was any particular reason that Bitcoin versioning doesn't follow the SemVer specification. Btc Drak replied that it does follow the SemVer spec with the next major version being 0.12.0 and maintenance releases being 0.12.1 etc. Release candidates are labelled 0.12.0-rc1 for example.Wladimir J. van der Laan also weighed in on the discussion about the release schedule and feature freeze of Bitcoin Core 0.12.0. He stated that "feature freeze" means that any large code changes will no longer go into 0.12, unless fixing critical bugs. There is a good point to decouple consensus changes from Bitcoin Core major releases.In a message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Wladimir van der Laan explained the release schedule of Bitcoin Core software. The numbers assigned to releases do not serve as a signaling mechanism; they simply count up every half year. This means that the software is not judged by its maturity level, which would lead to long arguments and increased stress levels for the development team.</summary>
