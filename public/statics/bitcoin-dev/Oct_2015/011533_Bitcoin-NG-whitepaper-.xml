    <summary>The conversation among the bitcoin developers missed an important issue regarding double spending in a micro block that happens in key block which reorg'd away the first transaction. This kind of situation makes it impossible to punish people if there is a double spend in a micro block. The only solution left is to fall back to regular full blocks for confirmation times. Greg Slepak brought up a point on twitter, stating that users could no longer pick transactions in a mining pool which was set up in such a way that they can commit fraud at a much lower cost than the block's total reward. On October 14, 2015, Ittay via bitcoin-dev replied to Bryan Bishop's email regarding reward compensation and how it is not enough to fix the problems associated with double spending. Fraud proof removes all the attacker's revenue, but some issues still need to be addressed. The details regarding these issues were discussed in the -wizards group previously.</summary>
