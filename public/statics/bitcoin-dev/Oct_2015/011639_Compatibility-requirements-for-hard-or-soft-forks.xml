    <summary>Gavin Andresen has raised a question regarding the requirement of validating one-megabyte transactions under new rules. He argues that expensive-to-validate transactions created and given a lockTime in the future could be stored somewhere safe, and their owners may have no other way of spending the funds. In such situations, changing validation rules to be more strict so that those transactions are invalid would be an unacceptable confiscation of funds. Rusty has added that if we consider low-S enforcement, there is a high chance that non-expert users will be unable to spend an old transaction and they need to compromise their privacy and/or spend time and money. By that benchmark, we should aim for "reasonable certainty". Rusty suggests that a transaction which would never have been generated by any known software is the minimum bar. Adding "...which would have to be deliberately stupid with many redundant OP_CHECKSIG etc" surpasses it. The only extra safeguard he can think of is clear, widespread notification of the change. It is important to note that not just lockTime, but potentially any tx locked away in a safe requires validation.</summary>
