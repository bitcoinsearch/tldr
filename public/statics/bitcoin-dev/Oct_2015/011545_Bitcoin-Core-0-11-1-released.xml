    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1 has been released, featuring security fixes, and users are recommended to upgrade as soon as possible. The release includes a fix for buffer overflow in bundled upnp, updating miniupnpc to version 1.9.20151008, which fixes a buffer overflow in the XML parser during initial network discovery. Furthermore, upnp has been disabled by default, which may result in a lower number of reachable nodes on IPv4; however, this prevents future libupnpc vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network. The node will now require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when relaying or mining. This removes a nuisance malleability vector. The default for the `-minrelaytxfee` setting has been increased from `0.00001` to `0.00005`, necessitated by the current transaction flooding, causing outrageous memory usage on nodes due to the mempool ballooning. This is a temporary measure, bridging the time until a dynamic method for determining this fee is merged.</summary>
