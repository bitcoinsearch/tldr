    <summary>The Bitcoin subreddit has a rule that posts must concern the near-term development of the Bitcoin core code or Bitcoin protocol. The Bitcoin Development Mailing List has introduced new moderator rules in order to increase productivity and enhance the quality of interactions among developers. Moderation will last for three months, after which an on-list discussion will be conducted to determine whether it should continue or change. Appeals for or against moderation decisions should be directed to Jeff, who will have the final say. At present, there are five moderators, namely BtcDrak, G1lius, Kanzure, Johnathan, and the writer of the post. They cover Asia, Europe, and the US, and are not connected to each other. Moderation rules include no offensive posts, no personal attacks, and that posts must concern the near-term development of the bitcoin core code or bitcoin protocol. Posts must also contribute to bitcoin development. Patches, notification of pull requests, BIP proposals, academic paper announcements, and consequential discussions are encouraged, whereas shower thoughts, wild speculation, jokes, non-technical bitcoin issues, rehashing settled topics without new data, and moderation concerns are discouraged. Detailed patch discussions are generally better on GitHub PR, while meta-discussion is better on bitcoin-discuss. All subscribers start off as moderated and the mod bit gets cleared when they post. However, it gets set again if someone notices or reports a violation. The moderators acknowledge that mistakes may occur and ask for patience from subscribers. On October 22, 2015, Rusty Russell via bitcoin-dev announced that all rejected posts would be forwarded to a public viewing list. The list can be found at https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev-moderation/. However, the forwarded messages are not readable and only contain the message "An embedded message was scrubbed..." with a non-text attachment named signature.asc.In this post, Gavin Andresen expresses his frustration with the moderation policy on an unknown platform. He states that the policy is already a disaster and expects his message to be rejected as well. Gavin points out that several messages from various individuals have already been rejected, including himself and Sergio Damian Lerner, who he refers to as his partner in crime. Other rejected messages include those discussing a bug, CLTV, censorship of technical discussion, and complaints about censorship. Gavin ends his post with a "WTF?" remark, indicating his confusion and disbelief at the situation.</summary>
