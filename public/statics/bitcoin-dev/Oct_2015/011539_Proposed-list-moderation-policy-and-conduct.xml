    <summary>The mailing list, bitcoin-dev, is aimed at facilitating constructive discussions related to technical development of the bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin Core reference implementation. The proposed policy aims to maintain an environment where a broad diversity of participants feel welcomed and useful. The policy includes guidelines on being friendly and patient, civil and considerate, assuming good faith, respecting time and attention, and disclosing potential conflicts. It serves to distill the common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Failure to observe the code may be grounds for reprimand, probation or removal from the lists.The enforcement of the policy includes direct contact, on-list discussion, or reaching out to moderators through their on-list communication addresses. Moderators are selected from various projects and roles to avoid cases where the set of moderators equals the set of bitcoin core committers or similar. Other resources that provide guidance for good behavior include Chapter 6 of Producing OSS by Karl Fogel, RFC 1855, and the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. The policy was inspired by the GNOME Code of Conduct, Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines, Ubuntu Code of Conduct, and other codes listed at the OpenHatch list of project codes of conduct.</summary>
