    <summary>On a Bitcoin development forum, Steven Pine accuses Mike of being a "concern troll" and a "bully." However, Russ argues that these terms are not valid in technical discussions. He asserts that several developers act as bullies by using the power they have accumulated in a decentralized system. Russ also disputes the idea that Bitcoin is supposed to have a model where users are not forced to trust a small group such as the core developers. He believes that giving up the idea of decentralization would mean relinquishing control over the official software releases. In response to Mike's refusal to build consensus changes he doesn't agree with, Russ argues that Bitcoin is built on incentives and not a charity. Finally, Russ suggests that only a very small minority of the Bitcoin developers have integrity and trust, while most are irrational and untrustworthy outside their technical expertise.</summary>
