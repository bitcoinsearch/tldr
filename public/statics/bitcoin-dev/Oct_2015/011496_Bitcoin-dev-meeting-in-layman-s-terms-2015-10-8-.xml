    <summary>The weekly Bitcoin developer meeting was discussed in layman's terms. The topics noted were mempool limiting: chain limits, Low-S change, CLTV &amp; CSV review and the creation of a Bitcoin discuss mailing list. It is important to note that the author is not a developer and some information provided may be incorrect or biased. It was announced that most JS Bitcoin software is vulnerable to generating incorrect public keys which has the potential to cause millions of dollars in losses. Mempool limiting: chain limits were discussed with urgency as child-pays-for-parent mining increases attack vectors. The proposed number of transactions received push-back but the total size limit did not. A 25 transaction limit was suggested as being enough. Low-S change was discussed in regards to the recent malleability attack and requiring nodes to have the "low-s" encoding for signatures. BlueMatt has a node which several people are running that auto-malleates to low-s transactions. Contacting miners about testing LowS in standardness was suggested and a release is scheduled for the end of the month.CLTV &amp; CSV backport review was discussed with uncertainty and confusion about whether the semantics are final or not in regards to using bits from nSequence. Pull requests for clarification and reviews were suggested. Lastly, there was discussion surrounding the creation of a Bitcoin discuss mailing list. The Bitcoin-dev mailing list is intended for technical discussions only, however, inappropriate posts have been made. Next week, a Bitcoin-discuss list will be created with moderators yet to be decided. A meeting is scheduled for next week to discuss moderation and policies.</summary>
