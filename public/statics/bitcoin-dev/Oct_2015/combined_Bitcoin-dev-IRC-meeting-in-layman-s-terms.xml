    <summary>During a recent weekly dev meeting, a bitcoin developer posted an overview of the key topics discussed. The main points included mempool limiting, BIP68 + CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, CLTV soft fork deployment, and libconsensus merge time window. The developers discussed finding ways to limit the mempool so that nodes cannot be attacked by abusing the mechanism. They also debated chain limits and came to a consensus that larger descendant packages would be safer than smaller ones which are easier to attack.The meeting also focused on the Libconsensus project, which aims to separate the code that influences network consensus from non-consensus parts. This separation enables developers to improve the consensus layer without affecting other components. The goal is to make the code more modular and easier to maintain.Overall, the meeting was productive in exploring these important topics that will ultimately help to improve the security and efficiency of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
