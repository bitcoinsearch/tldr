    <summary>Notplato recently made a suggestion to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list about an improvement for isStandard. They proposed that bits 16..29, which can take any value without affecting the script, should be turned off to help the script pass isStandard. Notplato believes that this requirement could serve as a backup in case future uses of those bits are deployed as soft forks. However, they also expressed uncertainty about their understanding of isStandard and asked for clarification if necessary.In addition to their suggestion, Notplato offered their services as a techie and provided information about their current projects. It remains to be seen whether this suggestion will be implemented or not. Nonetheless, it's always encouraging to see community members stepping up and contributing to the further development of Bitcoin.</summary>
