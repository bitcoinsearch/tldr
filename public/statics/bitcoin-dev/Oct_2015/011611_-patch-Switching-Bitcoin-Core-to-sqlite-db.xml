    <summary>A new implementation to replace leveldb with sqlite has been introduced on Github. It is still in need of some work before passing tests. Additionally, it has been suggested that instead of implementing it as a replacement, multiple backends should be supported, which would allow for migration. A dbwrapper bench tool that represents the needs and style of how the database is hit is needed to investigate further. Gavin's recently added bench target/bench environment could be used for this purpose.</summary>
