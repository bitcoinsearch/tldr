    <summary>In an email conversation, Emin GÃ¼n Sirer discusses the issues with fixing problems associated with double spending by just taking reward compensation back by fraud proofs. The whitepaper he refers to has all the technical details of this issue. This topic was also recently discussed in a -wizards thread. For a system entirely based on fraud proofs and threats of fraud proofs, fidelity-bonded ledgers are recommended. Links to relevant discussions on this topic can be found in the provided sources.</summary>
