    <summary>In a post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Btc Drak challenges the assumption that making a noise about a topic makes it controversial. He argues that if something is truly controversial, it will be obvious and plain to see. However, he believes that the soft fork in Bitcoin is indeed controversial. The main point of his post is how Bitcoin Core's "no change" rule has prevented bigger blocks from being implemented for years. This rule was meant to ensure consensus among developers but has been criticized as not working for many decision-making processes.Btc Drak suggests that this rule has hurt the things that Mike was passionate about in the past and is now hurting the things that some other developers are passionate about today. He believes that everyone should agree that the past is the past and that they have all learned a lesson. It is time for Bitcoin Core to make decisions in a different way.</summary>
