    <summary>Jonathan Toomim discovered that several running bitcoind processes were using over 3GB of RAM, even though the mempool seemed to be under control. The total memory usage was not shown as he restarted bitcoind as soon as he noticed the issue. Wladimir van der Laan stated that this is most likely the mempool but just not being reported correctly. In the meantime, the mempool growth can be mitigated by setting `-mintxfee`. This will be the default in version 0.11.1 and 0.10.3. Version 0.12.0 will have better mempool management and more precise reporting.</summary>
