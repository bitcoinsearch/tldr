    <summary>In an email conversation between Milly Bitcoin and Russ, they discussed the correct way to use a copyright notice. Russ stated that using "All Content Copyright and other rights reserved by its Respective Owners" or something similar is not the same as claiming ownership using the "c" inside the circle. He also explained that there is a difference between claiming a copyright for individual works as part of a compilation as opposed to claiming a copyright on the compilation itself, which is what the current notice is. Milly Bitcoin suggested in the conversation that the copyright notice refers to the fact that each contributor owns copyright to his own contributions, but Russ corrected her by stating that the legal owner should be identified after the "c" in the circle. According to Nolo, a valid copyright notice should contain the word "copyright", a "c" in a circle (Â©), the date of publication, and the name of either the author or the owner of all the copyright rights in the published work. The USPTO states that the use of the notice informs the public that a work is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright owner, and shows the year of first publication.</summary>
