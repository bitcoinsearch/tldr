    <summary>In a recent discussion, Gregory Maxwell argues that the bit is easily checked by thin clients and could be used to reject potentially ill-fated blocks from non-upgraded miners post switch. However, thin clients have not done anything useful with the version numbers. A middle ground solution could be to require setting the bit for a period of time after rule enforcing begins, but only enforce the validity of the block under new rules. This will add another state and would trigger warnings on older clients if introduced later. To implement this middle ground solution, miners would need to keep setting the bit for another 2016 blocks. If required later, it can become a consensus rule. Rusty ended the discussion with a humorous quote.</summary>
