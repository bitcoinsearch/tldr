    <summary>The author is requesting clarification on the definition of "short-term changes to the Bitcoin protocol" as a moderation rule. They propose the question of whether any one-megabyte transaction that is valid under existing rules should also be valid under new rules. The pro argument highlights the possibility of expensive-to-validate transactions with a lockTime in the future that may have no other way of spending the funds. On the other hand, the con argument suggests it is unlikely such large, timelocked transactions exist due to the Core code's policy for years that only 100,000-byte transactions are standard and larger transactions are not. It is proposed that the requirement should be relaxed to only valid 100,000-byte transactions under old consensus rules. Gavin Andresen implemented BIP101/Bitcoin XT when deciding on a limit for signature hashing and decided to support any "non-attack" 1MB transaction.</summary>
