    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.10.3 release candidate 2 has been released with security fixes and translation updates. Upgrading and downgrading instructions are provided, but a backup of the entire data directory is required for a smooth downgrade as the block files and databases of versions before 0.10.0 are not backwards-compatible with this new release. The block index database will hold headers for which no block is stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support. Notable changes include an update to bundled miniupnpc to 1.9.20151008 to fix a buffer overflow in the XML parser during initial network discovery. UPnP has been disabled by default to prevent future libupnpc vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network. Additionally, the node will now require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when relaying or mining to remove a nuisance malleability vector. Finally, the default minimum relay fee has been increased from `0.00001` to `0.00005` due to current transaction flooding causing outrageous memory usage on nodes. In summary, Bitcoin Core version 0.10.3 release candidate 2 provides security fixes and translation updates while also making important changes such as disabling UPnP by default and increasing the minimum relay fee to address transaction flooding issues. It is important to follow upgrading and downgrading instructions and back up the entire data directory for a smooth transition.</summary>
