    <summary>The context of this discussion is about Bitcoin protocol authorship and the perceived value of soft-forks. Mike and Gregory, both intelligent and well-versed in Bitcoin, are engaging in a debate that some believe is not productive. Steven Pine criticizes Mike for being a concern troll and bully, losing his integrity and trust, and wasting the core developers' time with his antics. Pine suggests that Mike should fork Bitcoin, develop XT, and ignore his input on core unless some XT feature is deemed good enough to incorporate. Gregory Maxwell responds to Tom Zander's suggestion to argue on the topic, not on the man, by pointing out the behavior of stating an opinion no one has held as theirs and attacking it is not a productive way to hold a discussion. He enumerates a number of specific reasons why the situation is not very similar to the one Mike was trying to draw a parallel to. The author suggests that Bitcoin protocol authorship and individual implementation development need to be separated as soon as possible so that Core developers can focus on their implementation's development free from distraction while other implementers and Core developers can discuss protocol issues in a more relevant forum in a more civilized and constructive manner.</summary>
