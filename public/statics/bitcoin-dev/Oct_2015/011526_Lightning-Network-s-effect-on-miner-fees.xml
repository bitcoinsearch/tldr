    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Paul Sztorc pointed out that Lightning Network (LN) transactions cannot take place without periodic on-chain transactions. As such, while LN is a complementary technology to Bitcoin, it still relies on the underlying blockchain to function. Additionally, users are advised not to store large amounts of BTC in LN hot wallets and instead opt for confirmed UTXOs for long-term cold storage. It is expected that LN usage will begin with small amounts of BTC in tiny hot wallets, as there is currently little interest in running large hot wallets.</summary>
