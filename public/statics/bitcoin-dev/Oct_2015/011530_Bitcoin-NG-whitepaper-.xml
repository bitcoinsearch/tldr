    <summary>On October 14, 2015, Ittay from the Bitcoin community replied to a discussion about fixing problems associated with double-spending. He noted that fraud proof would remove all of the attacker's revenue and compared it to the attacker sacrificing an entire block for double-spending in the current system. The discussion referenced included commentary from Luke-Jr and took place on the -wizards forum. The whitepaper with more detailed information can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02037.</summary>
