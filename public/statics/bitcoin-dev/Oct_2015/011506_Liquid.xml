    <summary>A user named Benjamin has expressed his surprise over Blockstream's plan to implement Sidechains for exchanges and requested an explanation. He questions the announcement's use of terms such as "rapid transfer" and "settlement" in relation to Bitcoin, which he deems as anonymous digital cash with no concept of settlement. Additionally, he queries the connection between Bitcoin and existing financial institutions, market liquidity, and capital requirements. Benjamin also inquires about Blockstream's commercial products and launch partners, which include Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin, and Xapo, with discussions ongoing with a dozen more major institutional traders and licensed exchanges.</summary>
