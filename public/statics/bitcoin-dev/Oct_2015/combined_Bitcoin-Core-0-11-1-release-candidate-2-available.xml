    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1 and 0.10.3 have been released and are available for gitian builds, as per a post by Wladimir on the Bitcoin Forum. Gitian builds verify that the binaries being distributed were produced from the exact source code as verified by a third party, thereby ensuring security and trust in the software. Version 0.11.1 has several bug fixes and improvements, such as changes to how transactions are relayed, better handling of orphaned blocks, and an increase in the default number of outbound connections. On the other hand, version 0.10.3 is a maintenance release with some security fixes and backports of some changes from the 0.11.x branch.The releases coincide with the ongoing debate within the Bitcoin community about block size. While some users advocate for a larger block size limit to allow more transactions per block, others argue that this would make it harder for individuals to run full nodes and decentralize the network. The development team behind Bitcoin Core has yet to take a stance on the issue, stating that they prioritize security and stability over any specific block size limit.Furthermore, Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1 release candidate 2 has been announced with notable changes and security fixes. The upgrade and downgrade options are available, and users running an older version are advised to shut it down. This latest version fixes a buffer overflow in the XML parser during initial network discovery, disables upnp by default to prevent future libupnpc vulnerabilities from posing a structural risk to the network, and increases the minimum relay fee default from `0.00001` to `0.00005`.Overall, the release of Bitcoin Core versions 0.11.1 and 0.10.3 represents a significant step forward for the Bitcoin ecosystem, demonstrating the ongoing commitment to improving the protocol and ensuring its security and reliability. Using gitian builds assures users that they are running the code intended by developers, with no unauthorized changes or additions.</summary>
