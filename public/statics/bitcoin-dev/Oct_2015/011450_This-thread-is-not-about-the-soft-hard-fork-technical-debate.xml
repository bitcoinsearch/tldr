    <summary>A new member to the bitcoin-dev community has been reading through the threads to educate themselves on the group ethos and etiquette. They found it difficult to understand some of the back-and-forth conversations, which may be intentional to maintain exclusivity. The new member would like to get involved by contributing their knowledge to the hardfork debate, but they are unsure if there is a more appropriate place to do so. Meanwhile, Mike Hearn voices his support for a hard fork instead of a soft fork in regards to CLTV deployment. He believes that hard forks are cleaner and have other desirable properties, while soft forks pose real financial risks. Despite controversy surrounding the consensus rules, Hearn predicts that Core maintainers will ignore it and do CLTV as a soft fork anyway.</summary>
