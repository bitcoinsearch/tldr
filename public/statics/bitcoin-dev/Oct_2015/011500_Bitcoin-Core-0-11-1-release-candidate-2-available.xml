    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1 release candidate 2 has been announced, providing a new minor version release with security fixes. Upgrading and downgrading is available. If you are running an older version, shut it down. This latest version brings notable changes and fixes a buffer overflow in the XML parser during initial network discovery. Additionally, upnp has been disabled by default to prevent future libupnpc vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network. The minimum relay fee default has also increased from `0.00001` to `0.00005`.</summary>
