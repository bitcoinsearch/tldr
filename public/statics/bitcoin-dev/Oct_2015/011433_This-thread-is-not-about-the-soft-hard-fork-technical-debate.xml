    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Milly Bitcoin requested a list of "Core Developers" as referenced in the copyright notice. Luke Dashjr, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, responded by clarifying that there is no legal group that owns copyright to the entirety of the code. Rather, each contributor owns copyright to their own contributions. This clarification sheds light on the decentralized nature of the development process for Bitcoin Core.</summary>
