    <summary>A developer named Daniel has discovered some code in bitcoin's src/main.cpp that is using a preceding block as the "from argument" instead of pindexBestHeader. This issue was found around line 4960 of the code, and he points out that the request on line 4132 does use pindexBestHeader when responding to a newly announced block. He is unable to understand why the preceding call is being used and believes it should be changed to pindexBestHeader. However, when he makes this change, the wallet.py test gets stuck, and he cannot figure out why. Daniel is seeking help to better understand this issue and thinks that an explanation in a comment around line 4960 would be helpful for others. He is committed to writing a pull request if he can understand the issue and seeks to save others time by doing so.</summary>
