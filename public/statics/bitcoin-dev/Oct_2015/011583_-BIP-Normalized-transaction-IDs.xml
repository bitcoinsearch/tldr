    <summary>In a conversation between Christian Decker and Luke, the issue of transaction malleability was discussed. If there are multiple signers for a transaction, changing one signature would invalidate the signatures of other signers as well. Luke suggested that the modified version can be re-signed by the other signers to solve this issue. However, this is still a form of malleability that needs to be addressed in the BIP.</summary>
