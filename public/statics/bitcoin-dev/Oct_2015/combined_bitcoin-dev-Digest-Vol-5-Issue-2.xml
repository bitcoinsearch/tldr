    <summary>The Bitcoin-Dev mailing list recently discussed the versioning of Bitcoin. Marcel Jamin forwarded an email from Btc Drak regarding the matter, questioning why the Bitcoin versioning doesn't follow the SemVer specification. Btc Drak replied that it does indeed follow the SemVer spec, with the next major version being 0.12.0 and maintenance releases being 0.12.1, etc. Release candidates are labelled 0.12.0-rc1. Wladimir J. van der Laan also shared his thoughts on the discussion about the release schedule and feature freeze of Bitcoin Core 0.12.0. He explained that "feature freeze" means that any large code changes will no longer go into 0.12, unless they fix critical bugs. There is a good point to decouple consensus changes from Bitcoin Core major releases. In a message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Wladimir van der Laan clarified the release schedule of Bitcoin Core software. The numbers assigned to releases do not serve as a signaling mechanism; they simply count up every half year. This means that the software is not judged by its maturity level, which would lead to long arguments and increased stress levels for the development team.</summary>
