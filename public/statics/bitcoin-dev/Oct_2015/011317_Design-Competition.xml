    <summary>In this email thread, the discussion is centered around the need for a more open mailing list for Bitcoin, as well as the announcement of a Bitcoin trading platform competition. The original poster expresses their desire for a dedicated mailing list that is not focused solely on digital cash systems and welcomes discussions about 2.0 projects. Another member suggests that the Bitcointalk Altcoin section would be the best place for announcements regarding such projects. In response to the announcement of the trading platform competition, one member questions why the funds are not being used to fund Core development instead. The competition is described as a community-driven effort that aims to build a trading platform for foreign exchange and other assets using colored coins and potentially a sidechain. The contributions made will be available under an MIT license on Github. Finally, the original poster offers their coding services and lists several projects they are involved in, including Litmocracy and Meme Racing.</summary>
