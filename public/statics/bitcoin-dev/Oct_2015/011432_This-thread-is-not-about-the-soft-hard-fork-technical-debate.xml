    <summary>The author of the message expressed confusion over the terminology related to Bitcoin's Core developers. They noted that the software's name was changed from QT to "Core," which seemed to have a different meaning than what they initially understood as "core developers." The author questioned whether there were "Core Core Developers" who were more important than other "Core developers." Additionally, they requested a list of "Core Developers" for legal purposes. The author also stated their belief that the idea of Core being the "core of Bitcoin" should be deprecated.</summary>
