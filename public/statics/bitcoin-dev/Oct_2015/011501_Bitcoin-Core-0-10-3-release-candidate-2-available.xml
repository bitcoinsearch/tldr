    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.10.3 release candidate 2 is now available. This new minor version release comes with security fixes and translation updates. Upgrading and downgrading instructions are provided. The block files and databases of versions before 0.10.0 are not backwards-compatible with this new release, so a backup of the entire data directory is required for a smooth downgrade. The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support. Two notable changes include an update to bundled miniupnpc to 1.9.20151008 to fix a buffer overflow in the XML parser during initial network discovery and upnp has been disabled by default to prevent future libupnpc vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network. Additionally, the node will now require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when relaying or mining to remove a nuisance malleability vector. Finally, the default minimum relay fee has been increased from `0.00001` to `0.00005` due to current transaction flooding causing outrageous memory usage on nodes.</summary>
