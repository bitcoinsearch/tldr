    <summary>On October 6, 2015, Eric Lombrozo expressed his disappointment in a post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. Lombrozo responded to a message sent by cipher anthem, calling someone a "concern troll and bully." Cipher anthem had used the term "troll" in their message, which Lombrozo referred to as "childish" language. Milly Bitcoin responded to Steven Pine's post about Mike being a concern troll, and cipher anthem suggested using the term "cultist" instead of "troll" to appear more professional. The conversation continued on the mailing list.</summary>
