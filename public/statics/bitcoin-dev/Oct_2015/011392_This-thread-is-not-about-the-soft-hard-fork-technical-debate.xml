    <summary>The message is in response to a debate regarding hard forks and soft forks in the Bitcoin network. The author of the message argues that hard fork requirements cannot be applied to soft fork procedures. Additionally, they state that the idea that all objections must be addressed until the person agrees is not always applicable. They argue that it is unfair to assume that something is controversial just because someone refuses to understand or disagrees with it. The author of the message also discusses a previous discussion on the mailing list where Mike Hearn criticized the informal governance model of Bitcoin Core development. The author believes that Hearn has won this battle and that a formal decision-making process may be good for Bitcoin. However, they also acknowledge that a more formal process may bring the project to a standstill if each objection is addressed endlessly.</summary>
