    <summary>On September 24th, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan announced a feature freeze for Bitcoin Core 0.12 on December 1st of that year. In response to this announcement, Luke Dashjr asked about the consensus freeze and suggested that it should be postponed until after the HK workshop in case a hardfork is decided on. Dashjr expressed concern that postponing the release could cause more delay, as new code would need to be developed, tested, and reviewed before being added to the release. Dashjr also noted the issue with release date drift due to changes needing to be added, which was the reason for switching to a time-based release schedule instead of a feature-based one. Van der Laan responded by saying that feature freeze meant that only critical bug fixes could be made to 0.12. He also stated that he did not want to postpone 0.12 for the reasons mentioned by Dashjr but acknowledged the benefits of decoupling consensus changes from major releases. Finally, van der Laan suggested that they could always do a 0.12.1 release if necessary.</summary>
