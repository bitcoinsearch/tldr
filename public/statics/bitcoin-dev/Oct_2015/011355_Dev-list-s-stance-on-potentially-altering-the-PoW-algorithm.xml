    <summary>In response to concerns about the centralised hoarding of mining ASICs, restarting mining with a new algorithm may be an acceptable solution. Such hoarding-miners do not participate in the economy and are not meaningful contributors by accepting payments from other bitcoin users. However, there is no basis for these claims and such questions should be directed towards economists rather than developers. The suggestion of changing the language of Core to prevent developer centralisation was made in jest.</summary>
