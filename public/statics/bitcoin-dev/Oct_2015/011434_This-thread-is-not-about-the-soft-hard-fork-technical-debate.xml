    <summary>In a discussion among members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding raised concerns about the potential for centralization of control over the Bitcoin codebase. This prompted Peter R to suggest using differential equations to measure centralization pressure and implementing a "one man one commit" policy to promote decentralization. He also advocated for deprecating the idea that Core is the "core of Bitcoin" in favor of multiple competing implementations, such as XT and btcd, to make it easier for the community to determine the evolution of Bitcoin based on the code they choose to run. R's views were seen as insightful and valuable by some members of the mailing list.</summary>
