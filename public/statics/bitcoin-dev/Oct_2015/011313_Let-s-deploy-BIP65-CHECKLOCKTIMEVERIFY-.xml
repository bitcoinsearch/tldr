    <summary>In an email exchange between Jorge Timón and Mike Hearn, the two discussed the issue of newly invalid transactions being accepted into a miner's memory pool and causing them to mine invalid blocks until the owner shuts down and upgrades. This was happening for weeks after P2SH triggered. Mike Hearn pointed out that any miner that has modified or bypassed IsStandard(), accepts direct transaction submission, or runs an old node from before OP_NOPs were made non-standard could be affected by this issue. However, Greg Maxwell corrected the second paragraph of the email exchange, stating that it was not entirely accurate.</summary>
