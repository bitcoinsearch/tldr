    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing a potential memory leak issue. Possible explanations for the effect include leaks, caches and fragmentation. Debugging tools are not ideal to investigate the issue, but a build with tcmalloc may be useful in investigating heap statistics. One user suggested running the system in valgrind with --leak-check=full for 10 minutes to identify any memory leaks at exit. However, some of the observed leaks may just be design issues where cache can grow too much and not show up in the valgrind output. The group warns against trolling behavior and threatens to ban those who do not follow guidelines.</summary>
