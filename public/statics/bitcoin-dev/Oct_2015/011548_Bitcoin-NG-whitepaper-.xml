    <summary>The Bitcoin-NG protocol is designed to address scalability challenges faced by Bitcoin and is said to increase throughput while reducing latency without impacting Bitcoin's open architecture or changing its trust model. With the NG approach supposedly running as fast as the network allows, a question arises whether it could be offered as an option to users of Core who could choose between being limited by block size and block interval or running out as fast as the network would allow. Additionally, concerns are raised about how information managed and protected in the Bitcoin-NG scheme? The headers contain references to previous blocks, current GMT times, cryptographic hashes of ledger entries, and cryptographic signatures of the headers so forth, and other information. Can the Bitcoin-NG scheme be designed or implemented in a manner which supports Stealth sends, Confidential Transactions, or similar privacy measures? Or is this something which cannot be answered at this time?</summary>
