    <summary>In an email conversation on October 21, 2015, Jonathan Toomim mentioned a user in the bitcointalk p2pool thread who claimed to have a memory usage issue on Linux but not on Mac OS X under a GBT workload in both situations. Ross Bennetts responded to this and stated that he had experienced this issue on both Linux and Mac OSX. He moved his P2Pool/bitcoind node from Ubuntu to OSX since his P2Pool instability began, and they both became flaky after a few hours of uptime. Bennetts tried both core and xt versions and two other bitcoin nodes, one connected to electrum-server and one standalone, seemed fine. Bennetts provided links to his various social media profiles at the end of his email.</summary>
