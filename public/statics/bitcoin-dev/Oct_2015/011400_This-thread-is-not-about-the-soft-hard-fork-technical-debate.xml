    <summary>In an email thread on October 5th, 2015, Gregory Maxwell expressed his opinion that Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 66 (BIP66) rollout was not a success despite others thinking it was. He points out that during the rollout, people were told not to trust the longest chain until it was 30 blocks. He believes that if this fiasco happened in a company, people would get fired for gross misconduct. There is a terrible track record of doing soft forks in the past, and there are good technical reasons why it should not happen again. Maxwell also criticized the character assassination of Mike Hearn, who he thinks has been wrongly accused of disrupting Bitcoin to try to force his block size hard fork on people. The email thread then goes on to discuss the issue of consensus, which is an admirable goal but often not reached in the real world. However, this specific goal is in conflict with building a good product and a well-functioning community. A good product and community need rules, timely decisions, and conflict resolution, and do not need muting of valuable voices, character assassinations, or egos.Lastly, Maxwell suggests reading the book "The Art of Community" as it provides insights into building a successful community.</summary>
