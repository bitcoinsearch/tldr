    <summary>In a discussion about the term SPV (simplified payment verification), Mike Hearn claimed that the verb 'coin' means to invent a new word or phrase and asked that the claim "I coined the term SPV" be retracted as it would be plagiarism. The whitepaper states that the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. To protect against this, one strategy is to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. SPV clients without any fraud detecting mechanism are functional but incomplete implementations according to Satoshi's original definition. In the first generation of SPV wallet, it might be good enough, but eventually, SPV clients should be ready to detect any rule violation in the blockchain, including things like block size. Hearn referred to a post on bitcointalk.org where he introduced the terminology of SPV clients for "simplified payment verification". At that time, nobody used the term "SPV wallet" to refer to what apps like BreadWallet or libraries like bitcoinj do. Satoshi used the term "client only mode", Jeff was calling them "headers-only client" etc.</summary>
