    <summary>A developer is experiencing high memory usage on a running bitcoind process. The mempool seems to be under control, however, the total memory usage is over 3 GB RAM for several nodes. After restarting the processes and letting them run for a few minutes, memory usage drops significantly. The developer is unsure where the memory leak might be coming from and suggests that it may be related to minrelaytxfee code path. The issue is happening with both Bitcoin Core 0.10.1 and Bitcoin XT 0.11B.</summary>
