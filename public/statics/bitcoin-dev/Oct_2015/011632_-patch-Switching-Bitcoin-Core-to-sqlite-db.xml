    <summary>A developer suggested having two storage options for Bitcoin's UTXO, but Luke-Jr, a contributor to the project, warned against it. He said that UTXO storage is consensus-critical code, and any divergence in implementation behavior could lead to consensus failure. To reduce the risk of this happening, they need to choose one storage engine and maintain consensus-compatibility themselves. Luke-Jr believes that fixing LevelDB would be easier than switching to anything SQL-based. He acknowledged that research is necessary, but he emphasized being realistic about deployment.</summary>
