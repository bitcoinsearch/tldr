    <summary>In an email exchange on 9/30/2015, Jorge Tim√≥n via bitcoin-dev suggested that the advantages of softforks did not need to be fully understood in order to move forward with BIP65. He gave the example of how BIP66 was deployed without every developer and user needing to understand it. However, this example was criticized as a bad one due to the fact that BIP66 deployment failed and required centralized intervention to fix the issue.</summary>
