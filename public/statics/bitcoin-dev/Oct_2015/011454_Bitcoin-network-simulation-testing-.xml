    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Byron Gibson asked if anyone was using simulators such as Shadow and BTCSim to test proposed changes to Bitcoin. In response, Nina K said that she had been using Shadow but found that running it with Tor slowed down her machine quite a bit, which could affect the accuracy of the stats collected. She wondered if this was an issue for others as well or if there was an adjustment that could be made. Shadow uses virtual time that is decoupled from real time, so while it may slow down a machine, it does not affect the stats collected. However, compared to abstract simulators that avoid running the actual Bitcoin code, running Shadow can be somewhat unpleasant unless one has a fast machine.</summary>
