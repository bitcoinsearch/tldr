    <summary>Venzen Khaosan has issued a challenge to an unnamed "eloquent guy" in the bitcoin community, offering to debate with him for 15 minutes in a public open mic session. He guarantees that he will remove the person from their high horse and close their voice in Bitcoin for good, stating that they are too stupid to handle client funds and this great innovation. Venzen Khaosan also mentions that he will go for the psychological throat first. Mike Hearn via bitcoin-dev wrote an email discussing the controversy surrounding CLTV deployment, which is clearly controversial and should be a hard fork. He claims there is only one objection to it being a hard fork, and states that he believes many developers other than himself have noted that hard forks are cleaner and have other desirable properties. Mike Hearn goes on to say that as everyone in the Bitcoin community has been clearly told that controversial changes to the consensus rules must not happen, it's clear that CLTV cannot happen in its current form. He expects Core maintainers to ignore the controversy and do CLTV as a soft fork anyway, despite this. Mike Hearn states that he would rather the opcode be tweaked, citing real financial risks to a soft fork.</summary>
