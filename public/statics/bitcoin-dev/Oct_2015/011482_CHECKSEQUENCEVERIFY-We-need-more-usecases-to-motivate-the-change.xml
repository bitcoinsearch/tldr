    <summary>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, raised some concerns about the review process for BIP68 and BIP112, which collectively define the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY semantics. He pointed out that there isn't any one pull request with all the code changes together, making it difficult to fully understand the behavior of the overall design. Todd believes that in this case, the overall design needs to be evaluated as a single unit to ensure the final effect of the merged BIPs is fully understood.</summary>
