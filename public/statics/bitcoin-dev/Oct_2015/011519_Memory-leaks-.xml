    <summary>On Tuesday, October 13th, 2015, Jonathan Toomim posted on bitcoin-dev asking if anyone had any guesses as to where memory was being leaked or what was using the additional 2.4 GB. He questioned whether there was a leak in the minrelaytxfee code path and asked if anyone else had seen something similar. Toomim had been using minrelaytxfee=0.00003 or something similar on his nodes.In response, someone suggested running it in valgrind with --leak-check=full for 10 minutes. They provided the command: "valgrind --leak-check=full src/bitcoind 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee out". This would show any memory leaks at exit. However, they noted that the leaks observed may just be design issues where cache can grow too much and when the cache is cleaned on shutdown, it wouldn't show up in the valgrind output.</summary>
