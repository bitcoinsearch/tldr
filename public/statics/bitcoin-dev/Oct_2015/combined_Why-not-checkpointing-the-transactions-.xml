    <summary>An experienced database engineer has questioned the workings of Bitcoin's architecture, specifically its transaction structure. The engineer notes that the new Bitshares 2.0 is changing its transaction structure to resemble that of relational database management systems (RDBMS), which have been using this method for over 30 years. The engineer suggests that Bitcoin networks replay every single transaction since the beginning and store that information on each core node, which is not efficient. Instead, the engineer recommends keeping a checkpointed state and only carrying new transactions. This way, the historical backup of all transactions could be left to "historical" nodes or collectors so that the network can operate with greater efficiency and speed.The developer has queried the Bitcoin mailing list about why the network must reply every single transaction since its inception instead of starting from a closer state with only new transactions. The developer believes that nodes could rely on a small working "transaction log" to provide transactional information from little PDAs on warehouses or relay information to satellites without storing every single historical transaction forever. Responders to the query have explained that the invalidation of transactions in a trustless system means that the whole blockchain is required to confirm validity. They suggest implementing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) to validate and download only the portions of the blockchain in which a user is interested.The engineer argues that if Bitcoin had a small transactional workload and left behind the overload of previous transactions, it could become an incredibly decentralized system that nobody could disrupt. Additionally, a very small ODBC, JDBC connector on the bitcoin client could allow traditional RDBMS systems to handle the heavy load and let bitcoin core rely on everyone at a level that no one could ever disrupt a very small amount of transactional data. However, the engineer emphasizes that these are just some thoughts and their intentions are the best as they continue to research Bitcoin code.</summary>
