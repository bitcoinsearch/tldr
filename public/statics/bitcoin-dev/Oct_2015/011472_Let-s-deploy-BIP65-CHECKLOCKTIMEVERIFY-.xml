    <summary>In an email exchange on October 7, 2015, Eric Lombrozo discussed the possibility of attacks on a new version of a cryptocurrency. He noted that a hashpower supermajority would make such attacks difficult to pull off, but even with a 99% supermajority, an attacker could still perform the attack once per day. The attack involves creating an invalid transaction according to new clients, which would sit in old clients' mempool until one of them mines a block.</summary>
