    <summary>Byron Gibson, from CoS and Mirrorx.com, asked if anyone is using simulators like Shadow or BTCSim to test proposed changes to Bitcoin. Gibson is interested in optimizing the ROI by selecting categories of experiments that benefit from a more controlled environment, rather than be invalidated by its divergence/s from livenet. Andrew Miller responded that he has been using shadow and thinks these simulators are important for testing but they have some limitations. Running shadow with Tor slows down the machine quite a bit, so the stats can't possibly be accurate. However, virtual time, which Shadow uses, is entirely decoupled from real time so it may slow down the machine but this would not affect the stats collected. Nina K also responded saying that running shadow w Tor is not as 'light' as presented and slows her own box down quite a bit.</summary>
