    <summary>In a signed message posted on the bitcoin-development mailing list, a user named Odinn talks about a protocol concept called ABIS that enables decentralization and expansion of a giving economy. The post also mentions some background information from 2013 and 2014 related to microdonations and incentives to run full nodes. Odinn points out that since that time, some new developments have come to light which the participants in that thread may find interesting, particularly a working implementation in BCN that is arguably viable in BTC as well. The post includes links to the previous discussions and the new development.</summary>
