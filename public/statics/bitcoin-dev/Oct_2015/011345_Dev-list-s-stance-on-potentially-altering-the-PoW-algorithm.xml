    <summary>In an email exchange between individuals discussing the feasibility of ASIC-resistance in cryptocurrencies, one person pointed out that the term was coined to promote certain altcoins and that building an ASIC for any kind of algorithm is possible in theory. However, it was noted that making it arbitrarily hard in practice is also possible. The other person responded by stating that ASIC-resistance is simply not possible and that they didn't say anything about memory-hard, which is a possible alternative. They further added that simple-to-implement-in-hardware pow algorithms are preferable to memory-hard ones.</summary>
