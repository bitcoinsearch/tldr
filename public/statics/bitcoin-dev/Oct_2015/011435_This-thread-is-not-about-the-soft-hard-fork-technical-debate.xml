    <summary>The copyright notice is a legal statement that identifies the owner of the copyright of a work. The notice must include the word "copyright," a "c" in a circle (Â©), the date of publication, and the name of either the author or the owner of all the copyright rights in the published work. If the legal owners are not properly identified then the notice is not valid. The use of the notice informs the public that a work is protected by copyright, identifies the copyright owner, and shows the year of first publication. Therefore, it is important to include a valid copyright notice to protect the rights of the owner of the work.</summary>
