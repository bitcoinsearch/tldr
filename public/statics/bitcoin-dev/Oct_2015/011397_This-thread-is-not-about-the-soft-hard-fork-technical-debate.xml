    <summary>On October 5, 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding CLTV deployment and Mike Hearn's involvement. Btc Drak challenged Tom Zander's assumption that Mike Hearn's actions had made CLTV deployment controversial. Tom Zander responded by stating that Mike Hearn's arguments had been refuted successfully. Despite this, Mike continued to misexplain things due to his motivation to disrupt Bitcoin in order to push for his blocksize hardfork. Tom Zander pointed out that this motivation was not related to soft-forks or CLTV, so it shouldn't be expected that Mike's position would change. Tom Zander also mentioned that Bitcoin Core claims to have a consensus mechanism and sticks to "no change" if consensus is not reached. He stated that bigger blocks were blocked for years as a result of this rule. However, he clarified that these were Mike's claims and not anyone else's.</summary>
