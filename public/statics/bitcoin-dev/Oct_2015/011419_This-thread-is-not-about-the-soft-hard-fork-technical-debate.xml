    <summary>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in October 2015, Tom Zander asked about the importance of only listening to regular contributors when it comes to a fork in the Bitcoin protocol. In response, Gregory Maxwell highlighted that there were no regulator contributors who disagreed with the current approach. However, Peter Todd emphasized that Bitcoin is not just a software project and decisions regarding its governance and evolution should be made by an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders from across the community.Todd suggested that the hard- vs soft-fork debate is not just a code maintenance issue, and that the current gridlock in Core could be used to encourage the growth of new forkwise-compatible implementations of the protocol. He also encouraged the initiative by Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn with BIP101 and Bitcoin XT as a possible model for coming to a consensus on hard-forking changes.</summary>
