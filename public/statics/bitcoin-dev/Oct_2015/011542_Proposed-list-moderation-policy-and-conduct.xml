    <summary>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeff Garzik stated that participants in discussions should disclose any potential conflicts of interest regarding employment or other projects they may be involved in. He also suggested that over-disclosure is better than under-disclosure when it comes to perceived conflicts of interest. Garzik went on to discuss the term "Bitcoin maximalist," which has become popular as an insult and refers to those who believe Bitcoin should be the only cryptocurrency in existence. He argues that anyone involved in Bitcoin development who is not a Bitcoin maximalist could have a potential conflict of interest if they work for a company that competes with Bitcoin. Garzik believes that user dissatisfaction with Bitcoin development may be due to a lack of trust in developers working towards the success of Bitcoin.</summary>
