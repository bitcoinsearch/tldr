    <summary>Facebook has a fork of LevelDB called RocksDB that is maintained. The API for RocksDB and LevelDB are nearly the same, so it may be easy to replace. However, RocksDB was optimized for large databases running on multiple cores, which could potentially have negative effects on the use-case. In light of this, Jeff Garzik started working on an implementation to replace LevelDB with SQLite as part of researching alternatives that are maintained and reliable. Although it builds, it still needs work before passing tests. It was noted that LevelDB is unmaintained.</summary>
