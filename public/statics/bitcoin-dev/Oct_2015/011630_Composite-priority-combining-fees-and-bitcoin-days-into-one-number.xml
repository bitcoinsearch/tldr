    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion on October 28, 2015, Jonathan Toomim argued that node policy must remain easy to modify/customize in a flexible manner. He added that simplifying other code in a way that makes the policy harder to configure is not a welcome change. Toomim further explained that making the code simpler could make custom policies (such as the current default) harder, and it is better to leave the main code less simple. He said that the only custom policy that this change would make harder to implement is the current default policy of 5% reserved space. Toomim suggested an API that is calibrated on the whole mempool, then has a method that takes transactions and returns priority scores. However, Luke Dashjr disagreed, stating that trying to communicate policies as simple numbers is significantly more complicated for the policy-writer than what they have now.</summary>
