    <summary>In September 2015, Mike Hearn expressed his objection to using a soft fork to implement a feature in Bitcoin due to the potential problems it could cause, including reduced reliability of SPV wallets during the rollout period. He suggested that making it a hard fork would eliminate this issue and result in his objection being dropped. However, he also acknowledged that there was no consensus on the matter and proposed two options - either dropping the idea of "everyone must agree to make changes" or doing nothing at all.Another individual agreed with Hearn's assessment that there was no consensus and emphasized the importance of reaching a meta-consensus on decisions within the Bitcoin community. They suggested that since the decision to Do nothing had been made regarding the blocksize, the same set of rules should be applied for all decisions going forward.</summary>
