    <summary>A Bitcoin Core developer, Venzen Khaosan, has challenged Mike Hearn to a public debate on the topic of Bitcoin. The debate will consist of three sessions of five minutes each, with two-minute breaks in between. Each speaker is allowed to make one statement in each session that does not exceed two minutes. The event will take place in a public venue with an international audience and an arbiter will be agreed upon. To protect himself from Hearn's "official" friends, the event will be unannounced and commence when Khaosan appears on an event panel. Khaosan believes he has the debating resources to show Hearn as an intellectual lightweight if he participates. Meanwhile, Paddy, another member of the Bitcoin development community, requests that such public debates should be kept off-list so that the mailing list can only focus on new developments in the community.</summary>
