    <summary>In an email exchange between Luke Dashjr and Jonathan Toomim, the topic of node policy in regards to modifying/customising it was discussed. Dashjr argued that simplifying code could make custom policies harder to implement, specifically the default policy of 5% reserved space. He suggested using an abstract API that is calibrated on the whole mempool and has a method for calculating priority scores for transactions. This would make it easier for someone to write a reserved-space algorithm within the priority API scheme.</summary>
