    <summary>On September 24, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan via bitcoin-dev announced some important dates for the development of Bitcoin Core's version 0.12. The post included a list of milestones to help guide developers during the development cycle. The first milestone was set for November 1, 2015, and included opening Transifex translations and a soft translation string freeze with no large or unnecessary changes. The second milestone was set for December 1, 2015, and included a feature freeze and translation string freeze. Additionally, there was a proposal to schedule a time window for merging big refactors, such as libconsensus, assuming it is ready according to the current plan. The proposed time windows were October 25-31 or November 1-7, and it was implicitly stated that big refactors should not be merged into version 0.12 outside of that window.</summary>
