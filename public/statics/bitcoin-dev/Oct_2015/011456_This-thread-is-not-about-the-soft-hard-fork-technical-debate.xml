    <summary>In this context, Sergio denies using any four-letter words on IRC and questions the trustworthiness of IRC IDs. He also requests Venzen to provide a link where an impostor said something to him in Sergio's name. Sergio expresses his skepticism towards the characters mentioned in the email and considers them as just regular people. He signs off with best regards.</summary>
