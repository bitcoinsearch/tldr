    <summary>Gregory Maxwell and Rusty Russell discussed the possibility of requiring a bit to be set during the soft fork activation period, allowing thin clients to reject blocks from non-upgraded miners. However, this proposal was deemed problematic as it would trigger warnings on older clients. Instead, they decided to leave the issue for now and focus on upgrading versionbits. Rusty opened a PullReq for the "keep setting bit until activation" proposal.</summary>
