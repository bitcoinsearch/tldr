    <summary>On October 5, 2015, a user named Peter R posted on the bitcoin-dev forum. In the post, Peter suggested that the current gridlock be used in reference to a topic being discussed. However, another user quickly responded with a message stating that there was no gridlock and any attempt to create one for political reasons would not be successful. The response was likely due to previous instances of misinformation being presented as fact without correction, prompting the user to state their objection clearly and firmly.</summary>
