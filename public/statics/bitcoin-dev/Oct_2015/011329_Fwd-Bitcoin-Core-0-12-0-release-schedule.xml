    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Marcel Jamin raised a question about why Bitcoin still exists. This is not a new question, as it was previously raised by others years ago. Originally, the "1.0" version of Bitcoin was a target for when the "client mode" as planned by Satoshi was implemented, making the Bitcoin Core implementation feature-complete for a minimum working/viable project. However, the version number is not so important and tends to generate a lot of discussion. Jamin suggests that perhaps they should just follow the example of emacs and go from 0.12 to 12.0 for the next version.</summary>
