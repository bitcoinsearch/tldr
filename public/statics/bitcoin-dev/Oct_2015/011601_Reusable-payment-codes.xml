    <summary>In an email exchange between Justus Ranvier and Luke Dashjr on October 22, 2015, Dashjr expressed concern about the "notification address" requirement in a proposal. This requirement entails address reuse and blockchain spam, as it forces the recipient to either leave the notification addresses unspent forever or spend them, which could potentially compromise their private key. Dashjr suggested making a single zero-value OP_RETURN output with two pushes instead, which would not use any space in the UTXO set and never need to be spent/mixed/dusted, while still being searchable with standard bloom filters or indexed with optimized algorithms.Ranvier stated that the notification transaction portion of the proposal was his least favorite, but he did not see any alternatives that would provide an unambiguous improvement, including Dashjr's suggestion. One of the most highly-weighted goals of this proposal was to be usable on as many mobile/light wallets as possible. Ranvier also noted that all existing platforms for balance querying index by address, so support for bloom filters or other querying methods is less comprehensive, meaning the set of wallets that can support payment codes would be smaller. However, Dashjr argued that software should be improved to support receiving with payment codes instead of designing BIPs around current software, especially when there is no benefit to doing so.</summary>
