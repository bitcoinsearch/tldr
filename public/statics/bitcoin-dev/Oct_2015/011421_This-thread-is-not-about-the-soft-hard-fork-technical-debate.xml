    <summary>In an email exchange on October 5th, 2015 between Gregory Maxwell and Peter R via bitcoin-dev, there was a discussion about "gridlock." Peter R had suggested to use the current gridlock, to which Maxwell replied that there was no gridlock and that any effort to manufacture one for political reasons would not be successful. The conversation ended with a comment from Russ stating that the discussion over the definition of "gridlock" was worthless.</summary>
