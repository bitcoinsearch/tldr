    <summary>In an email conversation on 22/10/15, Luke Dashjr expressed concerns about the "notification address" requirement of a proposal which would lead to blockchain spam and address reuse. He suggested using a single zero-value OP_RETURN output with two pushes instead. However, another member of the conversation pointed out that this proposal was designed to be usable on as many mobile/light wallets as possible, and bloom filters or other querying methods are not as comprehensive as indexing by address. The proposal was attached as a PGP signature file.</summary>
