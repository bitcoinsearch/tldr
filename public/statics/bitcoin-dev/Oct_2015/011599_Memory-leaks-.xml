    <summary>On October 22, 2015, Multipool Admin wrote an email stating that the bitcoind process was getting killed every few days when it reached approximately 55 GB of usage on their server. The email also suggested adding a cron job to restart bitcoind every day or two as a damage control mechanism until the issue was resolved. On October 21, 2015, Tom Zander via bitcoin-dev responded to Jonathan Toomim's claim that he had a memory usage issue on Linux but not on Mac OS X under a GBT workload in both situations. Tom Zander urged everyone to ensure they measure their memory usage correctly on Linux and provided a code snippet for measuring memory usage accurately.The email ends with information on how to unsubscribe from the group and access more options.</summary>
