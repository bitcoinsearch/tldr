    <summary>In an email conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Hearn discussed the definition of a "working" full node and how it relates to the upcoming softfork in the Bitcoin network. He defines a working node as one that verifies everything and believes that if a node starts skipping bits, then it is not really working according to its original design goals. However, he also states that assuming the hashrate majority has upgraded, both non-upgraded and upgraded nodes will converge on seeing "the most-work valid chain" and remain equally safe for transactions waiting for confirmations. Hearn agrees that hardforks are necessary and should be deployed as soon as possible to show their feasibility, but he still believes that softfork deployment is preferable in many cases like this. He suggests that bip99 proposes a likely uncontroversial hardfork alternative, but questions how a new script operand could be included via a hardfork.</summary>
