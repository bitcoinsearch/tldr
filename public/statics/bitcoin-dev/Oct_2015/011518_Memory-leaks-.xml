    <summary>The writer noticed that their running bitcoind processes were using 3+ GB of RAM despite the mempool being under control. However, the total memory usage wasn't recorded as bitcoind was restarted right after this observation. The newer versions have more accurate reporting of memory pool usage which reflects real memory usage. The accurate reporting includes size, bytes, and usage. PR #6410 implements accurate memory accounting for mempool.</summary>
