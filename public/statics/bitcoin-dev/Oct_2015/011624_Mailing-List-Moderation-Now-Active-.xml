    <summary>In this post, Gavin Andresen expresses his frustration with the moderation policy on an unknown platform. He states that the policy is already a disaster and expects his message to be rejected as well. Gavin points out that several messages from various individuals have already been rejected, including himself and Sergio Damian Lerner, who he refers to as his partner in crime. Other rejected messages include those discussing a bug, CLTV, censorship of technical discussion, and complaints about censorship. Gavin ends his post with a "WTF?" remark, indicating his confusion and disbelief at the situation.</summary>
