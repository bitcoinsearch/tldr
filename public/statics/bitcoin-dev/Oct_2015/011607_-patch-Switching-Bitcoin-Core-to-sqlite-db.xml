    <summary>The author of the context has been working on local key value stores in Java for an electrum server. They recommend considering LMDB, which is fast and reliable in their testing, but cannot be used on 32-bit systems that require over 2gb of storage due to memory mapping. Jeff Garzik, via the bitcoin-dev mailing list, has shared an implementation to replace leveldb with sqlite as leveldb is unmaintained. This implementation is still a work in progress and needs further testing. The purpose of researching alternatives to leveldb is to find maintained and reliable options.</summary>
