    <summary>In an email chain from October 2015, Luke Dashjr made a statement that BIPs should not be designed around current software. However, the author of the email disagrees with this statement and argues that version 1 payment codes are designed to be deployable by wallet implementers without requiring any network-level changes. The author points out that multi-push OP_RETURN outputs are not standard transactions, so any improvement to the protocol that requires this feature is not appropriate for version 1. The author suggests waiting until additional capabilities are deployed in the network to specify a version 2 payment code that uses those features and encourages users to upgrade.</summary>
