    <title>Dev-list's stance on potentially altering the PoW algorithm</title>

    <summary>The email conversation between Daniele Pinna and Adam Back discusses the proposal of an asymmetric memory-hard PoW through a recently published paper. The paper proposes an algorithm that guarantees protection from ASIC/FPGA optimization. The email thread also mentions the limitations of the Cuckoo cycle algorithm, which has been improved upon by the proposed algorithm. However, there are papers demonstrating that protection from ASIC/FPGA optimization is impossible. The email discussion raises questions about the stance of core devs on potentially altering the bitcoin PoW protocol. It is also noted that a novel optimization-resistant algorithm could greatly improve decentralization in the bitcoin network due to a resurgence of desktop/cellphone mining.</summary>
