    <summary>On October 5th, 2015, Peter R expressed his agreement with Mike that Core's requirement for unanimous consensus results in development gridlock and should be revisited. However, a response was made stating that there is no development gridlock, as evidenced by the IRC logs for core-dev, pull requests, and merge history demonstrating a vibrant development community with active developers. The responder accuses Peter R of manufacturing a crisis to fit his narrative and warns against intellectual dishonesty and toxicity in their discourse.</summary>
