    <summary>In a conversation between Wladimir J. van der Laan and Marcel Jamin, the topic of the Bitcoin protocol's version numbering was discussed. Jamin mentioned that the companies building on top of Bitcoin, along with its $3.5 billion market cap, suggest that the 1.0.0 tag is overdue. Van der Laan responded by pointing out that most of the investment in Bitcoin is not in the Bitcoin Core software. When Jamin suggested using version numbers as a signaling mechanism, Van der Laan explained that they don't currently use the numbers as a signaling mechanism, but rather just count up every half year. When asked why the block/transaction versions are at v3/v1 respectively, and the highest network protocol version is 70011, Van der Laan explained that it's mostly due to not using the numbers as a signaling mechanism, and the potential arguments that would arise from considering whether the software is mature enough to be called 1.0.0.</summary>
