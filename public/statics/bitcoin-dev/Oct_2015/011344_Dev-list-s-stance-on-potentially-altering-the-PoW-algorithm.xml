    <summary>The context highlights the fallacy of "all-or-nothing" thinking, which is commonly observed in the Core camp. The author criticizes the use of the term "ASIC-resistance," which has been coined to promote certain altcoins. They argue that the fact that ASICs can be built for any algorithm in theory does not mean that it cannot be made arbitrarily hard in practice.The author suggests that the arrogance of the Core camp should be toned down since it is possible to make an algorithm arbitrary hard to crack.</summary>
