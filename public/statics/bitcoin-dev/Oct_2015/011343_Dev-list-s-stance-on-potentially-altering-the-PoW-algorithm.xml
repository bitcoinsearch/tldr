    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in 2015, Daniele Pinna pointed out BIP99's proposal for anti-miner hardforks. Jorge Tim√≥n responded by stating that it is impossible to guarantee protection from ASIC/FPGA optimization since specialized hardware can always be more efficient. However, BIP99 takes into account the possibility of "anti-miner hardforks" to restart the ASIC and mining market in case mining becomes too centralized. The term "ASIC-resistance" was also criticized as an absurd term coined to promote some altcoins.</summary>
