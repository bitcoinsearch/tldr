    <summary>In a mailing list discussion, Sergio Demian Lerner challenges the assumption that Mike Hearn's actions in creating controversy around CLTV deployment are disruptive. He argues that ISM has consensus and history shows it works, with miners having accepted it for past softfork rollouts. Simply making noise does not make something controversial; when it is, it is obvious. Lerner goes on to state that Hearn's intention is to criticize the informal governance model of Bitcoin Core development and has strategically pushed the discussion to a dead-end where the group must either ignore him, which violates the established criteria that all technical objections coming from anyone must be addressed until that person agrees or responds to his objections one after the other, bringing the project to a standstill. Lerner believes that Hearn has won this battle and that having a more formal decision-making process may not be too bad for Bitcoin, maybe it can actually be good.</summary>
