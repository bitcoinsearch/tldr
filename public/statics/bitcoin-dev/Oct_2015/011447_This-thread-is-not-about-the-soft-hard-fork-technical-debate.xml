    <summary>The message is a response to Sergio Demian Lerner's post on Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The author of the message accuses Lerner, along with Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, of breaching consensus in the community. The author claims that Hearn has a history of opposing consensus and argues that his intentions are not what Lerner perceives them to be. He further criticizes Lerner for not having an issue with Hearn's actions and suggests that this speaks poorly of him. The author also criticizes Hearn's bitcoinj code and claims that it disregards protocol policy. Additionally, the author accuses Hearn of harming the public while he worked for the NSA and lacking a fundamental understanding of open source methodology and ideology. The author concludes by suggesting that Lerner should not speak for someone else and should instead speak for himself.</summary>
