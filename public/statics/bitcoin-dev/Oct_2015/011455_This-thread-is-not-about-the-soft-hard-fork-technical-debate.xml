    <summary>The email conversation between Milly Bitcoin and Russ discusses the copyright notice of Bitcoin's code. Milly Bitcoin argues that the "copyright notice refers to the fact that each contributor owns copyright to his own contributions." However, Russ disagrees with Milly's argument and explains that the legal owner is identified by the "c" in a circle (Â©). He further adds that if the legal owners are not properly identified then the notice is not valid. In support of his argument, Russ cites Nolo and USPTO sources which explain what a valid copyright notice should contain.The email conversation indicates that version tracking software such as Git or CVS is used for tracking contributions of individuals who may have made any changes to the code. The purpose of these tools is to identify contributors who have made specific changes to the code. The email conversation does not provide much detail on Bitcoin itself, rather it focuses on the copyright notice of Bitcoin's code and how it should be correctly displayed.</summary>
