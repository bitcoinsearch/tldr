    <summary>The debate on whether or not to implement BIP65 in Bitcoin has caused discord among community members. However, a solution has been proposed that can satisfy both sides. By imposing additional constraints on transaction validation, transactions made in a specific way will always look valid to non-CLTVers but will not be valid for CLTVers unless the CLTV rules are followed. This way, both versions can run alongside each other, and people can switch back and forth between them as much as they like. SPV clients can choose to connect only to nodes that are non-CLTV. Some people have expressed disappointment and frustration with the childish behavior and name-calling in the discussion. Despite this, there is hope for harmony if everyone works together.</summary>
