    <summary>On October 19th, 2015, Christian Decker proposed a solution to the issue of transaction malleability in Bitcoin. The proposal involved computing the normalized transaction ID and adding it to the UTXO when storing the coin state. However, the proposal was not a complete solution to the problem of malleability and Decker suggested including flags in the UTXO-creating transaction to specify which parts of the signature would be covered. This would allow for fully malleability-proof wallets. Additionally, there was discussion around how to refactor common functionality into reusable blocks and how to annotate incoming transactions with their normalized inputs. Luke also noted that non-VERIFY is not possible as a softfork without doing a second/new P2SH since it can be negated.</summary>
