    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Steven Pine accused Mike of being a "concern troll" and a bully. Milly Bitcoin, another participant in the thread, criticized the use of the term "troll" as unprofessional. She suggested using the word "cultist" instead. The term "concern troll" is often used to describe someone who pretends to be concerned about an issue in order to disrupt a conversation or promote their own agenda. Meanwhile, "troll" is a term often used to describe someone who deliberately posts inflammatory comments online in order to provoke a reaction from others.</summary>
