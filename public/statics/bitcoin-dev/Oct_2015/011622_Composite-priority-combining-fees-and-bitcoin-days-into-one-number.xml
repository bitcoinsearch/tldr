    <summary>The process of assigning block space based on bitcoin-days destroyed (BDD) and fees has been criticized due to the need for two code paths, making it harder to write and maintain. One alternative proposed is eliminating BDD priority altogether, but a new idea suggests creating a conversion rate between BDD and fees to create a composite priority metric. The equation sum(fees) = sum(BDD) * conversionRate * BDDweight would be used to calculate the conversion rate, with the relative weight of BDD vs fees set by policy statement from the command line. To optimize the process, the sum of the mempool fees and BDD would be stored and updated as transactions enter or leave the mempool, with recalculations occurring when a new block is found to minimize drift.</summary>
