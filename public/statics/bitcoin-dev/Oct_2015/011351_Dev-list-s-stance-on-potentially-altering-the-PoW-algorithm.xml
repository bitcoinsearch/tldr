    <summary>In an email to bitcoin-dev, Daniele Pinna references a recently published paper that discusses the Cuckoo cycle algorithm and its limitations. The paper proposes a new algorithm that greatly improves upon it. However, Pinna notes that the paper analyzed an old version of the Cuckoo cycle paper and their analysis is not applicable to the most recent revision. Pinna further comments on the functions of this class on Reddit. He believes that changing the proof-of-work (POW) function is not impossible in principle but expects it would only happen due to problems with the composition of current hash-power and not even if it were universally agreed that some other construction was technically better.</summary>
