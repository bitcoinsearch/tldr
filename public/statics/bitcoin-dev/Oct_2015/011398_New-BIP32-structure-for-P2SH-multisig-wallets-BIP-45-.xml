    <title>New BIP32 structure for P2SH multisig wallets [BIP-45]</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange dated October 5, 2015, Jean-Pierre Rupp expressed concern about a privacy issue in BIP-45. He stated that if the same extended public key is used for all multi-signature activity and different cosigners are dealing with separate multi-signature accounts, then reuse of the same set of public keys means that all cosigners from all accounts will be able to monitor multi-signature activity from every other cosigner, in every other account. Matias Alejo Garcia responded to this email thread, stating that he was not completely sure what Rupp meant by "account" and "multi-signature activity." Garcia explained that according to BIP45, a signing party needs the extended public keys of all the other parties in order to generate a wallet address, but each party will be able to see the transaction history of the wallet they are sharing. However, if the party has other wallets with other copayers, the xpub should be completely different. The email exchange took place through BitPay.com.</summary>
