    <summary>In a recent post on bitcoin-dev, Peter Todd expressed his belief that while nSequence is the neatest and most straightforward way to implement a certain feature, they have not done a good job of showing why it needs to be implemented via nSequence. He also notes that he is not aware of any other proposals for its use, even in vague terms, and that much of nSequence has already been reserved for future use by BIP68. Rusty responds by suggesting that if they apply infinite caution, they could never use nSequence because there might be a better use for it in the future.</summary>
