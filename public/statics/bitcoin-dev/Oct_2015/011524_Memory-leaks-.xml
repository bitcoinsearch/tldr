    <summary>The email thread is related to the issue of memory leaks in Bitcoin. A member named Jonathan Toomim asked if anybody had any guesses on where memory could be leaking or what was using an additional 2.4GB. Tom Zander suggested running it in valgrind with --leak-check=full for 10 minutes to check any memory leaks at exit. Some members have been using a minrelaytxfee of 0.00003 or similar on their nodes, and maybe there's a leak in the minrelaytxfee code path. Mike Hearn added that leaks are not the only explanation possible; caches and fragmentation can also give this sort of effect. However, the tools to debug this aren't great, but you could try a build with tcmalloc and use it to investigate heap stats. In response to Mr. Hearn's threats to "ban people" based on their preferences, suggestions, or characterizations of his chosen software project, another member stated that he doesn't own the list and has very little to say on this matter at this stage. He was warned that trolling like a 3-year-old will get him swiftly banned. The member's email signature included a link to abis.io, which is a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy and a new social good.</summary>
