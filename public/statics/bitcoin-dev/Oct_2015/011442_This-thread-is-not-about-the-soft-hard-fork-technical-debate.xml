    <summary>The email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Tom Zander on October 5, 2015, discussed the issue of listening to contributors in regards to a fork in the Bitcoin protocol. Maxwell provided perspective and scope on the topic and asked Zander what element of the responses suggested that anyone was not being listened to. However, some members of the community felt that those against the soft fork were not being listened to because an alternative or remedy was not even considered. The actions showed a disregard for the many objections, and consensus could only be reached by both sides reaching a middle ground. The email also raised questions about why using a hard fork with proper voting was so bad compared to a soft fork. Furthermore, Maxwell warned that if the Core team forced a soft fork, many active players in the Bitcoin marketplace might see them as no longer being allies. He concluded by saying that Bitcoin would still go on.</summary>
