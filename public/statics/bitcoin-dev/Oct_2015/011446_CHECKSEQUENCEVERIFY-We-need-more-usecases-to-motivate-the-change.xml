    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach suggests that decreasing granularity is a soft-fork, whereas increasing it is a hard-fork. He decides to keep the highest possible precision with the expectation of decreasing granularity in the future if required. Peter Todd suggests that this should be written up in the BIP along with a description of how to go about the upgrade, as increasing precision for everyone would break compatibility too much to be practical.</summary>
