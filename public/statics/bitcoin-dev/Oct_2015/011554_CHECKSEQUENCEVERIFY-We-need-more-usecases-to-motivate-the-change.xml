    <summary>The email thread discusses the use of nSequence in BIP 68 and the possibility of using 16 bits for sequence numbers in both block and time versions, leaving 14 bits for future soft forks. Rusty Russell mentions three other proposals for nSequence, including discouraging miners from reorging chains and using it for proof-of-stake blocksize voting. The BIP text needs to be updated, but the discussed change was added to the PR. The new specification removes ambiguity and uses 512 seconds granularity within the context of the 10 minute block target. Adam Back raises concerns about the block interval changing from 10 minutes and suggests that if orphan rates remain low with 1 minute blocks, the locktime granularity would need to be coarse relative to the block interval.</summary>
