    <summary>In an email thread on October 5th, 2015, Tom Zander responded to a previous message and suggested that the discussion should focus on the topic, rather than attacking individuals. Another participant in the thread responded by pointing out that some members of the group have made ad hominem attacks against others, such as suggesting that their opinions have less merit due to insufficient volunteer time spent on Bitcoin or lack of certain software development experience. The responder stated that everyone would benefit from calling out this type of behavior, and that corrections are best received from someone who agrees with the person being corrected. The responder then clarified that they were not complaining about anyone in particular, but rather pointing out that attacking a strawman argument is not productive in discussions. They went on to explain how one member had argued that certain criteria existed when it did not, and they were explaining why this was not a valid comparison. They enumerated specific reasons for the differences between the situations being discussed. Finally, they acknowledged that communication can be difficult, but that they were willing to continue clarifying their position off-list if necessary.</summary>
