    <summary>In an email conversation, Clément Elbaz raised concerns about the consequences of a soft fork in Bitcoin that could lead to critical problems for financial software. He explained that while some transactions may be meaningless to an individual, they may hold importance for people using upgraded Bitcoin software. During a soft fork, it's possible to miss the meaning of a transaction and thus calculate an inaccurate balance of a wallet. The ability to calculate balances of wallets that aren't yours is important in determining the accurate balance of a wallet in a broad sense. Elbaz also mentioned that nothing prevents people from sending transactions of a new type, which can lead to the problem of not being able to "opt out" of the issue. It raises the question of why anyone would pay to a scriptPubKey they don't understand. Elbaz compared this to paying bills with cash buried in a park instead of informing the provider, which would likely result in the payment being rejected.</summary>
