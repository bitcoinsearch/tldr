    <summary>A member of the bitcoin community wrote a script to test how often transactions follow bip69, a standard that specifies how inputs and outputs should be ordered in a transaction. The test showed that only 42% of all transactions would accidentally be bip69 when randomized, indicating that randomization is currently more popular than bip69. However, the writer notes that with more inputs and outputs, bip69 can be determined with high confidence. Additionally, if clustering a wallet, it is easy to determine how the wallet behaves with respect to bip6. Gregory Maxwell responded to the original post, stating that randomly ordered two-input transactions have a 50% chance of following bip-69, making the reported 60% adherence to bip69 a small minority.</summary>
