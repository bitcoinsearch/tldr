    <summary>This proposal suggests a URI scheme that allows for backward compatibility with both native segwit (bech32) wallets and legacy wallets (base58). The BIP is an adaptation of the earlier BIP 0021 by Nils Schneider and Matt Corallo. The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable easy payments from any wallet, without hindering backward compatibility as a barrier to segwit adoption. This BIP allows a merchant to preferentially receive payments to a bech32 address while still allowing older clients to make base58 encoded payments. The specification includes Query Keys such as 'addr', which specifies an alternative bitcoin destination that is preferred over the "bitcoinaddress" field of the URL. A simpler syntax for this scheme is bitcoin:[?amount=][?label=][?message=][?addr=]. An example provided in the proposal demonstrates how the address can be used along with the preferred bitcoin destination.There are no reference implementations yet available for Bitcoin clients.</summary>
