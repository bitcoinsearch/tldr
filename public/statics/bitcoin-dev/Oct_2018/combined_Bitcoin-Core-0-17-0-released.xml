    <summary>Bitcoin Core, a software used to mine and operate with bitcoin, has recently released version 0.17.0 for multiple operating systems and platforms. The update offers new features such as dynamic loading and creation of wallets, the addition of a new RPC command called "assumesvalid," and the inclusion of a new wallet format called descriptors. Additionally, the 'account' API has been replaced with the 'label' API, and compatibility with BIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions support has been added. Furthermore, the latest version includes several new RPCs and features, including PSBT-related RPCs that provide a more flexible way to create, sign, and broadcast transactions through Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT). However, upgrading from version 0.13.0 or older may result in memory blow-up during the roll-back of blocks to the SegWit activation point, and the GUI may suffer from visual glitches in the new MacOS dark mode.Bitcoin Core version 0.16.1 has also been released to fix more than 20 bugs and vulnerabilities in the software, including CVE-2018-12356 and CVE-2018-12357. Additionally, low-level RPC changes have been made, such as `scantxoutset` being used to scan the UTXO set for entries that match certain output descriptors, and `createrawtransaction` now accepting an array or dictionary for the `outputs` parameter.Moreover, Bitcoin Core developers have released version 0.16.3, which includes a fix for a denial-of-service vulnerability discovered in the code. The vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to crash a network node by flooding it with duplicate transactions. The update also includes a list of individuals who contributed to the project, including translators on Transifex.The Bitcoin Core team has been working on numerous improvements to the software, including updates to build systems, tests and QA, bug fixes, changes to the options dialog, peer table, and send coins dialog, and enhancements to performance. The software is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported). However, upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.Lastly, the release includes improved logging tools such as debug.log which provides anchor points for debugging p2p_sendheaders, and the removal of the `-blockmaxsize` option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes. Python 2 support has also been discontinued for all test files and tools, and improvements have been made to block and transaction handling. Documentation changes include various improvements and updates to Unix documentation, explaining how to update chainTxData in the release process, and documenting a method for reviewers to verify chainTxData.</summary>
