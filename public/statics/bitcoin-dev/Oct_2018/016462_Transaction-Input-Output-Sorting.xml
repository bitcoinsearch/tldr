    <summary>Chris Belcher, a member of the Bitcoin development community, expressed gratitude for bringing attention to an important topic in an email discussion on October 24, 2018. According to bip-69 statistics provided by https://p2sh.info/dashboard/db/bip-69-stats, it was found that around 60% of transactions follow bip-69, but this may be due to chance. A transaction has a 50% chance of following bip-69 if it has two inputs ordered randomly. Therefore, the percentage of transactions following bip-69 appears to be a small minority.</summary>
