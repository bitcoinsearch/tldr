    <summary>A website, p2sh.info/dashboard/db/bip-69-stats, claims that about 60% of transaction follow bip69. A suggestion has been made to create a bitcoin wiki page to track wallets that use bip69. With this information, it would be easier to determine which open source wallets can have code written for them and which closed source wallets can be bugged about bip69. Ryan Havar expresses concerns about the fungibility of bitcoin in an email conversation. He worries about the reliance on blockchain analysis and centralized analytics services which could harm the value and history of bitcoin.</summary>
