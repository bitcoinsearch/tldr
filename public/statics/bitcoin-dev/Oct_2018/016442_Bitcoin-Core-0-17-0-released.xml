    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.17.0 has been released with various new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. The update includes the option to limit block storage and set different options for different networks through a single configuration file. Additionally, the 'account' API has been replaced with the 'label' API and compatibility with BIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions support has been added. However, upgrading from version 0.13.0 or older currently results in memory blow-up during the roll-back of blocks to the SegWit activation point and the GUI suffers from visual glitches in the new MacOS dark mode.BIP174 is an interchange format for Bitcoin transactions that are not fully signed yet, along with relevant metadata to help entities work towards signing it. RPCs such as `converttopsbt`, `createpsbt`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, `walletprocesspsbt`, `finalizepsbt`, `combinepsbt`, and `decodepsbt` aid in this process. Other changes in the update include the introduction of new thread safety annotations, Clang compile-time checking, and enhancements to performance.The release of Bitcoin Core version 0.17.0 brings several changes to the software, including the removal of the `-blockmaxsize` option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes, Python 2 support being discontinued for all test files and tools, and improvements to block and transaction handling. The upgrade also introduces the option to specify the directory for the blocks storage and specialized double-SHA256 with 64-byte inputs with SSE4.1 and AVX2. Accounts have been deprecated in favor of labels, and additional log prints have been added for easier debugging.The Bitcoin Core team has made numerous improvements to the software during the last few months, including updates related to build systems, tests and QA, bug fixes, changes to the options dialog, peer table, and send coins dialog to improve readability, and improvements to performance. The Bitcoin Core team has also submitted over 50 patches in its latest code review, including fixes for bugs found within the software as well as updates to the testing framework.Bitcoin Core version 0.17.1 has been released with various changes and improvements, including preventing shared conf files from failing with different available options in different binaries, checking for AVX2 code, as well as AVX, XSAVE, and OS support. Documentation changes include various improvements and updates to UNIX documentation, explaining how to update chainTxData in release process, and documenting a method for reviewers to verify chainTxData. The new version includes credit to everyone who directly contributed to this release.The Bitcoin Core team has also released version 0.16.3 which includes a fix for a denial-of-service vulnerability discovered in the code. The vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to crash a network node by flooding it with duplicate transactions. The update also includes a list of individuals who contributed to the project, including translators on Transifex.</summary>
