    <summary>The author of a BIP proposal is considering using the shortest possible encoding, such as a single letter "a", to reduce the byte size required for a QR code. However, they acknowledge that using "address" may be more self-explanatory. They plan to include sample QR code sizes for typical use cases to determine feasibility. To avoid difficulties with multiple keys of the same name in many wallets, the author suggests using a delimiter instead. They plan to update the BIP proposal and send it again.</summary>
