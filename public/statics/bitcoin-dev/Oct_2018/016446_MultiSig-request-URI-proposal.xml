    <summary>The context discusses an idea proposed by おのかちお via bitcoin-dev mailing list for a new URI scheme that would allow for multisig requests from website to user's local wallet. The proposed URI scheme is "bitcoin-sigreq://{{rawtx}}?{{param}}" and includes the raw transaction encoded in base64, as well as parameters such as the public key for sign key pair and the path for HD wallet position. However, the context also highlights potential issues with using a URI scheme for two-way communication in the context of on-chain multisig transactions, which require multiple parties to provide signatures and one party to aggregate and publish the transaction. While BIP72 allows for callbacks to be included in the URI, it was designed for one-way communication and may not be suited for two-way communication. The author suggests finding a different method that is better suited for this purpose instead of limiting oneself to the URI system.</summary>
