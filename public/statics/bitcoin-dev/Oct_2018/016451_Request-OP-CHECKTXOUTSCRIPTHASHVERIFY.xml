    <summary>In a conversation between Kim Juan and ZmnSCPxj, the possibility of a new opcode for the Bitcoin scripting system, OP_CHECKTXOUTSCRIPTHASHVERIFY, was discussed. The opcode would allow a transaction output to only be spendable in a predefined manner, potentially mitigating key loss risk. However, there are issues with covenants and vaults being visible on-chain and requiring complex script templates, making them heavy in terms of block space. Additionally, recent efforts have been towards making contract execution off-chain. ZmnSCPxj proposed an improvement to the specification of OP_CHECKTXOUTSCRIPTHASHVERIFY and noted that plans for future SCRIPT updates will generally involve only future SegWit versions. The conversation also touched on possible use cases for the opcode and potential privacy concerns.</summary>
