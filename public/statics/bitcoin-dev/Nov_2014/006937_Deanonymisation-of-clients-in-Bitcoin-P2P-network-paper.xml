    <summary>The severity of the Tor/Bitcoin issue has been acknowledged, but there is no need to criticize Bitcoin's financial privacy characteristics. Rather, Bitcoin can be a useful tool in improving privacy strategies, but it should not be considered a complete solution. Many of the issues associated with this context can be traced back to known deficiencies in Tor. However, Bitcoin magnifies these deficiencies and makes them more measurable, which can benefit both projects. The attack vector described here is relevant for non-dual-stack nodes as well. An attacker can try to kick users from all Tor exit nodes they do not control and proceed with other attacks when a large number of Tor-only users connect through their Tor exit node(s). Therefore, measurements have been taken to improve the DoS handling of Bitcoin when connected to Tor.</summary>
