    <summary>In a message to Peter Todd, Tamas Blummer expressed his opinion that writing bug-for-bug compatible code with Satoshi is almost impossible. Blummer believes that the aim of BIP62 is noble, but increasing the complexity of the code by adding features such as soft-fork-ready versioning does not feel right. Instead, he suggests freezing the consensus code and studying its bugs, which could lead to defining a hard fork or a better chain to migrate to, as discussed by Blockstream.</summary>
