    <summary>In an email exchange on November 8, 2014, Daniel F provides some guidelines for the storage, RAM, and bandwidth resources needed to run a full node. He states that currently, the disk usage is about 30GB for the blockchain data and it will only keep growing slowly. He suggests assuming 10GB growth per year and recommends providing a disk of 50GB. As for CPU usage, he believes there won't be any after syncing the blockchain. However, after running for a few months, his node gets up to using 1.5GB of RAM. In terms of bandwidth usage, Daniel's node averages about 500GB of traffic per month, most of it outgoing. Overall, these guidelines provide a rough idea of what can be expected for running a full node.</summary>
