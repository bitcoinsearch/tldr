    <summary>A draft BIP has been created to add auxiliary headers to Bitcoin in a bandwidth efficient way. The overhead per auxiliary header is around 104 bytes, which is much smaller than embedding the hash of the header in the coinbase of the block. The proposal is a soft fork that uses the last transaction in the block to store the hash of the auxiliary header. This is possible because the last transaction in the block has a much less complex Merkle branch than the other transactions. The full details of the proposal can be found on the GitHub page provided in the context.</summary>
