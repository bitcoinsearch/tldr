    <summary>Daniel has provided rough guidelines for the storage, RAM and bandwidth resources required to run a full node. According to his statistics, the disk usage is currently around 30GB for blockchain data and will keep growing gradually. CPU usage is not a problem once the blockchain is synced. The RAM usage after a few months of operation is approximately 1.5GB. Bandwidth usage averages about 500GB of traffic per month, mostly outgoing. These guidelines should give Francis a rough idea of what to expect when running a full node.</summary>
