    <summary>On November 4, 2014, Pieter Wuille suggested a solution to a problem related to applying rules on every transaction with nVersion greater than or equal to 3. Luke's suggestion was to not apply this rule on every transaction, which solved the issue. Pieter believed that this solution could be generalized by making the non-mandatory BIP62 rules only applicable to transactions with strict nVersion==3 and not higher ones. Gavin Andresen agreed with Pieter's proposal, stating that soft-forking is a useful way of rolling out upgrades and should not be prohibited.</summary>
