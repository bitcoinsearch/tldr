    <summary>During a discussion, it was suggested that not everything should be exposed as a library. Instead, specialized utility libraries would serve the purpose better, especially for wallet- or user interface-related functionality. This recommendation was made to ensure that unnecessary information is not shared and only relevant data is presented. Wladimir, in a response to Mem Wallet's inquiry regarding the goal of 3rd party development of Bitcoin related services and tools, stated that the plan is to provide the consensus functionality as a library, where essential parts that make Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be made available. However, there is no intention to expose everything as a library. Wladimir further explained that specialized utility libraries would fill this purpose better and referenced https://github.com/bitcoin/libbase58 for base58 processing.Meanwhile, a different project broke out stealth and coinjoin as distinct repositories and made them installable using npm. In an email conversation between Btc Drak and Oliver Egginger, they discussed C libraries for blockchain analysis. Egginger asked for a C library for his research project involving block chain analysis and provided a link to picocoin's library. Drak suggested MatthewLM's cbitcoin as an alternative option. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, signed off the email thread with his contact information and work affiliation at BitPay Inc.The libbitcoin_common.a library has two minor observations: DecodeBase58Check is listed as inline in the header but is not actually inlined, and the hierarchy of tools within the library is poor/weak. It raises questions about whether there is an intention to strengthen and hierarchicalize the various internal libraries such that they would be suitable for third-party development of bitcoin-related services and tools.In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Mem Wallet asked if the internal libraries of Bitcoin could be made suitable for third-party development of Bitcoin-related services and tools. In response, Wladimir stated that the plan is to provide consensus functionality as a library, starting with a basic transaction/script verifier in version 0.10. There are also plans to add a library for transaction signing, but not everything will be exposed as a library, particularly wallet- or user interface related functionality.An off-topic question was also raised regarding the use of picocoin for blockchain analysis, with Oliver seeking opinions on its limitations. The message concludes with links to Abis.io, which is a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and a new social good.</summary>
