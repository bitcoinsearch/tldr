    <summary>In response to a question from Mem Wallet, Wladimir explains that the plan is to provide consensus functionality as a library, starting with a basic transaction/script verifier in version 0.10. He expects this to be extended to further utxo set management in future versions, but no API has been worked out for that yet. There are also plans to add a library for transaction signing. However, Wladimir clarifies that not everything will be exposed as a library, particularly wallet- or user interface related functionality. Specialized utility libraries would fill this purpose better. One such example is libbase58 for base58 processing, which can be found on GitHub.</summary>
