    <summary>In a conversation on the Bitcoin developers' IRC channel in 2014, Jorge Timón stated that he did not know of any use cases for larger OP_RETURN sizes. However, he later expressed irritation that the size had been reduced to 40 bytes, as he had an application where he wanted to put ECDSA in signatures in the OP_RETURN, which would require at least 64 bytes. Despite not being able to remember what the application was, Timón argues that it is not an unreasonable use case and could be used to send a payment with a signature, timestamped in the blockchain.</summary>
