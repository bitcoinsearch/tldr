    <summary>In an email conversation from November 7, 2014, Tamas Blummer asked Peter Todd if he saw any chance for forking to work best with a freeze of the consensus code. Peter responded that the consensus code is essentially frozen and any changes introduced would be due to a mistake rather than intentional. However, he did mention two serious soft-fork proposals in the air: Pieter Wuilleâ€™s BIP62 and his CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Despite these proposals, dealing with proposed changes in an environment where competing implementations use essentially the same consensus-critical code is much easier on both a technical and political level.</summary>
