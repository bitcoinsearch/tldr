    <summary>In a discussion among developers on Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, Peter Todd expressed skepticism about choosing the nVersion==3 for blocks and transactions. Jeff Garzik agreed with the concern, stating that he prefers to disconnect block version and transaction version. Pieter Wuille remarked that he sees consensus rules as one set of rules, but has no strong opinion about it and is fine with using nVersion==2 for transactions. They also discussed the possibility of introducing two different new tx version numbers in a single soft-fork in the future, and how transactions can be verified for correctness in a stand-alone fashion outside a block.</summary>
