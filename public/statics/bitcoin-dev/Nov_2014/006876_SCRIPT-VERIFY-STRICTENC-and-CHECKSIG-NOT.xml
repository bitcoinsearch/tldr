    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, posted on November 6th, 2014 about an invalid transaction that git head would accept into the mempool. The transaction in question spends the redeemScript: CHECKSIG NOT. Additionally, he mentioned that Bitcoin-Ruby has forked yet again. Another user responded by asking for clarification and pointing out that a webbtc node had just received a block, questioning if this change would cause a fork. No further information was provided on the topic.</summary>
