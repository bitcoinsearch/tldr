    <summary>A message signed with PGP SHA512 format and sent by Odinn contains a link to a discussion on the Cypherpunks mailing list about an attack that could be used to de-anonymize clients on the bitcoin network. According to Jeff Garzik, it relies on several conditions, such as kicking the machine off Tor, assuming that it will fall back to non-Tor. This is only valid for dual-stack nodes, which are not entirely anonymous. Jean-Paul Kogelman asks how many of these issues have already been addressed and provides a link to a paper from the University of Luxembourg on the subject. The core devs were contacted before publication of the paper. The email also includes links to download BIRT iHub F-Type, a free enterprise-grade BIRT server from Actuate. Additionally, it provides links to the Bitcoin-development mailing list and Odinn's website, which describes a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and a new social good.</summary>
