    <summary>The email conversation is about a problem with executing genuid.sh after compiling Bitcoin core on Debian 7. The user, Francis GASCHET, encountered an error message that says "too many arguments" and shared a solution to fix it by modifying the genbuild.sh file. In response, Wladimir acknowledged the solution and informed Francis that there is already an existing issue for this problem on Github. However, he mentioned that Rebroad's solution contains a new error and will merge Francis' patch instead.</summary>
