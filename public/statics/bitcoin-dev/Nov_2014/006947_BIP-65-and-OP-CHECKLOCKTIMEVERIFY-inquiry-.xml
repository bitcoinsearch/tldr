    <summary>The author of the email is questioning the use of BIP 65 and the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. They suggest a new approach that would push an OP_TRUE or OP_FALSE onto the stack using an OP_CHECKLOCKTIME instead of relying on nLockTime in a transaction. This would allow for multiple OP_CHECKLOCKTIME conditions to be included in a single script and could create interesting and complicated scripts based on block height and/or block timestamp. The author notes that it is trivial to emulate OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY using OP_CHECKLOCKTIME OP_VERIFY sequence. The email was sent by Richard Moore, founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc. Contact information can be found at the end of the email.</summary>
