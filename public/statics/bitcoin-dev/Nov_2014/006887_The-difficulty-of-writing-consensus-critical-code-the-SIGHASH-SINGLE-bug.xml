    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, explained that hard-forking upgrades of protocols are not done regularly even when there are no consensus problems to worry about. He stated that flag days are rare in engineering and for good reason. Bitcoin has extra consensus requirements which make the necessity of fixing bugs greater. There are two general ways to fix bugs: either as part of a controlled, planned, and managed process, or as a response to an immediate disaster. The alternative to scheduling and planning necessary upgrades to fix bugs in the protocol is to wait for a crisis and apply a bandaid solution. Todd believes that the latter method is not effective and fixing bugs should be done through a planned process. He questions who benefits from not fixing bugs in Bitcoin. In the message, Todd also provides a link to a video on how to use email encryption to support online privacy.</summary>
