    <summary>Tom Harding, a developer from California, proposed a solution to improve the reliability of unconfirmed transactions on the bitcoin network. The proposal involves a new section called "Confidence to include tx1" and a subsection called "Deliberate delay attack." The section discusses a potential attack on miners under concerted attack, where a miner excludes any transaction that was first seen less than 30 seconds ago or double-spent less than 30 seconds after first seen.In an email conversation on October 28, 2014, Tom Harding acknowledged that without double-spend relay, a miner would not be able to detect transactions that conflict with others. He also stated that even with it, the miner cannot be sure and may choose to include no transactions at all to be safe. This is because a malicious miner can flood the network with orthogonal double spends, which other miners will spend time on before realizing they are double-spends.In addition, Gregory Maxwell proposed an attack in which a malicious miner can simultaneously flood other miners with orthogonal double spends that he doesn't mine himself. The attack highlights the risk of shorter timeframes. However, connecting to everyone on the network is not ideal. There is also a related concept of "discouraging" blocks which refers to mining on a previous block, but one must be careful not to break consensus. Miners are incentivized to connect with everyone on the network and look for double-spends to avoid being delayed. Tom Harding expressed caution about miners including a double spend in their block in an online discussion on Bitcoin forums. Another user raised concerns that this proposal could have disastrous side effects for miners. Two other users also replied to the thread with additional insights. Tom Harding also discussed the importance of double-spend relay in a conversation with Matt, adding that first-double-spends are relayed according to #4570. However, if a miner includes a double-spend in their block, they have to be very careful and exclude fast transactions. In summary, Tom Harding proposed a solution to improve the ability of bitcoin users to rely on unconfirmed transactions, which can be adopted incrementally without the need for hard or soft forks. However, there are risks associated with including double-spends in blocks and potential attacks from malicious miners flooding the network with orthogonal double spends. These issues require careful consideration and analysis by Bitcoin developers.</summary>
