    <summary>A recent post on Reddit has brought to light a paper from the University of Luxembourg that highlights how attackers can de-anonymize clients on the Bitcoin network. The paper examines several methods through which an attacker can compromise user privacy. It is not clear how many of these issues have been addressed, but it is mentioned that the core developers were informed prior to publication. The paper can be accessed via the link provided in the post.</summary>
