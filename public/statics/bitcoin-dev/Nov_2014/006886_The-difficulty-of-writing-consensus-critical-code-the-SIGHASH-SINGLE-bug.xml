    <summary>In a discussion about scheduling protocol upgrades, Justus Ranvier suggests upgrading every two years. However, Peter Todd disagrees and argues that doing hard-fork upgrades on a regular basis is not feasible and should be avoided. He believes that flag days, which are rare in engineering, should also be avoided. Peter's argument implies that hard-forking upgrades of almost all protocols should not be done regularly, even when there are no consensus problems to worry about.</summary>
