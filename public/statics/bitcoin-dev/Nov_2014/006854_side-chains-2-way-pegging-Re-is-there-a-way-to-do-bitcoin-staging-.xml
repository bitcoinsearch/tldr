    <summary>In a mailing list discussion in November 2014, Alex Mizrahi criticized a paper by Blockstream co-founders on sidechains as "wishful thinking". Mizrahi argued that the paper is based on the assertion that Bitcoin's decentralized mining model is secure, which he believes is not necessarily true. In response, Blockstream co-founder Adam Back explained that while sidechains may not be as secure as Bitcoin, they are still more secure than alternative blockchain solutions. The paper also discusses the issue of hashpower attacks and reorganizations and suggests longer contest periods for transfers to make fraudulent transfers harder to carry out.</summary>
