    <summary>The problem of using scripts-which-are-not-scripts in Bitcoin can be solved by implementing a hard fork upgrade known as "script 2.0." The current system relies on these hacks due to the desire to avoid a hard fork, but implementing this upgrade would eliminate the need for them. It is important to note that this issue exists solely because of the preference for a soft fork and the subsequent need for workarounds.</summary>
