    <summary>On November 6, 2014, Pieter Wuille proposed changing the STRICTENC protocol to immediately fail unrecognized pubkeys or fail the script if the pubkey is non-standard and signature verification succeeds. This proposal was accepted, with the question being raised whether this rule should apply to all pubkeys passed to CHECKMULTISIG or just the ones that are otherwise checked. The potential difficulty of spending existing outputs was also acknowledged, and it was decided that making this a consensus rule could make existing P2SH outputs/addresses unspendable.</summary>
