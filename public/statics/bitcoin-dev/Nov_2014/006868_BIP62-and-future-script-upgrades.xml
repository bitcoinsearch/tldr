    <summary>In a Github pull request, Pieter Wuille addressed some issues with rules for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 62. The changes include better names for the rules, clarification on the interaction of BIP62 with P2SH, and that known hashtypes are required despite not being part of DER. The proposal also suggests using v2 transactions instead of v3 transactions and applying the optional rules only to strict v2, not higher or lower. In response, Peter Todd expressed skepticism about the use of nVersion==3, preferring to disconnect TX and block version. He suggested that there may be circumstances where two different new tx version numbers might need to be introduced in a single soft-fork. Todd also noted that transactions can be verified for correctness in a stand-alone fashion outside of a block.</summary>
