    <summary>Francis GASCHET, a Bitcoin enthusiast, is exploring the Bitcoin universe and testing different things on testnet. He is concerned about the decreasing number of full nodes with appropriate resources in France. To contribute to the network, he plans to set up a full node for which he seeks advice on the required storage, RAM, and bandwidth resources. His company operates a dual-homed internet access and has the capacity to host an HA server in a secured environment. In his email update, Francis informs that his node is up and running on 5.56.40.1:8333, using Linux HA + dual homed Internet transit, and should be stable from now on.</summary>
