    <title>Increasing the OP_RETURN maximum payload size</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on #bitcoin-dev, Jorge Tim√≥n and Alan Reiner debated whether there were any use cases that required greater sizes for OP_RETURNs. Jorge couldn't think of one, but Alan noted that he had previously been irritated by the size reduction to 40 bytes, as he wanted to put ECDSA in signatures in the OP_RETURN, which would require at least 64 bytes. He couldn't remember what his application was, however. Pieter, the writer of the email containing the conversation, suggested that it was still possible to send the signature out of band and commit the transaction to a hash of that signature using an OP_RETURN output or pay-to-contract scheme. He also expressed concerns about people using the blockchain as a convenient transport channel rather than just for necessary data validation.</summary>
