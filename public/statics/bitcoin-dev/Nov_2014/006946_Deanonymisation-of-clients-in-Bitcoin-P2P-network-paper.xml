    <summary>In a discussion thread, a person named Mistr Bigs mistakenly assumed that a paper was discussing the unintentional ways of obtaining IP addresses of clients involved in transactions on the core Bitcoin network. However, the response to this assumption pointed out that the paper was not about obtaining IP addresses. The paper discussed fingerprinting approaches that probabilistically connect transactions to hosts whose IPs are already identified. It also stated that if a node is used exclusively via Tor, it effectively doesn't have an IP address, except for certain bugs that were not discussed in the paper.</summary>
