    <summary>Cl√©ment Elbaz suggested separating the consensus code into a "Bitcoin Kernel" project that could be used by anyone. This idea is not new, and work on it has already begun. The first step is creating a stand-alone script verification library. The library's code can be found at https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/blob/da18a0266c4de76c2a461cc2984aa2fa066c42f5/src/script/bitcoinconsensus.h. It contains various definitions, including script verification flags. The library will eventually be part of the larger Bitcoin Kernel project.</summary>
