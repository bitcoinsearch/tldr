    <summary>The discussion is about the deanonymization of transactions from non-Tor connected hosts, and the need to address these issues in Bitcoin itself rather than discussing Tor limitations. The paper being discussed is focused on the fingerprinting approaches that probabilistically connect transactions to hosts whose IPs are already known, and not on unintended ways of obtaining IP addresses of clients involved in transactions on the core Bitcoin network. The researchers have found ways to identify users who are not using Tor, thus making it important to address these issues in Bitcoin proper. Using Tor exclusively can effectively hide a node's IP address except for bugs of a class that aren't discussed in the paper.</summary>
