    <summary>In a conversation between Peter Todd and an unknown recipient, the topic of BIP62 and its impact on wallet authors was discussed. Peter Todd noted that BIP62 could potentially make life easier for wallet authors by removing the need to deal with malleability. However, he also mentioned that for most contract purposes, CTLV would be the better option to use. This is because it is more clearly correct and reduces the protocol state machine by one step. Peter also acknowledged that BIP62 achieves the secondary goal of making required implementation behavior more explicit, which should not be ignored. He concluded by stating that although these two concepts are somewhat orthogonal, they are complementary in nature.</summary>
