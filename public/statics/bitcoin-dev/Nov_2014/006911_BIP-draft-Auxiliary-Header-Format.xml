    <summary>Tier Nolan posted an update on the BIP for adding auxiliary headers to Bitcoin in a bandwidth-efficient way. The BIP has been updated to cover the specification of the transactions that need to be added, and Tier Nolan will create a network BIP the next day. The aheaders message is required to make use of the data by SPV clients. The hash of the aux header is part of the block, but the aux header itself is not, so the entire aux-header is encoded in the block. The merkleblock now has the auxiliary header information too. There is a tradeoff between overhead and delayed transactions. The final transaction in the block has the digest of the auxiliary header, and it is not possible to simply start a node and have it mine. Mining nodes need to include wallets to manage their UTXO entry.</summary>
