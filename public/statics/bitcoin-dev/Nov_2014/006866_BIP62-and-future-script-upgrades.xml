    <summary>In an email exchange on November 4, 2014, Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd discussed the choice of nVersion==3 in relation to block version increases. Todd expressed skepticism about the use of this rule, stating that future increases in block.nVersion could be unrelated to transactions. Garzik agreed with Todd's sentiment, citing previous ambiguity that arose from bumping tx version due to changes in block version. Although Garzik ACK'd the change, he prefers to disconnect TX and block version. Todd proposed using a single numbering system for consensus rules since they only apply to blocks. Garzik had no strong opinion on the matter and is fine with using nVersion==2 for transactions.</summary>
