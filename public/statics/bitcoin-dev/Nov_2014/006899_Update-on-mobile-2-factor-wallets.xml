    <summary>The post discusses the development of decentralized 2FA wallets for Bitcoin, which require both a desktop/laptop and an Android smartphone app to function. Two different implementations are discussed: Bitcoin Authenticator and a wallet made by Christopher Mann and Daniel Loebenberger from Uni Bonn. Bitcoin Authenticator uses P2SH/CHECKMULTISIG to provide the 2-factor functionality while Mann and Loebenberger's implementation has ported the efficient DSA 2-of-2 signing protocol by MacKenzie and Reiter to ECDSA. Mann and Loebenberger's protocol uses a combination of ECDSA, Paillier homomorphic encryption and zero knowledge proofs. While these projects have not yet implemented support for BIP70, they are expected to become more user-friendly and secure with further development.</summary>
