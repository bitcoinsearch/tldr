    <summary>The OP_RETURN output data limit is currently set at 40 bytes, which was initially intended to be 80 bytes but was reduced before the 0.9 release as a safety measure. After nine months of observation, the lack of blockchain catastrophe has led to proposals for increasing the limit. Suggestions include allowing two OP_RETURN outputs per transaction, increasing the default maximum payload size to 80 bytes (which can already be configured through the 'datacarriersize' option), making the maximum OP_RETURN payload size proportional to the number of transaction outputs, or a combination of these options. The third proposal seems to be the most interesting, with the second proposal being the second-best option. The first proposal is also considered good as long as the "space budget" is shared between the two outputs. There is a call for discussion and agreement on a plan for increasing the limit.</summary>
