    <summary>The context discusses the issue of fixing bugs in Bitcoin and who benefits from not doing so. The writer makes it clear that they do not want to delve into politics and accuses the other party of using obnoxious tactics. They explain that the difference between hard forks and soft forks is whether or not old nodes are dragged along in a quasi-broken state. The writer asserts that non-miners can easily reject a soft fork by running a node that does so, and that the reason to avoid soft forks is purely an engineering tradeoff and not related to being an Evil Centralised Foundation.</summary>
