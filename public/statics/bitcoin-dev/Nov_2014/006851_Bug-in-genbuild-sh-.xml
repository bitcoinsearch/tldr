    <summary>The user has successfully compiled bitCoin core on Debian 7, but received an error message "too many arguments" while executing genuid.sh. They fixed the issue by modifying genbuild.sh file using a diff command. The changes made were in the if condition where git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree was executed. The modification included adding double quotes to "$(git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2&gt;/dev/null)" = "true". The modification helped to resolve the issue and the execution of genuid.sh worked fine.</summary>
