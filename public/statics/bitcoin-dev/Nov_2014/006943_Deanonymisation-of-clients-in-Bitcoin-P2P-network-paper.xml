    <summary>The research paper from the Laboratory of Algorithmics, Cryptology and Security at the University of Luxembourg discusses the potential risks of obtaining IP addresses of clients involved in transactions on the core Bitcoin network. While Tor may be a first thought to mitigate this risk, Bitcoin over Tor has its own problems that prevent it from being effective. The primary issues mentioned in the paper are related to a Bitcoin node in default operation. Researchers have found that Bitcoin does not protect user's IP address and it can be linked to the user's transactions in real-time. Transactions made during one session, even those made via unrelated pseudonyms, can be linked together, revealing up to 60% of the IP addresses behind the transactions made over the Bitcoin network. Dr. Alex Biryukov explains that this Bitcoin network analysis combined with previous research on transaction flows shows that the level of anonymity in the Bitcoin network is quite low.</summary>
