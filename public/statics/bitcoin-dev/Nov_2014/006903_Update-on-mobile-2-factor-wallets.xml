    <summary>I can provide an explanation about the difference between the Princeton threshold signature scheme and another unnamed scheme. The person asking the question is familiar with the Princeton threshold signature, which involves generating a single key on one device and then splitting it into parts that are distributed among multiple devices. However, they are wondering if another scheme works the same way. The answer is no; in this other scheme, neither device ever sees the master private key.</summary>
