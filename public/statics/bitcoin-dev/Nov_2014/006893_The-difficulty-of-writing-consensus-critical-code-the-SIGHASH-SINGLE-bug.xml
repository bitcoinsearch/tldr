    <summary>The idea of separating the consensus code into a "Bitcoin Kernel" project, similar to the Linux Kernel, is being discussed. The kernel would contain only the minimum code required for reaching consensus, leaving the implementation of other aspects to applications built with it. It would be stateless, providing an interface for submitting blocks/transactions to be validated, along with the necessary context. The consensus code is currently frozen, with any changes made due to mistake rather than intent. Soft-fork proposals such as Pieter Wuille's BIP62 and Tamas Blummer's CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY are currently being considered, but dealing with proposed changes in an environment where competing implementations use essentially the same consensus-critical code is easier both technically and politically.</summary>
