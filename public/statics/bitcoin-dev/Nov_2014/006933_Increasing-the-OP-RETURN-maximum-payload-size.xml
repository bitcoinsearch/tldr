    <summary>The current size of the OP_RETURN is not enough for many legitimate uses in the blockchain and application developers are complaining about it. While increasing its size could potentially grow the blockchain faster, the Bitcoin network has not experienced death by bloat at its current size of 40 bytes. Wladimir agrees with increasing the OP_RETURN size, stating that he doesn't care about the actual size and thinks it's safe to increase it without worrying. The suggestion is even made to increase it beyond 80 bytes.</summary>
