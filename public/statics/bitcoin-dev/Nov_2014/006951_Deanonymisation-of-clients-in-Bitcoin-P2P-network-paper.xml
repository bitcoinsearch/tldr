    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin's anonymity, a user named Mistr Bigs questions why there is a focus on Tor limitations when researchers are deanonymizing transactions from non-Tor connected hosts. Another user responds by explaining that if a user does not use Tor or a similar infrastructure, they can still be deanonymized in many different ways. The user also explains that if they are listening widely to the network and a host regularly hands them a user's transactions, they can draw reliable conclusions about the user's identity even without identifiable characteristics. On the other hand, if the host is persistently behind Tor, their privacy is protected. Therefore, the priority should be ensuring that hosts can continually use Tor or similar systems rather than reimplementing Tor, which has already had millions of dollars invested and dozens of subject matter experts working on it.</summary>
