    <summary>The discussion of "best defaults" including default size for OP_RETURN, minimum fees, anti-dust policies, first-seen vs replace-by-fee, etc. ultimately depends on miners and their configuration policies. However, many miners and pools are apathetic towards configuring their own policy. The solution is to make it easier for miners to implement their own policies by abstracting out those parts of the code. Pull requests like #5071 and #5114 are steps in that direction and can help increase the acceptance of 80 bytes OP_RETURN transactions amongst miners. Separating script/standard was also a little step in the same direction, although this wasn't its main purpose.</summary>
