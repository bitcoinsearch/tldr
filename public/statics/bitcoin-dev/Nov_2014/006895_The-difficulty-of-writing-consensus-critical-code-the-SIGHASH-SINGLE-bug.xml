    <summary>In an email exchange on November 7, 2014, Cl√©ment Elbaz suggested separating the Bitcoin consensus code into a project similar to the Linux Kernel that could be used by anyone. Wladimir responded affirmatively, noting that there were already plans to move in this direction with the implementation of a script verification library in version 0.10 of Bitcoin's software. This library would be extended to other parts of the consensus by version 0.11 and beyond.</summary>
