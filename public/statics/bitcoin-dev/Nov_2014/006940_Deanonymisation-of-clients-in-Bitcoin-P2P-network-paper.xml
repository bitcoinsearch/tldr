    <summary>The discussion is centered around the potential vulnerability of users abandoning their privacy if they are forced off Tor via DOS attacks. The author believes that in a future where very few users make decisions about their privacy, consumer wallets will not directly expose Tor to end users and instead use it behind the scenes. This makes automated fallback or control over exits a concern for such wallets. The author's gut feeling has changed over time regarding tying Bitcoin to Tor too deeply. While Tor is convenient, most apps do not require a significant amount of onion routing. The author suggests that a small amount built into the p2p layer would be sufficient as Tor is complicated and could be a liability in the future. It is noted that Bitcoin currently has a large population of users with little technical skill, and assuming growth in the future, very few users will make decisions about their privacy.</summary>
