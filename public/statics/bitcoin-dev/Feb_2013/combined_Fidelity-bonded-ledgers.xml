    <summary>Peter Todd wrote a post on February 25, 2013, suggesting that Bitcoin's transaction and scripting system could be utilized to prove the movement of coins from one place to another. However, he also noted that this system is flawed as a currency due to the double spend problem. To address this issue, a new opcode and scriptPubKey can be used to provide proof of a double-spend attempt, and anyone with such proof can collect a reward. Transactions can follow the Bitcoin system of scripts, scriptPubKeys, and scriptSigs, while withdrawals from the ledger to the blockchain proper can happen in a similar way. Todd acknowledged Gregory Maxwell for his ideas about adding unspent-chaum-token redemption op-codes to Bitcoin proper, which led him to develop the Fidelity-Bonded Ledger idea. Token creation and redemption can be audited by tracking the total value of all tokens issued, and clients can show that either their redemption request has not been honored or that the value of outstanding tokens does not match up. A special unspent txout can be allowed to force redemptions, which can only be spent by creating the requested txout, thus transferring the funds to the rightful owner. By adding a relatively small number of opcodes to the existing scripting language, a ledger built on top of Bitcoin can be created whose honesty and performance are incentivized by the prospect of losing something of value. The post concludes with Todd's contact information.</summary>
