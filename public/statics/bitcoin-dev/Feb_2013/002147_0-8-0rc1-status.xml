    <summary>The Linux builds of version 0.8.0rc1 are in good shape and easily reproducible using gitian. However, the Windows builds are varying with every compile and need further attention. On the other hand, the OSX build is in pretty good shape but still requires some work. The plan going forward is to announce the release of 0.8.0rc1 with the binaries that have been developed so far, in order to get more testing done. In addition to this, the project is being encouraged to perform a build check on FreeBSD 8.3 (using gcc) and 9.1 (using clang/llvm). While the author will try to test version 8.x as well, it may not be possible to do so in time.</summary>
