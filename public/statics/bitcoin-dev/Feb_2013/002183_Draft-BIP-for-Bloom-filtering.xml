    <summary>On February 6, 2013, Mike Hearn requested for the BIP wiki page to be unlocked as it was stale. Gregory Maxwell, in response, informed that he had asked for permissions to unlock it but hadn't heard back. Later, the page was updated to the latest version of the protocol and marked as accepted after paying the new anti-spam deposit. Matt was praised for doing the heavy lifting on this feature.</summary>
