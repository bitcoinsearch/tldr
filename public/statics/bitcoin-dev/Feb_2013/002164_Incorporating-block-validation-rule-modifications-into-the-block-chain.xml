    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 34 (BIP-34), Gregory Maxwell explains that it ensures the change is safe to enforce rather than gauging consensus. He notes that the change doesn't cause old clients to reject the main chain, unlike an increase in the maximum block size, which would be rejected by old clients. Additionally, adding new opcodes doesn't cause a disagreement about the longest chain. Bitcoin intentional uses the consensus mechanism only for validating the ordering of transactions and not as a democracy. The discussion ends with the question of how maximum block size is to be decided.</summary>
