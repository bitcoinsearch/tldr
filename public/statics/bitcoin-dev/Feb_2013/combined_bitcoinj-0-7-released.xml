    <summary>The bitcoinj Java library has released version 0.7, which is the foundation of MultiBit, Bitcoin Wallet for Android and SatoshiDice. The new release notes include a fully verifying mode in addition to simplified verification and bloom filtering which are now implemented and activated by default. API changes have been made as well, with ECKey.sign() now taking a Sha256Hash as an argument and returning an ECDSASignature object in response. PeerGroup pings its peers and calculates moving averages of the ping times. There are many bugfixes and minor improvements, including faster startup networking code and support for testnet3 and bitcoin-qt compatible message signing and verification.Matt Corallo made huge contributions to this release, while Andreas Schildbach provided testing, ideas and quality bug reports. Ben (piuk) of blockchain.info funded the ECDSA key recovery feature.</summary>
