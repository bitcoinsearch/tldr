    <summary>The bitcoinj Java library for working with Bitcoin has released version 0.7, the foundation of MultiBit, Bitcoin Wallet for Android, SatoshiDice and more. The release notes include a fully verifying mode in addition to simplified verification and bloom filtering which is now implemented and activated by default. PeerGroup pings its peers and calculates moving averages of the ping times. API changes include ECKey.sign() now takes a Sha256Hash as an argument and returns an ECDSASignature object in response. There are many bugfixes and minor improvements, including faster startup networking code and support for testnet3 and bitcoin-qt compatible message signing and verification. Thanks go to Matt Corallo for his huge contributions to this release, Andreas Schildbach for testing, ideas and quality bug reports, and Ben (piuk) of blockchain.info for funding the ECDSA key recovery feature.</summary>
