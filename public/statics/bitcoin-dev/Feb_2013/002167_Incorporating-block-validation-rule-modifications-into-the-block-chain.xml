    <summary>In a discussion between Gavin Andresen and Gregory Maxwell on February 13th, 2013, the topic of whether or not Bitcoin can meet its security and decentralization promises without any hard limit on block size was debated. Maxwell argued that since non-trivial fees and scaling limits are necessary to keep Bitcoin decentralized, block space scarcity is required in the long run. He also compared it to changing the supply of coins, suggesting that it should not be taken lightly. In contrast, Andresen disagreed with Maxwell, stating that he believes Bitcoin can still meet its promises without a hard limit on block size. Andresen also mentioned having a fruitful discussion with an economist friend about this over the weekend and planned to write up his reasoning for why raising the block size limit would not be a problem. Although no further information was provided in this context, it is worth noting that the debate over the block size limit has been ongoing in the Bitcoin community for years.</summary>
