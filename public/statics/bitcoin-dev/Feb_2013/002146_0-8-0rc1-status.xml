    <summary>On Friday, February 08, 2013, Gavin Andresen wrote about the varying Windows builds with every compile. He figured out that the -frandom-seed flag is not being passed down into the leveldb build resulting in two different binaries differing only in the names of some leveldb objects. He suggested an easy makefile fix. Luke responded that this issue was already mostly-fixed in pull #2243 submitted nine days ago. However, he mentioned that DEBUGFLAGS should be propagated to LevelDB or not is another conversation.</summary>
