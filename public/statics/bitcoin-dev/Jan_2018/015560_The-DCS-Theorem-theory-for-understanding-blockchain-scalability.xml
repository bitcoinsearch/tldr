    <summary>The DCS Triangle, an important tool for understanding blockchain scalability and blocksize-related debates, has been independently discovered by Greg and Trent McConaghy. The DCS Theorem, which is a probability proof of the triangle, can be found on arXiv. Interested readers can follow this link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04335. Finally, Greg requests that individuals refrain from emailing him anything that they are not comfortable sharing with the NSA.</summary>
