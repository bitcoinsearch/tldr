    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jefferson Carpenter, raised a concern about Bitcoin's difficulty being maxed out by Moore’s Law within 400 years. However, Peter Todd disputed this theory, saying that if Moore’s Law were to last for 400 years, mining Bitcoin blocks would require unimaginable energy levels. Todd added that once we reach such a point, the problem is the speed of light and we would run out of energy in our 10 minute light radius. Todd concluded that this matter belongs to science fiction writers rather than bitcoin-dev and shared an XKCD comic as well.</summary>
