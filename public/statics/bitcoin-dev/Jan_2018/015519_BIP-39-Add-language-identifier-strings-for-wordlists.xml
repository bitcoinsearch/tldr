    <title>BIP 39: Add language identifier strings for wordlists</title>

    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a discussion arose about the multilingual support in bip39. Greg Sanders asked whether anyone had actually used it, and received a response from someone who noted that Copay (and all its clones) use it. However, another user pointed out that the lack of support for non-English languages poses a problem for Japanese users who are not able to read English letters. This user recounted an incident where a 60-year-old Japanese man wrote down "aneter" for "amateur" when trying to recover his seed phrase. The user argued that insisting on English-only mnemonics is not a good way to move forward as a currency and requested a discussion of language identification strings appropriate for use with BIP 39. The user also pointed out that the phrases cannot be called “mnemonics” at all if they are gibberish in a wholly alien writing system. The user emphasized the importance of multi-language support and discussed the need for language identification strings that are appropriate for use with the standard.</summary>
