    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has suggested removing the word "satoshi" from the BIP39 English wordlist, which is used to generate seeds for bitcoin wallets. The suggestion was made after it was discovered that the word can be found on the list, leading to concerns that malicious third parties could use it to identify a bitcoin seed. However, some have argued that the security threat posed by the inclusion of the word is minimal as a determined attacker would try using any word list they find as a seed regardless of whether it contains the word "satoshi". The risk comes from the potential for attackers to index and test every occurrence of the word to gain access to a bitcoin wallet.</summary>
