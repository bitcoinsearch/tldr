    <summary>Based on the assumption that two chains have the same value initially or that miners believe they will have the same value in the end, miners are likely to be equally distributed between the two almost identical chains. In the event that one chain is faster, it will become more challenging to mine according to the difficulty adjustment scheme. Therefore, the two chains should have comparable chain generation rates, length and difficulty. If the chains do not meet these conditions, miners will be attracted more easily to the chain that is easier to mine, which will increase the chain generation rate. This, in turn, will make it harder to mine after difficulty adjustment. Eventually, equilibrium will be achieved.</summary>
