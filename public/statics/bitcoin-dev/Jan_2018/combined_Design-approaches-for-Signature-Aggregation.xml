    <summary>Bitcoin Core developer Russell O'Connor discusses various designs for signature aggregation in an email exchange. Pieter suggests a design where the aggregate signature data is put into the top of the first segwit v1+ input witness, regardless of whether or not that input is participating in aggregation. However, this design does not allow for toying with the weights of aggregated signatures. The expedient approach proposed by Matt Corallo is argued against by Russell due to its arbitrary choice of which input witness will hold the aggregated signature, making the specification and implementation error-prone. Russell supports the extended-transaction approach, which uses a new writer side-effect for Script to support signature aggregation. This model allows conditional success plus a log of additional constraints that need to be satisfied for the transaction to be valid. However, supporting future script versions or opcodes that may want to participate in signature aggregation is challenging. Russell believes that the expedient proposal has unintended semantic consequences and argues that the extended-transaction design is the conservative design. He also thinks that there are probably other designs for signature aggregation beyond the two discussed in the email.Despite the challenges in designing a system that allows for aggregation compatible with upgrades, people are still motivated to use taproot solely over P2WPKH based on having the option to perform aggregation. Overall, Russell argues against the expedient approach to signature aggregation and stresses the importance of a clean semantic model.</summary>
