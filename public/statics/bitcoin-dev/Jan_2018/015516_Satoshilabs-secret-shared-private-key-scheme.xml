    <summary>In a message from Gregory Maxwell on January 8th, 2018, he expressed his satisfaction with BIP 39 and its inability to be used as a brainwallet scheme. BIP 39 was designed to provide security for brainwallets by allowing users to generate a 12-word mnemonic from 16 octets of entropy drawn off /dev/urandom and protecting it with a creative passphrase. This results in a 128-bit security level. Maxwell is currently working on a BIP 39 tool that includes brainwallet support and can be found on GitHub. He also included his Bitcoin address at the end of the message.</summary>
