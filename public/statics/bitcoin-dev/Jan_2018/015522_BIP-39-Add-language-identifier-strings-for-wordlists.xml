    <summary>There has been a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the use of multi-language support in BIP39, which is the standard for mnemonic code or seed phrases used by wallets to backup private keys. Some users have raised concerns about the potential loss of money due to lack of support across multiple wallet implementations. However, others argue that restricting the standard to English only would exclude people who do not want to use or cannot use Latin characters and words from the English language. It has been reported that about 30% to 40% of Copay users store their backup in a language other than English, and there are constant requests to support new languages in BIP39. Some users suggest mapping existing ISO/UTF language character standards to the seeds instead of using a word list. Nonetheless, there are concerns that auto-correction could reinforce erroneously saved/written seed backups. The discussion also highlights the difficulty of creating flexible encoding standards that can cater to different languages while maintaining security.</summary>
