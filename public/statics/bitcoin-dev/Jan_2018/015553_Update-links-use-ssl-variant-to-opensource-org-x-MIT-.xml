    <summary>Felix Wolfsteller expressed disappointment over feedback he received off-list, but acknowledged that the mailing list is only for protocol-only discussions. He provided a link to follow the progress of his proposal to make changes to the copyright-header in source files, specifically making it use HTTPS instead of HTTP where possible. He suggested creating an issue on Github, 'sed -i' relevant links, create a pull request on Github and then come back to the mailing list. This change would affect a few hundred files and may require a copyright-year-extension (to 2018), too. He also shared an example header from a file in the Bitcoin codebase.</summary>
