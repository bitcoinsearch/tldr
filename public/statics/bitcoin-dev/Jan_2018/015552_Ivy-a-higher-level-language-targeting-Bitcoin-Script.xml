    <summary>The Ivy team has released a prototype higher-level language and development environment for creating custom Bitcoin Script programs called Ivy. It is designed to improve the usability of Bitcoin Script by adding affordances like named variables and clauses, static types, and familiar syntax for function calls. Ivy is a simple smart contract language which can compile to Bitcoin Script. The compiler only produces SegWit addresses; however, there was an issue with how the compiler was handling clause selection that led to a minor witness malleability problem. This problem has been fixed in version 0.0.7 of the compiler. A user suggested adding some form of compiler-time enforcement to prevent witness malleability, but the team believes it would be easier to build a static analyzer for low-level Bitcoin Script. Ivy is currently a prototype software intended for educational and research purposes only, and it should not be used to control real or testnet Bitcoins.</summary>
