    <summary>A forwarded email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses concerns over section 8.1.2 of the NIST 8202 Blockchain Technology Overview. Dylan Yaga, a representative from Fed, has revised the section and sent it to CANNON for further comment. Section 8.1.2 covers Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which was developed as a result of a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. The developers of BCH decided not to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) changes, but rather increase the blocksize. This caused people to have access to the same amount of coins on both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. A question is raised about the revised section regarding whether or not transactions are more compact due to SegWit. Transactions do appear more compact to un-upgraded nodes since the witness is stripped, but they are not actually more compact.</summary>
