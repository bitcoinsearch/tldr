    <summary>When a large miner wants to increase their chances of mining nearly every single round, they can create "miner tokens" by dividing their hardware setup into clusters that appear to be different independent miners. As each token expires, the miner can dedicate a fraction of their mining power to renew it and even create multiple new tokens with enough hardware. However, this strategy does not reduce energy use and only delays income for new miners, making profitability calculations more difficult. In the long term, this behavior artificially raises the difficulty target.</summary>
