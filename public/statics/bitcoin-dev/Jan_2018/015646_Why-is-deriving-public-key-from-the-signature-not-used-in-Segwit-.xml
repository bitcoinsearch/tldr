    <summary>In an email discussion, Aymeric Vitte raised a query regarding the presence of pubkey for standard p2pkh transactions, which was not the case previously. However, there was no response to his question regarding the reason behind this change and when it was implemented. In response, the sender of the email refuted the existence of such behavior in the first place and stated that Vitte might be mistaken.</summary>
