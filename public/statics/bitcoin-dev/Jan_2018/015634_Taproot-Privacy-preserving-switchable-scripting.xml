    <summary>In an email exchange, Anthony Towns raises concerns about the potential impact of quantum attacks on Bitcoin. He suggests that using taproot alone may not provide enough protection against hashing the key. When asked if there is a way for individuals to hedge against quantum attacks, he recommends using scriptpubkeys with actual security against quantum computers rather than snake-oil. He also notes that using the point at infinity would not work as a solution. While it's true that funds are being held in reused addresses over the long term, Towns believes this is not relevant since the attacker would simply steal the coins on spend.</summary>
