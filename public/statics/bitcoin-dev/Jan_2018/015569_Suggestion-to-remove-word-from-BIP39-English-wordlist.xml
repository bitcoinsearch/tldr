    <summary>On Jan 17, 2018, Weiwu Zhang via bitcoin-dev responded to a suggestion made by Ronald van der Meer for removing the word "satoshi" from the BIP39 English wordlist. The reason given by Van der Meer was that it would make it less obvious that it's a bitcoin seed when discovered by a malicious third party. However, Zhang argued that if a malicious third party finds a wordlist that looks like a seed, they would try using it as a Bitcoin seed regardless of the presence of the word "satoshi". Instead, the security threat lies in the fact that a malicious third party may index what they found and test every occurrence of "satoshi" for a lead to a seed. This could include hard-disk recycling services or any successfully hacked Gmail account. Therefore, Zhang sees the removal of "satoshi" from the wordlist as a reasonable improvement.</summary>
