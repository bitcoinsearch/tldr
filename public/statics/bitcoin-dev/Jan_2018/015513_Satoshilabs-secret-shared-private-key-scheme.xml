    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pavol Rusnak argued that plausible deniability is one of the main points of both BIP39 and SLIP39. The discussion was in response to concerns raised about the fact that entering the wrong passphrase when generating a private key can result in a different private key being created silently, which could lead to lost funds. According to Rusnak, the construction is by design and provides plausible deniability. However, there was a request for clarification on exactly what scenario the plausible deniability feature refers to.</summary>
