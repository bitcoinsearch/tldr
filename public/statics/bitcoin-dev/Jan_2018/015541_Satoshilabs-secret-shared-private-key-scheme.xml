    <summary>In an email thread dated 11/01/18, Gregory Maxwell suggested two methods to avoid inconsistencies in computer work. The first method involves having the computer do more work and then checking the consistency after the fact. Maxwell did not provide any specific details on how this method would work or what crypto primitives would be used. The second method suggested by Maxwell involves having a check value under the encryption during decode time. Again, Maxwell did not provide any specific details on how this method would work or what crypto primitives would be used. Pavol "stick" Rusnak, the CTO of SatoshiLabs, asked for further explanation on both methods. However, no response was provided in the email thread.</summary>
