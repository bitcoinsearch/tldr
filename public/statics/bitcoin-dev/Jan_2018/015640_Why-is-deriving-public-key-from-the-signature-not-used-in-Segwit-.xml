    <summary>The author of this message is inquiring about the rationale behind including both public key and signature in Segwit witness. They suggest that the public key can be derived from the signature and a quadrant byte, a method successfully used in both Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions. The author questions why the old method was used, as leaving out the public key would have saved 33 bytes per signature. They wonder if there was a specific reason for using the old method, such as security, performance, privacy, or if it was simply not considered at the time.</summary>
