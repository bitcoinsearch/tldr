    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell suggested that the design of Bitcoin would need to be changed to maintain accurate timestamps. However, it was pointed out that open-timestamp calendar servers provide more precise time-stamping under the assumption that the calendar server is behaving correctly. The OpenTimestamps servers are specifically designed not to be trusted and do not make any cryptographically verifiable attestations as to when timestamps were created. In the future, there is expected to be a trusted timestamping scheme via disposable keys.</summary>
