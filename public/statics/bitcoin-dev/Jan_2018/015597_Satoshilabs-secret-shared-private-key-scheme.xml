    <summary>In the given context, the author provides a concrete example and offers to answer any questions about it. However, they are unsure about how to make it clearer. The responder acknowledges their mistake in not reading it carefully and agrees that the scheme does not protect against the scenario presented by the author. They also mention that a large block cipher is a standard construction. The author expresses their happiness about this but points out that they did not find any standardization or implementation of the CMC mode, except for the paper. Finally, the author asks the responder if they have experience with other modes such as HCTR and HEH.</summary>
