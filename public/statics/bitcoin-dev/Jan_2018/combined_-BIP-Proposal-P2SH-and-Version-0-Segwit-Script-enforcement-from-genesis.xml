    <summary>The proposer has suggested a change in the consensus rules for Bitcoin's Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) and Version 0 Witness Program script rules. The proposed change suggests backdating these rules to the genesis block, which would simplify the consensus rules. This change would allow protocol implementers to avoid writing and testing code paths that are no longer relevant. Though it can be enforced with only one historical exception, it would make the consensus rules simpler.The proposer believes that this change will make it easier for developers to implement Bitcoin and reduce the complexity of the codebase. The full BIP draft can be found on Github and the pull request to Bitcoin Core, which implements this change, is open and available for review.Overall, the proposal aims to streamline the development process for Bitcoin and make it easier for protocol implementers to update their systems to comply with the new consensus rules. The proposed change has been made available for public review and feedback.</summary>
