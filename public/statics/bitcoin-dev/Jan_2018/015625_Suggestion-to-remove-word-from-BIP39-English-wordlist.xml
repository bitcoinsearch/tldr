    <summary>A user named Ronald van der Meer is asking what the next step is since he is new to the context. The email thread discusses the suggestion of removing a word from BIP39 English wordlist and whether it is possible to change or remove a word from the list. One person argues that changing the list is impossible because verification of an existing mnemonic requires the list, but another person disagrees and suggests selecting another word that is not on the 2048 list and agreeing by convention that the words 'satoshi' or the alternative word will represent the same number on the list. There is also information provided about the email sender's contact details, including his email address, website, and Twitter account.</summary>
