    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community has suggested that encryption headers for LUKS should be written onto disks, even if they are not used. The suggestion was issued as part of a challenge to "plausible deniability" designers to encrypt a 6 TB disk with pseudorandom bytes, walk it across US borders and wait to see what happens when the data is searched. The challenge is based on the premise that there is nothing inherently suspicious about a disk filled with pseudorandom data. For example, encrypted partitions that are filled and later reformatted will contain random bytes; modern drives often implement fast secure erasure with encryption, which means that any wiped data becomes random noise; and software disk encryption schemes result in drives being filled with random noise upon reformatting.</summary>
