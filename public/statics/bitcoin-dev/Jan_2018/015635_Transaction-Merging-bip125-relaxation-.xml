    <title>Transaction Merging (bip125 relaxation)</title>

    <summary>A user named Rhavar raised an interesting point about bip125 on bitcoin-dev, stating that it may be incentive incompatible. The context suggests that if a competitive mempool is assumed, accepting a replacement transaction of a lower fee rate doesn't seem generally rational. It is worth noting that BIP125 replacement requires the fee rate to increase, although the text of the BIP document is written in a confusing manner that doesn't make this clear.</summary>
