    <title>Proposal: rewarding fees to next block miner</title>

    <summary>In an email conversation on January 29, 2018, Eric Voskuil argued that block space created by a miner is the property of the miner, which can be sold or not sold. However, this argument is weak given that Bitcoin users collectively pay miners around $130k USD per block as inflation for complying with the Bitcoin protocol. It is unclear whether miners have more right to this payment than Bitcoin users have to run software that invalidates the coinbase outputs of miners who do not comply with the protocol. Such retaliation could be targeted against non-compliant miners.</summary>
