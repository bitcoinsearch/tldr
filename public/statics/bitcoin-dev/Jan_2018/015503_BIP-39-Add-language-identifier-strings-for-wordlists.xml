    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of BIP39 and subsequent BIPs, which are often used incorrectly and can mislead people. The advantage of using them is questionable compared to just backing up a seed. Some wallets, such as Electrum, allow validation in English only, while others, like Ledger-S, have keyboard limitations. There is a proposal to enhance the BIP39 wordlist set by specifying canonical native language strings to identify each wordlist, as well as short ASCII language codes. This would facilitate language identification in user interface options or menus and promote interface consistency between implementations. However, there are concerns about supporting multiple languages and vendor lock-in. Some suggest that new standards should be created where words are mapped to integers rather than literal strings, and a mapping from original language words to matching English words would be provided. This would allow users to enter a mnemonic into e.g. a hardware wallet that only supports English.</summary>
