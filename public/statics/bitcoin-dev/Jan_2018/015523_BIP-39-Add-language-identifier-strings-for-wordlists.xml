    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has raised concerns about the practicality and accessibility of using English/ASCII letters for Bitcoin wallets, especially in countries where English is not the primary language. The proposed solution to this problem was a multilingual BIP39 wordlist, which has been implemented by Copay and its clones. However, it has been pointed out that the feature has not been widely used and is not supported by major wallets. This has led to a call for a survey to be conducted worldwide to determine what people actually need and understand when it comes to securing their coins. Further criticism has been directed towards wallets that have implemented non-standard or difficult-to-understand features, which creates confusion for users. This has resulted in a proposal to correct this issue and simplify the process of securing coins. Additionally, there has been debate on the use of a wordlist versus a 32B hex string backup, with concerns raised about lock-in and the potential for users to lose access to their coins. The conversation also touched on the importance of language identification strings in making the BIP39 standard accessible to users who do not speak English. While some have advocated for an English-only standard, others have argued for the inclusion of non-English wordlists, citing the potential for greater adoption and accessibility in different regions. Links to various Github pages relating to Bitcoin transactions, Zcash wallets, and Bitcoin wallets were also shared by the original poster.</summary>
