    <summary>In a mailing list post, dexx has proposed raising the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes or higher to disincentivize the use of harmful methods to embed data into the blockchain. The aim is to make OP_RETURN scripts the cheapest way to embed data into the chain. Currently, embedding data with bare-multisig and P2SH can be cheaper in terms of effective transaction size compared to OP_RETURN with a payload limit of 80 bytes. However, both methods have been heavily used by the major two meta-protocols on top of Bitcoin: Omni and Counterparty, but both protocols started to use OP_RETRUN data embedding a long time ago. Despite this, token sends are usually done one by one, each with a single transaction, placing a heavy burden on the whole network when an exchange sends out withdrawals.Solutions for "multi-sends with multi-inputs" are available, and moving destinations into the payload for token sends has also been considered, but more space is needed, otherwise, this solution would be limited to very few recipients. During December 2017, there were roughly 210,000 Omni Layer transactions, with more than 12,000 transactions on peak days, and the numbers are growing. It's assumed that there is a similar number of Counterparty transactions, which most likely benefit from additional payload space too. Therefore, to discourage the use of more harmful methods to embed data into the chain, dexx proposes raising the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes. This will make it the "cheapest" way of embedding data into the chain.The proposal is based on the fact that token sends are usually done one by one, each with a single transaction, which burdens the whole network, especially when an exchange sends out withdrawals. There are solutions for "multi-sends with multi-inputs," but they require more space. Thus, dexx proposes to raise the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes or higher and is willing to provide a pull request if there is positive feedback. Currently, OP_RETURN scripts are the most common way to embed data into the blockchain, with P2SH being cheaper in terms of effective transaction size.Overall, dexx's proposal aims to address the issue of burden on the network due to token sends being done one by one, each with a single transaction. Raising the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes or higher will make OP_RETURN scripts the cheapest way to embed data into the chain, thus disincentivizing the use of more harmful methods. The proposal also takes into account the growing number of Omni and Counterparty transactions, which would benefit from additional payload space. Solutions for "multi-sends with multi-inputs" are available, but they require more space. Dexx is willing to provide a pull request if there is positive feedback.</summary>
