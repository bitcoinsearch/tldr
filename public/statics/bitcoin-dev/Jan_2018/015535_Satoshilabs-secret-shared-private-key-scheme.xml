    <summary>In an email conversation on September 1st, 2018 between Gregory Maxwell and Pavol "stick" Rusnak, the former suggested using blind host-delegated Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that run on a user's computer instead of a hardware wallet. The suggestion was made to ensure that the user's computer does not learn anything about the keys. Rusnak then asked for examples of such KDFs. The context implies that this conversation may have been related to cybersecurity measures for cryptocurrency wallets, given Rusnak's position as CTO of SatoshiLabs, a company known for producing Trezor hardware wallets.</summary>
