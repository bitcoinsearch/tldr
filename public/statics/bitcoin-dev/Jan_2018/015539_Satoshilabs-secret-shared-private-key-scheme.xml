    <summary>In a thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell suggested using blind host-delegated key derivation functions (KDFs) for hardware wallets. These KDFs would run on the user's computer instead of the hardware wallet, but without the computer learning anything about the keys. Pavol Rusnak asked for examples of such KDFs, but later retracted his request, stating that the hardware wallet wouldn't be able to determine if the computer was providing valid results or not.</summary>
