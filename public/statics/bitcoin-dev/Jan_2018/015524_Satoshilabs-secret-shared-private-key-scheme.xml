    <summary>In a recent email thread, Peter Todd asked Pavol Rusnak to explain the "plausible deniability" feature of Trezor wallets. Rusnak directed him to the documentation on multi-passphrase encryption and hidden wallets. However, Gregory Maxwell expressed concern over the weakness of the key derivation function, which could make it easy for passphrases to be brute forced. This could potentially reveal attempts to cover up funds. In response, Todd posed questions about the assumptions being made regarding human memory and psychology research.</summary>
