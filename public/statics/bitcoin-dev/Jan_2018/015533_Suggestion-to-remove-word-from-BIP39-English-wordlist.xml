    <summary>Ronald van der Meer, an individual reviewing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, has suggested the removal of the word "satoshi" from the BIP39 English wordlist. The reason for this suggestion is to make it less obvious that it is a bitcoin seed when found by a malicious third party. Ronald can be contacted through his email and website, as well as his Twitter account, and provides his GPG for secure communication.</summary>
