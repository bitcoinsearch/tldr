    <title>BIP 39: Add language identifier strings for wordlists</title>

    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev post, it was proposed that the BIP 39 wordlist set should have canonical native language strings to identify each wordlist, as well as short ASCII language codes. However, the writer advises against using any other language than English for BIP39, stating that they had allowed more languages when writing the BIP39 spec but learned that it was something they should have been more persistently against. Currently, a new standard is being drafted which will allow Shamir Secret Scheme Splitting and disallow usage of a custom wordlist in order to eradicate this mess. This will be pushed as a BIP once its contents are deemed acceptable. The link to the current BIP39 specification is provided in the post.</summary>
