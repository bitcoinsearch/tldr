    <summary>A serious vulnerability has been discovered in the Electrum wallet software on January 6th. This bug affects versions 2.6 to 3.0.4 of Electrum, including clones like Electron Cash, and all platforms. If a user's wallet is not password protected and they open it with an older version of Electrum while using a web browser, their wallet is at risk of being stolen. An attacker can obtain private data and modify user settings, including the list of contacts in a wallet, and the "payto" and "amount" fields of the user interface while Electrum is running.To protect themselves, users should upgrade their Electrum software immediately and stop using old versions. In addition, they should review their settings and delete all contacts from their contact list because the Bitcoin addresses of their contacts might have been modified. To upgrade Electrum, users need to stop running any version of Electrum older than 3.0.5 and install the most recent version. Users who did not protect their wallet with a password should create a new wallet and move their funds to that wallet. However, it is recommended that users do not move funds from password-protected wallets.Desktop users should download Electrum from https://electrum.org and no other website. Android users can find the most recent version available in Google Play. If the newest version cannot be installed, users should stop using Electrum on that computer and access their funds from a device that can run Electrum 3.0.5. The vulnerability was reported on November 25th, 2017, by user jsmad and patched in version 3.0.5 of Electrum. A patch was created by mithrandi after Tavis Ormandy demonstrated how the JSONRPC interface could be exploited against the Electrum GUI. However, the Github issue remained open because mithrandi's patch did not add password protection to the JSONRPC interface. Proper password protection was added on Sunday, January 7th, to the JSONRPC interface of the daemon. The 3.0.5 release includes password protection and completely disables JSONRPC in the GUI.</summary>
