    <summary>On 24th January 2018, Gregory Maxwell responded to a query by Aymeric Vitte regarding the absence of a pubkey in the scriptsig for a particular transaction. Gregory explained that the pubkey is present in scriptPubKey of vout 0 of another transaction which it is spending. Aymeric had earlier provided a link to a Bitcoin transaction on blockchain.info and asked about its scriptsig which lacked any pubkey. The transaction referred to was: https://blockchain.info/tx/226a8b08dc46a00e9ecec5567a303a0b354bef3c1674476eb5e4b627b2ace493?format=hex. No further information has been provided in this context. Aymeric Vitte's Github repository contains projects related to simplifying Bitcoin and Zcash transactions and wallets. The repository links to the dynamic blocklist for torrents and a list of 10 million passwords. It also has links to Peersm, Torrent-live and node-Tor.</summary>
