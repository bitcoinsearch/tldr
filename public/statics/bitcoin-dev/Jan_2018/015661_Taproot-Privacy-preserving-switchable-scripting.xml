    <summary>Gregory Maxwell proposed a Taproot delegating CHECKSIG that can make a top level "threshold-signature OR arbitrary-conditions" indistinguishable from a normal one-party signature with no overhead. The taproot branch is only required for accountability or when conditions other than public keys are required. Scriptless-scripts can accomplish most hash preimages without an actual hash pre-image condition. Maxwell wonders if there are any simple and useful/general preconditions that would be useful ANDed with a monotone function of public keys like CSV. Recursive taproot by itself isn't very interesting, since there is no gain to not just merging the alternative. It might make sense to support a taproot construction that can nest where interior nested keys have a CSV/CLTV predicate. Maxwell requests to change the subject line for further discussion about quantum computers.</summary>
