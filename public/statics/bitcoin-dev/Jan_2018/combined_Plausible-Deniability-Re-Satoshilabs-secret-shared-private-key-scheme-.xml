    <summary>The "plausible deniability" concept has been criticized in relation to devices such as Trezor, where presenting an acceptable alternative while keeping the actual hidden could backfire and be used as evidence against the user. In legal scenarios where authorities believe a user has more cryptocurrency than they are revealing, plausible deniability does not help, and users may be forced to sit in jail until they reveal the real password. It is important to have a privacy practice that leaves nobody knowing or suspecting that one has any Bitcoin at all. The worst part about plausible deniability schemes is that they can backfire quite badly and lead to very serious consequences.A member of the Bitcoin development community has suggested that encryption headers for LUKS should be written onto disks, even if they are not used. The suggestion was issued as part of a challenge to "plausible deniability" designers to encrypt a 6 TB disk with pseudorandom bytes, walk it across US borders and wait to see what happens when the data is searched. The challenge is based on the premise that there is nothing inherently suspicious about a disk filled with pseudorandom data.The author of the article shares his longstanding policy of immediately 'dd' any new hard disk or decommissioned old one from start to end with a pseudorandom byte stream, which would make it indistinguishable from disk encryption setup. Although he does this for fun and not for plausibility reasons, he challenges plausible deniability designers to 'dd' a 6TB disk with pseudorandom bytes and try walking it across the U.S. border until it gets searched. Smart people develop appropriate threat models, keep their security systems confidential and work to increase the popularity of network security systems to reduce how much they stand out. The only "plausibility" shield is to not seem like someone who is likely to have much, and plausible deniability solves nothing against sophisticated adversaries who possess both brains and patience.</summary>
