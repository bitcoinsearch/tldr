    <summary>The conversation thread on bitcoin-dev mailing list dated January 17, 2018 at 3:31:44 PM UTC discusses the generalization of a GF(256) sharing scheme. Gregory Maxwell suggests creating a test utility that tries all possible one byte messages with all possible share values using the proposed sharing scheme to determine its security. He notes that information theory is the reason why we can know that SSS and similar schemes have perfect security within their limited scope. Additionally, a GitHub link to a C program demonstrating the speed of GF(2^8) is provided as an example.</summary>
