    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer has proposed to add "P2SH² improvements" in the Bech32 format. He has shared an initial draft of the proposal on Github. The idea is to include the single SHA256 hash of the public key or script in the address instead of RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) or SHA256(SHA256(script)). This will allow relaying the middle-hash as a way to prove that the final hash is a hash itself, thereby proving it is not embedded data spam.Since deployment of Bech32 isn't widespread yet, Luke thinks it could be worth revising it to add this improvement. Bech32 is considered a missed opportunity for adding these improvements since everyone will probably be upgrading to it at some point.</summary>
