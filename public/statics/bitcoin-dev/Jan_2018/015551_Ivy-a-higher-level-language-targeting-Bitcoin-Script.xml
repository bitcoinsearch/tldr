    <summary>The Bitcoin community has released Ivy, a prototype higher-level language and development environment for creating custom Bitcoin Script programs. The language aims to improve the usability of Bitcoin Script by adding affordances such as named variables and clauses, static types, and familiar syntax for function calls. The language is simple and can compile to Bitcoin Script. With the addition of compiler-time enforcement, Ivy could help resolve witness malleability, which makes Bitcoin scripts more complicated to write. Ivy Playground for Bitcoin allows users to create and test simulated contracts in a sandboxed environment. However, this is prototype software intended for educational and research purposes only, and should not be used to control real or testnet Bitcoins.</summary>
