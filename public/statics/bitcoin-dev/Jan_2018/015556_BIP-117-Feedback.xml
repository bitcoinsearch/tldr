    <summary>Russell O'Connor has expressed his concern regarding the situation for BIP 117. Unlike BIP-141, there are no restrictions on terminating a v0 witness program with a non-empty alt-stack, and leaving non-canonical boolean values on the main stack. This is a new set of rules that didn't exist when the commitments were made, and these funds could be rendered unspendable if BIP 117 were activated. Theoretically, the use of altstack is completely standard, but in practice, it's unused. Russell's concern remains unanswered as he wants hard numbers on the worst-case time taken by sigops with the limit removed. It's about 120 usec per sigop, so it could take approximately 160 seconds to validate a block.</summary>
