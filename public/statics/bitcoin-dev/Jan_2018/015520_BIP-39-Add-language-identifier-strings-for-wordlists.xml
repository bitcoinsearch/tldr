    <summary>According to language statistics from app stores, 30% to 40% of Copay users have their backup on a language other than English, and there are constant requests to support new languages in BIP39. A discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list raised concerns about the potential for non-English speakers to make errors when writing down mnemonic phrases. However, some argued that restricting the standard to English would be artificial and unhelpful. The original question was about appropriate language identification strings for use with the BIP39 standard. Matias Alejo Garcia confirmed that Copay (and all its clones) use multilingual support in bip39.</summary>
