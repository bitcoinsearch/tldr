    <title>BIP 39: Add language identifier strings for wordlists</title>

    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Sjors Provoost expressed his disagreement on the inclusion of language-specific word lists in the current BIP-39 standard. He argues that supporting multiple languages would be useful as people tend to memorize things better in their native language. However, he prefers a new standard and replacement for BIP-39. The author of the proposal suggests adding standardized native language and short-ASCII identifier strings to the BIP repository, but he acknowledges that multilanguage support is only feasible with standardization. He urges the importance of language-specific standardized word lists and believes that independent implementation of standards is crucial for avoiding implementation lock-in. The author shares his implementation of the language switching backend for multilingual mnemonic generation which required only relatively small C code changes. He claims that it is easy to create such tools and this squarely answers concerns about vendor lock-in. Additionally, he mentions the absence of a Dutch word list in the BIP repository and expresses his wish to add more word lists. Finally, he invites further discussion by private mail or in an appropriate public venue and not on a bitcoin-dev thread about the existing BIP 39 standard.</summary>
