    <summary>In a recent email chain, Perry Gibson raised concerns over Trezor's "plausible deniability" scheme which could potentially lead to users being jailed for lying to border security. The scheme involves using alternate passwords based on seeds, but these passphrases can be bruteforced and used as evidence against the user in court. While passphrases can be up to 50 characters long, most users are not aware of this risk. Trezor's blog does not make it clear that passphrases can be bruteforced and used as evidence, and even suggests the opposite. Additionally, the blog fails to mention anti-forensics, which could leave traces of other wallets on the user's computer. It is unclear whether or not Trezor has audited the software sufficiently to ensure that there are no such traces.</summary>
