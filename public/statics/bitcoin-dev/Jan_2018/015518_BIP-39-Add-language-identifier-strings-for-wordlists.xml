    <title>BIP 39: Add language identifier strings for wordlists</title>

    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the use of multilingual support in Bip39, with some questioning whether it is actually being utilized by users. One user pointed out that Copay and its clones use it, but another suggested that if a feature is not widely used and not supported in major wallets, it may have been a mistake to add it in the first place. The discussion then turned to the difficulties faced by Japanese users trying to write down English words for BIP39 seeds. A user responded by asking those who advocate for an English-only mnemonic standard to bet their own money on their ability to carefully write down a backup phrase in a language they do not know. The original poster then requested discussion on appropriate language identification strings for use with the standard, as there are currently seven non-English wordlists available, with four more pending in open pull requests.</summary>
