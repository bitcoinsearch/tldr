    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell and Eric Voskuil debated the idea that miners gain an advantage by mining empty blocks or rejecting higher-fee transactions. While Voskuil argued that this was a myth, Maxwell suggested that there might be some truth to it, given that empty blocks are more conspicuous and could invite retaliation, especially with high levels of mining centralization. However, he also noted that dummy transactions are just as conspicuous, and underfilled blocks are produced without any apparent retaliation. Maxwell further argued that since block space created by a miner is the miner's property, it can be sold or not sold, without any harm to others.</summary>
