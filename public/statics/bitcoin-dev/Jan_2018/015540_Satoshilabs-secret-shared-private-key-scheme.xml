    <summary>On January 10, 2018, Pavol Rusnak started a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding blind host-delegated KDFs. Gregory Maxwell responded with a question about whether or not the userâ€™s computer could run KDF instead of the hardware wallet, but without learning about the keys. Maxwell then linked to a scheme that would enable this, but Rusnak quickly realized that the scheme wouldn't work since the HW wallet wouldn't be able to tell if the host computer was lying or not. He suggested that this issue could be solved by having the computer do more work and checking for consistency afterwards.</summary>
