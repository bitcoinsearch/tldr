    <summary>Natanael and another person were discussing a potential attack on a proposed scheme. The scheme involves publishing a hash commitment, which ends up in the blockchain, followed by the publication of the transaction itself that matches the hash commitment, which miners include in the blockchain. Natanael clarifies that in his proposed second version, a pair consisting of the hash and the transaction is published in the first step. This allows the user to try again if the attacker changes the transaction on the wire.Moreover, Natanael points out that anyone could flood the blockchain with this type of transaction pair, making it necessary to prevent spam or find another way to take the fee.</summary>
