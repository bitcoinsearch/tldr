    <summary>A traveler's plea to the Bitcoin community for plausible deniability on devices such as Trezor has been met with a warning from developer Peter Todd. The scheme could lead to jail time for lying to border security, said Todd. Travelers should not use it in a situation like that, he added. Devices like Trezor can be used to store cryptocurrencies offline and are popular among frequent travelers. Todd's warning follows an incident last year when a NASA employee was detained at the airport and made to unlock his mobile phone.</summary>
