    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list is discussing the use of multilingual support in BIP39. Some members argue that there are already examples of people using languages other than English and suggest mapping an existing ISO/UTF language character standard to the seeds, rather than limiting it to English. Additionally, concerns were raised about auto-correction potentially reinforcing incorrectly saved/written seed backups. Others pointed out that roughly 30% to 40% of Copay users have their backup on a language other than English, and new languages are constantly being requested for support in BIP39. The discussion also touches on the difficulties that certain languages face when using English words as part of the mnemonic phrase. Overall, there is resistance against limiting BIP39 to only English due to the potential cost of losing backup seeds for those who don't speak English.</summary>
