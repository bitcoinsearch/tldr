    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, Ryan argued that the concern over incentive compatibility was not realistic. He noted that the current incentive compatibility already exists in reverse, where miners are refusing transactions that would increase their total fees in the next block. Additionally, Ryan said that Bitcoin is built on various incentive-incompatible behaviors, such as change outputs. He stated that DoS risks are a more significant concern than incentive compatibility. Dave Harding responded to Peter Todd's suggestion that an increase in fee rate could be enough to require transaction replacement. Dave explained that for replacement consideration only by increased feerate to be guaranteed more profitable, one has to assume the mempool contains an effectively continuous distribution of feerates.</summary>
