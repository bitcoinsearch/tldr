    <title>Blockchain Voluntary Fork (Split) Proposal</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange between Chaofan Li and ZmnSCPxj, the latter asks about the worth of Bitcoin A and Bitcoin B and whether they can diverge in price. Li proposes a solution to the scalability issue of blockchain by splitting it into two or more blockchains voluntarily with some identifiers to distinguish them. The coins on one blockchain cannot be sent to the other and everyone gets double bitcoins, each with half the value of an original bitcoin. When sending coins, the wallet should randomly select one blockchain and send through only one if there are enough bitcoins. Li takes inspiration from stock split where the price halves, but the market capitalization remains the same. There is no dilution of every shareholder's total assets. Li believes that voluntary split of bitcoin will prevent the dilution of anyone's bitcoin assets.</summary>
