    <summary>The use of OP_RETURN scripts is the most common way to embed data into the blockchain. However, other methods such as P2SH can be cheaper in terms of effective transaction size. To discourage the use of more harmful methods to embed data into the chain, dexx proposes raising the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes. This will make it the "cheapest" way of embedding data into the chain. The proposal is based on the fact that token sends are usually done one by one, each with a single transaction, which burdens the whole network, especially when an exchange sends out withdrawals. There are solutions for "multi-sends with multi-inputs," but they require more space. Thus, dexx proposes to raise the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes or higher and is willing to provide a pull request if there is positive feedback.</summary>
