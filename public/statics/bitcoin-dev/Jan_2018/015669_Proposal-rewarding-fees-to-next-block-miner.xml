    <title>Proposal: rewarding fees to next block miner</title>

    <summary>A proposal was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the issue of miners filling up blocks with high fee transactions to increase recommended fees. The proposed solution would be to reward the fees of the current block to the miner of the next block (or X blocks after the current one), discouraging the flooding of blocks with fake transactions. This can be implemented through a soft-fork, with miners being required to set an anyone-can-spend output in the coinbase transaction of the block. The downside is that when the fork is activated, miners won't receive any reward for mining blocks for a period of 100 blocks, which could lead to temporary drops in hashrate.</summary>
