    <summary>Matt Corallo, a developer at bitcoin-dev, expressed his concerns regarding the adoption of a new approach without support for a privacy-encouraging wrapper proposed by Greg. This wrapper is important for preserving the privacy of Bitcoin transactions and adding it would not involve much additional overhead in many use-cases. He argued that while permissionless innovation is important, providing the privacy wrapper by default is crucial to the ecosystem. Corallo also pointed out that even from an efficiency standpoint, non-taproot is inefficient. In the case of everyone-agrees simple hash-based branching, it requires a 30% overhead to communicate the commitment to the untaken branch, which is worse in the case of extensive aggregation. Therefore, he believes that there can be no argument in favor of such communications overhead.</summary>
