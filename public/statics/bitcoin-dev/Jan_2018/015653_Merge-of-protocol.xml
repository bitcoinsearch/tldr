    <summary>In a thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user asked if it is technically possible to merge two blockchain protocols and create a resulting coin that combines the strengths of both. While it is possible for communities behind two coins to merge, it is a difficult and risky process requiring agreement from each coin's community as well as between the two communities. The merge block would have two parents and would represent a hard fork on both chains. With 2017 being a year of forks, the idea of merging altcoins with bitcoin or with each other may become more prevalent, especially with the current development of Lightning Network. However, no concrete resources or ideas were provided in the initial post.</summary>
