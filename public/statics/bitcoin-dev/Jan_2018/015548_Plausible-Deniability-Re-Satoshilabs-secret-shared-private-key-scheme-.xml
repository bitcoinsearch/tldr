    <summary>The author of the article shares his longstanding policy of immediately 'dd' any new hard disk or decommissioned old one from start to end with a pseudorandom byte stream, which would make it indistinguishable from disk encryption setup. Although he does this for fun and not for plausibility reasons, he challenges plausible deniability designers to 'dd' a 6TB disk with pseudorandom bytes and try walking it across the U.S. border until it gets searched. In reply to Damian Williamson's comment on the same topic, the author mentions that smart people develop appropriate threat models, keep their security systems confidential and work to increase the popularity of network security systems to reduce how much they stand out. He adds that the only "plausibility" shield is to not seem like someone who is likely to have much and that plausible deniability solves nothing against sophisticated adversaries who possess both brains and patience.</summary>
