    <summary>The author of this message is commenting on Draft NISTIR 8202 Blockchain Technology Overview. They have downloaded the draft and had the Internet Archive save a copy for archival purposes. The author believes that the information presented in the paper is technologically invalid and contains false information. Specifically, the section regarding "8.1.2 Bitcoin Cash (BCC)" is incorrect. The author outlines four corrections: 1) Bitcoin Cash uses the ticker BCH, not BCC; 2) Segwit was not a hardfork, but rather a softfork which is backwards compatible with unupgraded nodes and miners; 3) the original bitcoin blockchain is still called Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash; and 4) technically, Bitcoin Cash was forked from the original Bitcoin blockchain to create the altcoin "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH), so it is not the original chain but a forked one. The author believes that even the smallest amount of research could have prevented these errors and hopes their comments are beneficial to the improvement of the paper.</summary>
