    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrew Poelstra suggested a hardfork for a post-quantum world that would enable spending through quantum-resistant Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) of knowledge of the hashed public key. However, Tim Ruffing responded with a simpler solution using waiting and consensus rather than ZKP. The idea is to include H(classic_pk, tx) in the blockchain and then wait until it is confirmed before revealing classic_pk and tx. This approach is reminiscent of Guy Fawkes "signatures" and was previously proposed by Joseph Bonneau and Andrew Miller for cryptocurrency without asymmetric cryptography. Ruffing shared his thoughts on Twitter and also provided links to the original papers regarding Fawkes signatures.</summary>
