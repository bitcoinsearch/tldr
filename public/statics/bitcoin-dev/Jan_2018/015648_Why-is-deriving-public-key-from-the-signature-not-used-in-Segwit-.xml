    <summary>Aymeric Vitte has asked about a specific transaction on blockchain.info. The scriptsig for this transaction is provided, but there is no pubkey available. The reason for this is that the pubkey can be found in the scriptPubKey of vout 0 of another transaction, which is being spent by the current transaction.</summary>
