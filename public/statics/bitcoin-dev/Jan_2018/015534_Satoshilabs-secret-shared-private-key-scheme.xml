    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the "plausible deniability" scheme of Trezor. One of the members suggested that it could lead to people going to jail for lying to border security as alternate passwords based on seeds can be easily brute forced. The passphrase scheme allows a maximum of 50 characters to be used, and even with the HD seed, the search space is too large to brute force. However, there may be a weakness in the scheme that has not been identified yet. Another member shared a personal experience where they were asked to unlock their phone at the border and how the "plausible deniability" feature could have been useful in such a situation. However, the first member warned against using it as it could lead to serious consequences if caught lying to customs.</summary>
