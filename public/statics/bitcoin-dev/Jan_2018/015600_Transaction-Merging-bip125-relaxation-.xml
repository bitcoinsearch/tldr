    <title>Transaction Merging (bip125 relaxation)</title>

    <summary>The author of a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has described their idea for "transaction merging" on the fly. The proposal would allow users to merge multiple unconfirmed transactions, stripping extraneous inputs and change as they go, and pay them in one transaction. Currently, this is not possible because of the bip125 rule: "The replacement transaction pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions." The author's question is whether it is possible or reasonable to relax this rule. They suggest that if there was a straightforward way to merge N unconfirmed transactions, it could offer some pretty nice savings for everyone.</summary>
