    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list centered around a suggestion to remove the word "satoshi" from the BIP39 English wordlist. The concern was that if a malicious third party discovered a word list that looked like a seed, they would test every occurrence of "satoshi" for a lead to a seed. However, some argued that removing a word or changing a list is impossible as verification of an existing mnemonic requires the list. To change one word, an alternative to BIP0039 would need to be provided to cope with alternative words, or all the words would need to be changed to a completely new set of 2048 English words so that it is clear which wordlist is in use. One suggestion was to only use the most common words that meet the other criteria.</summary>
