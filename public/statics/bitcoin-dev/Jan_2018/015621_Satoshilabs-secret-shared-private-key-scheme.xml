    <summary>The context mentions a scheme, which is linked to a post on the bitcointalk forum. Additionally, the author discovered that the Makwa hashing function, which received recognition in the Password Hashing Competition, supports delegation and is similar to the suggested scheme. However, both schemes have two drawbacks: there is no proof that the host computes what they are supposed to do, and delegation is much slower than normal computation. The Makwa paper suggests that delegation is typically 100 to 1000 times slower. Due to these limitations, the author doubts that any scheme exists that would suit their needs.</summary>
