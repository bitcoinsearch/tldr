    <summary>In an email exchange, Matthew Clancy disagreed with the assertion that removing or changing a word in a mnemonic phrase is impossible as it requires the list for verification. Clancy suggested that all that would need to be done is to select another word not on the 2048 list and agree by convention that the words 'satoshi' or the alternative word will represent the same number on the list. This convention would serve as an alternative to BIP0039, which provides a standard for creating deterministic wallets using mnemonic phrases.</summary>
