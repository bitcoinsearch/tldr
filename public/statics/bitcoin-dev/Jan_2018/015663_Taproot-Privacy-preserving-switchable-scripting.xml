    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, a user named Tim Ruffing expressed concerns about cross-input signature aggregation. He suggested replacing the first n-1 signatures with a single-byte push where a signature is required to indicate aggregation and placing the combined signature in the last input at the required position. Russell O'Connor responded that a new field would have to be added to the P2P transaction structure for the aggregated signature since there isn't a good place to put it in the existing structure.O'Connor proposed using the witness reserved value mechanism in BIP 141 to add block commitments to this new field. He also suggested adjusting the discount on the weight of the new aggregated signature tx field so that even a single input taproot using the aggregated signature system ends up no more expensive than a single input segwit P2WPKH. Overall, O'Connor believes that there will be some leeway to make these adjustments.</summary>
