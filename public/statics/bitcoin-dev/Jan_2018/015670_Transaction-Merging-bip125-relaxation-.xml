    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd suggested requiring an increase in both feerate and absolute fee for replacing transactions in the mempool. He initially considered only requiring an increase in feerate, but abandoned that idea due to the need to consider the state of the entire mempool. For example, if a miner has a mempool with 750,000 vbytes and two 250-vbyte transactions each paying a feerate of 100 nanobitcoins per vbyte (50k total) are replaced with one 325-vbyte transaction paying a feerate of 120 nBTC (39k total), the miner's potential income from mining the next block is reduced by 11k nBTC. Even if the miner has enough transactions to fill the next block, the problem can still exist if the mempool doesn't contain effectively continuous distribution of feerates. Dave also added that it would be good for the mempool to have an effectively continuous distribution of feerates to help keep block production regular sans subsidy.</summary>
