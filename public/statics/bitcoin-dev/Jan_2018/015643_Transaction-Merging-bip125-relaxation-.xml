    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding BIP125's incentive compatibility continued with Gregory Maxwell clarifying that the replacement requires an increase in the fee rate. Rhavar had previously pointed out that the proposal may not be generally rational to accept a replacement transaction of a lower fee rate, assuming a competitive mempool. Peter Todd had initially considered requiring only an increase in fee rate, but later opted for the simpler criteria of both a feerate and absolute fee increase.</summary>
