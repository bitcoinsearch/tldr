    <summary>The term "plausible deniability" is being used in the context of Trezor's "plausible deniability" scheme, which could result in users being jailed for lying to border security if their alternate passwords based on seeds are brute forced. While passphrases can be long, most users may not understand the risk. Information does not exist in isolation and it is important to obviate any need to deny anything at all rather than relying on plausible deniability. The worst part about plausible deniability schemes is that they can backfire quite badly and lead to very serious consequences. It is worth noting that the wallet software itself may leave traces of the other wallets on the computer and data obtained via the network could tie one's identity to their wallet in different ways. The post highlights that cross-correlated analysis data customs agents have immediate access to, which could give plenty of cause to keep one locked up in a small room while their hard drive is examined for evidence that Trezor apps handled addresses already known to be linked to them.</summary>
