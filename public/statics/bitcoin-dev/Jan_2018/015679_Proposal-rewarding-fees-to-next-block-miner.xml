    <title>Proposal: rewarding fees to next block miner</title>

    <summary>In a recent bitcoin-dev email thread, Eric Voskuil and an unknown source debunked the myth that miners have an advantage over those buying block space. Voskuil believes this idea is complete nonsense and even steel-manned it by arguing that empty blocks could invite retaliation due to high levels of mining centralization creating retaliation exposure. However, he points out that dummy transactions are hardly less conspicuous and many nodes log when blocks show up containing transactions they've never seen before. Furthermore, underfilled blocks are produced by Bitmain's Antpool without any retaliation forthcoming.</summary>
