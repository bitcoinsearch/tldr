    <summary>In a discussion about the security of seeds for hardware wallets, concerns were raised about the strength of the key derivation function and the possibility of brute force attacks. However, the likelihood of attackers combining both crypto-nerd methods and physical attacks such as the $5 wrench attack was deemed low. The suggestion was made to create secret accounts with different seeds in hardware wallets to protect against muggers without risking user funds due to mistyped passwords. Additionally, using a checksum to reject invalid passwords while still allowing advanced users to override it was recommended. Encfs, a virtual file encryption filesystem, already offers this feature with its --anykey flag.</summary>
