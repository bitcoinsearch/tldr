    <summary>The context of the conversation is regarding BIP39, a standard used for generating and recovering Bitcoin wallets. The proposal is to add canonical native language strings to identify each wordlist and short ASCII language codes to promote interface consistency between implementations. Sjors Provoost suggests that a new standard should be created where words are mapped to integers rather than literal strings, with a mapping from original language words to matching English words. Alan Evans points out that seed generation in BIP0039 requires no dictionary what-so-ever, but Sjors suggests that a replacement for BIP-39 would be a good opportunity to produce a better English dictionary. There is some discussion around the use of multisig wallets and confusion around BIP32's purpose. Finally, Ayms provides links to Github repositories for Bitcoin transactions, Zcash wallets, and Bitcoin wallets, as well as a torrent dynamic blocklist and 10 M passwords list.</summary>
