    <summary>I disagree with the statement that changing a word or list in a mnemonic code is impossible. The argument against it is that the verification of an existing mnemonic requires the list, and changing one word would require providing an alternative to BIP0039 or changing all the words to a new set of 2048 English words. However, the solution proposed is to simply select another word not on the 2048 list and agree that it represents the same number as 'satoshi' or the original word by convention. This implementation seems fairly simple.</summary>
