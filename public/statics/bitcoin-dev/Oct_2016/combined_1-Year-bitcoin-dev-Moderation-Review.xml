    <summary>A member of the bitcoin community has suggested that the bitcoin-discuss mailing list should have been opt-out instead of opt-in. This has led to a request for information on subscription counts for both bitcoin-discuss and bitcoin-dev mailing lists. An opt-in system requires individuals to actively choose to subscribe to a particular group or mailing list, while an opt-out system automatically subscribes individuals unless they take action to unsubscribe. The decision to use an opt-in or opt-out system can have implications for how many people are subscribed to a group or list.Jeremy Rubin, a member of the Bitcoin development team, believes that moderation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list may be stifling discussion and damaging the value of the list. He suggests that since moderation was introduced, there has been a significant drop in the number of messages posted on the list, with some members self-censoring for fear of moderation. Rubin believes that people are not writing emails as much, which reduces the value of the list. Henning Kopp agrees with Rubinâ€™s assessment and suggests finding a way to get the bitcoin-discuss list going.Rubin acknowledges that moderation was necessary at the time it was introduced but argues that the community should now consider reopening the communication channel. While non-development talk should not clog the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a way should be found to get the bitcoin-discuss list going, which has not yet reached a critical mass of contributors. The discussion highlights the importance of communication channels in the development process and how too much moderation can hinder communication and the exchange of ideas within a community.</summary>
