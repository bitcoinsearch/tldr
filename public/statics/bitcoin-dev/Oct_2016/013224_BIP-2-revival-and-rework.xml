    <summary>Tom Zander had suggested that BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) should be a public domain with a CC-BY option. A discussion on the licensing of BIPs took place where it was pointed out that BIP1 requires PD or OPL but does not forbid other licenses. Similarly, BIP2 requires an acceptable license but does not forbid other choices. It was clarified that BIP2 does not forbid releasing work under PD in legislations where this is possible, despite the goal being to no longer allow PD as the only copyright option. Majority of BIP authors have previously chosen PD as the only option.</summary>
