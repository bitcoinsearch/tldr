    <summary>Tom Zander, a Bitcoin developer, responded to criticisms of Bitcoin's flexible transactions (FT) by Matt Corallo. Corallo called FT unsafe due to the current codebase's security holes and pointed out out-of-bound memory accesses in its 80-LoC deserialize method. In response, Zander welcomed feedback and noted that FT is safer because it changes only two concepts compared to SegWit's ten. He also explained that unit tests didn't hit any exploitable issues, and Valgrind reported similar issues in secp256k and CKey::MakeNewKey, as with Core. Finally, Zander encouraged Corallo to examine the rest of the code, stating that FT's approach is straightforward and simple.</summary>
