    <summary>Bitcoin Core's 0.13.1 release is set to include segregated witness (BIP 141, 143, 144, 145) for Bitcoin mainnet; it has been tested extensively on testnet and in other software. According to a recent proposal, BIP 141's start time will be set to November 15, 2016, 0:00 UTC (unix time 1479168000). However, this is just an initial date and signalling can only begin once the following three conditions are met - (1) the date passes, (2) a full retarget window of 2016 blocks with 95% signalling the version bit (bit 1 for BIP141), and (3) a fallow period consisting of another 2016 blocks. The proposal follows the BIP9 recommendation to set the versionbits start time a month in the future as well as discussion in the last IRC meeting.</summary>
