    <summary>In a conversation on the Bitcoin Development mailing list, an individual suggests that "Share alike" be required and "Attribution" be optional when it comes to licensing for BIPs. However, someone points out that there is no Creative Commons license option that requires Share Alike and allows Attribution as an option. The suggestion is made that CC0 would be the best license for BIPs in general, with the option of using MIT/BSD or CC-BY if authors are concerned about proper attribution. It is argued that more restrictive licenses are not suitable for BIPs and that the BIP repository is not the place to promote Open Access. BIP 2 allows for such licenses, but does not recommend them. The current form of BIP 2 addresses feedback from last year and it is suggested that it move forward in the near future if there are no objections.</summary>
