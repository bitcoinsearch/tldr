    <summary>The suggestion has been made that bitcoin-discuss should have been opt-out instead of opt-in. This raises the question of how many people are subscribed to bitcoin-discuss and bitcoin-dev. The author of the message is requesting this information from the moderators. It is unclear why they want to know this information, but it could be related to the suggestion about the opt-in/opt-out system.It is important to note that an opt-in system requires individuals to actively choose to subscribe to a particular group or mailing list. In contrast, an opt-out system automatically subscribes individuals unless they take action to unsubscribe. The decision to use an opt-in or opt-out system can have implications for how many people are subscribed to a group or list.Overall, the author's message brings up interesting questions about the subscription counts for these two bitcoin-related discussion groups and the potential impact of using an opt-in versus opt-out system.</summary>
