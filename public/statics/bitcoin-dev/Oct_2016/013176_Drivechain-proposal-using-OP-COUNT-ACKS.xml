    <summary>The conversation is between Sergio Demian Lerner and Peter Todd. Sergio accused Peter of down voting a proposal that would benefit the Bitcoin community, including Peter's future children, solely because of a personal attack on Sergio. Peter responded by saying that he is suspicious of any proposals coming from Sergio or his colleagues due to their history of patenting Bitcoin consensus technology. He believes such patents threaten decentralization. Peter suggests that Sergio rectify his dangerous and unethical behavior by following Blockstream's patent pledges. Sergio then proposes the drivechain for RSK's two-way pegged blockchain. The conversation ends with Peter providing his contact information.</summary>
