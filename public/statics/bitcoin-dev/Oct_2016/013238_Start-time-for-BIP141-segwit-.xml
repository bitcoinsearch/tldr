    <summary>The implementation of SegWit has been met with objections due to its long wait time and the fact that some wallets are taking a "wait and see" approach. According to a page linked by Tom Zander, the vast majority of wallets are not ready for SegWit. Wallets may not want to invest resources adding support for a feature that may not be activated. The alternative, Flexible Transactions, may be a safer option. If all wallets do support SegWit, they need to be rolled out and people need to actually download those updates. This takes time, and 2 months after the lock-in of SegWit would be the minimum safe time for people to upgrade. However, this is not how BIP9 works and changing the initial date won't help those who haven't started to work on supporting SegWit. After activation, there will still be plenty of time for those taking a "wait and see" approach to upgrade their software to support SegWit. The new features are not a requirement after activation, and it may take some time for them to reach users.</summary>
