    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on October 1, 2016, Rusty Russell noted that he could envision a situation where users would want to look only at high bits to confirm their transaction is valid in a block with at least a certain difficulty. However, he questioned why only the lower endian was being used. Luke Dashjr suggested using segwit versioning to enable bitwise operations like OP_AND and extending the validity of opcodes like OP_LESSTHAN, allowing for 256-bit inputs to solve this problem.</summary>
