    <summary>On October 16th, 2016, Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, conducted a survey where he asked businesses and individuals how long it would take them to upgrade to a new release. He noted that nobody said it would take them more than two weeks. Andresen believes that if someone is running their own validation code, they should be sophisticated enough to mitigate any risks associated with SegWit activation on their own. In addition, there has been a page up for several months that gauges whether or not wallets are ready for SegWit. Unfortunately, the page hasn't been updated since May. However, several wallets have finished or are close to finishing their support for SegWit. Andresen does not want anyone to lose money due to faulty wallets, but he also believes that developers have had almost a year to tinker with SegWit and make sure the wallet isn't poorly written. He notes that this is not an untested, mostly unknown feature that's being slipped out at the last minute.</summary>
