    <summary>Tom Zander has voiced his concerns over the proposed fallow period for upgrading to a new release in a thread on bitcoin-dev. He suggested that two months should be the minimum time allowed for upgrades since anyone who wants to be safe would need to upgrade. Gavin Andresen responded by saying he had asked businesses and individuals how long it would take them to upgrade to a new release in the past, and nobody said it would take more than two weeks. However, Zander pointed out that SPV users do not need to update after BIP109, but they do need to have a new wallet when SegWit transactions are being sent to them, meaning this upgrade will also affect end-users, not just businesses. He suggested two months is even too fast, prompting Matt to recommend that readers refer to an excellent thread on soft fork risks at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/012014.html and respond there instead of getting off-topic for this thread.</summary>
