    <title>Drivechain proposal using OP_COUNT_ACKS</title>

    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Russell O'Connor argued that a proposal to use OP_COUNT_ACKS in transactions was objectionable as it could cause transactions to fluctuate between acceptable and unacceptable with no double spend occurring. However, he acknowledged that such transactions were less likely to be used for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks as they could only be included by miners. Transactions redeeming outputs containing or referencing OP_COUNT_ACKS are not broadcast by the network and can only be included by miners. Therefore, O'Connor saw no issue with invalidating transactions after the liveness time expires, as without an expiration, polls could last forever and fail to provide DoS protection for block validation.</summary>
