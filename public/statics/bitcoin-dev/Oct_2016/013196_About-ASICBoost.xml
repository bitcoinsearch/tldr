    <summary>In an email dated October 2, 2016, Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo expressed concerns about the Bitcoin Foundation's potential disregard for Bitcoin's future centralization. He criticized the idea of asking the foundation to pay a license fee to avoid holding the rest of the Bitcoin mining community hostage. Corallo also mentioned the lack of transparent licensing and transparency in public discussions after the patent had been filed. However, he acknowledged that they cannot change the past and instead suggested focusing on collaboration for the future.</summary>
