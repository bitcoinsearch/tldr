    <summary>Bitcoin Core's 0.13.1 release was the first to include segregated witness for Bitcoin mainnet after being tested on testnet and other software. According to BIP9 recommendation, the versionbits start time is set a month in the future. Pieter Wuille proposed setting BIP 141's start time to November 15, 2016, at 0:00 UTC (unix time 1479168000). It is mostly in line with BIP 9's proposed defaults, which seems like an appropriate choice. However, this is just a lower bound on the time when the versionbits signalling can begin. Activation on the network requires the passing of this date, a full retarget window of 2016 blocks with 95% signalling the version bit (bit 1 for BIP141), and a fallow period consisting of another 2016 blocks.</summary>
