    <summary>BIP 2 is a new proposal that aims to replace BIP 1 in specifying how the entire Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process works. The proposal is currently believed to be the final draft for the new BIP process. In order to become active, the Process BIP will require rough consensus from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The procedure for its own activation is specified in BIP 2 due to the absence of a clear process defined in BIP 1. If any objections are raised towards the proposed BIP process as specified in BIP 2, it is recommended to voice them as soon as possible. The link to the full proposal can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki. It is important to review the proposal thoroughly and provide feedback if necessary. Luke, the sender of this message, thanks everyone for their review of the proposal and encourages them to voice their concerns or objections if any.</summary>
