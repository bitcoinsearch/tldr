    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner, co-founder of RSK, has proposed a new segwit-based and soft-forked opcode called OP_COUNT_ACKS to count acknowledgement tags in coinbase fields. The resulting totals are then pushed into the script stack. The proposal is designed with several properties in mind including interoperability with the scripting system, zero risk of invalidating a block, no additional computation during blockchain management and re-organization, and strong protection from DoS attacks. Lerner will be discussing the design rationale, improvements, changes and ideas at the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin event.</summary>
