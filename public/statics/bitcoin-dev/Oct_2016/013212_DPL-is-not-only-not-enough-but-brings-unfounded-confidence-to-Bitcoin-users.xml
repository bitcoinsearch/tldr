    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential advantage of a dedicated Bitcoin-related defensive patent pool, similar to Linux's Open Invention Network. The idea is to strategically deploy patent licenses to encourage cooperation and punish aggressors. Additionally, it is suggested that changing the Bitcoin Core license to something like Apache2/LGPL3 dual license could ensure the copyright license also has anti-patent protections. The use of Apache2.0 license for new releases and contributions can be feasible, while already-existing code and previous releases will remain under the MIT license. The discussion also highlights the benefits of using Apache2.0 license, which contains an explicit patent license grant and terminates that license if the licensee asserts a claim alleging that the covered work infringes a patent.</summary>
