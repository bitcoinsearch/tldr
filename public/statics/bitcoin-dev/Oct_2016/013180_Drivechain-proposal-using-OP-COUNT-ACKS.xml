    <summary>The context revolves around a proposal that benefits the Bitcoin community, and Peter Todd's suggestion to have Rootstock adopt a legally binding patent pledge or license to ensure their developments remain free and open. Sergio Demian Lerner, who is associated with Rootstock, mentions that coding has been their priority until now and they will discuss prioritizing the legal aspect with the team. He suggests that it took Blockstream several years to decide on adopting the Defensive Patent License (DPL), which involves high costs for patenting. Sergio adds that RSK has not filed any patents and is not planning to do so. He also clarifies that drivechains is not RSK's idea but Paul Sztorc's. Peter Todd insists on the adoption of DPL, as it is minimally intrusive and beneficial for the Bitcoin community.</summary>
