    <summary>In an email thread on October 15, 2016, Tom Zander suggested that BIPs should be licensed as public domain (aka CC0) and a CC-BY option only. However, he questioned the inclusion of MIT/BSD in the list of licenses for BIPs, which led to a discussion about licensing requirements for BIPs. The conversation also touched upon BIP 2 and its requirement for copyright options besides public domain. While some members expressed concerns over this requirement, it was clarified that BIP 2 does not prohibit PD in jurisdictions where it is recognized as legal. The email thread concluded with suggestions for improving the process of gathering community consensus, including reaching out to more people and making clear any proposed changes with reasoning. Luke was identified as the BIP champion of BIP 2.</summary>
