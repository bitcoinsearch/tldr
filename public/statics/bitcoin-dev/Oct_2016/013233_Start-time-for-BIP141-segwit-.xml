    <summary>According to a post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, SPV wallets will continue to function as normal without upgrade. Full nodes will provide transactions to SPV in a format they understand and SPV will accept the transaction since they are not doing any validation anyway. However, end users may want to upgrade to benefit from lower transaction fees when sending transactions. If they don't upgrade, that means the fee is too low for them to care, which is good news. Tom Zander, who made the post, suggested a minimum of 2 months for the fallow period. This upgrade affects not only businesses but also end users. Gavin Andresen had asked businesses and individuals how long it would take them to upgrade to a new release over the last year or two. No one said it would take them more than two weeks.</summary>
