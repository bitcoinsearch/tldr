    <title>1 Year bitcoin-dev Moderation Review</title>

    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development team, Jeremy, has questioned whether moderation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is stifling discussion and damaging the value of the list. While acknowledging that moderation was probably implemented for good reason, he suggests that it may have been taken too far and could be discouraging people from writing emails for fear of being moderated. He believes that the rate of moderated posts does not accurately reflect the effect of the "chilling effect" of moderation, which reduces the rate of people writing emails and offers a valuable communication channel. He suggests that this issue should be discussed as a community in order to open up the communication channel once again. Another member of the community, Henning Kopp, agrees that non-development talk should not clog the bitcoin-dev mailing list, but suggests that a way should be found to get the bitcoin-discuss list going, which has not yet reached a critical mass of contributors.</summary>
