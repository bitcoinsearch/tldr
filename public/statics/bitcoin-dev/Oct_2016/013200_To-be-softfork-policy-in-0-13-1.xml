    <summary>The release of segwit 0.13.1 has brought forth three default relay and mining policy rules that may become softfork proposals soon. It is important for users to note that a script spendable in pre-segregated witness system would not necessarily be spendable as a P2WPKH or P2WSH script. Developers should test the scripts on testnet with the default relay policy turned on and with a small amount of money after BIP141 is activated on mainnet before large-scale deployment in the production network.The first rule states that only compressed public keys are accepted in P2WPKH and P2WSH, while the second requires the argument of OP_IF/NOTIF in P2WSH to be minimal. The third rule mandates the signature(s) to be null vector(s) if an OP_CHECKSIG or OP_CHECKMULTISIG fails for both pre-segregated witness script and P2WSH. These rules have been updated in BIP141 and 143, which can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/459/files.</summary>
