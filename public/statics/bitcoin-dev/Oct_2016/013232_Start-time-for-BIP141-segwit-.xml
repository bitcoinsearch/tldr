    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list involved the length of the "fallow period" for SegWit activation. Tom Zander suggested a minimum of two months, while Gavin Andresen argued that businesses and individuals he had spoken to said it would take no more than two weeks to upgrade to a new release. Andresen also stated that if someone is not running their own validation code, they are not actually using Bitcoin, and therefore their ease in transition is irrelevant. He added that those who are sophisticated enough to run their own validation code should be able to figure out how to mitigate any risks associated with SegWit activation.</summary>
