    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer, has declared himself and any technology companies he controls as “Defensive” by committing to offer a Defensive Patent License (DPL) for any of his patents either existing or future, to any DPL User. Neither Todd nor any companies that he controls have any patents at this time. The announcement was also published on his website, petertodd.org, and includes a link to the txid of a Bitcoin transaction containing the message. On the advice of his lawyer, Todd is currently offering only a specific version of the DPL. The language "all technology companies I control" is there to avoid any complications with non-technology companies that he may control in the future.</summary>
