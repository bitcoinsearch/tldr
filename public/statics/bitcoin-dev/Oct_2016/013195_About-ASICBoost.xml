    <summary>The Bitcoin Foundation's lack of transparency regarding licensing has come under fire after they failed to license a patent from Sergio Lerner. In 2013, Lerner reached out to the foundation asking if they would license his patent on fair terms. The foundation declined, stating that it did not believe the proprietary patent would be significant. The lack of transparent licensing has raised concerns about centralization pressure and the potential harm it could cause Bitcoin in the long-term. Matt Corallo has criticized the foundation for its handling of the situation, suggesting that their disregard for future centralization is worrying.</summary>
