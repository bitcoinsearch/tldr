    <summary>The current codebase of Bitcoin Classic is riddled with blatant and massive security holes, including out-of-bound and exploitable memory accesses in the 80-LoC deserialize method. While flexible transactions have been called "safer", they still present a risk to the community that has been in desperate need of fixes for several years. A proposal for an alternative will take at least a year to complete given a large team of qualified developers. A discussion on soft-fork security provides a more detailed understanding of upgrades required, which should be addressed in that thread instead of this one. There have been objections to the implementation of SegWit for a long time, and some wallets are taking a "wait and see" approach. The majority of wallets are not ready, and may not want to invest resources adding support for a feature that will never be activated. Flexible Transactions may be a much safer alternative, but the community won't know until it's actually locked in. Even if all wallets support SegWit, it will take time for them to be rolled out and for people to download updates. At least two months after the lock-in of SegWit would be the minimum safe time for people to upgrade.</summary>
