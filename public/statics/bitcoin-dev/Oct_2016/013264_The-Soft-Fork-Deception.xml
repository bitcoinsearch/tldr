    <summary>The conversation started by Andrew on the Bitcoin development mailing list has been moved to Bitcoin-discuss. Andrew had been reading about soft forks in Bitcoin Core and noticed that there was a deceptive notion that soft forks did not force users to upgrade software. He argues that even though past soft forks still allow old nodes to accept blocks under tighter rules as valid, miners and users who want to use the old rules are no longer able to do so. In contrast, a hard fork would be required to facilitate this. Douglas Roark responds by questioning Andrew's definition of soft forks and suggests that the only way to avoid conflicts when deploying new features is to remove previously "soft forked" rules for non-segwit transactions and require them only for segwit transactions. Andrew proposes creating a new client called Bitcoin Authentic if his proposal isn't accepted.</summary>
