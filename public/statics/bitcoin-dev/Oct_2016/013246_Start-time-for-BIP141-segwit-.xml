    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, concern was raised over the status of wallet developer updates for SegWit support. While some developers have already worked on SegWit support, there are worries that inadequate testing and vetting may lead to problems. The controversial nature of SegWit has led to fears of network splitting, and some are calling for an extended "fallow period" to ensure safety. Despite this, FlexTrans is off topic in this discussion and no issues have been found with it so far. Tom Zander reminds people to take the safety of Bitcoin seriously, and asserts that extending the fallow time for safety is not a big deal.</summary>
