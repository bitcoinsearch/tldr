    <title>Start time for BIP141 (segwit)</title>

    <summary>Pieter Wuille through Bitcoin-dev mailing list has proposed to set the BIP 141's start time to November 15, 2016, 0:00 UTC for Bitcoin Core's 0.13.1 release. This will be a lower bound on the time when the versionbits signalling can begin. Activation on the network requires this date to pass, a full retarget window of 2016 blocks with 95% signaling the version bit (bit 1 for BIP141), and a fallow period consisting of another 2016 blocks. The fallow period is believed to be too short and it is suggested to have a minimum of two months for anyone who wants to stay safe. Tom Zander also requested to comment why the much safer and smaller Flexible Transactions are not being used.</summary>
