    <summary>From the given context, it is not clear what rule is being referred to. However, the discussion seems to be about implementing decentralised sidechains. The process of redemption from a side chain involves two phases. Firstly, the person unpegging the funds provides proof that they have locked the funds on the side chain, and are eligible to withdraw the funds, along with putting up a bounty. Secondly, there is a time-locked period where others can collect the bounty by providing a fraud proof that the locked funds given in the proof have actually been double spent. This two-phase system does not violate any rules, however, it is unclear which specific rules are being referred to. It should be noted that the speaker has not been following sidechain developments closely, so their understanding may not be complete.</summary>
