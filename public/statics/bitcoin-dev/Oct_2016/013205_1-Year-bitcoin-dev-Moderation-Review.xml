    <title>1 Year bitcoin-dev Moderation Review</title>
    <updated>2023-06-11T20:20:06.643770+00:00</updated>

    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin, has suggested that the mailing list's policy of moderation be reviewed. Rubin believes that since moderation was introduced, the number of messages per day has dropped significantly, making the community less accessible. Rubin suggests that people may now self-censor because they think their email will be moderated as trolling or spam. Consequently, Rubin believes that people are not writing emails as much, which reduces the value of the list. Henning Kopp agrees with Rubinâ€™s assessment and suggests finding a way to get bitcoin-discuss going. However, he adds that there is still a need to keep non-development talk off the developer list. The discussion highlights the importance of communication channels in the development process and how too much moderation can hinder communication and the exchange of ideas within a community.</summary>
