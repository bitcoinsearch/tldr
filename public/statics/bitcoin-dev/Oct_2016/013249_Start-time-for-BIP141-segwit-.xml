    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion on October 16, 2016, Tom Zander suggested that having a longer fallow period would make the system safer. However, another member of the group questioned how this would work. Once a fork reaches LOCKED_IN status, it will become active after the grace period is over. The question remains: how does a longer grace period make anything safer? Zander mentioned rolling back changes, but there is no mechanism for rollbacks, and the point of soft fork signaling is to avoid the need for rollbacks because miners have signaled their support.</summary>
