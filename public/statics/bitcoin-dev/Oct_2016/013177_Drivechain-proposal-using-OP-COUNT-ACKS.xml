    <summary>In an email exchange on October 2nd, 2016 between Sergio Demian Lerner and Peter Todd, Lerner questioned Todd's down vote of his free and open-source Rootstock proposal, which would benefit the Bitcoin community. Todd had allegedly attacked Lerner personally without basis, prompting Lerner to suggest that Rootstock adopt a legally binding patent pledge/license to continue collaborating. Lerner recommended that Rootstock adopt the Defensive Patent License (DPL), which he planned to do for his own consulting company. He argued that if Rootstock did not plan on obtaining any patents for offensive purposes, then adopting the DPL would not be intrusive. Lerner urged Todd to rectify the situation so they could continue working together to improve Bitcoin.</summary>
