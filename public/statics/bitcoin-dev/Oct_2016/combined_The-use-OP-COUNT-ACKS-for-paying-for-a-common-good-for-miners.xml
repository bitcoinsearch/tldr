    <summary>OP_COUNT_ACKS is a Bitcoin feature that allows users to pay for any service miners can provide as a group for the common good. This could include fee payment smoothing over many blocks or even jointly buying better internet services to reduce latency between them. Users can send Bitcoins to a script containing OP_COUNT_ACKS which requires 51% of miner's approval and add a special text tag such as "FOR-MINERS-TO-BUY-X" to such outputs. If accepted, a transaction will be created to redeem those funds. On October 3, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner proposed a use case for OP_COUNT_ACKS, which would enable users to pay miners for any service they can provide as a group for the common good. This approach could help address the tragedy of the commons problem that Bitcoin may face in the long term by users crowdfunding mining of the following n blocks. By sending bitcoins to a script containing OP_COUNT_ACKS requiring 51% of miners approval and adding a special text tag to such outputs such as "FOR-MINERS-TO-BUY-X", users can send bitcoins to miners and ask the majority of them to vote on the proposal. If accepted, it would create a transaction to redeem those funds.This system could help improve the efficiency of Bitcoin by allowing users to collectively pay miners for services that benefit the entire network. For example, jointly buying better internet service could reduce latency between miners, resulting in faster block creation and improved network performance. The use of OP_COUNT_ACKS would allow for a more democratic decision-making process among miners, with a majority vote required for a proposal to be accepted. Overall, the use of OP_COUNT_ACKS has the potential to address the tragedy of the commons problem that Bitcoin may face in the long term, by encouraging users to fund the mining of the following n blocks. By collectively paying for services that benefit the entire network, users can help ensure the long-term sustainability and success of Bitcoin.</summary>
