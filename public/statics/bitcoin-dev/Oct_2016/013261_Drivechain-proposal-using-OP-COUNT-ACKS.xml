    <summary>The discussion involves proposals on how to improve the Bitcoin protocol through a softfork. One proposal suggests using an unused code instead of OP_NOPx, which should be reserved for simple VERIFY-type codes that do not write to the stack. Another proposal considers the use of a new witness version and an additional field in the witness to indicate script version. However, the current BIP cannot make use of this as it is not yet enforced. The discussion also touches on the issue of limited coinbase space being overloaded with different purposes and proposes using a dummy scriptPubKey or OP_RETURN output. There are concerns regarding the potential shortage of poll space due to an artificial limit. Additionally, there is a question about whether an ack-poll is valid only for one transaction and if full nodes could prune corresponding ack-poll data. It is clarified that there is no ack-poll data stored except for the coinbase field cache, which periodically cleans itself by using a FIFO approach. Finally, the discussion addresses the concern about the risk of invalidating a block and whether transactions redeeming a script using OP_COUNT_ACKS would be non-standard. It is suggested that OP_COUNT_ACKS must be non-standard because witversion != 0 are already non-standard.</summary>
