    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner, Bitcoiner and RSK co-founder, has proposed a drivechain in the BIP draft which he hopes will be used as the base of all new 2-way-pegged blockchains that can take Bitcoin the currency to new niches and test new use cases. The drivechain is designed with several properties in mind, including zero risk of invalidating a block, no additional computation during blockchain management and re-organization, strong protection from DoS attacks, minimum block space consumption, and zero risk of cross-secondary chain invalidation. The full BIP plus a reference implementation can be found on GitHub, but the code is still unaudited. Sergio Demian Lerner will be available to discuss the design rationale, improvement, changes, and ideas at ScalingBitcoin.</summary>
