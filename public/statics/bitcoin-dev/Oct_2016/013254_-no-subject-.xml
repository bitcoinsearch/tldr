    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo and Tom Zander engaged in a discussion regarding flexible transactions (FT) and their safety compared to the current codebase. Corallo pointed out that the current codebase has "blatant and massive security holes" and questioned why Zander kept calling FT "safer." Zander responded by saying that he welcomes feedback on his code and that FT is simpler and changes fewer concepts than SegWit. Corallo then went on to give an example of what he saw as exploitable memory accesses in Zander's code if FT were turned on. However, Zander claimed that his unit test didn't hit any of these issues and that valgrind only reports similar issues in other parts of the code. He asked Corallo to report any specific issues to him off-list or on Github. Finally, Corallo suggested that any proposed alternative to the current codebase should not take at least a year to complete given a large team of qualified developers. Zander replied that he thinks FT fits the bill just fine and encouraged Corallo to check out the rest of the code to see its simplicity.</summary>
