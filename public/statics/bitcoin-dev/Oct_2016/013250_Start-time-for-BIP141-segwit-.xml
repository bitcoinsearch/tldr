    <summary>Bitcoin Core's 0.13.1 release is to include segregated witness (BIP 141, 143, 144, 145) for Bitcoin mainnet, which has been tested on testnet and other software. The BIP9 recommendation advises setting the versionbits start time a month in the future, and after discussion during the last IRC meeting, it was proposed that BIP 141's start time be set to November 15, 2016, 0:00 UTC. Currently, python-bitcoinlib does not have support for segwit, but it is backwards compatible with existing nodes and wallets, meaning there is no rush to upgrade. OpenTimestamps also uses python-bitcoinlib and will not be impacted by segwit as it is a softfork, so developers can stagger full-node upgrades to protect against bugs.</summary>
