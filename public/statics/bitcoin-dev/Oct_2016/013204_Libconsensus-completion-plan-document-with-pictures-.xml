    <summary>A developer who previously tried to encapsulate consensus code without exposing anything else has created a repository for phase 2 of the project. The developer was unsuccessful in getting review before, so he decided to turn "phase 2" into "expose verifyHeader" again. The repository includes images, latex file and pdf. Some phases can be done in different order or in parallel. An implementation of phase 2 (expose verifyHeader()) can be seen in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8493. The developer is open to questions or comments.</summary>
