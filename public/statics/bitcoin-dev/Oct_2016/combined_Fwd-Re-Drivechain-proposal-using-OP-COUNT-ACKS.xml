    <summary>The discussion revolves around a problem with the fungibility of coins generated from transactions. The issue is that if a transaction is reorged out during an innocent reorg, then it may never get back in unless it occurs at exactly the same height, which is not guaranteed. This poses a major problem with the proposal. There is nothing stopping users from using OP_EQUALVERIFY and causing their transaction to fluctuate between acceptable and unacceptable, with no party doing anything like a double spend. Sergio Demian Lerner suggests that transactions that redeem an output containing (or referencing by means of P2WSH) an OP_COUNT_ACKS are not broadcast by the network, and the only parties that can include the redeem transaction are the miners themselves. Therefore he sees no problem that an OP_COUNT_ACKS scriptSig transaction is invalidated after the liveness times expires.If there is no expiration, then polls can last forever and the system fails to provide DoS protection for block validation since active polls can accumulate forever.</summary>
