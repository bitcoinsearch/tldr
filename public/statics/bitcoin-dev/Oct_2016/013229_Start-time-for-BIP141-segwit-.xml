    <summary>The Bitcoin Core's 0.13.1 release is getting ready to include segregated witness (BIP 141, 143, 144, 145) for Bitcoin mainnet, after being extensively tested on testnet and in other software. Pieter Wuille, via bitcoin-dev, proposed setting BIP 141's start time to November 15, 2016, 0:00 UTC (unix time 1479168000) following the BIP9 recommendation to set the versionbits start time a month in the future. However, this is just a lower bound on the time when the versionbits signalling can begin. Activation on the network requires a full retarget window of 2016 blocks with 95% signalling the version bit (bit 1 for BIP141) and a fallow period consisting of another 2016 blocks. Chris Belcher expressed interest in JoinMarket using schnorr which would allow signature aggregation and so reduce the cost of coinjoins.</summary>
