    <summary>In an email conversation on the bitcoin-dev list, Daniel Robinson and Tom Zander discussed the potential advantages of the Defensive Patent License (DPL) over unilateral patent disarmament. Zander pointed out that the DPL could be more effective than MIT/BSD licenses because it creates an incentive for other companies to adopt it as well. This is important because MIT/BSD licenses allow companies to take without giving back, which doesn't build a community. Copyleft allows people to embrace and take, but if they extend they have to give back. Overall, Zander believes that the DPL represents a huge step forward.</summary>
