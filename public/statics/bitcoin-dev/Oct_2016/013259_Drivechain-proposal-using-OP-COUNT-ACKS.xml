    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner, co-founder of RSK, has proposed a new segwit-based and soft-forked opcode called OP_COUNT_ACKS. The full BIP can be found at https://github.com/rootstock/bips/blob/master/BIP-R10.md and the code and test cases can be found at https://github.com/rootstock/bitcoin/tree/op-count-acks_devel. The proposed system is designed for zero risk of invalidating a block, strong protection from DoS attacks, minimum block space consumption, interoperability with scripting systems, no additional computation during blockchain management and re-organization, no change in Bitcoin security model, and bounded computation of poll results. The proposal uses a two-way pegged blockchain that is currently being implemented in RSK using a federated approach until it becomes available in Bitcoin. The proposal aims to add risk-less Bitcoin extensibility through sidechains/drivechains and could be the base of all other 2-way pegged blockchains. The proposed system includes a new opcode that counts acks and nacks tags in coinbase fields and pushes the resulting totals in the script stack. Some comments and questions were made regarding the proposal, such as the use of scriptSig, the potential for 51% of miners to steal all money from the peg, the use of an unused code instead of OP_NOPx, and the issue of not wasting witness versions. Additionally, it was suggested that any additional consensus critical message should go to a dummy scriptPubKey like the witness commitment. Furthermore, it was noted that the coinbase space is limited to 100 bytes and is already overloaded by many different purposes. It was also questioned whether an ack-poll is valid only for one transaction and whether full nodes can prune corresponding ack-poll data after confirmation. Finally, it was pointed out that zero risk of invalidating a block couldn't be true for any softfork.</summary>
