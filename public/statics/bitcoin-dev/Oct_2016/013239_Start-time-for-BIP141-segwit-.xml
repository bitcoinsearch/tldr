    <summary>In a discussion regarding the activation of SegWit, developer Jorge Tim√≥n argued that changing BIP9's initial date would not be helpful to those who have not yet started working on supporting SegWit. Tom Zander responded by suggesting that if the reason for the short activation timespan is the use of BIP9, then it should not be used. He emphasized that SegWit is a controversial soft-fork that requires an extra safe deployment because rolling back the feature after deployment can turn all transactions into everyone-can-spend transactions. Therefore, he stands by the minimum of 2 months and believes that there is no excuse to use BIP9 as it was coded in an older client.</summary>
