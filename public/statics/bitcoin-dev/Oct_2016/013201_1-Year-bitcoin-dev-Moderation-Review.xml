    <title>1 Year bitcoin-dev Moderation Review</title>

    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a member of the bitcoin community, has started a discussion on the impact of moderation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. While acknowledging that such discussions are discouraged, Rubin believes that a year on from the implementation of moderation would be an appropriate time for the community to discuss its effect. He notes that since moderation began, there has been a significant drop in the number of messages posted on the list, with some members now self-censoring for fear of moderation. While Rubin believes that moderation was necessary at the time it was introduced, he argues that the community should now consider reopening the communication channel.</summary>
