    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer, has committed to offer a Defensive Patent License (DPL) for any of his patents, existing or future, to any DPL User. He has declared himself and all technology companies he controls as "Defensive". Neither Todd nor any companies under his control currently have any patents. Peter Todd clarifies that the language "all technology companies I control" is to avoid complications with non-technology companies that he may control in the future. He only controls one company as of writing, which he considers a "technology company", and thus the above offer applies to it. If he ends up controlling any other technology companies, the offer will apply to them as well.The announcement was published on Peter Todd's website, petertodd.org, and includes a link to the txid of a Bitcoin transaction containing the message. On the advice of his lawyer, Todd is currently offering only a specific version of the DPL. Anyone who wishes to contact him can do so through his email address, pete@petertodd.org.</summary>
