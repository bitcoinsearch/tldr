    <summary>Peter Todd explains that there are at least three similar patents filed by major Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers in different countries for a hardware design of an ASIC. He argues that the problem is not specific to ASICBoost and that it is not fair to blame any company for doing lawful commerce in a free market. Rather, he suggests that the issue lies in the flaw in Bitcoin's design which could have been corrected if certain guidelines he posted had been followed. The guidelines can be found at the link provided.</summary>
