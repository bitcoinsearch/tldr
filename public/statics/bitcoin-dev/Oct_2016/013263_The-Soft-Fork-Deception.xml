    <summary>The author has been reading through the history of soft forks provided by Bitcoin Core and believes that there is a notion that soft forks do not force Bitcoin users to upgrade software. However, this is not entirely true as miners who are still using old software and users who want to make transactions using the old rules are no longer able to do so, which could result in a hard fork. The author thinks that past soft forks have been deployed sloppily and suggests that new features should be implemented without forcing new rules. The author expresses concerns about the upcoming Segregated Witness soft fork, as it may require a hard fork in order to revert it. They propose making SegWit optional and removing previously "soft forked" rules for non-SegWit transactions, requiring them only for SegWit transactions. This may also relieve tensions for people who are not comfortable with SegWit and are thinking of joining a hard fork like the Bitcoin Unlimited project. The author threatens to create a new client called Bitcoin Authentic if Bitcoin Core does not accept their proposal or provide a good explanation as to why soft forks are being deployed in such a forceful manner. They would put at least CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY as mandatory within SegWit transactions.</summary>
