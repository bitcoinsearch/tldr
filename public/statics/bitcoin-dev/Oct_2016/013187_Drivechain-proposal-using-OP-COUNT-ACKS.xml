    <title>Drivechain proposal using OP_COUNT_ACKS</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around OP_COUNT_ACKS, which returns values that vary depending on the block in which the transaction ends up. Although the proposed use of this operation is less objectionable, nothing stops users from using OP_EQUALVERIFY to cause their transaction to fluctuate between acceptable and unacceptable, without any double spend. This poses a major problem with the proposal. The only way the proposal would become invalid is through a double-spend, and hence, it may be acceptable in relation to this argument.</summary>
