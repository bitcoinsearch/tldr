    <summary>The discussion between Marco Falke and Tom Zander on October 15, 2016, focused on the licensing of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). Zander suggested that BIPs should be public domain (CC0) or have a CC-BY option. Falke agreed but questioned why Zander chose to license BIP 134 under OPL and CC-BY-SA. Zander explained that he dual-licensed it so that if the CC-BY-SA was accepted in the future, users could remove the OPL without needing permission from all authors. Falke pointed out that BIP 2 does not allow PD as the only copyright option, to which Zander responded that PD was never the only option.</summary>
