    <summary>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell suggested that a timeout is needed for an ancient node that does not mine and therefore cannot be detected if it forks itself off the network due to a failed BIP bit. He further explained that one of two bits in the BIP is "FOR", while the other is "AGAINST". If "AGAINST" hits 25%, then the proposal is deemed a failure. The second bit would not normally be used, and this would enable proposals that will likely fail to be killed quickly. Rusty hinted that this could be added for specific soft forks or if we approach one failed soft fork every five weeks.</summary>
