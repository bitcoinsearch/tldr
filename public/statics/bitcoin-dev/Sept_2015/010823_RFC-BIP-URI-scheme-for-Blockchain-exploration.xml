    <summary>In an email conversation between Richard Moore and an unknown recipient on August 29, 2015, they discussed the idea of encoding the network and the format in which it should be done. They agreed that it would be a good point to encode the network but were unsure about the format. Richard suggested that the network should be part of the authority, similar to how http uses port 80 by default. For example, block:mainnet could be the default for blockchain://tx. He also proposed the idea of having block:testnet as part of the authority, indicating that the network is the testnet rather than the mainnet. They then shared links to further understand what types of things make more or less sense regarding this concept. The email conversation ended with the suggestion to try the Online TrID File Identifier.</summary>
