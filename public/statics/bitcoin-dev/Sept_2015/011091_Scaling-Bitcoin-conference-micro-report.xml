    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Matt Corallo clarified that there was no agreement on a desire to schedule a second hard fork and that while many agreed that a short-term hard fork now would be necessary, some believed that a second one would have to happen. He thinks it is critical that there be no messaging that people should rely on or assume there will be a future increase after a short-term bump. There are still fundamental disagreements about the threat model Bitcoin should design for, and ultimately, what it should be. During a blocksize panel, Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, stated that he thought we needed to set up a system of large, high-bandwidth, high-powered, Bitcoin nodes at institutions such as universities and large companies to allow the Bitcoin blocksize to be raised multiple orders of magnitude. The main objection raised during the committer/contributor discussions to the idea of a "short term bump" was messaging. Any bump should be accompanied by some kind of model describing scientifically what we were trying to achieve and where the numbers chosen came from.</summary>
