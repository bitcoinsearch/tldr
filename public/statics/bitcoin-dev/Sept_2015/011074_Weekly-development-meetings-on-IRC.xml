    <summary>Matt Corallo, via Bitcoin-dev, mentioned that Google Calendar is localized but it has an option to change the timezone of an event. However, UTC is not included in its options. According to a post, GMT/UTC is in the list and it is possible to configure Google Calendar to show an additional time zone to your localized one. Furthermore, Matt suggests using something that observes Daylight Saving Time (DST) in roughly the same way as everyone else such as CEST/PDT/EST/etc.</summary>
