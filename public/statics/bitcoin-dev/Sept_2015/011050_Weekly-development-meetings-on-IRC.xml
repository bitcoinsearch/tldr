    <summary>Wladimir J. van der Laan, a contributor to Bitcoin-dev, had a good idea to schedule a regular developer meeting in #bitcoin-dev after Monday's code sprint. The attendance is voluntary, but it may be good to have a time that many people are expected to be present and current issues can be discussed. Wladimir asked for preferences for days/times, suggesting every week on Thursday from 15:00-16:00 UTC.</summary>
