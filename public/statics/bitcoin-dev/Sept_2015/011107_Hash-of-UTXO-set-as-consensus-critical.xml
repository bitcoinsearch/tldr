    <summary>In a discussion about 51% attacks on the Bitcoin network, Rune Kj√¶r Svendsen makes a distinction between honest miners and malicious miners. An honest miner supports the network by building on top of the best valid chain, while a malicious miner wants to disrupt the network. A 51% attack occurs when a majority of mining power is controlled by malicious miners who can mine empty blocks on top of the best chain. Justus Ranvier asks for clarification on what it means to be a malicious miner and what differences in behavior would be observed between an honest miner and a malicious miner.</summary>
