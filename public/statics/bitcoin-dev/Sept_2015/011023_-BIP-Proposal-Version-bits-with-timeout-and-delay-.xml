    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list contains a discussion regarding the enforcement of new restrictions on blocks. It is noted that for policy level enforcement, miners do not need to wait for 75% agreement and can enforce the new restrictions from the start. The discussion also covers the association of states with softfork proposals. The BState begins as 'defined' and can transition to 'locked-in', 'activated', or 'failed' after each retarget period. There is a debate over whether the 75% rule should be maintained to confirm miner compliance with the new rule. The proposed variant involves counting in blocks rather than timeframes, and allocating two bits per proposal to allow miners to vote against forks. It is suggested that SPV clients should monitor the version field and take block forks into account when they occur.</summary>
