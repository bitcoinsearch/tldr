    <summary>The author of this text had trouble opening up ports for Bitcoin on their AT&amp;T network, due to the fact that AT&amp;T Uverse customers are forced to use a private dynamic IP which is hidden from the internet, making it impossible to send requests. The solution is to switch to a public static IP and allow incoming traffic, but AT&amp;T will not provide a public static IP without payment. There are only 37 nodes using AT&amp;T worldwide, indicating that using Bitcoin Core as a full node on AT&amp;T is extremely difficult. However, other large ISPs are also doing similar things, leading to a decline in Bitcoin nodes. The author believes that the community needs to educate people on how to use Bitcoin Core when facing these security measures, or the decline of node numbers will continue.</summary>
