    <summary>A debate arose among Bitcoin users about the impact of AT&amp;T on Bitcoin nodes. One user claimed that AT&amp;T effectively banned Bitcoin nodes by using private subnets, leading to a worldwide decline in node numbers. However, another user refuted these claims, stating that AT&amp;T's default network configuration did not cause any problems for Bitcoin nodes and accused the first user of being uninformed about computer networking.Despite this, the first user insisted that his accusations were true and that he had confirmed them with AT&amp;T technicians. The author of an email struggled to open port 8333 on his network, which prevented him from running Bitcoin Core and developing programs with Python modules. The author discovered that AT&amp;T had blocked access to the Bitcoin network via private subnets, making it impossible for computers to connect.Although he was able to switch to a public subnet, AT&amp;T charged a monthly fee for a public static IP address, which was required to gain full participation in the Bitcoin network. The decline of nodes worldwide is discussed, down 15% in the past year alone, and the community is urged to speak up and educate others about this issue.Another member of the Bitcoin-dev mailing list refuted the claims made by the sender, stating that there are 42 Bitcoin nodes running on AT&amp;T's network, which suggests no issue with their default configuration. However, the original sender argued that there is a firewall in the DVR that is uncontrolled and confirmed this with AT&amp;T technicians.There has been a significant decline in the number of Bitcoin nodes, and one individual believes that this is due to censorship by internet service providers (ISPs) who are not being transparent about their actions. The author believes that this issue needs to be explicitly addressed in instructions for running a full node, as it is a significant problem for anyone who wants to participate fully in the network.It is recommended that Bitcoin users take steps to protect their privacy when using AT&amp;T services, such as using a VPN or Tor, and to educate others about these issues. It appears that while there may not be a complete ban on Bitcoin nodes by AT&amp;T, there are issues with their policies that could negatively impact Bitcoin users and nodes, and the community needs to speak up and educate others about these issues.</summary>
