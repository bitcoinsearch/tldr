    <summary>In a conversation thread, Isidor questioned the need of having another side-chain to solve the Bitcoin block size issue. He stated that the market can already decide at the point where every Bitcoin user starts discriminating the Bitcoins they accept between the client versions of blocks where the Bitcoins come from. If a miner decides to follow a particular block size policy against the will of the community, the market could quickly rectify it when the miner realizes that no one accepts the resulting coins anymore, leading to financial loss for the miner. Moreover, he mentioned that holding a conference in Montreal to solve a global issue is an example of centralizing Bitcoin. To know more about the project and its technical details, he referred to the project page and GitHub README.</summary>
