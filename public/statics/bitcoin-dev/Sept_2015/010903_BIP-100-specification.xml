    <summary>Simon has written to Jeff Garzik regarding the proposal on counting absent/invalid votes and out of range votes. The proposal suggests that absent/invalid votes should be counted as votes for the current hardLimit while out of range votes should be counted as the nearest in-range value. Simon questions why an absent vote should be considered a vote for the status quo when a non-voter should have zero impact on the result. He also asks why out of range votes should be counted when they are considered invalid and should be discarded. Jeff Garzik has shared the initial public draft of BIP 100, stating that it is a starting point for open source feedback and iteration cycle.</summary>
