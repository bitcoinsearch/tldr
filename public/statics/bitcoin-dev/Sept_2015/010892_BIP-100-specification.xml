    <summary>In a discussion amongst Bitcoin developers, Jeff Garzik suggested that it would be silly to avoid discussion of the hard fork necessary for rolling out BIP 100. However, Btc Drak argued that such discussion should take place separately from the broader discussion of consensus forks. BIP 99 was referenced as a separate avenue for discussing consensus forks. The developers also acknowledged that parallel discussions on the topic could take place.</summary>
