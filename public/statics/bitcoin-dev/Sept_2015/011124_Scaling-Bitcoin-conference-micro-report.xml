    <summary>The discussion revolves around the idea that governments, even hegemons, are bound to fail at some point in history. Therefore, attributing godlike and limitless powers to a government is either the view of a shill or someone who is untutored in history. The conversation also touches upon the notion of threat models and how governments cannot be discounted as a threat. However, constructing a proper threat model is difficult as the attacker is essentially unbounded. As an example, any large government could easily obtain 51% of hash power and then only accept transactions from "certified services." These ideas are expressed in an email exchange between NxtChg and Steven Pine, with Pine emphasizing the historical tendency for governments to fail and cautioning against viewing them as all-powerful entities.</summary>
