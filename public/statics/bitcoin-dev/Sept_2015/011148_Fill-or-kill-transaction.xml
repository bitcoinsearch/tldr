    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion on September 17, 2015, Jorge Timon suggests using "fill or kill" for expiring transactions. However, Peter Todd suggests that this could be confusing and suggests that OP_MATURITY 100 should be required in all scriptPubKeys of the expiry transaction. This would make them as reorg-safe as coinbase transactions but may not work well with p2sh. Todd proposes that a "treat like Coinbase" flag in the UTXO set could be implemented when creating the output to solve this issue.</summary>
