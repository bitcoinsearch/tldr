    <summary>The discussion in this context is about improving the syntax of blockchain URLs. The proposed idea suggests that the "authority" component of the URL should identify the chain, whereas the "path" component should identify a particular block, transaction, or address in that chain. The current syntax for referencing a transaction is preceded by a chain ID followed by the transaction hash. The proposal suggests reversing the order and placing the chain ID after the authority component of the URL. The proposed idea also allows well-known chains to register a name as an alternative to the literal hash syntax. In conclusion, the proposed URL format will make it easier to reference transactions in forums or posts without having to look up the source.</summary>
