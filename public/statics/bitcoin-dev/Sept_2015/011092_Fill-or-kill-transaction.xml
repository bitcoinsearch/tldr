    <summary>On September 17, 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n sent an email to the Bitcoin development mailing list discussing the safety of transactions that can expire. Mark had suggested making all outputs of such transactions have op_maturity/csv/rcltv of 100 to ensure their safety. However, Luke pointed out that this would not make them as safe as mined bitcoins, which have both a 100-block maturity requirement and are expensive to generate. Merely using OP_CHECKMATURITYVERIFY (aka rcltv) has no cost to use.</summary>
