    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list conversation in 2015, Allen Piscitello suggested that the Bitcoin protocol should have multiple implementations to reduce its dependency on Core. However, Peter R disagreed with this idea, stating that previous attempts at making consensus-compatible re-implementations had ended poorly. He cited examples of bitcoin-ruby and btcd, which had numerous consensus failures, some of which were only recently found by fuzzing the scripting environment. Additionally, he mentioned that Ethereum attempted to create four clients written to a defined specification but still had numerous consensus failures due to misunderstanding or implementation. When Piscitello brought up Gavin's idea of having multiple robust implementations of the core protocol to promote decentralization in development, Peter R stated that it was a ridiculous task. He believed that supporting multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol would be incredibly foolish given the history of consensus failures, which could be leveraged to split the network and steal money.</summary>
