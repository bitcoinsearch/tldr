    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list named Roy Osherove was seeking feedback on creating a reproducible build of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-XT using TeamCity. He asked if all the platforms needed to be supported, and if Gitian is required to be used. In response, Mark Friedenbach stated that the binaries on bitcoin.org are built using the Gitian process and signed by a quorum of developers. The process of manually uploading Gitian builds to bitcoin.org was discussed in an email exchange between Mark Friedenbach and Roy Osherove.According to Mark Friedenbach, the gitian builds are made available on bitcoin.org, and there is no build server where gitian builds are automatically done and made available as this would defeat the purpose of Gitian. The question of whether a public server for Gitian builds is available and the usefulness of quorum verifications was discussed in a bitcoin-dev mailing list.Travis CI is used to ensure that the source code for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-XT compiles and tests run successfully on all supported platforms. However, the binaries produced by Travis are not trusted and are not used anywhere else. The binaries on bitcoin.org are built using the Gitian process and signed by a quorum of developers.Roy Osherove attempted to create his own reproducible build of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-XT using TeamCity and asked for feedback. He questioned whether all the flavors of builds are necessary and whether Gitian is required to be used at all. Feedback was requested regarding any additional features that people would like to see in the build.In this message, Jonas explains that the core developers are responsible for manually uploading Gitian builds to bitcoin.org. It is important for users who decide to run a pre-compiled version of Bitcoin Core to verify the binary against the available Gitian sigs. These signatures can be found in the signature repository at https://github.com/bitcoin/gitian.sigs.Additionally, PGP Pubkeys can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/gitian-downloader and instructions for verifying Bitcoin Core can be found at https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/verifying_bitcoin_core. It is crucial for users to verify their binaries to ensure the security of their Bitcoin transactions.Roy Osherove is open to feedback and suggestions for things that people would love to have in the build that do not exist there today. He has created his own build, which can be found at http://btcdev.osherove.com:8111/. He is wondering if all platforms need to be supported and if Gitian is truly required to be used.The availability of a public server for Gitian builds and the usefulness of quorum verifications were also topics of discussion. While the Gitian builds are available on bitcoin.org, a server that automatically does and makes them available would defeat the purpose of Gitian. Quorum signatures must be manually verified against the available Gitian sigs found at https://github.com/bitcoin/gitian.sigs.</summary>
