    <summary>In the given context, the speaker discusses the issue of licensing and its beneficiaries. They have proposed that miners be the main beneficiaries of licensing, but there is a consideration on whether they should vote to adopt the new terms. The speaker admits to not having factored in the potential need for gaining permissions for a change to be considered effective. They suggest consulting with a lawyer to determine the purpose of any license and how it can benefit someone when it is unclear who holds the license. The speaker questions the purpose of putting a license on the Core software or the blockchain, as there is no mechanism to enforce it and no revenue to be shared. Despite these issues, the speaker acknowledges that there doesn't seem to be anyone who could claim to have suffered any economic losses so this may not be an issue. Further investigation is recommended.</summary>
