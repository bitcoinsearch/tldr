    <summary>On June 30, 2015, Justus Ranvier proposed a Bitmessage address derivation method from an HD seed based on BIP-43, developed by Monetas. He suggested proposing it as a BIP to reserve a purpose code. However, since Bitmessage is not within the scope of the BIP process, Luke proposed modifying BIP 43 to refer non-Bitcoin purpose codes to the SLIP repository. The SLIP repository can be found at https://doc.satoshilabs.com/slips/.</summary>
