    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Jeff Garzik highlighted the negative impact of refactors, stating that branches of the source tree are being maintained by software engineers at home, startups, and major companies. However, there is a need to understand why these branches are being maintained and what features are present in them that Bitcoin Core doesn't have. In many cases, companies are maintaining forks of Bitcoin Core unnecessarily, where a different architecture could do what they need without adding new logic to the codebase itself. The discussion ends with Peter Todd's signature and PGP attachment.</summary>
