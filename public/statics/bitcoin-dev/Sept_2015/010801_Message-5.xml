    <summary>A user named hurricanewarn1 has reported that AT&amp;T has effectively banned Bitcoin nodes by closing port 8333 on their network. Despite efforts to open the port, hurricanewarn1 received confirmation from AT&amp;T that they have a hidden firewall in their cable box that can firewall any port they want even if the customer asks them not to. This could be the driving force behind the massive decline in Bitcoin nodes. Hurricanewarn1 had to contact headquarters and threaten to rip the equipment out of the wall to get a proper answer from AT&amp;T. However, as of now, Time Warner seems to be more accommodating towards Bitcoin nodes.</summary>
