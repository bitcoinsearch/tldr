    <summary>Wladimir J. van der Laan suggested scheduling a regular developer meeting in #bitcoin-dev after a good idea was proposed during Monday's code sprint. Attendance is voluntary, but having a set time for people to discuss current issues may be beneficial. Wladimir asked if there were any preferences for days/times and suggested every week, on Thursday from 15:00-16:00 UTC. According to Jonasschnelli's doodle, the most popular time is Thursday from 19:00-20:00 UTC. Wladimir mentioned that scheduling the meeting in UTC makes sense internationally due to different DST or no DST at all in different locales, making it more complex to set a convenient time for everyone. Some people may find the convenient time to be less convenient half of the year, but there is no time that works for everyone anyway.</summary>
