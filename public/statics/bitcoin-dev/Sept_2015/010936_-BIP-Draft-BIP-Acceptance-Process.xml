    <summary>The current system for decision-making in Bitcoin is not well-defined and lacks transparency, causing confusion and hindering major players from investing large sums. The proposal to set up a more consistent and transparent process that involves risk matrices has received criticism from those who believe the current system works fine and from those who lack experience working on large projects. However, proponents argue that such a process would not replace analysis but rather make it more consistent and understandable. A link is provided to further discuss the benefits and limitations of using risk matrices.</summary>
