    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, jl2012 has expressed concern over the 100 block maturity requirement for transactions. In response, it has been suggested that this requirement can be dropped if the expiration height is set to more than 100 blocks after inclusion height. The concern was raised about this requirement making the system less appealing as the recipient may not like the delay in receiving their funds. By dropping the maturity requirement, this issue could be resolved.</summary>
