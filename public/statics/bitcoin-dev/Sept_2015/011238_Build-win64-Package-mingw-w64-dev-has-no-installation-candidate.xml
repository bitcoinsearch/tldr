    <summary>In an email conversation between Joseph Bisch and Roy Osherove, it was noted that TeamCity setup was using Ubuntu Trusty to perform the build while Travis CI was using Ubuntu Precise instead. As a result of this difference in operating systems, the mingw-w64-dev package was only available in Precise. The email also stated that the package had been split into mingw-w64-x86-64-dev and mingw-w64-i686-dev, both of which had to be used with Ubuntu Trusty. The email provided links to relevant pages about the different packages and operating systems. Roy Osherove's email signature contained links to his book and course, as well as his contact information.</summary>
