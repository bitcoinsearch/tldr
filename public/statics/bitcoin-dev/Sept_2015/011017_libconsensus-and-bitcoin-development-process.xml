    <summary>In an email sent on September 15, 2015, Jeff Garzik discussed the negative impact of an unfocused stream of refactors to key code. He suggested that if refactoring were accelerated and scheduled to be performed in a one-week sprint, the long term developer impact would be much less. Although there may be a lot of breakage during this week, the average level of downstream patch breakage is significantly lower afterwards. This approach can be compared to "ripping the band-aid off quickly rather than slowly".</summary>
