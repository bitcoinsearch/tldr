    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev community, Richard Olsen, announced a competition in 2015 for participants to build a trading platform using coloured coins on the blockchain for settling trades. The use of a sidechain was suggested but not required. The competition initially focused on foreign exchange, with other assets to follow. The competition's aim was for it to be community-driven and all contributions would be made available under an MIT license on Github. Olsen invited questions both at the online briefing event and via email.</summary>
