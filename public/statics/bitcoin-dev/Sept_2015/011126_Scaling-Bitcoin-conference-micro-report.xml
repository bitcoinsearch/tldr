    <summary>The concept of threat models is a useful tool for examining potential risks associated with Bitcoin. This includes threats from both governments and non-governments. Developing a threat model involves considering the context of other possible threats, such as attacks that can be executed by someone with a few million to spend. These types of attacks could easily crash the exchange rate or buy core developers more easily than executing a 51% attack. Those who consider threats from government and assume everyone associated with Bitcoin is "pure" are seen as irrational cultists who are not qualified to discuss threat models. In response to a statement made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, NxtChg clarified that no one discounts governments as a threat. However, constructing a proper threat model is difficult since attackers are essentially unbounded. For example, any large government could obtain 51% of hash power and only accept transactions from "certified services."</summary>
