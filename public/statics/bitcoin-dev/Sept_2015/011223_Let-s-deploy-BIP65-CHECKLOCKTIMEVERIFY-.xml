    <summary>The author of this message is arguing that there is no need for SPV wallets to change as making the spec a hard fork means all existing software will automatically do the right thing. It is important to note that bitcoinj is no longer the only SPV wallet implementation and BreadWallet has its own code in Objective-C, which is the second most popular SPV implementation. The author also argues that incorporating a soft fork would have real downsides and questions the justification for using one. Additionally, the author addresses the issue of XT mentioned earlier in the message.</summary>
