    <summary>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Richard Olsen announced a Bitcoin-related competition aimed at building a trading platform that allows participants to settle their trades through the blockchain via coloured coins. Lykke Corp, based in Zurich, is funding the competition and is allocating 2 million Lykke coins (worth $8,000) for core development over the next three months. The use of a sidechain is suggested but not required for trade reconciliation. All contributions will be made available under an MIT license on GitHub, with the aim of creating a community-driven effort rather than proprietary technology. However, Benjamin, another member of the mailing list, commented that the Bitcointalk Altcoin section is currently the best place for such announcements, as Bitcoin dev is primarily focused on core problems which are under-funded. In addition, he believes there is room for a better board/list for new 2.0 projects and suggests that anyone who wants to build a better venue for 2.0 projects can contact him. Finally, he mentions that he has sent a private email about markets on top of blockchains.</summary>
