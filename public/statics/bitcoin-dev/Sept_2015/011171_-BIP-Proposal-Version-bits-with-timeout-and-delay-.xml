    <summary>The email conversation between Rusty Russell and Tom Harding regarding the consensus rules related to a locked-in soft fork was discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Russell proposed a simple one-period delay for the activation of the soft fork, while Harding suggested a one-period "burn-in" to show sustained support of the threshold, with any lapse resetting to an inactivated state. Both agreed that adding more complexity for a situation that is unlikely to happen is a mistake. Gavin Andresen was also part of the conversation.</summary>
