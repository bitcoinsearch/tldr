    <summary>In a discussion about the efficiency of transmitting new solutions, Gavin Andresen proposed the idea of merged mined block DAG with blocks of arbitrary strength that are differentially coded against prior state to minimize transmission costs. However, there was some confusion about the use of 'merged mined' in this context as weak blocks are ephemeral and often purged out of memory quickly. In order to eliminate proportional propagation costs, the weak block transaction list must be a superset of the block transaction list size. This creates a pressure to increase weak block overhead, which is not ideal. Overall, the proposal could still work, but it requires careful consideration of the weak block commitment and its relationship with block commitment.</summary>
