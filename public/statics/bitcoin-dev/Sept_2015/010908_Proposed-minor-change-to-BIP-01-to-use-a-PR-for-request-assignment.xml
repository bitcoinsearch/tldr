    <summary>In the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, there has been difficulty in auditing assignments in the past. Gregory Maxwell, a member of bitcoin-dev, suggested changing the number request process to opening a pull request with BIP text without a number. This new mechanism would remove friction from the process and make the assignment auditable. The current process was written when a different solution was used for storing and presenting BIPs. Maxwell's proposal would involve using only the author's name and an index as the number to request an assignment. He requested that any responses be strictly directed to whether or not anyone finds the proposal objectionable.</summary>
