    <summary>Eric Lombrozo proposed a long-term plan for bitcoind in 2015. The first step involved defining an API for libconsensus, which would support an abstract DB model, track chain state, provide query mechanisms for blocks and transactions with optional pruning and indexing, expose a subscription mechanism for events such as NEW_TIP, REORG, etc., and contain a script interpreter. The second step involved developing a peer services library that performs the tasks of peer discovery and relay, with the ability to connect to appropriate peers and queue messages. It uses libconsensus for all validation functionality and as a datastore for the consensus state but maintains its own database for peer history and statistics. The third step involved providing high-level calls and pub/sub mechanisms. Finally, the wallet was split out into a separate process that connects to the stack via the API/RPC layer. Jorge Tim√≥n agreed with this long-term vision and suggested that bitcoind becomes a subtree of bitcoin-wallet, which has bitcoin-wallet and bitcoin-qt, and upper layers should move to C++11. He believed this architecture would maximize the number of people who can safely contribute to the project.</summary>
