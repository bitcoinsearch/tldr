    <summary>The argument being made is that the state is not a threat to a system designed to deprive the state of seigniorage, because the state will see that system as too important. The author suggests that this idea may seem off to those who view governments through conspiracy theory videos. However, the author argues that no threat model or small blocks can save you from government scrutiny. The author suggests building SilkRoadCoin, which only works via TOR, has an ASIC-resistant algorithm and 10 Kb blocks, if you want a chance of avoiding government intervention. Despite these suggestions, most people still subscribe to a global "electronic cash system" and intend to continue using Bitcoin for that purpose.</summary>
