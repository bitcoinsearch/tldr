    <title>CI Build for Bitcoin - Some Basic Questions about Gitian and other stuff</title>

    <summary>Roy Osherove is attempting to create a reproducible build of his own for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-XT using TeamCity. Osherove believes that building it himself is the best way to learn. He has some questions regarding the builds of Bitcoin. According to him, Bitcoin is continuously built on travis-CI at https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/. There are many flavors that are built, but he is not sure if all of them are necessary. He also wonders if Gitian is required to be used, or used in parallel, or at all. Osherove has created his own build, which can be found at http://btcdev.osherove.com:8111/. He is wondering if all platforms need to be supported and if Gitian is truly required to be used. Osherove is open to feedback and suggestions for things that people would love to have in the build that do not exist there today.</summary>
