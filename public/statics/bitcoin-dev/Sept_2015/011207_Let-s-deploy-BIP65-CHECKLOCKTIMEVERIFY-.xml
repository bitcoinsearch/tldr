    <summary>Mike Hearn, a developer, expressed his objection to using a soft fork to deploy a feature for Bitcoin. He argued that it would result in the same problems as all other soft forks and make SPV wallets less reliable during the rollout period. Instead, he suggested making it a hard fork, which would eliminate his objection. However, he acknowledged that there is no consensus on this matter and proposed two options: either drop the idea that everyone must agree to make changes or do nothing. The email was sent on September 28, 2015, via the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Some people found Hearn's message confusing and questioned whether it was a sophisticated form of humor they did not understand.</summary>
