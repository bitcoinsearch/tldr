    <summary>The concern raised is about the potential censorship of one of the last uncensored forums for technical Bitcoin discussion with a wide viewership. The forum is seen as a means for the average somewhat technical person to hold the Bitcoin development community accountable for its actions and have their voice heard. However, there is uncertainty regarding who will draw the line on what is considered "off-topic" by list admins. Despite this concern, it takes only 15 minutes or less daily to read the forum while drinking coffee.</summary>
