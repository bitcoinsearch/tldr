    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave Collins was curious about btcd mainnet forks that had occurred since it came out of alpha. However, he noted that there haven't been any such forks yet, although he didn't rule out the possibility of one happening in the future. He also clarified that his point was not to attack btcd, but rather to emphasize the difficulty of software development in this space.Collins pointed out that Bitcoin Core itself had experienced actual forks on the mainnet during the same period. He acknowledged that no developer is perfect and that mistakes are bound to happen from time to time. The bigger picture, however, is that the overall development process for cryptocurrency is challenging due to the complexity of the technology involved.One of the issues with developing cryptocurrency software is that it's difficult to know what behavior is inferred by the use of CPP and OpenSSL. Collins noted that the recent DER encoding consensus failure highlighted this fact. Additionally, there are likely other problems lurking in the transaction environment, which can be easy to overlook given how complex Bitcoin script can be. Overall, the conversation underscored the challenges that developers face when working with these cutting-edge technologies.</summary>
