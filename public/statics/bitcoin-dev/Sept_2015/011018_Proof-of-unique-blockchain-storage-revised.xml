    <summary>Bitcoin network nodes can be incentivized to exist by paying peers for providing data in the blockchain. However, it is difficult to determine whether a peer is genuinely storing the blockchain or simply relying on other peers as a proxy. Asymmetric-time functions can be used to prove unique (IP-tied) blockchain storage, and improvements can be made to make it fully practical. The proposal is detailed in a post by Sergio on his blog, which includes a review of the use of asymmetric-time functions.</summary>
