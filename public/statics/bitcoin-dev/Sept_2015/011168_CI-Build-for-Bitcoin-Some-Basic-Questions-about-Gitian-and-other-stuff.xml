    <title>CI Build for Bitcoin - Some Basic Questions about Gitian and other stuff</title>

    <summary>The question of whether a public server for Gitian builds is available and the usefulness of quorum verifications was discussed in a bitcoin-dev mailing list. The Gitian builds are available on bitcoin.org, but a build server that automatically does and makes them available would defeat the purpose of Gitian. Quorum signatures can be found on GitHub, but the process is manual. Travis-CI continuously builds Bitcoin source code for the purpose of ensuring successful compilation and testing on all supported platforms, but the binaries are not used because Travis-CI is not a trusted platform. The binaries on bitcoin.org are built using the Gitian process and signed by a quorum of developers. The original poster was attempting to create their own reproducible build of Bitcoin using TeamCity and asked for corrections and feedback. They also questioned whether all platforms need to be supported and if Gitian is truly required.</summary>
