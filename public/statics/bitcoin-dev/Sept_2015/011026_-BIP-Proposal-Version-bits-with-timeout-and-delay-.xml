    <summary>The discussion revolves around the safety and effectiveness of implementing new restrictions on blockchain. It is agreed upon that setting the restriction at 95% would be safer as it will produce fewer orphaned blocks. However, implementing restrictions in one's own block can be done at 0%. The conversation also touches on using height versus time for bip writers and the ease of writing "block x" versus "date y". It is suggested that at 75%, a super-majority is achieved and blocks can be safely rejected if they are invalid according to the new rule.</summary>
