    <summary>In a message sent via the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Wladimir J. van der Laan proposed the idea of scheduling a regular developer meeting in #bitcoin-dev. The purpose of the meeting would be to discuss current issues in the Bitcoin community and to provide an opportunity for developers to collaborate. While attendance would be voluntary, having a set time for the meetings would allow for more people to attend. Suggestions were made for days/times, with one proposal being every week on Thursday from 15:00-16:00 UTC. While the recipient of the email was unlikely to attend at that time, they approved of the idea and looked forward to reading the meeting logs.</summary>
