    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Peter Todd proposed that all scriptPubkeys should have op_maturity/rcltv/csv 100+ to make outputs of transactions that can expire as reorg-safe as coinbase transactions. However, this solution does not work well with p2sh, so he suggested implementing a "treat like Coinbase" flag in the UTXO set. Regarding nKillTime, Todd suggested calling it nExpiryTime and changing the term from fill or kill transactions to transactions that expire to accurately reflect their purpose. He argued against reinventing the wheel by changing names of terms already established in the bitcoin community, such as rcltv which was previously called op_maturity. Todd emphasized the importance of using accurate terminology to facilitate learning and understanding among members of the community.</summary>
