    <title>[BIP Proposal] New "sendheaders" p2p message</title>

    <summary>In this message, a discussion is taking place among developers regarding the possibility of new nodes unilaterally switching to sending headers instead of the previously used method for announcing new blocks. Tier Nolan suggests that there may not be a requirement for a new message and that current nodes would still be compatible with the switch. However, Suhas Daftuar points out that such a change might not work for all network participants, including users running older versions of Bitcoin Core and non-Bitcoin Core software that participates on the network. Daftuar proposes enabling the behavior based on advertised p2p network version. The message ends with a PGP signature.</summary>
