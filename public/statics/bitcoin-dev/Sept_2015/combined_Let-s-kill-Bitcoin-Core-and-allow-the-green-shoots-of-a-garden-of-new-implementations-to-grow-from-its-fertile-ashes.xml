    <summary>In September 2015, Bitcoin developers engaged in an email conversation about upgrading the Bitcoin protocol and allowing for experimentation. One suggestion was to create multiple implementations of Bitcoin Core to reduce the network's dependency on Core. However, convincing users to adopt a new implementation could be a challenge as many developers prefer to contribute to Bitcoin Core due to its quality codebase. To minimize risks in a non-emotive way, it was acknowledged that everyone should upgrade to the same consensus rule change, and ensuring backwards-compatibility through testing is essential. The email also suggests that instead of encouraging nodes or miners to "vote" by running different consensus rules, the focus should be on analyzing proposals in a constructive, collaborative, and technically-focused manner.The idea of never reaching consensus with Bitcoin Core was suggested, which would provide impetus for new implementations to fork from Core and implement scaling solutions that they deem best. This would allow users to select the winning solution based on the code they choose to run, promoting the decentralized spirit of Bitcoin.Creating multiple implementations of Bitcoin Core would involve forking the codebase, and any innovation from one development group would be freely integrated by another if desired. Each group would have a strong incentive to remain fork-wise compatible with the other implementations. While this approach has its benefits, the biggest challenge would be to convince users to adopt a new implementation when Bitcoin Core is widely used due to the quality of its code and the preference of many developers to contribute to it over writing their own implementation.In the discussion, Chris D'Costa posed the question of whether there is an interest in creating a Bitcoin fork that would allow for unrestricted experimentation, which he believes could provide valuable insights for future decisions regarding Core updates. However, he identified the lack of incentive as a potential problem. The concept that D'Costa described is similar to sidechains, which are a way to experiment with new features without launching a separate altcoin. Elements Alpha was suggested as a technical sandbox for this type of experimentation and currently has experimental changes to transaction structure. It provides a way to experiment with new ideas without affecting the stability of the main Bitcoin network.In conclusion, while there are differing opinions among Bitcoin developers regarding the best approach to upgrading the protocol and allowing for experimentation, the focus should be on analyzing proposals in a constructive, collaborative, and technically-focused manner. Additionally, sidechains and technical sandboxes like Elements Alpha provide a way to experiment with new ideas without affecting the stability of the main Bitcoin network.</summary>
