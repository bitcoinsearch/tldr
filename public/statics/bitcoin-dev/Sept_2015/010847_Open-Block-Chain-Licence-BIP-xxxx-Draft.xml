    <summary>The Bitcoin network is facing a licensing issue related to the copyright ownership of transaction messages that are being published by various parties. There are concerns about whether miners have permission to republish these messages and whether they contain copyrighted or licensed material from others. The issue of licensing after the fact requires permission from every copyright holder, which is not easy to obtain. A proposed solution is to give miners the main benefits of licensing and let them vote to adopt new terms. However, it is unclear if this would be successful or if anyone has suffered economic losses due to the current situation. The authors of the draft BIP believe that a block chain license is necessary to supplement the existing MIT License, which only covers core reference client software. They acknowledge that replacing or amending the existing MIT License is beyond the scope of the draft BIP. The changes proposed in the BIP would be considered effective on a retrospective basis, but further investigation is needed.</summary>
