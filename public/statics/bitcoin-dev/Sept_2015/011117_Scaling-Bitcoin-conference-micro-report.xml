    <summary>In this email thread, the conversation has gone off-topic and the sender questions whether it needs to be discussed on the list. The original message was about Bitcoin growth and adoption, but it has morphed into a discussion about gun control and piracy. The sender argues that governments only tolerate internet-based black markets because they believe Bitcoin can have benefits for their voters. They also question the difference between natural growth and growth driven by bank-backed start-ups and pro-censorship entities. Overall, the conversation seems to be meandering without a clear focus on Bitcoin development.</summary>
