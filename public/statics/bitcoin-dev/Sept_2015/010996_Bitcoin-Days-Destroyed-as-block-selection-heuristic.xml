    <summary>The Bitcoin transaction fee is calculated based on the sum of input age weighted by value and divided by transaction size in bytes. This means that it is directly proportional to BTCDD and any concerns about its effects have already been built into the code. However, Vincent Truong expressed concerns about how this could alter the prioritization of transactions in order to win. He believes that this could potentially result in a bad outcome for Bitcoin's fungibility.</summary>
