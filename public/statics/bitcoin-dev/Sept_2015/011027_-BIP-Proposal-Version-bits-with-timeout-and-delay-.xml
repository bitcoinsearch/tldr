    <summary>In an email exchange between Jorge Timón and an unknown recipient, the discussion centered around a proposal to increase the block size limit in Bitcoin. Timón argued that enforcing a 75% threshold for signaling support of the change would be insufficient and could result in orphaned blocks, while a 95% threshold would produce less orphaned blocks and be safer overall. The 75% threshold was only meant to serve as a test run before full enforcement at 95%. Timón also noted that if someone were to set the bit at 75%, they should be creating valid blocks under the rule.</summary>
