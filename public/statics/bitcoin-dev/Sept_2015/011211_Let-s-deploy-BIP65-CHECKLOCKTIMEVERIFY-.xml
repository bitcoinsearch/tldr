    <summary>SPV wallets are currently insecure, and while there is a soft fork mechanism in place that is not easily exploitable, there is no hard fork mechanism that isn't prone to systemic consensus failure. Mike Hearn argues that the current BIP should use a hard fork instead of a soft fork to prevent the repeat of cases such as P2SH, where invalid blocks were found for weeks or months after the new rules were implemented, exposing SPV wallets and old nodes to unnecessary risk. He also notes that there is no consensus for rolling out the new opcode in this way and shares concerns with others on Reddit.</summary>
