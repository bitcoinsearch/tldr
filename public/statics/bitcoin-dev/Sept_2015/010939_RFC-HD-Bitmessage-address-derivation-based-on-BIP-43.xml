    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on Sep 4, 2015, focused on modifying BIP 43 to refer non-Bitcoin purpose codes to the SLIP repository. Luke Dashjr proposed this modification as BIP 43 is still a draft and it would allow different companies or p2p chains like Namecoin to maintain competing registries. However, Justus Ranvier questioned the benefit of delegating the BIP-43 namespace management to a particular company (SatoshiLabs) instead of using the convenient feature of purpose codes matching the BIP number. Ranvier also pointed out that while the "namespace" defined in BIP43 is acceptable, BIP44's definition is not. It defines a centralized registry controlled by a single company instead of having a way for different companies or p2p chains to maintain competing registries. Instead, Ranvier suggested using a code deterministically generated from the chain ID (the hash of the genesis block), which would completely remove the need for a registry in the first place. Justus Ranvier is associated with the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project and can be reached at justus@openbitcoinprivacyproject.org.
