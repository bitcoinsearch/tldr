    <summary>The threat model of Bitcoin is being discussed, with the assumption that it is a legal and regulated service provided by a highly trusted mining community. This is seen as a reasonable design, but there is a large grey area in terms of potential threats. The idea of painting the worst picture possible is viewed as either a defect in thinking or intentional FUD. Mike Hearn's threat model is also mentioned, which argues that governments should not be considered a threat. The article suggests that there are two ways to fight governments: either become too big to close, or become too tiny to hunt through the use of specialized alt-coins designed for that purpose.</summary>
