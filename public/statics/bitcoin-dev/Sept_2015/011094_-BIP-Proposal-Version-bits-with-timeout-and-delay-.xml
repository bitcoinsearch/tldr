    <summary>The discussion is centered around the activation mechanism in Bitcoin and the use of height or time to replace it. The argument for using height is that old soft/hardforks will eventually replace the activation mechanism with height. However, it is unclear whether the proposal suggests using block time or median block time. While using height may be easier for bip writers, deployment speed is measured in months and adding another variable could complicate matters. Some hardforks/softforks may also complicate implementation with the use of block time. The discussion is ongoing and can be found in a thread branched from bip99's discussion.</summary>
