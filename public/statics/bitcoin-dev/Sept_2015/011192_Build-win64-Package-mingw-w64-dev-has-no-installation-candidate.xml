    <summary>A user is trying to recreate the travis CI build system using TeamCity in order to learn more about the bitcoin builds. However, they are facing problems with getting mingw dev during the windows builds, as it shows "Package 'mingw-w64-dev' has no installation candidate". They have tried using the same exports env vars as the travis script and even used the travis script inside teamcity, but the problem persists. The PPA seems to be importing fine during the build. The agent is running inside a docker image based on ubuntu. The user has shared the full log of the failed build, and they are looking for suggestions as to why it works on travis but not on the teamcity build agent. The same problem also appears in win32 build. In the end, the user thanks everyone and shares their contact details.</summary>
