    <summary>Ken Shirriff has proposed adding the bitcoin symbol to Unicode standard, as it is currently not included. He has successfully proposed a new character for Unicode in the past and believes this proposal has a good chance of succeeding. The proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf. Shirriff has asked for endorsement from Bitcoin developers to help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol. Contact information for Richard Moore, founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc., is also included in the email thread. A link to the Bitcoin symbol page on en.bitcoin.it/wiki is provided as well.</summary>
