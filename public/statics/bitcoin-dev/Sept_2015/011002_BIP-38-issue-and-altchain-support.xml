    <summary>The integration of BIP-38 into libbitcoin has resulted in two issues. Firstly, the scenario that justifies the "confirmation code" is flawed, with full support implemented but marked as deprecated. Counter arguments are being sought for any potential scenarios where it may still be useful. Secondly, while BIP-38 envisions altchain integration, it does not specify it. As such, the capability has been implemented and documented for backward compatibility. If there is enough support, a proposal will be written to modify BIP-38. Neill Miller is credited for the pull requests related to BIP-38 for libbitcoin and bx.</summary>
