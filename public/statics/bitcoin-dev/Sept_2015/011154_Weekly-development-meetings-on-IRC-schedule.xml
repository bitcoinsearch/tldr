    <summary>A weekly IRC meeting has been scheduled for Bitcoin developers. The meeting was scheduled for Thursday from 7:00-8:00 PM UTC, starting on September 24th. A shared Google Calendar has been provided and can be added to other calendars to show the meeting in their own timezone. The initial timing of the meetings is not ideal for those located in China, Japan/Korea, and Australia due to the time difference. A suggestion has been made to review the timing of meetings on a weekly or monthly basis to ensure that everyone is able to attend. Additionally, some have requested an agenda be published before each meeting to determine if it is worth attending, particularly for those who will need to wake up in the middle of the night to participate.</summary>
