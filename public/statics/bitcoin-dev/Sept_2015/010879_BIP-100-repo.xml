    <summary>The conversation discusses the concept of "votes" in relation to Bitcoin. It is unclear if it is a semi-automatic or fully automated process. The number of options and values for votes can have an impact on outcomes. There is currently no fee market in Bitcoin, but it could be a good goal to strive towards. Implementing a fee market would require a pricing mechanism and actual commitments. However, Bitcoin is not capable of adapting to this yet. Jeff Garzik introduces a 1 MB floor which eliminates unlikely scenarios that squeeze users, and Luke Dashjr suggests combining rules 2 and 4 into a single rule and modifying the voting to require 50% to set the limit floor.</summary>
