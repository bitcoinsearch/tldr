    <summary>In an email conversation between Jorge Tim√≥n and Greg, they discuss a proposal by BtcDrak to use increased nBits to vote for permanently raising the block size. Jeff had previously made arguments against this proposal, but it appears that his arguments only apply to BtcDrak's proposal and not to Greg's original proposal where the block size is only increased for that specific block. The email ends with a request for everyone to speak specifically in order to catch important details like this.</summary>
