    <summary>During a code sprint, the idea of scheduling a regular developer meeting in #bitcoin-dev was proposed. The meeting time was suggested to be every week 15:00-16:00 UTC on Thursday by Wladimir J. van der Laan via bitcoin-dev mailing list. However, Matt Corallo raised concerns that quoting UTC could lead to inconvenience for participants in different time zones due to changes in daylight saving time. He suggested quoting an actual timezone of an actual area so it will remain constant, like 1700 CEST or 0900AM PDT. Furthermore, he noted that Google Calendar does not directly support UTC and therefore it would be practical to select a timezone available in Google Calendar.</summary>
