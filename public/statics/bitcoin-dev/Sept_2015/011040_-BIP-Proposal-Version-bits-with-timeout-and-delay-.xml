    <summary>In September 2015, a discussion was held on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the enforcement of rules when 75% consensus is reached.

This would prevent them from producing blocks that they believe are fine but actually aren't. However, the author of the email remains unconvinced.</summary>
