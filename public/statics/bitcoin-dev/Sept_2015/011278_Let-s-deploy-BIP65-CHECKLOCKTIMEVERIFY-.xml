    <summary>On September 27, 2015, a discussion was held on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the deployment of BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Peter Todd suggested deploying it, to which there appeared to be common agreement. The only point of controversy was how to deploy it: versionbits versus IsSuperMajority. Wladimir J. van der Laan proposed that versionbits should have code out for longer before considering it for concrete soft forks. This is because hastening along versionbits because CLTV is wanted would be risky.However, a simple "block version &gt;= 4" check is insufficient due to XT, which sets version bits 001....111. Rusty suggested using a simple test instead, stating that XT won't trigger it, and it won't trigger XT. The proposed test will still allow them to use versionbits in parallel later.</summary>
