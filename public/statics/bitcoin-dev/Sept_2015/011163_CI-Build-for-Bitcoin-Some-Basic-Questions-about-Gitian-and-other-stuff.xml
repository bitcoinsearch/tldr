    <summary>Travis CI is used to ensure that the source code for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-XT compiles and tests run successfully on all supported platforms. However, the binaries produced by Travis are not trusted and are not used anywhere else. The binaries on bitcoin.org are built using the gitian process and signed by a quorum of developers. Roy Osherove attempted to create a reproducible build of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-XT using TeamCity and asked for feedback. He questioned whether all the flavors of builds are necessary and whether Gitian is required to be used at all. Feedback was requested regarding any additional features that people would like to see in the build.</summary>
