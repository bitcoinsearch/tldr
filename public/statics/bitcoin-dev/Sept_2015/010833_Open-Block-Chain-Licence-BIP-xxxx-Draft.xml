    <title>Open Block Chain Licence, BIP[xxxx] Draft</title>

    <summary>The email thread involves a proposal from Ahmed Zsales via bitcoin-dev, stating that the network requires a blockchain license to supplement the existing MIT License which only covers the core reference client software. The draft BIP presented by Ahmed is shared in the email and requires discussion and evaluation. However, the general problem with licensing after the fact is highlighted by another person in the thread. They explain that requiring permission from every copyright holder in order to make the change is an issue. No comment is given on Ahmed's proposal itself.</summary>
