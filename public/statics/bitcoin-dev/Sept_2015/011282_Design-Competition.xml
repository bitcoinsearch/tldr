    <summary>A Bitcoin-related competition is seeking participants to build a trading platform that allows users to settle trades through the blockchain via coloured coins. Initially designed for foreign exchange, the platform will later expand to other assets. The use of a sidechain is recommended but not necessary for trade reconciliation. Interested parties can attend an online briefing event or visit www.lykkex.com for more information. Contributions will be made available under an MIT license on Github in an effort to make this a community-driven project rather than a proprietary technology.</summary>
