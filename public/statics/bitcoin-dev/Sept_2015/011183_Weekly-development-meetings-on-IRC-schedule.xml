    <summary>Bitcoin developers discussed the timing of weekly IRC meetings in September 2015. Vincent Truong suggested a meeting time from 23:00 to 00:00 UTC that could work for accommodating the US and Asia, but it may not be convenient for everyone. He proposed having the meeting once a month on the first week and running every other week on the main schedule. Jl2012 suggested reviewing the timing on a weekly or monthly basis with a doodle vote. Wladimir J. van der Laan created a shared Google Calendar for the meetings on Thursdays at 19:00-20:00 UTC starting from September 24, 2015, with the timezone in Reykyavik (Iceland) which is UTC+0. The calendar can be added to personal calendars, showing the meeting in one's own timezone.</summary>
