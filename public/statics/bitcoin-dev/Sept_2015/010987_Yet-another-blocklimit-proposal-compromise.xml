    <summary>In this email exchange, the importance of economically dependent full nodes in maintaining Bitcoin security through consensus rules is emphasized. This is different from miner full nodes and ensures decentralization of policy. It is crucial that running full nodes remain convenient to maintain decentralization security. A summary of Bitcoin decentralization by Mark is provided as a reference. The Chinese miners' proposed 8MB cap was not meant to be a permanent solution but rather a limit based on current infrastructure. The writer suggests a 2-4-8MB growth over four years, with economically dependent full nodes upgrading after a hard-fork upgrade. Soft-fork upgrades are not considered appropriate because it is more important for economically dependent full nodes to upgrade. In another part of the email exchange, Marcel proposes assessing the technical possibility of block limits without driving up node costs too much. Jorge raises concerns about further increasing mining centralization.</summary>
