    <summary>In an email exchange on September 2, 2015 between Jeff Garzik and Luke Dashjr regarding the newly added 1 MB floor to the bitcoin block size limit proposal, Luke suggests that the 1M is a safety rail and cannot perform worse than the current system. He also questions why the new size limit votes must use 11 bytes of coinbase and suggests increasing the coinbase length to allow for 100 bytes in addition to the pushed height and size-vote since this is a hardfork. Furthermore, he suggests modifying the voting to require 50% to set the limit floor so that it coordinates with what miners can already effectively do today by rejecting blocks larger than some collusion-determined limit. Jeff's original question was about the purpose of the newly added 1 MB floor which he believes to be too high for the limit at present, and the fact that it is one-sided to only allow increases when decreases are much more likely to be needed in the short term. He suggests combining two rules into a single rule lifting the 1 MB limit to 32 MB or whatever value is deemed appropriate to make it clear that the limit remains a part of the consensus protocol and p2p protocol limits are not to have an effect on consensus rules.</summary>
