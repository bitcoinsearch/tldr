    <summary>The discussion in the email thread revolves around the maximum block-size that can be filled at zero-cost by miners. Ivan Brightly mentions that miners already control block size through soft caps, and there is no need to reduce the max block size unless technology advances or the internet is impacted by WW3. Btc Drak suggests that if the blocksize can only increase, it will hurt the fee market as transaction volume may ebb and flow significantly. The blocksize needs to be elastic and allow contraction as well as expansion. The discussion points towards a need for an economic discussion rather than a technology scaling discussion.</summary>
