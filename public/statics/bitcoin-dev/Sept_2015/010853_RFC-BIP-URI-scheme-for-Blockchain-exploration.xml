    <summary>The discussion revolves around whether to use the hash of the genesis block or the name constants for a reference to a certain transaction. It is suggested that chainPetName could be used as an alternative argument to provide a mnemonic name for well-known chains. However, there is no central authority that can register these names, and it will always be just a local registry. Using network magic bytes instead of the genesis hash is also proposed, but unique magic bytes cannot be registered without a central authority. The issue of having unique and memorable chain name strings without a central authority is highlighted. Relevant links are provided for further reading on Zooko's triangle and petnames.</summary>
