    <summary>The idea that users must follow the hashrate majority in Bitcoin is incorrect, with market forces dictating that hashrates will follow users instead. Users who are unhappy with hardfork rules may decide not to upgrade, causing a split between two chains that could persist for more than a few days. The Schism Hardfork section of BIP99 discusses this. Speculators may sell both A-coins and B-coins, but will likely not buy again until the initial uncertainty has passed. It is possible for miners to continue mining old coins as long as there are users creating demand for them, even if the new rules chain has a majority of users and miners. The discussion of these issues should take place on Github or the bitcoin-dev thread linked from the BIP.</summary>
