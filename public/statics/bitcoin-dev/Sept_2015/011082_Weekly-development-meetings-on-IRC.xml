    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Btc Drak suggested that Google Calendar's localization renders quoting UTC unnecessary. However, he pointed out a problem with using UTC - meeting times may change for those who observe DST. Instead, it would be better to quote an actual timezone of an actual area, such as 1700 CEST or 0900AM PDT. The use of a time system that changes clocks during DST seems to inconvenience the wrong position. One participant joked about hardforking time and upgrading it. Another participant suggested tonal time works well and consistently. There was also mention of the argument against using Google Calendar if it cannot support standard UTC.</summary>
