    <summary>During a discussion on IRC, it was mentioned that bitcoin-dev is too noisy and debates over bitcoin philosophy and broader context will start seeing grumpy list admins squawk about "off-topic!". To overcome this, the plan is to narrow the focus of the list to near term technical changes to the bitcoin protocol and its implementations such as bitcoin core, btcd, etc. However, it is also suggested that "take it elsewhere!" needs to have some place as a suggested destination.The proposal is to create a second list, bitcoin-tech-discuss or perhaps just 'bitcoin', with a more general rubric. This split has served IRC well and generally manages to keep the noise down to a productive level. The aim is to make sure that if bitcoin-dev is not productive then it's not useful. Overall, the goal is to increase productivity by focusing on technical discussions related to the development of bitcoin while providing a separate platform for broader discussions.</summary>
