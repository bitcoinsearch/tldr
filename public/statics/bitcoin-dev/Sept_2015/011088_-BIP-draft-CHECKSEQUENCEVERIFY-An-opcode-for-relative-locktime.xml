    <summary>Mark Friedenbach, a contributor to bitcoin-dev, mentions his sequencenumbers2 branch that includes an explicit relative lock-time field called nSequence. This field has clear semantics and is reserved for the future. He suggests commenting on #6312, where this topic is being discussed. Rusty agrees with Mark's suggestion and emphasizes that simplicity wins. The remaining half of the number space can be used for future purposes, while reserving the top two bits for those who are paranoid.</summary>
