    <summary>Bitcoin enthusiasts are finding it difficult to use the bitcoin symbol in text because it is not part of the Unicode standard. In response, a proposal has been written by Ken Shirriff to have the symbol added to Unicode. Shirriff has previously proposed a new character for Unicode and believes this has a good chance of succeeding. The proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf. Shirriff also suggested running the proposal by the bitcoin-dev group for endorsement, as support from Bitcoin developers could help the Unicode Committee recognize the importance of adding the symbol.</summary>
