    <summary>Bitcoin's popularity is not comparable to that of marijuana and guns, as they have separate support systems. While marijuana is an individual activity, Bitcoin users are vulnerable to being jailed. Guns, on the other hand, have the NRA to counter-balance the government for any gun control laws. The lack of a support system has made it difficult for Bitcoin to defend itself against legal attacks. However, if Bitcoin had its own NBitA, it would be better equipped to protect itself.An alternative solution suggested by some is to create a mining network that anyone can contribute to, which would enable Bitcoin to stay alive despite legal attacks. However, this would require features such as integrated darkcoin-style anonymity and only TOR protocol. Attempting to use Bitcoin in its current form for this type of fight is not feasible since it is overly-exposed and vulnerable. Additionally, not everyone shares the vision of Bitcoin as a marginalized outlawed coin somewhere in the depths of TOR.Finally, there are concerns about people promoting the most vulnerable position in smallblockistan and whether they might be agents of USG. Nevertheless, building an alt-coin with an ASIC-resistant algorithm seems more important than focusing on small blocks in the model.</summary>
