    <summary>The email thread on bitcoin-dev discusses the implementation of a new hardLimit for Bitcoin block sizes. The proposal suggests using a 4-byte unsigned integer to represent the block size in bytes, which is concise and easier to implement. Some suggestions were made regarding the use of human-readable strings, but it was deemed unnecessary. The discussion also covered several technical aspects, including the range of the hardLimit (1-32MB), the need for byte resolution, how votes are counted, and how the new hardLimit is calculated. It was suggested that miners can vote for the status quo by adding "/BV/" to the coinbase scriptSig. Additionally, there was debate over whether abstains should count as a vote for the status quo or not. In calculating the new hardLimit, the median value is calculated using the minimum and maximum values within a certain percentile range. Specifically, the raise value is determined by the vote for the 2400th highest block (20th percentile), while the lower value is defined as the vote for the 9600th highest block (80th percentile). If the raise value is higher than the current limit, then the new limit is set to the raise value. Similarly, if the lower value is lower than the current limit, then the new limit is set to the lower value. Otherwise, the size limit remains unchanged.</summary>
