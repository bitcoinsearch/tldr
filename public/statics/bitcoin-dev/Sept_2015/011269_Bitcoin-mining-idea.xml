    <summary>In an email sent on September 29, 2015, Jeff Garzik, a prominent member of the bitcoin development community, deemed a certain topic "off-topic" for the related mailing list. However, one individual responded to Garzik's email, accusing him of acting as though he possessed authority and trying to intimidate others. The individual suggested that Garzik should focus his attention on reviewing his company's handling and security measures with regards to bitcoin instead of attempting to bully people.</summary>
