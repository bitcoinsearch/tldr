    <summary>Lykke Corp, a Zurich-based company, is funding a Bitcoin-related competition to build a trading platform that allows participants to settle their trades through the blockchain via colored coins. The aim of the competition is to develop a community-driven effort rather than a proprietary technology. To facilitate quicker trade reconciliation, the use of a sidechain is suggested but not required. The competition will initially focus on foreign exchange and other assets will follow. Participants in the competition will receive 2 million Lykke coins ($8,000 USD) allocated for core development over the next three months. More details on the requirements can be found on the Lykke website.</summary>
