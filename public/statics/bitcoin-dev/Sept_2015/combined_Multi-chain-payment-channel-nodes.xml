    <summary>The lightning network and other multi-hop payment channel networks have the potential to handle more transactions per second. Payment channel network nodes have the ability to operate on multiple chains or ledgers if they are two-way-peg compatible with BTC. This method can be more accommodating for payment network users who may have different preferences about security models, fees, or other system properties. During an IRC monologue, the terms "hub" and "cross-chain hubs" were used to describe a payment channel network node. An earlier implication was that transaction fee trends could influence when payment channel users choose to settle on the main chain because fees may be too high to make the trade-offs worthwhile for the user. Centralized ledger operators, such as companies running spot exchanges, could run payment channel nodes, allowing their users to deposit and withdraw funds. However, this is subject to whether the service provider is operating anything resembling a hot wallet. Additionally, a centralized ledger operator could be considered a valid multi-chain destination in the above-mentioned imaginary lightning-compatible payment protocol.</summary>
