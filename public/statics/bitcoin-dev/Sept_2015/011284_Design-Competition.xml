    <summary>In a post on Bitcoin-dev, Eric Lombrozo jokingly suggests building a spaceship using only a watermelon, two donkeys, some duct tape, and a fire hydrant. However, the post also highlights the issue of finding developers for new services in the Bitcoin ecosystem. While some proposals receive significant interest if made by well-known individuals, others are dismissed as spam or ridiculed if coming from unknown sources. This creates an impression of exclusivity within the Bitcoin community. The author suggests creating a list where people can discuss proposed and ongoing projects and look for developers to hire.</summary>
