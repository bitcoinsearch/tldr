    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev conversation, Luke Dashjr responded to Jorge Timón's suggestion that expired transactions could be made as reorg-safe as coinbase transactions by requiring op_maturity/csv/rcltv of 100 for all outputs of an expirable transaction. Dashjr pointed out that this is not quite as safe as coinbase transactions because mined bitcoins have not only a 100-block maturity requirement but are also expensive to generate. On the other hand, mere OP_CHECKMATURITYVERIFY (aka rcltv) has no cost to use. The question was raised whether using an op_return output as a nonce to make the hash of the transaction contain some proof of work would make non-coinbase expirable transactions more secure against reorgs, but it was deemed irrelevant.</summary>
