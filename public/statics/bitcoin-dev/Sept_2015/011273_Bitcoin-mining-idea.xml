    <summary>Since 2011, the bitcoin-development list was created to focus on highly technical aspects of the core software and avoid philosophical discussions. However, since then, Bitcoin has changed and stakeholders have expanded. Therefore, it is important for the actual description of the list to clearly describe what people can expect to discuss when they sign up. This will ensure that discussions remain relevant and focused. The list's original intention to avoid philosophical discussions is not as important as providing a clear understanding of what topics are acceptable.</summary>
