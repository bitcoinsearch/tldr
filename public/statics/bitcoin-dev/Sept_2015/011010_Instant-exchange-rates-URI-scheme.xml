    <summary>A proposal for a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for a standard URI scheme to allow wallet operators to implement instant exchange or pegging to other currencies, cryptocurrencies or asset classes has been made. The idea is to include parameters in the wallet address that would supplement the presentation of a proposed transaction. For instance, a wallet operator which instantly exchanges Bitcoin to gold would present a wallet address with details such as currency, bitcoin-to-gold rate and expiry date. This would enable the sending wallet to present up-to-date exchange rates and other information to the user. The purpose of the proposal is to allow interoperable communications of rates and other pertinent information.</summary>
