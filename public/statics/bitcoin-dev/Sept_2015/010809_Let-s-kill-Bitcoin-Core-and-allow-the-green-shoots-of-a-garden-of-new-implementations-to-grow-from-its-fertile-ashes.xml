    <summary>The email thread discusses the risks of upgrading Bitcoin's consensus code and how to minimize risks in a non-emotive way. It is acknowledged that for upgrades to be successful, everyone should upgrade to the same consensus rule change, and ensuring backwards-compatibility through testing is essential. The email also proposes the idea of creating multiple implementations of Bitcoin Core with different scaling solutions, which users would select based on the code they choose to run. However, it is suggested that encouraging nodes or miners to "vote" by running a range of different consensus rules isn't helpful, as it can create compatibility issues and politicize a technical topic. Instead, the focus should be on analyzing proposals in a constructive, collaborative and technically-focused manner.</summary>
