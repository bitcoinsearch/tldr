    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Hearn suggested dropping the idea that "everyone must agree to make changes" in the Bitcoin community. He argued that there was never a rule that soft forks require total consensus and that a majority of miners can implement a soft fork against the wishes of other users. To counter this, merchant/exchange/user checkpointing is a valid response. However, no group can force through a hard fork without buy-in from a large portion of the userbase. While total consensus isn't required, very large consensus is necessary, as well as consensus across sub-groups.</summary>
