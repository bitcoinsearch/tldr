    <summary>On September 18, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan, a developer for Bitcoin, suggested scheduling a regular developer meeting in #bitcoin-dev via email to the group. The meeting would be voluntary, but it would be helpful to have many people in attendance to discuss current issues. It was emphasized that these meetings would be for discussions only and not for decisions to prevent any repeat of previous events where people were unable to attend. Wladimir then asked for preferences on days and times for the meeting, suggesting every week at 15:00-16:00 UTC on Thursdays. Luke Dashjr, a fellow developer, expressed his preference for a later time but agreed that the meeting time should be practical for California developers as well since there are several of them.</summary>
