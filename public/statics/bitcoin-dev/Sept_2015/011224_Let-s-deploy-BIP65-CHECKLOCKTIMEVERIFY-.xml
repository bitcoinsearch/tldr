    <summary>Mike Hearn and Peter Todd have a conversation about the addition of CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) to the Bitcoin protocol. Mike shows his approval of the opcode definition of the CLTV. When asked if he would add an IsSuperMajority() CLTV soft-fork to Bitcoin XT, Mike says yes but suggests putting the version bit change behind a command line flag due to problems with deployment in the BIP. Peter asks if Mike would add soft-fork detection to bitcoinj, but Mike opposes it and explains how hard and soft forks are handled by SPV clients. Peter mentions that neither case guarantees all miners adopt a fork and proposes proper SPV fork protections for bitcoinj or an alternative implementation that does.</summary>
