    <summary>In this email exchange between Eric and Mike Hearn, Eric tries to set aside their differences regarding SPV security. Eric asks Mike if he understands the different implications for soft forks and hard forks, assuming that insults were not his intention. Eric questions how doing this as a hard fork would make any difference to SPV clients other than requiring an extra OP_DROP, and suggests that warning the user on unrecognized nVersion and making unknown noops nonstandard could satisfy Mike's concerns. On the other hand, Mike argues that there is NO hard fork mechanism in place that isn't highly prone to systemic consensus failure, but suggests using an opcode that isn't currently defined as a solution. He also mentions that Eric's belief that SPV wallets are "inherently insecure" seems needlessly trollish.</summary>
