    <summary>On September 28, 2015, Mike Hearn expressed his concern over using a soft fork to deploy a feature in Bitcoin. He argued that this would cause problems for SPV wallets during the rollout period and suggested making it a hard fork instead. However, there was no consensus on the matter. In response to this, Adam wondered about Gavin's views and hoped that he would include it in XT. He also mentioned that the rationale for soft vs hard-forks is well known, so he wouldn't go over them.</summary>
