    <summary>A participant is being sought for a Bitcoin related competition aimed at building a trading platform that settles trades through the blockchain using colored coins. Initially, the platform will be for foreign exchange and will later be extended to other assets. The use of a sidechain is suggested but not mandatory. More details are available on www.lykkex.com, and contributions will be made available under an MIT license on GitHub. Richard Olsen, who sent the message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, stated he would answer questions about the competition. However, this competition is off-topic for the mailing list as it focuses on bitcoin protocol and reference implementation development.</summary>
