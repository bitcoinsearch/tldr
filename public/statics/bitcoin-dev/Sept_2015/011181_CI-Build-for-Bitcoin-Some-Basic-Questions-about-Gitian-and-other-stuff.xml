    <summary>In this message, Jonas explains that the core developers are responsible for manually uploading Gitian builds to bitcoin.org. He notes that it is important for users who decide to run a pre-compiled version of Bitcoin Core to verify the binary against the available Gitian sigs. These signatures can be found in the signature repository at https://github.com/bitcoin/gitian.sigs. Additionally, PGP Pubkeys can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/gitian-downloader and instructions for verifying Bitcoin Core can be found at https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/verifying_bitcoin_core. It is crucial for users to verify their binaries to ensure the security of their Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
