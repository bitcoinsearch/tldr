    <summary>In this email exchange from September 2015, Mike Hearn discusses the lack of consensus regarding a proposed change to the Bitcoin protocol. Specifically, he suggests that the requirement for everyone to agree on changes should be dropped and people should simply be informed of the change after its implementation. However, there is technical consensus for CLTV by IsSuperMajority() similar to the rollout of BIP66, with the only open question being whether to account for XT's use of versionbits, as the standard has not been finalized. The risks associated with this change are discussed, particularly the need for miners and SPV wallets to handle awareness of new blocks. BitcoinJ could play a pivotal role in mitigating these risks if additional handling had been added before activation. The necessity for additional SPV handling requirements and other preparation during a soft fork should be documented and advertised widely. Finally, objections to the change were strongly stated but it was noted that Gavin is OK with adding CLTV support to XT.</summary>
