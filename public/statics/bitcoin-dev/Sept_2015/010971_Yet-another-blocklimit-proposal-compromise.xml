    <summary>The proposal suggests assessing the technical possibility of increasing blocklimit without driving up the cost of running a fullnode too much. The determined blocksize limit will be set at the next reward halving and then doubled at every halving thereafter, reaching a hardlimit of 8GB. This doubling every four years is expected to stay within technological growth predictions. The proposal is considered a compromise between Pieter's and Gavin's proposals, with an initial increase to start the growth and reaching 8GB in 2056 if starting with 8MB. The start date is set around mid-2016. The proposal suggests a simple and predictable approach where block subsidy halves and blocksize limit doubles. It may make sense to update the limit more often in between based on a block's timestamp or for each difficulty period.</summary>
