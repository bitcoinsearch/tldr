    <title>[BIP/Draft] BIP Acceptance Process</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andy Chase proposed setting up a system where everyone has a say and clear acceptance can be reached regarding high-level Bitcoin decisions. However, Peter Todd argued that such a system would be silly in the current environment as it is difficult to force people to run software they don't want to. Todd suggested that the market should decide and if an idea isn't getting acceptance, those proposing it should do a better job of convincing relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, Todd stated that even if a process was created, it would fall apart if committees approved a BIP that relevant stakeholders disagreed with. Finally, Todd argued that for soft-forks, miners have little ability for other parties to have a say; for non-consensus-related standards, it's possible for a BIP to be "accepted" even if only a small group of users use the standard; and for hard-forks, almost everyone is involved, though who can stop a fork isn't well defined.</summary>
