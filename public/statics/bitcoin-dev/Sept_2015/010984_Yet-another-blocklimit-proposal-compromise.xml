    <summary>The relation between block maximum size and mining centralization is a complex issue. Marcel Jamin argues that the overlap between those who want to run serious mining operations and those who cannot afford an above-average internet connection is small. He proposes assessing the current block limit that is technically possible without increasing the cost of running a node too much, as most systems running a full node may have some capacity left. However, Jorge Timón raises concerns about further increasing mining centralization.</summary>
