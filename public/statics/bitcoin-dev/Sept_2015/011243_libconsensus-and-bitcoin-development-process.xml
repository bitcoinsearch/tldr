    <summary>There has been some discussion on IRC about the best approach to large-scale refactoring in Bitcoin development. The consensus seems to be that such projects should occur over a short period of time and have a written plan beforehand. Jeff Garzik raised concerns about the seemingly random nature of libconsensus refactoring PRs, noting that they can cause downstream developer headaches and make it difficult for non-trivial changes to be pushed upstream. Jorge Tim√≥n responded by pointing out that he had communicated his plan for libconsensus numerous times and that the changes were not random. Despite this, he acknowledged that there was still work to be done to help people understand his proposals and structure his pull requests more effectively.</summary>
