    <summary>There is a debate on using a soft fork to deploy a feature which currently lacks consensus. The issue with using a soft fork is that it would cause problems similar to other soft forks in which SPV wallets become less reliable during the rollout period. To avoid this, the suggestion is to use a hard fork instead. Until there is consensus, two options are presented: either drop the idea that everyone must agree to make changes, or do nothing. The former would require informing the community of the decision.</summary>
