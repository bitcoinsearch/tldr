    <summary>In an email conversation on September 4th, 2015, Andy Chase expressed concerns regarding the process of implementing changes within the bitcoin community. Luke responded by stating that only hard forks should go through the hard fork process, soft forks through the soft fork process, and so on. He believes trying to make a one-size-fits-all approach would mean de facto accepted Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) wouldn't be recognized because no one would care to meet the higher requirements.</summary>
