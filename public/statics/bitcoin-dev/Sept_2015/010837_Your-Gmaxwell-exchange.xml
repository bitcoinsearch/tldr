    <summary>In a discussion on decentralized bitcoin development, Eric Voskuil argues against the idea of forking as a means of achieving decentralization. He believes that true decentralization requires actually doing so, and that even forking is a major commitment. He also notes that common consensus check code is available in several bitcoin implementations, and that the claim that this is outrageously difficult is misleading. In response to Voskuil's comments, another participant in the discussion argues that there is no requirement for there to be multiple interpretations of the consensus code, citing the existence of libbitcoinconsensus. They question why Bitcoin's survival would be predicated on reimplementation. Finally, Voskuil acknowledges that these issues apply to Bitcoin Core as well as other implementations.</summary>
