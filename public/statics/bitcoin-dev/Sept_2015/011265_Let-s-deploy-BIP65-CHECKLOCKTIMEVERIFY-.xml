    <summary>Peter Todd, a developer of Bitcoin, has proposed the deployment of BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. There is common agreement on this, however, there is some controversy over how to deploy it. Todd believes that the versionbits proposal should have code out there for longer before being considered for concrete softforks. He has backported the CLTV op-code and an IsSuperMajority() soft-fork to the v0.10 and v0.11 branches, pull-reqs #6706 and #6707. A pull-req for git HEAD for the soft-fork deployment has been open since June 28th, #6351. After they are merged, a 0.10.3 and 0.11.1 release can be rolled out (with RC cycle). Todd thinks it's possible to safely get CLTV live on mainnet before the end of the year.</summary>
