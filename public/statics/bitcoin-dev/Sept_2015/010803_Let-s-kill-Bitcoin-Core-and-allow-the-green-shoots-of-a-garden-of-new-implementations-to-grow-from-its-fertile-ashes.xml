    <summary>In an email conversation on September 1, 2015, Peter R contacted bitcoin-dev to inquire about Bitcoin-B, which is associated with Blockstream. The response from Blockstream was that they currently have no interest in maintaining a separate implementation of Bitcoin. This decision was made because they believe it would have significantly negative value at this time. Additionally, there seems to be a climate where people are confusing alternative implementations with the destructive bifurcation of the Bitcoin ledger.</summary>
