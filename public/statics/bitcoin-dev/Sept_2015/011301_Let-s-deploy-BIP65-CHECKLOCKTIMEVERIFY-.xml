    <summary>The context discusses the requirement of a global software upgrade for full nodes in order to achieve the stated goal. The necessity of upgrading is emphasized, as failure to do so would result in the node no longer performing its intended function. Soft forks are also mentioned, with Jorge stating that they do not always lead to network convergence and instead result in constant mini divergences until everyone has upgraded. Adam's statement about consensus is challenged, as it is noted that ignoring those who disagree does not constitute true consensus. The author agrees with John's sentiment that never-ending debates are detrimental, and suggests organizing a conference about soft vs hard forks to explore the topic further. Talk titles are requested for vetting purposes.</summary>
