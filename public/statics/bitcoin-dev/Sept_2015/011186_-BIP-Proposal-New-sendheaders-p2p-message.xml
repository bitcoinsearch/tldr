    <title>[BIP Proposal] New "sendheaders" p2p message</title>

    <summary>In a thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a suggestion was made to unilaterally switch to sending headers instead of full blocks in order to improve block propagation. However, Tier Nolan expressed concern that this would not work for all network participants, especially those running older versions of Bitcoin Core or non-Bitcoin Core software. Additionally, even for versions 0.10 and 0.11 that process headers, the block fetching logic is not optimized for new block announcements via headers messages. As a solution, a pull request was implemented to allow nodes to opt-in to direct downloading of blocks upon receiving headers messages, while nodes that do not implement block downloading in response to headers announcements should continue to receive inv's.</summary>
