    <summary>The statement that users pay to use the network but have no defined rights is a feature of Bitcoin, not a bug. This is because if users had rights to sue someone, then the system would not be decentralized. If users had the right to sue all the miners, node operators, and developers collectively, it would not be realistic and would go against the decentralized nature of the system. Defining specific entities that have liability must mean they are in control, or otherwise they would not be liable.</summary>
