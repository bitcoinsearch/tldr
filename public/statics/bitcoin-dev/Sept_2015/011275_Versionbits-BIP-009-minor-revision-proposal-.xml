    <summary>In a BIP discussed by Pieter and Eric, it was noted that the miners turn off the bit as soon as it is locked in, which makes network adoption less visible. Rusty did not propose another suggestion but suggested that miners keep setting the bit for 2016 blocks after activation. In this regard, there should be a consensus rule that rejects blocks without the bit to force upgrades on the last miners. If the proposed idea works, then they can proceed with it. According to BIP-0009, if software supports the change, it should begin by setting B in all blocks mined until it is resolved. If bit B is set in 1916 or more of the 2016 blocks within a retarget period, it becomes 'locked-in,' and miners should continue setting bit B so uptake is visible. The consensus rules related to locked-in soft fork will be enforced in the second retarget period, allowing the remaining 5% to upgrade. At the activation block and after, miners should stop setting bit B, which may be reused for a different soft fork.</summary>
