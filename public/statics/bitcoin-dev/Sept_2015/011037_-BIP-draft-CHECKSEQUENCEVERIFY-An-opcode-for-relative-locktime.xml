    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach proposed two new variations of sequence numbers for Bitcoin transactions. The first variation inverts the sequence number with nSequence=1 meaning 1 block relative lock-height, and nSequence=LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD meaning 1 second relative lock-height. The second variation also inverts the sequence number, but interprets it as a fixed-point number allowing for up to 5-year relative lock times using blocks as units or up to about 2-year relative lock times using seconds as units. Both variations leave bits available for future use. Friedenbach sought input on what an appropriate maximum relative lock-time would be, suggesting up to 1 year. Eric Lombrozo commented that he would prefer replacing the entire nSequence field with an explicit relative lock-time with clear semantics.</summary>
