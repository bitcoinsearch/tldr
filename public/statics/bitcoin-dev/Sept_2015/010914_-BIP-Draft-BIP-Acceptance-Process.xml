    <summary>Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) need a clearly defined process for acceptance and acknowledgement, according to author Andy Chase. While BIP-0001 outlines the process for submitting proposals, it doesn't specify how they are accepted or rejected. To address this, Chase proposed a method by which BIPs go through comments and acceptance processes. He suggests committees be created to represent client authors, miners, merchants and users, each representing at least 1% of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Acceptance is defined as at least 70% of the represented percentage stake in three out of four segments.</summary>
