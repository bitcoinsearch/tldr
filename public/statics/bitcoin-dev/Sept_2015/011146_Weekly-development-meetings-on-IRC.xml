    <summary>In an email conversation dated September 21, 2015, a person named gb suggested that they could provide some insights based on their experience of working with other transglobal IT projects. Although the planning for the project was already underway, gb's input could still be valuable. The speaker responded by saying that scheduling could always be changed later and proposed trying out the plan once before making any major changes.</summary>
