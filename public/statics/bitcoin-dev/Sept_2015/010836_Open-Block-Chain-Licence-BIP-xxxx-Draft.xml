    <summary>The discussion involves proposing a block chain license to supplement the existing MIT License which only covers the core reference client software. The proposal raises concerns about licensing after the fact, which requires permission from every copyright holder to make any changes. It was suggested that miners be the main beneficiaries of licensing, and they should vote to adopt the new terms. The proposed changes would be considered effective on a retrospective basis. There are considerations on whether gaining permissions for a change to be considered effective is necessary from data existing before a license change. The block chain is in perpetual change and the sooner a change is agreed upon, the more data it will cover without any reservations. Thus, further investigation is needed to determine if this proposal is feasible.</summary>
