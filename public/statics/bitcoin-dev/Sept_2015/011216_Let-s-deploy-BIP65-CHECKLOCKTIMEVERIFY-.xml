    <summary>In an email exchange on September 28, 2015, Gavin Andresen suggested that the Bitcoin community should stop pretending that "everyone must agree to make consensus rule changes" and instead operate under rough consensus. He also called for better communication and a risk/benefit security tradeoff analysis document regarding SPV nodes. Peter Todd responded in agreement, suggesting that mempool-only deployment could help mitigate risks to SPV nodes. However, he noted that CLTV-using transactions are non-standard and not relayed in all Bitcoin Core releases. Gavin also asked if there was such a document available for BIP101.</summary>
