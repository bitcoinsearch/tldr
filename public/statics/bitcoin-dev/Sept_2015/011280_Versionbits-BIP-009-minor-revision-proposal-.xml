    <summary>This context discusses the difficulty of determining whether or not miners are enforcing new rules, without relying on someone mining a block that breaks the rule. While hard forks do provide a means of enforcement, they come with greater risks and potential disruption. The author suggests that a good awareness campaign can help address concerns about older clients. Despite the frustration of not being able to explicitly acknowledge enforcement, this is simply the reality of the situation.</summary>
