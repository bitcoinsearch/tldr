    <summary>The discussion is about the difference between doing a proposed change as a soft fork versus a hard fork in terms of its impact on SPV clients. The author questions why all clients do not warn the user on unrecognized nVersion and suggests that a hard fork would be simpler and more SPV-friendly. The author also notes that making unknown noops nonstandard was already done in a previous change to soft forks, but it did not address all concerns. The author believes that hard forks are well understood and simple, while soft forks require extra code and can be unfriendly to SPV. They question the benefits of soft forks and seek clarification on their advantages.</summary>
