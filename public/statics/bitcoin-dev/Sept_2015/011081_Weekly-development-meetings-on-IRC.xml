    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around scheduling meetings using UTC versus a specific timezone. Google Calendar was mentioned as being localized, but the problem with quoting UTC is that meeting times will change for those observing daylight saving time. It was suggested to quote an actual timezone of an area so it remains constant even during DST changes. The idea of hardforking time was jokingly suggested and tonal time was mentioned as a consistent alternative. One participant expressed frustration with the inconvenience caused by clock-changing.</summary>
