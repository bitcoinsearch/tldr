    <summary>In an email thread on September 3, 2015, Andy Chase stated that he wrote the BIP mainly to generate ideas about governance. Bryan, in response, expressed his concerns over committee design but did not elaborate further. However, he suggested that ecosystem echo-chambers should make efforts to represent alternative viewpoints through strong steelman arguments. These arguments, if internalized, could be useful for pathological integration. Bryan also mentioned that the proposed process does not have to replace any existing BIP process and could proceed indefinitely without namespace collision.</summary>
