    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Arthur Bouquet proposed the idea of a URI scheme to simplify the process of requesting and verifying signatures, similar to the BIP0021 bitcoin URI scheme for requesting payments. This would allow for easier use of bitcoin signatures and could become available in bitcoin clients that support message signing/verifying and payment URLs or QR codes. To gain proper consensus, Bouquet suggested going through a BIP and presented his idea publicly before proceeding with a draft BIP and reference implementation. The proposed URI scheme could use the same format as BIP0021 with an additional parameter or utilize a different scheme like BIP121. The signing process would require manual approval from the user, similar to the BIP0021 scheme. Bouquet also posted a topic on the Bitcointalk forum for further discussion. Another user in the thread expressed interest in a similar proposal for multi-signature wallets.</summary>
