    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposed hardLimit for Bitcoin blocks. The current range is set from 1-32MB, and there are concerns about reinstating a legacy limitation by imposing this limit. The message size limit aims to reduce storage requirements per peer and make it harder for a node to support many peers. The suggestion is to use a merkleblock message, allowing receiving parts of a block from multiple sources. Changing hardLimit can be achieved by encoding a proposed value within a block's coinbase scriptSig. Miners vote for the nearest MB, and votes out of range should be clamped. The new hardLimit will be the median of the current hardLimit * 1.2, 20-percentile, current hardLimit/1.2, and 80-percentile. If the raise value is higher than the status quo, then the new limit is set to the raise value; if the lower value is lower than the status quo, then the new limit is set to the lower value. Otherwise, the size limit remains unchanged.</summary>
