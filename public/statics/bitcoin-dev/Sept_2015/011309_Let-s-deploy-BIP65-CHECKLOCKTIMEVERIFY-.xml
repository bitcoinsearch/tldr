    <summary>The context is a discussion about the upgrade of full nodes and the reduction in security that comes with not upgrading. The conversation also touches on the issue of absentee miners and the production of invalid blocks. It is stated that soft forks do not guarantee the outcome of absentee miners producing invalid blocks, whereas hard forks do. Miners who have changed their code in unadvisable ways can produce invalid blocks and there are many seemingly innocuous ways to do so. The modification of IsStandard() will not necessarily result in invalid blocks; unknown NOPs are now handled via a script validation flag. It is noted that invalid CLTVs do not currently appear to get mined.</summary>
