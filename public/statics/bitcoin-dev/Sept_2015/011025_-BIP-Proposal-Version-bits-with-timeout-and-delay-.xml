    <summary>In an email exchange on September 16, 2015, Jorge Timón suggests that enforcing new restrictions on one's own blocks does not require waiting for 75% consensus. Instead, one can enforce the restrictions from the start, and all miners who set the bit will also do so. At 75%, there is a solid super-majority. Timón suggests that one can safely reject blocks that have the bit set but are invalid according to the new rule, as long as everyone who sets the bit enforces the new restrictions.</summary>
