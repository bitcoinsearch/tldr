    <summary>Danny Thorpe suggested using the network magic bytes to distinguish between mainnet and testnet instead of an extremely long hex string from the genesis hash. He mentioned that this would be much shorter, just as distinct, and two coins could have the same magic bytes but communicate on separate ports. However, he preferred a common network name mapping for the sake of humanity and suggested that this BIP should define one string name alias for each supported network while leaving the mapping to local implementers' lingo. To avoid confusion, Thorpe proposed having cointype like BIP44, which is described in detail in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#coin-type.</summary>
