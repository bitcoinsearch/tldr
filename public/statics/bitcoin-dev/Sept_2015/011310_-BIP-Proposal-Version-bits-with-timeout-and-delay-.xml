    <summary>In a conversation on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding expressed concern over the possibility of support falling off during a delay period for a new proposal, resulting in far below threshold support just moments prior to enforcement. However, Rusty Russell agreed with Gavin's stance that keeping things simple and well defined is crucial, and accounting for all corner cases may not be feasible. Despite this, the BIP was changed to allow for visibility on any fall off in support, though no action would be taken to address it.</summary>
