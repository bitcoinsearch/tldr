    <summary>The writer believes that rough consensus is good enough and we should stop pretending that "everyone must agree to make consensus rule changes." They also suggest that a risk/benefit security tradeoff analysis document needs to be written up to better communicate the risks to SPV nodes. Once the soft fork rolls out, they suggest mempool-only deployment as a mitigation strategy. The writer also agrees that CLTV is ready to roll out and should happen ASAP. In response to this, Mike Hearn has objected to using a soft fork to deploy this feature, citing problems with SPV wallets becoming less reliable during the rollout period. He suggests making it a hard fork instead. Until then, he advises doing either of two things: 1) Drop the idea that everyone must agree to make changes or 2) Do nothing.</summary>
