    <summary>In an email chain between Matt Corallo and Jeffrey Paul, Matt expressed his belief that the use of UTC and GMT is outdated on both Google Calendar's website and Android. However, Jeffrey pointed out that it is possible to configure Google Calendar to show additional time zones and that GMT/UTC is included in the list. Matt then suggested using a timezone that observes DST in roughly the same way as everyone else, such as CEST/PDT/EST/etc. The conversation ends with Jeffrey's contact information.</summary>
