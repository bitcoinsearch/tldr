    <summary>In the given context, the author discusses the ambiguity surrounding the use of "1M" as a unit of measurement. The term has been used to refer to 1,000,000 bytes as well as 1,048,576 bytes and 1,024,000 bytes. The author proposes that "megabyte" should be used to exclusively mean 2^20 (1,048,576) bytes. They also advocate for using "Kb" to always mean 1024 bytes, despite some people rounding it, making it the preferred specification.The author acknowledges the importance of having human-readable data and suggests that the specification should establish clear guidelines on these details. By doing so, there will be less confusion and more consistency in the use of units of measurement in various contexts.</summary>
