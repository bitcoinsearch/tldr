    <summary>The conversation in question seems to have gone off-topic, as per the initial comment. The topic at hand is unclear as Jeff's emails and follow-ups do not provide a clear picture, only mentioning an agreement made by unnamed individuals to do something if a metric is modified. This does not address the fundamental issues at play. As such, there is little on-topic discussion to be had. However, once Wladimir starts a thread with a BIP and a clear plan for Bitcoin Core, there will be more relevant topics to discuss.</summary>
