    <summary>The process of manually uploading gitian builds to bitcoin.org was discussed in an email exchange between Mark Friedenbach and Roy Osherove, dated September 23, 2015. According to Mark Friedenbach, the gitian builds are made available on bitcoin.org, and there is no build server where gitian builds are automatically done and made available as this would defeat the purpose of gitian. The quorum signatures are accumulated manually and can be found on the github page for gitian.sigs. Roy Osherove asked if there is a public server where gitian builds can be viewed, and a public server that shows the quorum verifications or that shows how to join in on the verification if such a thing is helpful. Mark Friedenbach explained that the binaries are not used anywhere else because Travis is not a trusted platform. The binaries on bitcoin.org are built using the gitian process and signed by a quorum of developers. Roy Osherove also mentioned that he was trying to create a reproducible build of his own for bitcoin and bitcoin-XT using TeamCity, and asked if all the platforms need to be supported, and if gitian is truly required to be used, or used in parallel, or at all. Feedback was requested on the current build presented by Roy Osherove on http://btcdev.osherove.com:8111/.</summary>
