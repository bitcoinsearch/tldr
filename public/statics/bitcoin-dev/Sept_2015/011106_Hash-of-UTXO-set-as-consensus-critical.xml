    <summary>In an email conversation on September 19, 2015, Rune Kj√¶r Svendsen discussed the distinction between a 51% attack and malicious mining. A 51% attack occurs when the majority of mining power is malicious. Malicious mining can be observed in the behavior of miners. For example, if miner A mines honestly while miner B mines maliciously, there would be differences in their behavior that could be observed. Justus Ranvier, from the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, participated in the email exchange and provided his contact information along with his public key signature.</summary>
