    <summary>The conversation starts with a frustrated comment about the need to upgrade time via a hardfork. The discussion then moves on to the topic of Google Calendar and its localization options for changing time zones. However, it is noted that there is little global consistency in daylight saving time (DST) usage, with different places observing it on different dates. This means that events scheduled in DST time zones could potentially move twice during each change for some people who observe it. For example, Europe and the US end DST one week apart.</summary>
