    <summary>Ken Shirriff, a member of the Bitcoin community, has proposed to add the Bitcoin symbol to Unicode. The use of the Bitcoin symbol in text is currently inconvenient because it is not included in the Unicode standard. In his proposal, Shirriff suggests adding the common B-with-vertical-bars Bitcoin symbol to Unicode. He believes that with endorsement from Bitcoin developers, the Unicode Committee will realize the importance of adding this symbol. Shirriff has successfully proposed a new character for Unicode before and thinks that this proposal has a good chance of succeeding. The full proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf.</summary>
