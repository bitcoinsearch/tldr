    <summary>In this email exchange, Tier Nolan and Jorge Timón discuss the best approach to implementing a new rule in Bitcoin. Nolan suggests that if 75% of blocks in the last 2016 window have the bit set, then all blocks that do not meet the new rule should be rejected. Timón argues that relying on nodes to follow the standard policy is not enough and suggests instead applying the new rule from the start in their own blocks and waiting for 95% consensus activation. Nolan asks for the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</summary>
