    <summary>The message is about AT&amp;T's landline and internet offerings. The author suggests that if someone has the AT&amp;T landline but doesn't use the standard internet/TV offering, then they should check with local small ISPs to see what their policies are regarding ports. Ideally, the ISP should let users port forward to SOMEPORTNUMBER for TCP and UDP and have port 8333 open. The author also notes that if someone has FTTN because they are paying a local ISP for internet service, and that local ISP has contracted with AT&amp;T to provide service in an area where old-style DSL has been phased out, then even if the local ISP has its own privacy policy posted which is different from AT&amp;T, everything is subject to AT&amp;T data retention because of the FTTN. Therefore, the author recommends getting a VPN (or setting up one's own) for one's connection. Tor will run through the VPN. The message also includes an excerpt from Zach G via bitcoin-dev, who was struggling to get port 8333 open all year. After hours of phone calls and messaging AT&amp;T, he discovered that the internet was being routed through a DVR/cable box, and they confirmed the DVR also had a firewall. AT&amp;T refused to turn the firewall off because it is their equipment. Therefore, they can firewall any port they want even if the customer asks them not to. The author suggests that this may be the driving force behind the decline in Bitcoin nodes and that Bitcoin is being censored by ISPs themselves.</summary>
