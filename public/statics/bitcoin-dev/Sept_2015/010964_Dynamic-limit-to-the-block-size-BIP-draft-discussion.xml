    <summary>The author expresses their support for a technical approach to block scaling rather than a political one. They criticize BIP100 for giving too much power to miners and consider BIP101's attempt to predict technological progression in the future as flawed. The author suggests that a dynamic limit on block size would be favorable, but worries about the potential need for a hard fork in the future and the difficulty of upgrading embedded firmware. They propose a plan where the maximum block size decreases by 10% every 4032 blocks if a minimum of 2500 blocks has a size greater than the previous maximum block size. The author also identifies the risks of a selfish mining attack and suggests that unbounded growth is undesirable.</summary>
