    <summary>In a 2015 email, Adam Back discussed the importance of maintaining economically dependent full nodes for Bitcoin security. He argued that it is crucial to define what "reasonably convenient" means in order to ensure decentralization security. Additionally, he suggested that node operators likely have headroom for larger blocks and increasing network connection requirements may even decrease mining centralization. Back also addressed the proposal for an 8MB block size cap from Chinese miners, clarifying that it was due to limitations in current network infrastructure and what they felt would remain fair to all miners and node operators worldwide. Finally, Back proposed a plan to gradually increase the block size from 2-4-8MB over a 4-year time frame, with a hard fork upgrade once everyone in the network has upgraded.</summary>
