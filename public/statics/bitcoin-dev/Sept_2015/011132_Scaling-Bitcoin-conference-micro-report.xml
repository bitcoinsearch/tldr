    <summary>The Bitcoin community has been working on developing a more modular and layered architecture to achieve greater decentralization in software development. This would result in less need for critical code reviews, pushback from developers, and a better process for building consensus within the community. However, it is not clear if this would change the level of centralization of how final decisions are made.One threat to Bitcoin is the incentive for companies to hire developers to change or not change Bitcoin Core to benefit their interests. While this risk needs to be understood and considered, there may not be much that can be done about it.To increase the basic infrastructure nodes significantly, the community needs to have properly aligned incentives. While this may mean increased transaction fees, it is doable and necessary to achieve greater decentralization.</summary>
