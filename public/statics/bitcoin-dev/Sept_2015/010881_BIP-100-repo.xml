    <summary>The message is a communication sent via email by Jeff Garzik on September 2, 2015, to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. In the message, Garzik shares that he has opened a repository containing the full text of BIP 100 discussion document in markdown format. The BIP 100 formal specification will also be checked into the same repository before submitting it to the upstream bips.git repo. Garzik provides a link to the newly created repository in his previous email, which had failed to include the link. The context suggests that the email was part of a wider conversation about a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy - ABIS.IO.</summary>
