    <summary>This is a proposal for the BIP Realistic Acceptance Process, which aims to document the current method for accepting or rejecting BIPs. The motivation behind this document is to allow for a discussion on a realistic and acceptable BIP acceptance procedure. The author notes that while BIP-0001 defines the process for writing and submitting a Bitcoin improvement proposal, it does not specify the precise method for which BIPs are considered accepted or rejected. The proposal outlines a game-like process that simulates the different stages of the BIP process. This involves drawing up an implementation, submitting it for comments on a mailing list, submitting a draft pull request to bitcoin/bip, submitting a pull request with implementation, and finally, a hard fork. Each stage has its own set of rules and requirements, which are detailed in the proposal. The proposal has been put into the public domain, and it is specifically based around the acceptance process of BIP-0064, which was picked because it picks up a lot of the edge cases that BIPs often have. The author cites several calls for documenting and using the current "realistic" method for BIP acceptance from prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, such as Luke Jr., Btc Drak, Peter Todd, and Adam Back.</summary>
