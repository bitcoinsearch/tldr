    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, members debated the standardisation of HTTP queries to blockchain explorers. The conversation centred around the identification of chains and transactions within them, with some suggesting that the authority component of a URL should identify the chain, and the path component should identify the particular block, transaction or address in that chain. Others proposed the idea of allowing well-known chains to register a name to be used as an alternative to the literal hash syntax. There was also discussion around using the genesis block hash as a rigorous method for identifying a reference to a transaction, while also allowing for more relaxed alternatives. The GitHub repository for Common-Blockchain was referenced throughout the conversation as a resource for exploring these ideas further.</summary>
