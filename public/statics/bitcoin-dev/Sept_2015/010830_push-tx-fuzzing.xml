    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Kristov Atlas expressed interest in developing a fuzzer for push tx APIs but could not find one after a brief search. He asked if anyone had found otherwise or was engaged in writing one. Jonas Nick provided two links to Bitcoin Consensus Test Cases and his blog post on fuzzing Bitcoin Consensus. According to Nick, the only implementations with significant network presence are btcd and Bitcoin Core, and fuzzing them should be sufficient if these services validate transactions using either of the two. Two implementations linked by Atlas were based in Insight that uses Bitcoin Core for validation. If they don't validate transactions before broadcast, they will not make it beyond a single hop through the P2P network and are of minimal concern.</summary>
