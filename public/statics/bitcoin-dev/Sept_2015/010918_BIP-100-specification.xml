    <summary>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave Scotese raised the issue of varying interpretations of the term "1M" in relation to bytes used by different people within the industry. He believes that "megabyte" should be used to refer specifically to 2^20 (1,048,576) bytes and that "Kb" should always mean 1024 bytes, rather than being rounded up or down. To clarify the situation, he suggested that the spec needed to nail down these details. The IEC standard, meanwhile, is to use the prefix MiB for 2^20 bytes.</summary>
