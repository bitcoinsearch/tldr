    <summary>On 09/03/2015, Luke Dashjr proposed modifying the BIP 43 to refer non-Bitcoin purpose codes to the SLIP repository. However, Justus Ranvier questioned the benefit of delegating the BIP-43 namespace management to that particular company as it adds complexity to its usage for no discernible benefit. Ranvier is associated with the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project and provided his contact details in the email signature. The email also includes two attachments - one is an application/pgp-keys file named 0xEAD9E623.asc with a size of 18381 bytes, and the other is an application/pgp-signature file named signature.asc with a size of 801 bytes.</summary>
