    <summary>In an email exchange from September 4, 2015, Marco Pontello stated that he couldn't see any issues with the current process, but was actually in need of more details. The email thread discusses the use of GitHub for BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) and how it has caused some confusion with numbering assignments. The conversation mentions how a WIKI page used to be the preferred method, but the switch to GitHub had some benefits despite the issue with numbering. The message ends with a reflection on how they should have fixed the issue earlier and a note to learn from the experience.</summary>
