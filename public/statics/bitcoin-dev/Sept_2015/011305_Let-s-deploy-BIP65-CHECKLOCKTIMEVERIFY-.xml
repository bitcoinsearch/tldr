    <summary>When a miner accepts an invalid transaction into its memory pool and tries to mine it, it will continue producing invalid blocks until the owner shuts it down and upgrades. This issue occurred for weeks after P2SH triggered. This problem can be caused by miners that modified or bypassed IsStandard(), accept direct transaction submission, or run an old node from before OP_NOPs were made non-standard. However, the "single divergence" in the hardfork grows forever unless all miners eventually upgrade. Fortunately, they do recognize the loss of money and upgrade. Therefore, the argument presented does not make sense.</summary>
