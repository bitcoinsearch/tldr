    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his opinion about the signed message feature of Bitcoin in September 2015. He suggested that the whole process of signing messages needs to be rethought since it is commonly used in insecure cases where it doesn't actually work. For instance, people use it to prove ownership of bitcoins and/or that they sent bitcoins, but current signed messages cannot do either. Luke Dashjr believes that any new method must avoid using the same key as for signing transactions since the public key is technically private information. Additionally, he notes that addresses are semi-deprecated by the payment protocol, so it may not make sense to design an entire authentication system without considering this fact. Arthur proposed a solution to give users an easier way to access existing tools than the "sign message thing" itself. His proposal is about the current signing process, which exists even if it's not perfect, but it could also work with a new signing message system tomorrow. However, Luke Dashjr was concerned about privacy issues and requested elaboration on why the use case Arthur referred to doesn't actually work. Finally, Arthur shared a link to a real case that uses Bitcoin signatures.</summary>
