    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposal for a new rule and its implementation in the bitcoin network. The focus is on defining the states and trigger mechanisms rather than arguing over optimal values for supermajority requirements. The proposed implementation involves miners setting a bit, applying the rule to their own blocks, and if 75% of the last 2016 blocks have the bit set, then go to tentative state where miners enforce the rule in blocks with the bit set. If 95% of the last 2016 blocks have the bit set, then it goes to locked-in state, which is the point of no return. In this state, miners enforce the rule in blocks with the bit set and after 2016 blocks, it goes to the activated state. In the activated state, miners do not set the bit, reject any block that has the bit set for 10080 blocks, and reject blocks that don't follow the new rule. The advantage of enforcing the rule when 75% is reached is that miners get early notification that they have implemented the rule incorrectly, producing blocks that they think are fine but aren't.</summary>
