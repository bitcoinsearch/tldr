    <summary>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers, Chris D'Costa expressed agreement with Adam's opinion that it would not be appropriate to experiment with the Bitcoin network on the live network or testnet. He posed the question of whether there is an interest in creating a Bitcoin fork that would allow for unrestricted experimentation, which he believes could provide valuable insights for future decisions regarding Core updates. However, he identified the lack of incentive as a potential problem. The concept that D'Costa described is similar to sidechains, which are a way to experiment with new features without launching a separate altcoin. Elements Alpha was suggested as a technical sandbox for this type of experimentation and currently has experimental changes to transaction structure. It provides a way to experiment with new ideas without affecting the stability of the main Bitcoin network.</summary>
