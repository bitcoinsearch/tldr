    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in September 2015, Matt Corallo suggested that Google Calendar be used for scheduling events, but with a timezone that observes DST in roughly the same way as everyone else. However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that there is little global consistency in DST usage, with many places implementing it on different dates. Therefore, if an event is scheduled in a DST timezone, it is likely to move twice each change for some people who observe it. For example, Europe and the US end DST one week apart.</summary>
