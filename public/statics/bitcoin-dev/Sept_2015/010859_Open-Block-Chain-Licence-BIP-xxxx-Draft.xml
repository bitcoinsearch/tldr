    <summary>The Bitcoin community has received a proposal for an Open Block Chain Licence, which some believe is necessary to supplement the existing MIT Licence. However, there are concerns that such a licence would be pointless as Bitcoin cannot be controlled and it would not stand up in court. There is also concern that the proposal represents centralisation of one of the few decentralised things left on the planet. The draft BIP is available for discussion and evaluation.</summary>
