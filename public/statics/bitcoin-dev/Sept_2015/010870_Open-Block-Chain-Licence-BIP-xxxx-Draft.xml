    <summary>The reviewed effort is not worth any additional time, according to a legal reference called Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991). The court ruled that Rural's directory was just an alphabetic list of all subscribers, and no creative expression was involved, so Rural's copyright claim was dismissed. Claiming ownership or authority or issuing any license has no benefit because nobody is going to enforce anything, and they don't even have the authority anyway. A 5-minute talk with an IP lawyer should confirm this, but Bitcoin attracts quite a number of completely irrational people.</summary>
