    <summary>Corey Haddad, via bitcoin-dev, suggested that if the blocksize divide is hinging on differing developer views on the nature of the threat posed by governments, it may be better to defer to people who specialize in that area. Jerry Brito is an expert on this topic. Some influential developers know Bitcoin but are completely ignorant about government regulations and will go around claiming everyone who discusses regulation is a "statist". There are also developers who are going around claiming that stress testing is a criminal action against those running nodes. This brings up complicated legal questions about the liability of people running nodes. Instead of contacting someone who researched the issue, the developer posted some hyperbolic article on Reddit which did nothing but promote misinformation. Furthermore, there is an issue about the conference where developers should not be accepting advertisers engaged in nefarious activities. BitcoinTalk was accepted as an advertiser, which has promoted fake banks where many users lost money (CoinLeders/Inputs.io), illegal investment schemes where many people lost funds (BLBSE), and a whole host of questionable, illegal, immoral, and unethical activities. Just because the guy who runs the site wrote a block explorer that does not mean the developers should blindly promote a highly questionable website that damages Bitcoin's reputation. The people running these events need to start acting responsibly.</summary>
