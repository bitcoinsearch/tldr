    <summary>SPV wallets do not detect hard-forks as they pick the highest work chain. Any miner who has not upgraded makes blocks on the shorter chain, which are then ignored and stored for future reorganizations. The underlying problem is that after the fork point, there will be no blocks in the main chain that violate the rules and end up being orphaned. This is how bitcoinj was designed to work, so there is no flaw in it.</summary>
