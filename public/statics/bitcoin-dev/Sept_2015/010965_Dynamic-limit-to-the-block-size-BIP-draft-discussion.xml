    <summary>In a discussion around the proposal of a dynamic limit on the block size, Gavin Andresen and another individual's favorable stance was revealed. However, Corey Fields, a Bitcoin Core developer, stated that he was unclear on what problem(s) this proposal was trying to solve. Fields suggested implementing simple rules such as specifying a maximum block size based on the average block size over the last N blocks or implementing an absolute maximum block size that increases by a maximum of 3.45 times every year. He questioned the need for centralized decision-making in determining how full blocks "should" be and justifying why these specific growth limits were chosen.</summary>
