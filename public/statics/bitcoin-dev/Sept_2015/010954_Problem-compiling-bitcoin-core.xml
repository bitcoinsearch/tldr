    <summary>On September 7th, 2015, Sriram Karra responded to a post by LinuXperia regarding an issue with the Boost libs. LinuXperia thanked Karra for his response and acknowledged that he did not have the correct configuration options. BTC Drake and ChinaTinte reached out directly to LinuXperia after seeing the post and were able to help him solve the problem. LinuXperia was eventually able to successfully build bitcoin-core from sources and expressed gratitude towards everyone who helped, including the bitcoin developers.</summary>
