    <summary>The discussion revolved around the concept of honest miners and fraud in Bitcoin mining. The security assumption is that a supermajority of miners are honest which can be problematic if a dishonest miner majority commits fraud against users by mining only empty blocks or other actions that render money worthless. However, mining empty blocks itself is not fraud. The definition of an honest miner is one that follows the rules of the protocol. It is important to note that relying on miners' honesty is necessary even if one runs a full node, as per the white paper.</summary>
