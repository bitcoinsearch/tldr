    <summary>In this conversation, Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille are discussing the potential downsides of soft forks. Maxwell has expressed his objections to the idea multiple times in the past and does not understand why there is a push for them when there are acknowledged risks involved. He also questions the specific benefits to end-users of implementing a soft fork. Wuille argues that there is no need for changes to BIP 101 for SPV clients to follow the new chain automatically. Maxwell continues to object to the implementation of CLTV due to the lack of consensus and financial risk involved. In the past, Wuille had argued that hard forks are riskier, but did not explain why he thought so. Overall, the debate over the pros and cons of soft forks versus hard forks continues.</summary>
