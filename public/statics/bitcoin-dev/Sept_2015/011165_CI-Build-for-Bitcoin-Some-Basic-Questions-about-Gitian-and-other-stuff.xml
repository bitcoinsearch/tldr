    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list named Roy Osherove asked about creating a reproducible build of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-XT, using TeamCity. He wanted to know if all the platforms needed to be supported, and if gitian is required to be used. Mark Friedenbach responded to his questions by stating that the binaries on bitcoin.org are built using the gitian process and signed by a quorum of developers. The builds made by Travis only ensure that the source code compiles and tests run successfully on all supported platforms, but they are not used anywhere else because Travis is not a trusted platform. Therefore, there is no public server where the gitian builds can be viewed or where the quorum verifications can be seen.</summary>
