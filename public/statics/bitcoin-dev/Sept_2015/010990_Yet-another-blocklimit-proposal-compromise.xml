    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin security, Marcel Jamin suggests that increasing network connection requirements might decrease mining centralization. However, he argues that not being well connected with other miners is a problem for the rest of the miners, rather than Chinese miners who are the majority in terms of hashrate. Adam Back notes that full nodes play an important role in enforcing consensus rules and ensuring decentralization, and it is important to make it reasonably convenient to run full nodes for decentralization security. He also clarifies that the 8MB cap proposed by Chinese miners was due to current network infrastructure limitations, not a lack of interest in scaling. In response to concerns about mining centralization, Jamin proposes assessing a block limit that is technically possible without driving up the costs of running a node too much.</summary>
