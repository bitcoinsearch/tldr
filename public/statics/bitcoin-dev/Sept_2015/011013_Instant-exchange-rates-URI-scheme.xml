    <summary>A proposal for a standard URI scheme to allow wallet operators that implement instant exchange or pegging to other currencies, cryptocurrencies or asset classes to allow for interoperable communication of rates and other pertinent information has been put forward. The idea is to include in the wallet address as parameters information that supplements the presentation of a proposed transaction. This would allow the sending wallet the ability to present up-to-date exchange rates. The proposal suggests using the bitcoin address as an example of how this could work. It includes the currency, cryptocurrency or asset that the transaction will end up as encoded in ISO 4217 if applicable; the bitcoin to rate as dictated by receiving wallet; and a Unix timestamp of when the rate loses validity. The proposal suggests that the sending wallet specify the amount of Bitcoin they wish to be paid rather than adding more things to consider at checkout time which confuses things.</summary>
