    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ahmed Zsales suggested that a block chain license is required for the network. This generated interest and led to a previous discussion in 2012 which was shared by Bryan Bishop. The group also considered references to protections for private keys while they remain under your control and whether or not finding private keys attached to coins and moving the funds constituted theft. However, the decision was made not to include anything specific in the draft license to keep it simple, relying instead on generic definitions of rights to private transaction data which would cover private keys.</summary>
