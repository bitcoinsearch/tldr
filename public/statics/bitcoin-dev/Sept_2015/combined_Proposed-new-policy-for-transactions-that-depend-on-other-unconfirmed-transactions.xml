    <title>Combined summary - Proposed new policy for transactions that depend on other unconfirmed transactions</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin developer Alex Morcos has proposed changes to the policy limits on unconfirmed transaction chains. These changes aim to limit the size of the mempool and ensure that a new transaction can pay not only for the transaction it would evict but also any dependent transactions that would be removed from the mempool.The existing limits are quite generous and could lead to mempool clogging or relay fee boosting attacks. The proposed new limits are 25 transactions and 100 kilobytes of total size for both ancestor and descendant packages, which would affect less than 2% of transactions entering the mempool in April or May of this year. However, during a stress test period from 7/6 through 7/14, as many as 25% of transactions would have been affected by these limits.Morcos has proposed four new command-line configurable limits to ensure that no chain of transactions would be too large for eviction code to handle, computational feasibility of calculating the state required for sorting and limiting the mempool, maintaining the pre-existing policy goal that all transactions in the mempool should be mineable in the next block and ensuring that a new transaction can pay for any dependent transactions it would evict once the mempool is full.Serica and DigitalTangible use unspent transaction chains to speed up the bitcoin user experience without waiting for blockchain confirmations, and they agree with the proposed policy of limiting MAX_ANCESTORS = 25 and MAX_DESCENDANTS = 25 as it is reasonable. However, they wish to avoid slippery slope restrictions in unspents falling from 25 to 2 or even 0.According to the proposal, these limits would have affected less than 2% of transactions entering the mempool in April or May of 2015. However, during a stress test in July of the same year, as many as 25% of the transactions would have been affected.The proposed depth limit of 100 may not provide a sufficient cap on memory consumption or loop/recursion depth for brokered asset transfers, requiring sets of transactions with a dependency tree depth of 3 or more to be published together. If this is not sufficient, a limit of 10 would provide plenty of headroom. Matt Corallo sees no problem with such limits and suggests limiting entire tx dependency trees to a maximum of two levels deep and a maximum of ten transactions.These proposed limits are not a change to consensus rules and do not affect how many chained transactions a valid block may contain. They are command line arguments that can easily be changed on an individual node basis in Bitcoin Core. Feedback is being requested from developers regarding any legitimate use cases that might be hindered by these limits, as they could limit the use case of brokered asset transfers that require sets of transactions with a dependency tree depth of 3 to be published together. The code to implement these changes can be found in pull request 6557, built off of pull request 6470.</summary>
