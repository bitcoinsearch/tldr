    <summary>On September 18, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan suggested scheduling a regular developer meeting on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He proposed having the meeting every Thursday from 15:00-16:00 UTC. However, there were concerns about whether this timezone is available in Google Calendar since it does not directly support UTC. The idea was generally well-received and attendance was voluntary. The hope was that having a regular meeting time would encourage more people to attend and facilitate discussions of current issues.</summary>
