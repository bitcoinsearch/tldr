    <summary>In a conversation between Rusty Russell and Jorge Timón, Timón expresses his disagreement with the importance of a certain concern regarding activation mechanisms in old soft/hard forks. He suggests that using height as an activation mechanism would be more efficient and this idea is being discussed in a thread branched from the bip99's discussion. Russell thanks him for the information and plans to dig through bitcoin-dev to find the thread. The initial thread can be accessed through the BIP document in the bitcoin/bips PR.</summary>
