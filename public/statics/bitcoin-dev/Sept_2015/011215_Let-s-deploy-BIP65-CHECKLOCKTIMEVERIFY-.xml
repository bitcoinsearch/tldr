    <summary>Mike Hearn has stated that there is no consensus on using a soft fork to deploy the feature of "CheckLockTimeVerify" (CLTV). He believes it will cause problems as all other soft forks have caused. He suggests making it a hard fork instead. However, he did state that there is necessary consensus to deploy CLTV via IsSuperMajority(). This method requires a super majority of miners and a low probability for the soft-fork being rejected. Mike Hearn also asks three questions: whether CLTV should be added to Bitcoin protocol, whether IsSuperMajority() CLTV soft-fork will be added to Bitcoin XT if it's added to Bitcoin Core, and whether soft-fork detection will be added to bitcoinj.</summary>
