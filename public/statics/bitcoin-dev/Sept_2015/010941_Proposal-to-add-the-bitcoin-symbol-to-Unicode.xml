    <summary>Theo Chino sent an email to Ken Shirriff asking how he can join and support his proposal to have the bitcoin symbol added to Unicode. Ken Shirriff wrote a proposal to add the common B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol to Unicode as it is currently not in the Unicode standard. He believes that having this symbol added will make using the bitcoin symbol in text more convenient. Ken Shirriff has successfully proposed a new character for Unicode before, so he is familiar with the process and thinks that this proposal has a good chance of succeeding. The proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf. Ken Shirriff asked for endorsement by Bitcoin developers to help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol. He sent this email to the bitcoin-dev group to get their support.</summary>
