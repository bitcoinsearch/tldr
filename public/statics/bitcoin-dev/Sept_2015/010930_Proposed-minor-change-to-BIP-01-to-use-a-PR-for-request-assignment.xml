    <summary>Eric suggested a special label to indicate number requests, after Gregory Maxwell proposed a minor change to BIP 01 for requesting number assignment. Maxwell suggested opening a pull request with the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) text without a number as a mechanism for requesting number assignment. The current process in BIP01 was written when a different solution was used for storing and presenting BIPs. Maxwell requested that any responses be strictly directed to his question and that a new thread be started for a different subject.</summary>
