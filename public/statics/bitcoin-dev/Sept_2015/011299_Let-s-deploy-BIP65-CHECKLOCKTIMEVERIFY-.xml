    <summary>A Bitcoin investor and non-programmer has made two observations. Firstly, those who oppose a soft fork may be correct in technical terms but could be underestimating the risk of a contentious hard fork. Secondly, the downsides of a soft fork are unclear and appear to relate more to inelegant coding. The investor is concerned that debates around these issues are reducing confidence in Bitcoin's future. They suggest that top developers from both sides should compromise and promote a non-contentious solution to restore public confidence. The investor suggests that Bitcoin should become a public utility/backbone blockchain upon which all blockchain stakeholders can rely. For this to happen, Bitcoin needs to be simple, reliable, cost-effective and scalable.</summary>
