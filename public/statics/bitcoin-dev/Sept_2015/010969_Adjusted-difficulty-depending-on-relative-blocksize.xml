    <summary>The discussion revolves around the "flexcap" proposal by Greg Maxwell and Mark Friedenbach, which was introduced in May 2015. The concern is that changing the difficulty in response to anything other than observed block production rate would unavoidably change the money supply schedule. Even if the reward is changed, the timing would still be altered even if not the average rate. Jakob Rönnbäck acknowledges that he should have looked deeper into the mailing list while Adam Back provides links to the discussion on the topic from May 2015.</summary>
