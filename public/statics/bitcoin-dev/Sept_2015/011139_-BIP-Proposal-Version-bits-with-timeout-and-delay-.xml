    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Rusty Russell and Jorge Timón are discussing the activation mechanism for old soft/hardforks. Timón disagrees with the importance of this concern and believes that old soft/hardforks will eventually replace the activation mechanism with height. Russell agrees that timeout via GetMedianTimePast() doesn't have any effect on "should I accept this to mempool" and seems uncontroversial. Activation is by block number once vote hits 95%, so that too is fairly simple to implement. The initial thread can be found in the BIP document which is in the bitcoin/bips PR.</summary>
