    <summary>The proposal presented in this context is a new policy aimed at improving the way transactions are prioritized by miners. The suggested heuristic involves comparing the Bitcoin Days Destroyed (BTCDD) of two valid blocks and choosing the one with the best BTCDD, but only for transactions that are already in the mempool. This policy would be most useful when two blocks are received within a small window of time, where the chances of choosing the right block are 50/50 under the default "first seen" rule. The proposed policy would benefit Bitcoin in terms of increased stability, motivating miners to add transactions, decreasing the utility of any global private network of nodes intended to spread selfishly-mined blocks, and motivating miners to stay well-connected so that they get transactions quickly. However, the proposal is not a consensus rule and everyone would be free to ignore it. Some individuals in the discussion believe that miners may not benefit from running this policy in the long run unless it becomes a default behavior, as most miners leave the defaults alone.</summary>
