    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, Jorge Tim√≥n agrees with using height versus time as a measure of deployment speed. He questions Rusty's point about it being easier for Bip writers to use time instead of block numbers. Three years from drafting is considered reasonable and to ensure no hash race occurs, Rusty suggests six years of blocks. However, deployment speed is measured in months rather than blocks, making it difficult to estimate.</summary>
