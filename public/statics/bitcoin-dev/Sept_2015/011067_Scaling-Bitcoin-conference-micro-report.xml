    <summary>The bitcoin-dev community has been discussing the possibility of a hard fork to increase block size limit and resolve scalability issues. While there was no consensus on the exact numbers, some were willing to accept a short-term bump with a smooth increase for a set time period before requiring a second hard fork if necessary. The discussion also included other metrics besides block size such as net-UTXO. Although there were disagreements on the issue, the core developers at the workshop agreed that they can work together to reach a compromise. However, some expressed concern about the need for a second hard fork in the future and preferred a long-term growth curve as part of any proposal. Overall, the summary provides insight into the debate among the bitcoin-dev community and the challenges facing the development of bitcoin.</summary>
