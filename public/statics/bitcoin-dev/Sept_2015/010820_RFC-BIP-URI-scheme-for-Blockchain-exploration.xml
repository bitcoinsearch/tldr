    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Richard Moore shared his liking for having a standard that all explorers and even core would understand. However, he suggested two changes. First, using a real URI scheme, blockchain:// so that normal URL parsing libraries can be used. Secondly, he recommended including the type looking up, for example, blockchain://txid/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a, blockchain://block/189000, and blockchain://address/1RicMooMWxqKczuRCa5D2dnJaUEn9ZJyn. Andreas Schildbach showed agreement with Richard's idea. He also appreciated the readability, unambiguousness and simplicity of the suggested URI.</summary>
