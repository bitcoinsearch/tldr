    <summary>Justus Ranvier, a developer, expressed concern about a proposal to modify BIP 43, which is still a draft. The proposal suggests referring non-Bitcoin purpose codes to the SLIP repository. Luke Dashjr, who made the proposal, suggested that delegating the BIP-43 namespace management to a company-independent repository would be better rather than to SatoshiLabs. Justus suggested that SLIPs should not be biased towards their company and that moving purpose codes to a separate namespace would add complexity to its usage without any discernible benefit. He also argued that polluting the BIP repository with non-Bitcoin related specifications would not be helpful.</summary>
