    <summary>In a message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding raised a concern about the "flexcap" proposal. According to Harding, any change in difficulty that is not in response to observed block production rate will unavoidably change the money supply schedule. This means that even if the reward is changed along with the difficulty, the timing of the reward would still be affected, if not the average rate. The discussion was centered around the question of whether or not changing the difficulty to an average of 10 minutes again would affect the schedule.</summary>
