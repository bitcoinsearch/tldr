    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list received an email on September 29, 2015, that was deemed off-topic by Jeff Garzik. Milly Bitcoin responded to Garzik's comment and accused him of pretending to be in charge and telling people what to do. Milly also suggested that Garzik should spend more time reviewing his company's Bitcoin handling and security procedures instead of trying to bully people. The context noted that making statements about a developer's personal character is also off-topic for the list. The email thread ended with the standard mailing list information including the list's name, email address, and website.</summary>
