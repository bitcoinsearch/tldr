    <summary>The writer of this message is looking for a fuzzer for push tx APIs that can send random data and fuzz particular aspects of the transaction format. They have searched briefly but have not found one. The writer lists several endpoints they would like to test, such as https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/pushtx/, https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/send, https://blockchain.info/pushtx, and others. The desired fuzzer should be able to fuzz valid and invalid script formats and change the order of op codes, among other things. The writer is also open to recommendations on how such a fuzzer should be structured. Finally, the writer invites anyone interested in collaborating to contact them via private message.</summary>
