    <summary>According to Adam Back, a selfish mining attack could potentially be used to amplify the impact of excess block-size in a system that has no means to reduce it. In this scenario, an attacker with enough hashrate could take advantage of the free transaction space created by excess block-size and use it to perform a selfish mining attack. However, such an attack would have to be sustained for at least 2000 blocks over a period of 4 weeks in order to achieve a mere 10% increase in the block size.</summary>
