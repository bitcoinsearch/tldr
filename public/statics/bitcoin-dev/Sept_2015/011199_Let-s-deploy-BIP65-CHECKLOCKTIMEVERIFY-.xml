    <summary>A comment is made in agreement with Peter's points, stating that BIP65 should be deployed immediately and not wait for the 0.12 schedule. Waiting for the schedule would take almost nine months to complete the softfork, which is deemed unnecessary. Some mining pools hinted at adopting BitcoinXT by the end of 2015, and if BIP65 was deployed earlier, they would have a patched version ready when they switch. Gavin has agreed to support BIP65 in XT. Finally, there is a question posed about backporting BIP65 to 0.9, as some miners requested a backport during the deployment of BIP66, resulting in the creation of 0.9.5.</summary>
