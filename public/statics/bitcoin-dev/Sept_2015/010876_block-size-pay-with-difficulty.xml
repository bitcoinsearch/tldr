    <summary>It is suggested to not propose schemes that pay with difficulty or hashpower to change the block size as it could potentially be unrealistic and damaging. This is because miners have a straightforward incentive to deploy new hashpower as soon as possible. Requiring out-of-band collusion or idle hashpower on hand to change block size can be corrosive, making the block size and fee market too sensitive to the mining chip market. Instead, pay-to-future-miner has neutral, forward-looking incentives that are worth researching.</summary>
