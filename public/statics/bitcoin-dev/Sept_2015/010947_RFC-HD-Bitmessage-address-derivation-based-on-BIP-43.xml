    <summary>In September 2015, there was a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list about maintaining competing registries for different companies and P2P chains. It was noted that the current situation with centralized registries was not an accident and that the BIP repository had made a decision to move part of the standard to a repository willing to handle it. While some believed that the centralized registries were fine as long as they didn't rely on having only one of them or in them having the same values for the same chains, others argued that BIP44's centralized registry was not acceptable and suggested using a code deterministically generated from the chain ID instead. This proposal was deemed retro-compatible, even for carelessly designed chains that allowed pre-mining, and provided securely unique IDs that did not require a centralized registry. One member suggested starting a Chain IDs BIP.</summary>
