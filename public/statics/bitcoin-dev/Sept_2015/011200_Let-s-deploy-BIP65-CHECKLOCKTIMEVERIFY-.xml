    <summary>In an email exchange on September 27th, 2015, a user named jl2012 expressed support for the deployment of BIP65 and agreed with all of Peter's points. The user also asked about the possibility of backporting it to version 0.9, citing the example of how miners requested a backport to 0.9.5 during the deployment of BIP66. Peter responded that he could backport it to 0.9 but wanted to first hear from miners as to why they were still on v0.9.x. The email contains a signature.asc attachment.</summary>
