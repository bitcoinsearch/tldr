    <summary>In a message sent on Bitcoin-dev, Andy Chase introduced a BIP that aims to discuss governance ideas. However, there is currently no governance in place for Bitcoin. Any BIP dealing with governance should document the natural forces involved in real-world acceptance rather than laying down rules for people to follow. For hardforks, economic consensus is required, while miner majority is necessary for softforks. For other changes, real-world implementation and use by a significant number of people are needed.</summary>
