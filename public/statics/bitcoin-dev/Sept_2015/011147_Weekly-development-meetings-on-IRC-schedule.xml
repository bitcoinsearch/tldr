    <summary>The response to the idea of having weekly IRC meetings was positive. A suitable time slot, Thursday 19:00-20:00 UTC, was selected using the Doodle site and it was confirmed that everyone who voted is available at that time. The first meeting will take place on September 24th and will continue every week thereafter. A shared Google Calendar has been created for this purpose, but its timezone is Reykyavik (Iceland) which is UTC+0. However, users can add the calendar to their own calendars and view the meeting in their own timezone by clicking on the button in the lower right corner.</summary>
