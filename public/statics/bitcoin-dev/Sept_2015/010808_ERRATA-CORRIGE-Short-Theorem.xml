    <summary>Peter Todd, a developer of the Bitcoin software, wrote an email in 2015 about a math proof which showed that larger miners earn more money per unit hashing power. He provided a link to his proof and stated that he did not believe anyone was arguing otherwise. Another participant in the discussion, Dpinna, had claimed that his paper showed that the advantage of larger miners decreased as the block reward diminished or as the total fees increased. Peter regarded this claim as reasonable but did not check the math. The email exchange took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
