    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in 2015, Btc Drak jokingly suggested that time is in need of an upgrade and asked if it is possible to hardfork time. Gregory Maxwell responded by stating that there is little global consistency regarding DST usage and using a timezone that observes DST like CEST/PDT/EST might not be feasible. Matt Corallo suggested using Google Calendar's option to change the timezone of an event, but noted that UTC is not available as an option. In response, Btc Drak suggested using Iceland time (UTC without DST) as an alternative.</summary>
