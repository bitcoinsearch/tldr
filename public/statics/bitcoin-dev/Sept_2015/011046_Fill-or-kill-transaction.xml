    <summary>The email thread discusses the implementation of a "fill-or-kill" system using nLockTime and nSequence. The proposal introduces two new parameters, nLockTime2 and nKillTime, which allow for greater flexibility in transaction confirmation. The proposed system is compatible with BIP68, but may break existing implementations if it affects coinbase transactions. The resolution is 4 blocks or 2048 seconds, and the maximum confirmation window is 8188 blocks or 16,769,024 seconds. The proposed system is a soft fork that allows for both height-based and time-based nLockTime2 values. However, height-based OP_CLTV is not compatible with nLockTime2, and a new OP_CLTV2 may be needed to verify both nLockTime and nLockTime2. The proposed system will overflow in 55 years, after which a hard fork may be necessary to implement a better fill-or-kill system, or a new tx nVersion can be used for another 55 years.</summary>
