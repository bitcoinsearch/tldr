    <summary>In an email exchange in August 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n suggested that the fact that some altcoins (such as Litecoin and Feathercoin) have the same genesis block hash is a design mistake in Feathercoin. However, he noted that it could be solved by moving Feathercoin's genesis block to the next block that is not identical to Litecoin's. The issue of alternative chains was also discussed, with one participant arguing that it should not be excluded just because it does not fit the concept of neat and tidy. They suggested that using an identifier instead of the genesis hash would be a better approach to account for altcoins. Overall, if the proposal is made to account for altcoins, it's better to have an identifier rather than relying on the genesis hash in isolation.</summary>
