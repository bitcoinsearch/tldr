    <summary>One proposed solution to reducing "noise" in discussions is for maintainers to make decisions and declare, this is how Core does it. If there is disagreement, individuals are encouraged to create or join a fork. This technique is not being utilized by Wladimir, which is something that should be fixed. Ending debates is a fundamental management technique to prevent circular conversations. Allowing random people to give red cards to others who disagree with decisions only aggravates users further as it dismisses valid objections as philosophical discussions.</summary>
