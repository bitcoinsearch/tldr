    <summary>On September 27, 2015, Neil Haran posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list looking for a partner to develop a gamified bitcoin mining app. He stated that he was searching for someone who was knowledgeable in cryptography and the bitcoin code base. Although he received interest from some individuals, he was still seeking the perfect candidate to collaborate with. If anyone was interested, they were instructed to email him at nharan81@gmail.com. The post was deemed off-topic for the mailing list.</summary>
