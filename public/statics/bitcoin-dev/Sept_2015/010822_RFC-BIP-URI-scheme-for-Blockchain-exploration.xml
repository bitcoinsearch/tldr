    <summary>In an email exchange from August 29th, 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n expressed his preference for using "chainID" over "network" as a way to reference a transaction in the blockchain. He suggests using the hash of the genesis block as a rigorous means of referencing a transaction, with the option of using name constants as a simpler and more relaxed alternative. This would allow for correct references to transactions without requiring a source lookup, which could be useful in forums or posts. Examples of how a reference to a transaction might look are provided, including variations that incorporate chainID or other element names.</summary>
