    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Bryan Bishop provided a review of proposed and exotic SIGHASH types. Among them was the SIGHASH_MULTIPLE and petertodd's suggestion of SIGHASH_DONT_SIGN_TXID to make OP_CODESEPARATOR more useful. Another idea presented was the "meta sighash" which involves using code to build up the signature with OP_CODESEPARATOR. The email also included a digital signature attachment from Peter Todd.</summary>
