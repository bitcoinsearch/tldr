    <summary>In a discussion about versionBits, Rusty suggested using a simple test to ensure compatibility with XT, which sets version bits 001....111. He proposed the use of a check that would not trigger XT and could be set to block nVersion to 8 for now. The discussion centered around simplifying Rusty's proposal with the adoption of a patch by XT, which Gavin had agreed to. No summary was explicitly stated in the context.</summary>
