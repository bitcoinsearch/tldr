    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread on August 31st, 2015, user s7r expressed the desire to try other implementations of Bitcoin. However, they are wary of doing so due to the high quality of the code in Bitcoin Core and the importance of Bitcoin as a payment protocol. Another user responded that alternate implementations don't necessarily have a problem with code quality, but rather the incredible difficulty of getting it right. They explain that attempting to re-implement even just transaction signature verification can quickly lead to edge cases. The user provides a link to a blog post about fuzzing Bitcoin consensus for further reading.</summary>
