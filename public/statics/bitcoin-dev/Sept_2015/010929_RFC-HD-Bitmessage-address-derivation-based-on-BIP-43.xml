    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core Developer, argued that polluting the BIP repository with non-Bitcoin related specifications would be a problem, in response to a proposal to add HD generation of keypairs from a single seed for many non-conflicting uses. Justus Ranvier, from the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, countered by saying that intentionally making a useful technology less useful because assigning non-colliding numbers is too hard is a strange approach to software engineering. The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting financial privacy and anonymity through the use of Bitcoin.</summary>
