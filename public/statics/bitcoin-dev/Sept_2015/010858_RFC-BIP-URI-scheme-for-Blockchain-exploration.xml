    <summary>In a discussion held on 2nd September 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n expressed his concern over the central authority to register unique and memorable chain name strings. However, some argue that having a central registry for assigning names to numbers is not problematic as seen in the case of MIME types and TCP/UDP port number assignments. The BIP describing the "blockchain" URI scheme is also published by a central authority.</summary>
