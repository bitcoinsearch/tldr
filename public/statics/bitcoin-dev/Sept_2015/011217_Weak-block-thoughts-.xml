    <summary>In this discussion on bitcoin-dev, Kalle Rosenbaum asks about the transmission of block differences between weak blocks. The use of Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs) is suggested for synchronizing mempools, but not for ordering transactions. Instead, encoding new blocks using a diff based on a weak block or a Merkle tree node hash can be used. However, managing and removing duplicate information between weak blocks can be complicated, and Merkle trees have difficulty with insertions or deletions near the beginning of a block. A hybrid system could be implemented to improve transmissibility.</summary>
