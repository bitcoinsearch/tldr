    <summary>A proposal was made on September 10, 2015, by a member of the Bitcoin developer community to address the issue of complex and hard-to-memorize Bitcoin addresses. The solution proposed assigning unique names to Bitcoin addresses for easier sharing and increased user-friendliness. To create a named Bitcoin address, a user would input their preferred name into their wallet, and if available, a transaction would be sent to an address without a private key, viewable on the blockchain, with the name appended as an OP_RETURN output. When someone wants to send Bitcoin to a named address, their client references the same directory and searches for the OP_RETURN output of the desired name using a binary search method. If found, the client will use the address associated with that transaction to send the Bitcoin.However, this proposal has been met with disapproval due to privacy and security concerns. Reusing Bitcoin addresses can compromise both privacy and security, and maintaining a registry of every address in the world could be problematic and unnecessary. Instead of assigning names to Bitcoin addresses, some suggest developing a name registry system off-chain attached to bip47 reusable payment codes. This proposed naming convention involved the use of a directory of names chosen by users of the system, with a binary search method used to search through all the data efficiently. However, this idea was also met with skepticism as it may compromise privacy and security. While there are several solutions listed on GitHub for addressing the issue of complex Bitcoin addresses, the best practice is to use BIP-70 for sending payment requests. Overall, the proposal to assign unique names to Bitcoin addresses offers a potential solution to the problem of complex Bitcoin addresses and could improve the overall user experience, but feedback and questions are welcome.</summary>
