    <summary>There is no consensus on any change that could result in repeating a situation in a few years. The context implies that there might be a disagreement or lack of agreement among individuals or groups regarding some changes that could lead to a recurring event. The statement lacks specific details on what type of change is being referred to and what the recurring situation might be. The use of the phrase "all over again" suggests that the situation may have occurred before and could happen again if the proposed changes are implemented. It is unclear whether the potential recurrence of the situation is desirable or not. The statement also does not provide any information on who is involved in the decision-making process and what factors are being considered when evaluating the proposed change.Overall, the context highlights the importance of having a consensus when making decisions that could impact the future. Without consensus, there is a risk of repeating past mistakes or creating new problems that could have been avoided with better communication and collaboration. It is essential to consider all perspectives and ideas before implementing any changes to ensure that they are sustainable and beneficial for everyone involved.</summary>
