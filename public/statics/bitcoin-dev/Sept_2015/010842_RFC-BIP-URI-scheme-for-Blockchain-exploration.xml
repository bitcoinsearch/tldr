    <summary>The email conversation discusses the structure of blockchain URLs. One participant suggests that the chain part should be optional since most references will be to Bitcoin's main net. Another participant argues that the "authority" component of the URL should identify the chain, while the "path" component should identify the specific block, transaction, or address in that chain. The suggestion is made to allow well-known chains to register a name as an alternative to the hash syntax. Another participant proposes using the hash of the genesis block as a rigorous way to identify the chain but suggests allowing the use of name constants as a simpler alternative. Three different examples of referencing a transaction with varying levels of detail are given. The email concludes with a link to an online file identifier tool.</summary>
