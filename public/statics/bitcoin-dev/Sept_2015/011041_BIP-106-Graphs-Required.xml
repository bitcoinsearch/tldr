    <title>BIP 106 : Graphs Required</title>
    <updated>2023-06-10T22:40:35.209916+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Upal Chakraborty is seeking help to find two graphs that analyze the effectiveness of BIP 106, which can be found on GitHub. He needs two similar graphs plotting the max block size cap against each block, calculated as per his two proposals in BIP 106, assuming the max block size cap for block 1 was 1mb. The graph he needs is similar to the one provided by Blockchain.info, which plots the historical data of block size for each block. Upal is unsure whether this is the right place to ask for such help, but he hopes someone might help out.</summary>
