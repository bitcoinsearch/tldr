    <summary>There is a practical limit to the size of a re-org, with Vincent's proposal suggesting that a year's worth of blocks is a practical limit that an attacker would have difficulty overcoming. However, there are blind spots in being able to distinguish between malicious and honest blocks. Rune suggests that empty blocks indicate malice, while the originator of a transaction generally takes on the responsibility of re-broadcasting it if it gets re-org'd out of its confirmation(s). Any malice in a 51% attack would come in the form of failing to include such transactions. Looking at the mempool would determine which transactions have been rebroadcasted and which have not, thus indicating dishonesty. The inability to distinguish between malicious and honest blocks is a key issue that needs to be addressed.</summary>
