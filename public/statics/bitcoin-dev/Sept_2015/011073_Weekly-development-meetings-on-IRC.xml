    <summary>During a discussion on scheduling a regular developer meeting for #bitcoin-dev, the issue of timezones and daylight savings time (DST) came up. Although Google Calendar is localized, it has an option to change the timezone of an event, but does not provide UTC in its options. Btc Drak suggested that using something that observes DST in roughly the same way as everyone else (e.g., CEST/PDT/EST) would be better than quoting UTC. This is because meeting times will change for those that observe DST, and what was a convenient meeting time may become inconvenient for some.Matt Corallo also expressed agreement with the idea, but asked if a timezone available in Google Calendar could be selected since it does not directly support UTC. Wladimir J. van der Laan originally proposed every week at 15:00-16:00 UTC on Thursday, but the issue of timezones and DST needs to be taken into account when selecting a specific time. Overall, the group agreed that it would be best to select a timezone that is available in Google Calendar and observes DST in roughly the same way as everyone else to ensure consistency.</summary>
