    <summary>Introducing METAmarket, a new decentralized e-commerce platform that is 100% peer-to-peer and customizable. With METAmarket, users have complete control over their own marketplace, whether it be open to all or private, wholesale or retail, moderated or unmoderated, clearnet or darknet. The platform uses a zero-fee approach and ensures funds are secure from theft or exit scams with a P2P Bitcoin multisig escrow between buyer and seller only. METAmarket is built directly on top of the Bitcoin and Bitmessage reference clients, prioritizing security above all else. The future of e-commerce is in the hands of the users with METAmarket.</summary>
