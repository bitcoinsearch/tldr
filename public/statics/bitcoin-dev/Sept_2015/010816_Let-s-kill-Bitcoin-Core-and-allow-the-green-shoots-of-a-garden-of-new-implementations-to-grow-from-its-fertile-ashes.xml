    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Wladimir, the lead developer of Bitcoin Core, responded to concerns about the recent hardforks and drama surrounding them by suggesting that experiments should be done on sidechains or altcoins instead. He argued that forking the Bitcoin chain would needlessly confuse matters, especially if multiple forks gained their own users. Wladimir also clarified that alternative implementations of node software such as btcd and obelisk are not the same as deliberate rule changes like those seen in Bitcoin XT, which exist to split off their own chain.</summary>
