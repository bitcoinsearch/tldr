    <summary>The concept of 'weak blocks', which was proposed by Rusty, has been discussed recently in various forums. These include the Bitcoin forum, Linux Foundation mailing lists and Bitcoin Wizards logs. The idea behind weak blocks is to improve the efficiency of block propagation in the Bitcoin network. This would enable miners to receive block information more quickly and reduce the likelihood of stale blocks. There have been several proposals and mentions of weak blocks and near blocks in these forums over the years. Recently, there have been more discussions on this topic as well, including at ScalingBitcoin events. Bryan has provided these links for further reading on the subject.</summary>
