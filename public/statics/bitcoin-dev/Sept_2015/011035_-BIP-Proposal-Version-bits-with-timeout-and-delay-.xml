    <summary>The discussion revolves around implementing a new rule in Bitcoin regarding the activation of a consensus. The exact numbers, such as 95% vs. 75%, are not essential at this point. What matters is defining states and trigger mechanisms. While one party prefers waiting for 95% consensus activation to apply the new rule, another proposes setting the bit from the start and waiting for 75% consensus. However, concerns are raised that until it becomes a consensus rule, it is just part of the standard policy, and we shouldn't rely on nodes following the standard policy. It is suggested that if more than 75% of the blocks have the bit set, then all blocks that have the bit set and fail to meet the rule will be rejected. The discussion is carried out via email on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
