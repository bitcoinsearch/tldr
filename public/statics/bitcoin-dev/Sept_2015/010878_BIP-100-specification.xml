    <summary>The email chain includes a revision suggestion for the calculation of hardLimit based on the coinbase scriptSig votes. The new hardLimit will be calculated by sorting the coinbase scriptSig votes from lowest to highest and using the vote of the 2400th block. If the change in the vote of the 2400th block is less than 20%, then it will be used as the new hardLimit. Otherwise, the hardLimit will be changed either to 120% or 80% of the current hardLimit. The fifth point about the 75% rule is unclear, and there is confusion about why invalid version 4 blocks would not always be rejected. Jeff Garzik posts a link to the initial public draft of BIP 100, emphasizing that it is a starting point for feedback and iteration rather than an endpoint. The email signer provides their technical skills and links to their website and projects.</summary>
