    <summary>The speaker is objecting to the use of soft forks and suggests that a hard fork should be used instead in the current BIP implementation. This would prevent situations like the P2SH case where invalid blocks were found for weeks or months after new rules were implemented, posing unnecessary risks for SPV wallets and old nodes. The speaker also notes that there is no consensus for rolling out the new opcode in this way and others share the same concerns as expressed in comments on their article. It is important to not change definitions of terms agreed upon by all parties when making arguments against soft forks.</summary>
