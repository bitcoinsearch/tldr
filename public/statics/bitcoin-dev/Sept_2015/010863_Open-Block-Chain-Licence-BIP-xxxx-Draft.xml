    <summary>Ahmed Zsales proposed a draft BIP which suggests the implementation of a blockchain license to supplement the existing MIT License that only covers the core reference client software. However, Warren Togami is skeptical about the need for such a license as he believes that the blockchain may not be entitled to copyright protection. He argues that although the block chain compilation is unique and creative, it is created in a mechanical manner and is not a creative work of a human. Togami states that further study is needed to determine the legal protection of databases under different jurisdictions. Nevertheless, Togami agrees with the intent of the license in attempting to exclude works within the blockchain that may be subject to third-party copyright.</summary>
