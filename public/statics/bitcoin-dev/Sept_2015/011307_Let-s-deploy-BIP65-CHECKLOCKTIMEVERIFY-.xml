    <summary>In an email conversation between Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn and others, the topic of upgrading Bitcoin software was discussed. Hearn stated that a global upgrade is required for all full nodes to achieve the software's stated goal, but if users do not want to upgrade they can run an SPV wallet or use blockchain.info. However, he noted that security may be reduced for full nodes that have not upgraded. The conversation also addressed the possibility of implementing new features through soft forks instead of hard forks, which would mean fewer total features for users if the latter route were chosen.</summary>
