    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Matt Corallo suggests using a timezone that observes DST, like CEST, PDT, or EST, instead of UTC for the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin event. However, there is little consistency in DST usage globally, with many places doing it on different dates. As a result, those in some DST timezones may experience two changes for the same event, such as in Europe and the US where DST ends one week apart.</summary>
