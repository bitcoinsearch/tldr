    <summary>The discussion of rolling out BIP 100, a hard fork proposal, is being addressed in the Bitcoin community. Some members believe that avoiding certain topics should not be done and instead, separate discussions should take place for efficient conversation. One such discussion is regarding consensus forks in BIP99. Once an agreement has been reached, implementation can then be discussed. Others argue that deployment is a separate issue from the mechanics of how BIP100 will function after activation and that deployment methodologies should not be discussed when proposing blocksize changes. In terms of technical details, jl2012 argues that the 75% rule is meaningless since there are no invalid version 4 blocks in a pure relaxation of rules. The implication threshold, whether it's 95% or 80%, is also unclear. He believes that a hardfork should only be initiated based on its acceptance by the economic majority, not miner support. He proposes a symmetrical approach to increase and decrease block size thresholds set at 80%. Hardforks could be signalled with a 'hardfork bit' or combined with a softfork. Jeff Garzik proposed the initial public draft of BIP 100, emphasizing that it is just the starting point for open-source feedback and iteration.</summary>
