    <summary>In this context, it is assumed that the current block size is 1MB, and the block reward for a full block is 25.5BTC, including transaction fees. A miner who tries to increase the size of the next block by x% will be required to pay an x% penalty of the reward. If a miner wants to increase the block size by 1 byte, the block size has to increase by 0.0001%, and the penalty will be 0.0000255BTC/byte. For a typical 230byte transaction, this would be 0.005865BTC or 1.35USD at the current rate.Jeff Garzik, in a 2015 discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, expressed skepticism about schemes proposing to pay with difficulty/hashpower to change block size. Such schemes require out-of-band collusion to change block size and/or idle hash power on hand to change block size, which are unrealistic and potentially corrosive. Instead, he suggested researching neutral, forward-looking incentives like pay-to-future-miner.However, there is a general problem with pay-to-increase-block-size schemes in that they indirectly set a minimal transaction fee, which could be difficult and arbitrary and goes against competition.</summary>
