    <summary>Ken Shirriff, a member of the Bitcoin community, has proposed to add the bitcoin symbol to the Unicode standard. The use of the bitcoin symbol in text is currently inconvenient as it is not recognized by the Unicode standard. This proposal aims to include the common B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol to Unicode. Ken Shirriff has previously proposed a new character for Unicode and believes this proposal has a good chance of success. In an email sent to the bitcoin-dev group, Ken Shirriff requested endorsement from Bitcoin developers to help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol. The proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf. The inclusion of the bitcoin symbol in the Unicode standard will make it much easier to incorporate the symbol in text, making it more convenient for users.</summary>
