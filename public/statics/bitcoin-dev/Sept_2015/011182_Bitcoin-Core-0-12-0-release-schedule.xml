    <summary>The Bitcoin Core team is planning the next major release, 0.12.0, for the end of this year. The proposed schedule includes opening Transifex translations for 0.12 on November 1st and a soft translation string freeze with no large or unnecessary changes. On December 1st, there will be a feature and translation string freeze. In January, the team plans to split off the `0.12` branch from `master`, start the RC cycle, tag and release `0.12.0rc1`, and begin merging for 0.13 on the master branch. The final release of version 0.12.0 is expected to occur on February 1st. As many members of the team will be busy with events such as Scaling Bitcoin Hongkong and end-of-year festivities in December, pre-RC bugfixes and polishing will be left until later.</summary>
