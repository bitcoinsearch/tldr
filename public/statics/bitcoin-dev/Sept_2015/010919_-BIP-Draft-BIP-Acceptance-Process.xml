    <summary>The author of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has suggested that committees could be used to filter opinions down to a yes/no, when it comes to decision-making on bitcoin. The idea is based on voluntary participation and the understanding that enforcing rules, such as forcing groups to see the other side, is difficult. Committees are considered a useful option due to their successful use in many fields and their ability to filter opinions. However, there are concerns over censorship and centralisation pressures. Another possible approach suggested is micro votes, which allows each user to represent themselves, but proving and preventing manipulation is a concern. The process does not have to replace any particular BIP process as-is, but rather could be an alternative that proceeds on its own perhaps indefinitely without replacement.</summary>
