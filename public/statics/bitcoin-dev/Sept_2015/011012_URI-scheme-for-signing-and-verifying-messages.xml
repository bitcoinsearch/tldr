    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, Luke Dashjr expresses concerns regarding the current signed message system and its insecure uses. He suggests that a new method should be developed which avoids using the same key as for signing transactions and designing an entire authentication system. Arthur proposes a URI scheme which would allow users to access existing tools more easily. When asked about privacy issues, Dashjr explains that the signed message only proves that the person who received payment with the address agrees to a given message/contract, not that they presently still have the bitcoins received. While there are a few good use cases for the current signed messages, they appear to be a minority at the moment and implementing any URI-based signing could actually make them more difficult.</summary>
