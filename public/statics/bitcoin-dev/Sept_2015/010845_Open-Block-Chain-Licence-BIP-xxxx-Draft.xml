    <title>Open Block Chain Licence, BIP[xxxx] Draft</title>

    <summary>Ahmed Zsales wrote a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list suggesting that the network requires a block chain license to supplement the existing MIT License that covers only the core reference client software. However, Wladimir countered by saying that an open system cannot have a specific license for everything added to the chain. He suggested making the BIP advisory, but was unsure if it would help as there would still be uncertainty about the license of the contents of a particular block.</summary>
