    <summary>Upal Chakraborty is requesting assistance in locating two graphs that examine the efficiency of BIP 106, which can be found on GitHub. These graphs would plot the maximum block size cap against each block based on his two proposals in BIP 106, with the assumption that the maximum block size cap for block one was 1MB. The graph he needs should resemble the one offered by Blockchain.info, which displays the historical data of block size for each block.Although Upal is uncertain if this forum is the appropriate place to make such a request, he remains hopeful that someone will be able to assist him.</summary>
