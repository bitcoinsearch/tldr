    <summary>Bitcoin developer Peter Todd has urged for the deployment of BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, a new code release. In a message on Sunday, Todd said that it is time to deploy BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and that he had backported the CLTV op-code and an IsSuperMajority() soft-fork to the v0.10 and v0.11 branches, pull-reqs #6706 and #6707 respectively. He called for a release of v0.10.3 and v0.11.1 with CLTV and suggested getting the ball rolling on miner adoption. He added that it is possible to safely get CLTV live before the end of the year.</summary>
