    <summary>The process in BIP01 was written when a different solution was used for storing and presenting BIPs. The author is considering suggesting a change in the number request process to open a pull request with BIP text without a number, using only the author's name and an index as the number, as the mechanism to request number assignment. The author seeks clarification if there is any reason why anyone would object to this suggestion. The message concludes by requesting that any response should strictly address the question and not digress into another subject.</summary>
