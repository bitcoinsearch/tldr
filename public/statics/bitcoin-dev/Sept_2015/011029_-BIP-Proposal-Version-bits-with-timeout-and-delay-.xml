    <summary>In an email exchange between two developers, Jorge Timon and Tier Nolan via bitcoin-dev mailing list, discussion was held on the implementation of a new consensus rule in Bitcoin protocol. The new rule required miners to set a bit in the block header for blocks larger than 1MB in size, and if more than 75% of the blocks within a window of 2016 have the bit set, then reject all blocks that have the bit set and fail to meet the rule. However, Jorge Timon pointed out that until it becomes a consensus rule, nodes may not follow the standard policy of applying the restrictions at 75% and could apply them at 0% or 90%.</summary>
