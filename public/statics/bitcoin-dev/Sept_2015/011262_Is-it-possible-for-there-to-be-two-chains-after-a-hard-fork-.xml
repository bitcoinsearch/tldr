    <summary>In this conversation, Gavin Andresen started a thread to discuss the possibility of two chains persisting for more than a few days after a hard fork. He expressed confusion and requested a sanity check due to seeing smart people making this claim. Allen Piscitello responded by stating that mining empty blocks is not fraud and asked for clear definitions of terms like "honest miner" and "fraud." Mike Hearn then added to the discussion, stating that even running a full node does not protect against a dishonest miner majority committing fraud, which is already mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper. Andresen suggested moving the discussion to a more general list and emphasized the importance of miners following the rules of the protocol.</summary>
