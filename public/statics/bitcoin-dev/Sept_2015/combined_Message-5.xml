    <summary>A user named hurricanewarn1 has reported that AT&amp;T has closed port 8333 on their network, effectively banning Bitcoin nodes. Despite attempts to open the port, hurricanewarn1 received confirmation from AT&amp;T that they have a hidden firewall in their cable box that can firewall any port they want, even if the customer asks them not to. This may be the reason for the significant decline in Bitcoin nodes. Hurricanewarn1 had to contact headquarters and threaten to remove the equipment from the wall to get a proper answer from AT&amp;T. As of now, Time Warner seems to be more accommodating towards Bitcoin nodes.</summary>
