    <summary>On September 30, 2015, Luke Dashjr started a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the consensus freeze for the upcoming Bitcoin Core release. He questioned the absence of a consensus freeze and suggested that it should be postponed until after the HK workshop in case a hardfork is decided on. He also asked whether the consensus freeze has been entirely de-coupled from the release process since old versions need an update too. In general, there is a consensus to decouple from Bitcoin Core releases. However, the discussion did not provide any specific information on the outcome or decision regarding the consensus freeze.</summary>
