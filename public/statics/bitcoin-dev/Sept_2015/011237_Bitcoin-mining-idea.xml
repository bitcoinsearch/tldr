    <summary>Trevin Hofmann, in a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, stated that he previously started a cryptographically secure rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a proof of concept. However, due to time constraints, he was unable to further develop it. He provided a link to the GitHub repository for the RPS protocol for interested parties. In a separate message on the same mailing list, Neil Haran shared his idea of building a massive RPS tournament using bitcoin-qt. The tournament would be the largest ever seen and no one would be able to stop it. Each player would play a best-of-five tournament each round, with players randomly matched up against each other. The number of rounds would effectively be the depth of a binary tree. If a million people played in this tournament, one would need to win 20 rounds to win the tournament and the cash prize. Neil offered to supply the cash prize and believed he could get millions of people playing. However, Lauri Love advised Neil not to solicit interest in advance of content, but rather share his idea first and allow people to volunteer interest/assistance if they found it cogent and interesting.</summary>
