    <summary>The writer of the email has been struggling to open port 8333 for Bitcoin Core on his computer. After hours of phone calls and messaging AT&amp;T, he discovered that the issue was due to the internet being routed through a DVR/cable box with a firewall. The ISP had refused to turn off the firewall, making it impossible for the customer to open any ports. This situation could be contributing to the decline in Bitcoin nodes, as ISPs are censoring the network without informing customers. The email suggests that one solution is to tell AT&amp;T to put the DVR/cable box into bridge mode and use one's own router with external IP. It is generally recommended to avoid using an ISP-provided router for anything other than modem functionality.</summary>
