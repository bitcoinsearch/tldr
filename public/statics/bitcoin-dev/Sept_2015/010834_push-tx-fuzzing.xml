    <summary>In an email exchange on September 1, 2015, Monarch shared two ideas with Kristov for fuzzing bitcoin transactions. The first idea was random bit flipping from valid transactions while the second idea involved random transaction script generators, including generators from a grammar, a stochastic grammar, and a random sequence of opcodes. Manuel expressed interest in contributing to the project and shared links to his past experiments on fuzzing. Wladimir J. van der Laan responded to Monarch's email and commented on blockchain.info's problems with validation due to not using a full validating node. These problems included improper signature verification and loose coinbase transaction relaying, which caused instant banning from connected nodes. He suggested that there is potential for fun with fuzzing those APIs.</summary>
