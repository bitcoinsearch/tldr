    <summary>A suggestion has been made to grab some code from BIP101, which permits block messages larger than 2MB while retaining the current limit of 2 MB imposed on other network messages. The 32 MB limit was patched a few months ago and can be viewed on GitHub. The limit is in place to keep message sizes small enough to be serialized in memory. It has been suggested that the 32 MB ceiling should be auto-raised according to an exponential factor starting in 2017. The factor could be 1.5, and the delay time could be longer if it takes longer to fix the message size issue across all implementations.</summary>
