    <summary>The integration of BIP-38 into libbitcoin has encountered two issues. The first issue is related to the "confirmation code" scenario, which has full support implemented but marked as deprecated. This scenario's justification is flawed, and counterarguments are being sought for any potential scenarios where it may still be useful.The second issue is that BIP-38 envisions altchain integration but does not specify it. As a result, the capability has been implemented and documented for backward compatibility. If there is enough support, a proposal will be written to modify BIP-38. Neill Miller is credited for the pull requests related to BIP-38 for libbitcoin and bx.</summary>
