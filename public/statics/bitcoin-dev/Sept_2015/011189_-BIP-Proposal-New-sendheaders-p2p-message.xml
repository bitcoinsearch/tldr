    <title>[BIP Proposal] New "sendheaders" p2p message</title>

    <summary>In this context, Suhas Daftuar discusses the option of bumping up protocol versions in the future while still being able to receive headers-announcements for blocks. It is suggested that inv-based block announcements are not going away anytime soon, so forcing all software on the network to upgrade to supporting headers announcements, whether now or in the future, seems too drastic. Block headers are small enough to make using the inv mechanism for them impractical and it would be better to send headers instead. Reducing the amount of state in the protocol has value, and decreasing overall latency for headers to get around the network can only be a good thing.</summary>
