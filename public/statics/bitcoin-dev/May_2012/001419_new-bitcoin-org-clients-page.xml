    <summary>In an email dated May 2, 2012, Mike Hearn corrected a statement claiming that Bitcoin-Qt was written by Satoshi Nakamoto. He clarified that while Bitcoin-Qt is the best client, it was actually written by Wladimir. The email also addressed concerns about the initial start time for Bitcoin-Qt, which Hearn noted had been reduced significantly and no longer required a 24-hour+ wait. Additionally, Hearn mentioned that Armory, another client, had been partly funded by donations, though he did not see this as relevant since all clients have received funding through donations.</summary>
