    <summary>In an email exchange on May 24, 2012, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen proposed an optimization strategy for avoiding rechecking transactions that have already been verified as valid. He suggests that only transactions that need verification are those in the pool. However, Jeff Garzik notes that this work is already underway and is not relevant to the current proposal regarding lazy miners and empty blocks. Garzik, who works at exMULTI, Inc., signs off the email with his contact information.</summary>
