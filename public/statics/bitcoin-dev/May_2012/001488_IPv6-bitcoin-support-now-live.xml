    <summary>On May 12, 2012, sipa pushed out IPv6 support to bitcoin/bitcoin.git and there are already a few live IPv6 nodes on the network. Pieter Wuille's DNS seeder running at seed.bitcoin.sipa.be has also started crawling the IPv6 network since yesterday and returns corresponding AAAA records to help IPv6 nodes find each other. According to Peter Todd, an IPv6-only node could not start up and sync with the network unless he manually created a dual-net node and manually added it. However, things now work fine out of the box and he had five peers when he last checked.</summary>
