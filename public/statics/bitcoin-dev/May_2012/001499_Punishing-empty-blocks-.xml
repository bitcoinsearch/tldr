    <summary>Peter Vessenes, in an email dated May 29, 2012, expressed his confusion on how to reverse a block or coinbase into a URL. In response, a suggestion was made to add a new message to the peer-to-peer relay network that would allow miners to publish and update their policy URI signed by the relevant key. This new message would be similar to transaction and alert broadcasts. By doing so, counter-DDoS rules could decline to relay or store URIs for keys that have not been published recently or achieved statistical significance in the last N blocks.</summary>
