    <summary>In a 2012 email exchange, a user suggests using "Reply to All" in response to an email. However, another user warns against this method as it can cause the sender's email to be duplicated and eventually blow out the to and cc lines. The second user recommends using "reply to" instead, assuming the list sw can handle it. This discussion brings up the topic of "Reply-To" munging, which is the practice of automatically changing the email address that replies are sent to. The website http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html argues that this practice is harmful and should be avoided. The email was sent by Jeff Garzik from exMULTI, Inc.</summary>
