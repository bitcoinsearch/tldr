    <summary>In this conversation from May 2, 2012, developers discuss different Bitcoin clients. Gary Rowe mentions that Bitcoin-Qt is developed in C, but Alan Reiner points out that the license is more important. Armory requires the entire blockchain and is a dependent client of either Bitcoin-Qt or bitcoind. Electrum is also a dependent client, but on a centralized server rather than a particular client. There are multiple Android clients available for Bitcoin. Alan Reiner clarifies that "designed for occasional use" likely means not running continuously. He also mentions that Armory now has full installers for Windows and Linux with uninstallers and automatic URI registration. There is discussion about how it would be great if Armory could manage bitcoind itself in the background like Spesmilo.</summary>
