    <summary>The writer conducted an experiment with the AskFor() function and observed that changing the time waited from 2 minutes to 10 seconds resulted in an increase in traffic between peers when used with the -limitfreerelay option. This is because the transaction is requested from every connected peer, but AlwaysHave never becomes true as it is always rejected. Therefore, the transaction is effectively retrieved from every single connected peer.To address this issue, the writer suggests setting up a memory pool for rejected transactions and blocks so that they can be ignored. However, the writer acknowledges being in the "trying to understand the code/protocol/algorithm" stage and cautions against making false assumptions about the code's intentions. Overall, this experimentation provides insights into the functioning of the AskFor() function and its impact on traffic between peers.</summary>
