    <summary>The author of the message is requesting information on two different topics related to BIP 21 (URI scheme) implementation in Armory and Bitcoin-Qt. Firstly, they enquire about the status and plans for supporting "bitcoin:" URIs in the Satoshi client, suggesting it would be a high-value feature that could improve usability dramatically. Secondly, they seek clarification on the intentions behind "label=" and "message=" fields in Bitcoin-Qt, pointing out how Armory has implemented it so both address labels and transaction labels are supported. The author suggests that merchants could include additional purchase information in the "message" field while only putting their business name in the "label" field to maintain privacy. Lastly, the author wants to know how other clients are implementing these features and if they distinguish between "label" and "message."</summary>
