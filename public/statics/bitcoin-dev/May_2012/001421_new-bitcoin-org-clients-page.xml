    <summary>MultiBit is a Bitcoin client that supports multiple languages including German, Spanish, and Greek. It is noted that Bitcoin-qt has been translated into a broad range of languages, although it is unclear how many are of good quality. The suggestion is made to list language codes using ISO 639 rather than flags and to include information about operating system support. These details would provide objective enumeration for users.</summary>
