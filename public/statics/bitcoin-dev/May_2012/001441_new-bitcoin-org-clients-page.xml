    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeff Garzik expresses his concerns on the matter of Bitcoin.org being too centralized and presenting too many choices to the user. Garzik proposes that rather than fighting over the design of a particular page, why not create an independently managed website like BitcoinClients.org or GetBitcoinClient.org to solve this problem in a distributed fashion. He believes that Bitcoin.org should only be the home of the "reference project" and not the entire Bitcoin community. Garzik emphasizes that the forum was moved to bitcointalk.org to reflect this idea. He also suggests that modern websites prefer to reduce download links rather than increase them, citing http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora as an example where only one download choice is presented with an "other options" link below it.</summary>
