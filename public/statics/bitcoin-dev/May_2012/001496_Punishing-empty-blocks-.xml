    <summary>In a conversation on May 29, 2012 at 3:28:56 PM, Peter Vessenes asked for clarification on the concept of 20 byte keyhash. The keyhash is an essential component of the Bitcoin protocol and is constructed using the formula ripemd160(sha256(ecdsaPubKey)). This formula involves taking the public ECDSA key (ecdsaPubKey), hashing it with SHA-256, and then hashing the resulting hash with RIPEMD-160 to produce a 20 byte keyhash.The purpose of the keyhash is to provide a unique identifier for a specific public key without exposing the key itself. This allows users to transact with each other using their public keys without revealing any sensitive information. Transactions are broadcast to the network and validated by nodes using the keyhashes as a reference point.Overall, the use of keyhashes is a crucial aspect of the Bitcoin protocol that enables secure and private transactions between users.</summary>
