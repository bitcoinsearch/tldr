    <summary>The email thread discusses the ordering of Bitcoin clients on bitcoin.org. There is a debate on whether Armory should be up front since it's not intended for beginners, but there is a need for a reasonable mechanism to appeal to new users and get the community more connected. The discussion about ordering is deemed unnecessary by some, and they suggest keeping it simple. One member requests access to the page and asks for the text to be forwarded as he is unable to view it. Another member goes off-topic and talks about email issues related to group emails. Overall, the conversation is seen as becoming too messy and the branch will be merged if no objections are made. The different Bitcoin clients are then described in detail, including their requirements, design, development language, availability, and website. The email ends with a notice about an upcoming security virtual conference and a reminder of the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
