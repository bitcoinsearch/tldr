    <summary>The context discusses different Bitcoin clients, including their requirements, design, availability, and development language. Bitcoin-Qt is a standalone client that requires the entire blockchain, designed for continuous operation, and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux with an installer. MultiBit is another standalone client that requires a reduced blockchain, designed for occasional use, and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux with an installer. Armory is a dependent client of Bitcoin-Qt that requires the entire blockchain, designed for occasional use, and available for Windows (64-bit only), Mac, and Linux (self-build). Electrum is also a dependent client of Bitcoin-Qt that requires no blockchain, designed for occasional use on servers, and available for Windows and Linux (self-build). Bitcoin Wallet is an Android client that requires a reduced blockchain, designed for occasional use on mobile, and available only for Android.The context also includes an email conversation between Amir Taaki and Jeff Garzik about making "Reply All" the default in mutt and excluding one's own email when doing a group reply to avoid duplication. The conversation also mentions the harmful effects of "Reply-To" Munging.</summary>
