    <summary>Mike Hearn expressed his opinion on the proposed solution and stated that he plans to implement the original design which was outlined over a year ago. The original design is to use a new protocol command to set a Bloom filter on a connection, so only transactions matching that filter will appear in relayed inventory. Clients are expected to maintain and track the block chain as usual, but instead of downloading the entire chain and then dropping irrelevant transactions, filtering is done server-side. By strengthening or weakening the Bloom filters, clients can choose their preferred point on the privacy/bandwidth-usage spectrum. This change is simple and allows clients to gain confidence in their balance by examining the chain. Jeff Garzik agreed that this proposal covers the necessary bases for an idealized model of a client as a set of private keys.</summary>
