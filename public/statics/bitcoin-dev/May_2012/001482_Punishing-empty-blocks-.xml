    <summary>In an email exchange between Christian Decker and Jeff Garzik in May 2012, Decker proposed a simple proof of work test that does not require CPU work but asks miners for a random old transaction. This method can estimate whether it is a chainless miner or not. If the miner stores the entire blockchain, they will be able to answer the getdata request easily, whereas a botnet would have to ask someone else for it. This could be detected if the response time deviates too much from what has been previously measured by comparing it against getdata for the block they advertise. However, this method is not perfect, but it provides an estimate. Meanwhile, Garzik mentioned that log times are accurate, assuming the system clock is remotely accurate.</summary>
