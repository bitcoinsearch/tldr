    <summary>The discussion surrounding the ordering of Bitcoin clients has been deemed "retarded" and, as a result, Amir Taaki has taken it upon himself to decide the ordering. He lists Bitcoin-Qt first, followed by the others in no particular order. Taaki explains that this decision is to prevent anyone from trying to "game the system," which he believes is currently unexploitable. Gary Rowe proposes a simple description for each client, including details such as required blockchains, standalone vs dependent clients, and development language. These descriptions are provided for Bitcoin-Qt, MultiBit, Armory, Electrum, and the Bitcoin Wallet Android client. In another email thread, Taaki expresses annoyance with group emails and discusses issues with Yahoo mail. Jeff Garzik chimes in with an article about the harmful effects of "Reply-To" munging. The email threads end with announcements for a live security virtual conference and links to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
