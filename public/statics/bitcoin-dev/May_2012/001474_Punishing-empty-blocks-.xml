    <summary>The email conversation between Robert McKay and Jeff Garzik discusses the issue of miners mining empty blocks, possibly leading to years of degraded service for existing users. Jeff Garzik suggests an implementation change that would avoid relaying top-of-chain empty blocks, but not ban them completely. This is a soft vote of choice by the user, not a hard requirement on all users. The proposal also does not affect the ability to refuse transactions, which is an important part of the game theory of transaction pricing. Jeff Garzik believes OOB TXs (out of band transactions) are a great idea and might even be the norm in a hyperscaled bitcoin future.</summary>
