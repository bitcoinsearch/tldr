    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Vessenes and Luke-Jr on May 29, 2012, Vessenes expressed his confusion about reversing a block or coinbase into a URL. Luke-Jr responded by explaining that 20 byte keyhashes are a fundamental building block of the Bitcoin protocol and provided the formula for calculating them: ripemd160(sha256(ecdsaPubKey)). Vessenes is the CEO of CoinLab, a company focused on expanding the use of Bitcoin, while Luke-Jr is a prominent Bitcoin developer. The email signature of Vessenes includes his contact information and social media links.</summary>
