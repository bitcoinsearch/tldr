    <summary>On May 24, 2012 at 4:33:12 PM, Jeff Garzik inquired about the effects of no-transaction (no-TX) blocks that were becoming frequent. He asked for comments on this issue. According to stats from Eligius's past hundred blocks, it is not unreasonable for 10% (1 in 10) of single transaction blocks to be mined, indicating that the blocks are not intentionally harming Bitcoin. The question then arises of how quickly miners need to process transactions to reduce the number of these types of blocks.</summary>
