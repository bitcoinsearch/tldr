    <summary>In a conversation on May 29, 2012, Peter Vessenes discussed the implementation of miners modifying the coinbase. He stated that anything hard to implement would not be adopted by miners and that without his coinbaser branch, modifying the coinbase is difficult. Moreover, he suggested using a 20 byte keyhash instead of a full URL in the coinbase as there is a hard-limit of 100 bytes for the same. The owner can broadcast a full URI out-of-band using this keyhash. He also recommended that miners should use "MFR=" (Mining Fee Rules) as a prefix to the fixed-size keyhash. Additionally, he suggested that miners use https with a specified SSL keyhash in the URI. The destination may be a redirect or content delivery, and clients should follow the relevant HTTP specification. However, text/plain and text/html are not suitable for this purpose. Vessenes supported JSON as it includes extensibility, which allows miners to divide up their services according to their requirement. The document delivered must be in a JSON format dictionary and include 'min_fee,' 'pool_name,' and 'last_modified' fields; optional fields can be added over time. While the Service Level Agreement isn't binding, miners who implement it are expected to make a best effort attempt to follow it. Finally, Vessenes said that the canonical location for modified SLA would be the final destination URL from the redirects. The coinbase advertisement must be part of every coinbase mined by the miner, or there's no reliable way to prove which blocks are theirs.</summary>
