    <summary>In a conversation between Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik, the issue of block times and their accuracy was discussed. Luke-Jr stated that block times are not accurate enough. However, Jeff Garzik stated that the times in the log are very accurate as long as the system clock is remotely accurate. Jeff Garzik works at exMULTI, Inc. and can be reached at jgarzik@exmulti.com.</summary>
