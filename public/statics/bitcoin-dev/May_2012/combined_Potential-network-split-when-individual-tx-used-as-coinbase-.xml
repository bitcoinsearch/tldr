    <summary>The context states that there was a code change in Bitcoin's main.cpp file eight months ago that allows denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on 100 nodes sending transactions that use individual transactions as the coinbase. The writer questions whether this means transactions with zero confirmations are at risk of causing a network split and mentions having read about services that allow zero-confirmation transactions, suggesting that there are peers that accept them. It is unclear whether the writer has misread the code or not, but they also ask if a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) would have been applicable for the change made to the code. In May 2012, Rebroad from SourceForge raised a query regarding the same code change. They wanted to know if transactions with zero confirmations were affected by the DoS protocol for nodes sending transactions that use individual transactions as their coinbase. Pieter, a member of the Bitcoin community, responded to the query and clarified the matter.</summary>
