    <summary>The author of the article discusses the calculation of block difficulty and its impact on miners' decision to mine or not. When the difficulty level is low, many miners may decide to mine resulting in blocks being produced every 3 to 5 minutes. However, as the difficulty increases, it may no longer be cost-effective for miners to continue mining which can lead to a drop in block production.The author questions whether the stability of Bitcoin so far has been due to miners not factoring in immediate cost-effectiveness or mining by zombie-farms. This raises an interesting point about the impact of block difficulty on mining behavior and its potential effect on the Bitcoin network's stability.It is important to note that the author suggests that the stability of the Bitcoin network may have been maintained due to the lack of immediate cost-effectiveness considerations by miners or zombie-farms. This implies that if these factors change, it could potentially affect the stability of the network.Overall, the article highlights the significance of block difficulty and its relationship with mining behavior and the stability of the Bitcoin network. It emphasizes the need for further research and analysis on this topic to ensure the sustainability and longevity of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
