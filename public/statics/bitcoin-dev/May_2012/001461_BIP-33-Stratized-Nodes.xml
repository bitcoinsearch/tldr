    <summary>Peter has shared his initial reactions after reviewing a proposal from Amir. He believes that the proposal is cool and useful, but less secure than validating an entire blockchain. Peter suggests working out some detailed use cases beyond just a sample conversation to better understand the security implications of this proposal. Additionally, he raises concerns about discovery and how stratized servers will decide which transactions to relay/store. Moreover, he wants to know about economic motivations to run a stratized server. On the other hand, Peter thinks that sending everything for a source address will save a lot of roundtrip conversations since it is likely the most common request. Furthermore, he thinks that it would be nice to work out some theoretical security/cost/value calculations for subverting or lying about transactions (n-confirmation transaction, 0 confirmation transaction), NODE_STRATIZED transaction chain, and address balance request.</summary>
