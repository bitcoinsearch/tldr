    <summary>On May 12, 2012, Jeff Garzik announced that IPv6 support has been added to bitcoin/bitcoin.git and there are already a few IPv6 nodes live on the network. Users with IPv6 were encouraged to pull the latest bitcoin and test it out. In addition to this update, Pieter's DNS seeder at seed.bitcoin.sipa.be now crawls the IPv6 network and returns corresponding AAAA records, which is expected to help IPv6 nodes find each other.</summary>
