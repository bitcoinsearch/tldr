    <summary>In an email conversation between Alan and Mike Hearn, Alan mentions that he sent updated text to Genjix Armory and hopes that it will be included or reviewed. He agrees with Mike about the $4k donations thing being immaterial for a certain page. Mike points out that listing language just under Multibit makes it sound like a distinguishing characteristic and agrees to take it out. Bitcoin-qt has been translated into a broad set of languages.</summary>
