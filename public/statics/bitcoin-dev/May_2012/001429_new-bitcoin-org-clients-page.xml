    <summary>The writer expressed frustration with the default email options, specifically when group emailing. They often find themselves having to add people back in to the conversation after someone accidentally replies instead of doing a group reply. The writer uses Yahoo mail for spam and mailing lists and finds that using the 'reply all' option is not easily accessible. They instead go through the steps of reply, delete To, re-enter bitco... select drop down, click send. The writer then asks if anyone knows how to make reply all the default in mutt and how they can exclude their own email from being re-included when doing a group reply. Jeff Garzik responds by suggesting they try "Reply to All", but the writer explains that this puts the sender in 'to' and list in 'cc'. Garzik then provides a link to an article about why "Reply-To" Munging is Considered Harmful. The email ends with a promotion for a Live Security Virtual Conference and a link to sign up for the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
