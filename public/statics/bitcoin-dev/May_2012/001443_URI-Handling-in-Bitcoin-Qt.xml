    <summary>In an email exchange, Alan Reiner asked about the status and plans for supporting "bitcoin:" URIs in the Satoshi client. The feature is already implemented for Linux (Gnome) and Windows, but temporarily disabled on Windows due to an issue with boost::ipc that crashed bitcoin at startup. Reiner also wanted clarification on the intentions behind "label=" and "message=" fields. The label is for the destination address and the message is a freeform message describing the transaction. However, the message is not currently stored in the Satoshi client, but may be added in the future along with other transaction meta-data fields such as contact information, bought items, and item prices.</summary>
