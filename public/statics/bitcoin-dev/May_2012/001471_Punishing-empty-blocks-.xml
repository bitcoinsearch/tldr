    <summary>In a 2012 email thread, Jeff Garzik expressed concern over the prevalence of empty blocks being mined by some Bitcoin miners. Despite Satoshi Nakamoto's suggestion to hash only the fixed 80-byte header, some miners still find it easier and more profitable to mine empty blocks rather than wait for new transactions to come in. Garzik proposed two potential solutions: not storing or relaying empty blocks if a certain amount of time has passed since the last block, or ensuring that the latest block includes a certain percentage of unconfirmed transactions from the mempool. However, there were concerns with both proposals, such as no-TX miners including a statically generated transaction or refusing to relay quickly found blocks. The discussion highlights the ongoing debate around optimizing the mining process while maintaining the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
