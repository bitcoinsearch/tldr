    <summary>The email thread between Wladimir and Alan discussed the transaction meta-data fields concept. Alan expressed his desire to add separate strings for labeling addresses versus transactions in the client. He suggested that having different strings for owner information and purchase information would be ideal and would fit perfectly with the availability of "label=" and "message=" fields in BIP 21. However, he acknowledged that it wouldn't work if Bitcoin-Qt couldn't do it that way. Alan also asked about the status and plans for supporting "bitcoin:" URIs in the Satoshi client. The feature is already implemented for Linux (Gnome) and Windows, but temporarily disabled on Windows due to an issue with boost::ipc that crashed bitcoin at startup. Reiner also wanted clarification on the intentions behind "label=" and "message=" fields. The label is for the destination address, and the message is a freeform message describing the transaction. However, the message is not currently stored in the Satoshi client, but may be added in the future along with other transaction meta-data fields such as contact information, bought items, and item prices.Additionally, the author of the message is requesting information on two different topics related to BIP 21 (URI scheme) implementation in Armory and Bitcoin-Qt. Firstly, they enquired about the status and plans for supporting "bitcoin:" URIs in the Satoshi client, suggesting it would be a high-value feature that could improve usability dramatically. Secondly, they seek clarification on the intentions behind "label=" and "message=" fields in Bitcoin-Qt, pointing out how Armory has implemented it so both address labels and transaction labels are supported. The author suggests that merchants could include additional purchase information in the "message" field while only putting their business name in the "label" field to maintain privacy. Lastly, the author wants to know how other clients are implementing these features and if they distinguish between "label" and "message." In the email thread, it was suggested that users should count on all important information being in the /label/ field since anything in the /message/ field might not be saved. In the future, it may make sense for users to populate both the /message/ and /label /fields with lots of data using newlines. The first line would serve as a summary and be displayed in the address book and ledger, while extra lines would be displayed when the user opens up a details window. All of it would be automatically generated by the merchant, providing purchasers with detailed documentation on every purchase they've made for zero effort.</summary>
