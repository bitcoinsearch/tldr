    <summary>If you're trying to respond to a group email, it's best to use the "Reply to All" function that puts the sender in the 'to' field and the recipients in 'cc'. However, this can lead to cluttered and lengthy email threads if people don't trim their responses. To avoid this, using the "reply to" function could be more effective, assuming the list software can handle it. This will ensure that only the intended recipients receive your response and prevent unnecessary confusion.</summary>
