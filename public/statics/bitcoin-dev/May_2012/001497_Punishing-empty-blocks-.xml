    <summary>In this conversation, the topic of implementing a spec for miners to publish a URL through their coinbase is discussed. One person points out that anything hard to implement will not be implemented by miners. Another notes that Coinbase is limited to 100 bytes and suggests that a full URL may not be feasible. The proposed spec includes rules for formatting the URL and the expected content of the document delivered. JSON format is suggested as it is easy for both computers and humans to read and allows for extensibility. The conversation ends with one person suggesting using Bitcoin's secure scripting system to run a script retrieved from the URI instead of hard-coded logic.</summary>
