    <summary>Amir Taaki proposed to use the existing Bitcoin protocol for providing new functionality while maintaining compatibility. This proposal, called BIP 33, would allow a parallel system to operate alongside the main Bitcoin network without affecting current Bitcoin clients. However, Jeff Garzik suggested improving the discovery process to make it an easy, flexible, and extensible process by creating a new command "get-features" that returns a list of key/value pairs, with the key being a string and the value type being determined by the key. Standard behavior of clients would be to send "get-features" after seeing remote version info as part of the initial connection handshake. Jeff Garzik offered to create this as BIP 34 if people wished.</summary>
