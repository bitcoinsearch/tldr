    <summary>In an email thread, Wladimir and Alan were discussing the concept of transaction meta-data fields. Alan expressed his desire to add separate strings for labeling addresses versus transactions in the client. He believed that having different strings for owner information and purchase information would be ideal and would fit perfectly with the availability of "label=" and "message=" fields in BIP 21. However, he acknowledged that it wouldn't work if Bitcoin-Qt couldn't do it that way. Alan suggested that for now, users should count on all important information being in the /label/ field since anything in the /message/ field might not be saved. Although he expected that message data would be displayed after the URI is clicked, just not saved. In the future, it may make sense for users to populate both the /message/ and /label /fields with lots of data using newlines. The first line would serve as a summary and be displayed in the address book and ledger, while extra lines would be displayed when the user opens up a details window. All of it would be automatically generated by the merchant, providing purchasers with detailed documentation on every purchase they've made for zero effort.</summary>
