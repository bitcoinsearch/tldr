    <summary>On May 3, 2012, Andreas Schildbach made a request to add Bitcoin Wallet to the list of smartphone clients. He stated that someone had told him that the cell phone apps they tried were slow, and while he recommended Bitcoin Wallet and Bitcoin Spinner, he admitted that he hadn't used them personally. Andreas suggested having a list of smartphone clients prepared. Jorge Timón responded to this message.</summary>
