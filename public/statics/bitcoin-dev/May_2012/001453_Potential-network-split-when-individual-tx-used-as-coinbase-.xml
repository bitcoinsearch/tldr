    <summary>In May 2012, Rebroad from SourceForge raised a query regarding a code change in Bitcoin's main.cpp file. The change was related to DoS (Denial of Service) protocol for nodes sending transactions that use individual transactions as their coinbase. Rebroad wanted to know if this meant transactions with zero confirmations were affected. Pieter, a member of the Bitcoin community, responded to the query and clarified the matter.</summary>
