    <summary>In an email exchange, Luke-Jr stated that the service bits are propagated as part of the address, implying that users can easily identify the nodes they want to connect to for specific services at a glance. Passing long lists might be impractical, although it could work for protocol changes that don't add new services. Jeff Garzik cautioned against using bitcoin's P2P network for unrelated tasks, stating that if the peer list becomes too stratified, it is a sign that clients should use another network entirely. The BTC P2P netwok should not be used as a general message transit network.</summary>
