    <summary>The author of BIP 22 has revised the draft and is seeking further review. The revision addresses Geir's last email in March and practical issues faced by some pools recently. The changes from the last revision include renaming submitblock() method to getmemorypool, using getmemorypool() to provide client capabilities and other information to the server while requesting a job. Longpolls are now using a parameter in the getmemorypool request instead of a separate URI. The client can also inform the server of its own size and sigop requirements in advance and request detailed transaction data from the server to manipulate transactions included in the final block without discarding fees or making the block invalid due to not having enough. This feature ensures that blocks can be proposed before wasting time mining them to ensure they are otherwise valid.Finally, servers can be arranged into single logical services with failover and load balancing, similar to the getwork X-Host-List and X-Switch-To extensions. The full diff can be viewed at https://en.bitcoin.it/w/?title=BIP_0022&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=26408&amp;oldid=25544.</summary>
