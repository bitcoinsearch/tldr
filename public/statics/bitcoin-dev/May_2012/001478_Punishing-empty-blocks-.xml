    <summary>A discussion between Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik is documented in an email exchange from May 24, 2012. Jeff Garzik raised concerns about no-TX blocks that were occurring with a frequency of 1 in 20, and asked for comments on the matter. Luke-Jr responded that based on statistics from Eligius's past 100 blocks, 10% (1 in 10) of 1-txn blocks is not unreasonable. This suggests that these 1-txn mined blocks are not necessarily harming Bitcoin intentionally. Luke-Jr then requested someone to figure out the math for how fast miners need to finish processing transactions to reduce the number of 1txn blocks. Jeff Garzik responded by suggesting that one should look at the time since the last block and correlate it with the number of non-spam transactions in the memory pool at that time. It would be clear which ones are quick blocks, which take only 120 seconds since the last block.</summary>
