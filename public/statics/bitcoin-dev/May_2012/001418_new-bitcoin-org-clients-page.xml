    <summary>If you have a low-powered computer or are not willing to tolerate a 24-hour+ initial start time, it may not be advisable to use certain software. The initial sync-up on normal systems now takes a couple of hours, and it could take longer if unresponsive peers are encountered. However, this will also make the SPV nodes slow.While it is better to be conservative, calling the initial start time a dozen times longer than expected may be a bit much. It is important to refine the system to optimize its performance.</summary>
