    <summary>The latest update of the bitcoin/bitcoin.git now supports IPv6, with several IPv6 nodes already live on the network. Users are encouraged to pull the latest version and test it out, especially those who have IPv6 connectivity. For those without IPv6, the website sixxs.net is recommended as a resource to obtain it. The announcement was made by Jeff Garzik, representing exMULTI Inc., through a message on a mailing list.</summary>
