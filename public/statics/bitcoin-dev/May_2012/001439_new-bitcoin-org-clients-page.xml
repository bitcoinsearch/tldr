    <summary>After reading through a forum thread about Bitcoin clients, the author decides to step back and let others continue the discussion. Various clients are mentioned, such as Bitcoin-Qt (developed in C), Armory (which requires the entire blockchain and is dependent on Bitcoin-Qt or bitcoind), Electrum (dependent on a centralized server), and Bitcoin Wallet (an Android client with multiple options). The topic of whether a client is designed for occasional use or exclusive use is debated, with Armory being designed to be the only wallet if bitcoind[d/-qt] is running in the background. Additionally, Armory now has full installers for Windows and Linux with uninstallers and automatic URI registration. The author suggests that it would be great if Armory could manage bitcoind itself in the background like Spesmilo.</summary>
