    <summary>In an email thread from May 2, 2012, members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list discussed creating a webpage for the least technically-inclined end-users. Raphael NICOLLE expressed that the technical terms used in some existing Bitcoin clients were too complex for the average user. Gary Rowe then provided a breakdown of several Bitcoin client options, including Bitcoin-Qt, MultiBit, Armory, Electrum, and Bitcoin Wallet (an Android client). These clients were described in terms of their required blockchains, standalone vs dependent operation, frequency of use, available operating systems, programming language, and website links. The conversation then shifted to discussing email etiquette, with Amir Taaki expressing frustration about group emails where someone accidentally replies only to the sender rather than to everyone. Jeff Garzik shared a link arguing against "Reply-To" munging, which causes problems when trying to reply to groups. The thread ended with a promotion for a live security virtual conference.</summary>
