    <title>OP_RETURN inside TapScript</title>

    <summary>A recent message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list suggested that since Taproot was activated, separate OP_RETURN outputs for pushing data on-chain are no longer needed. Instead, "OP_RETURN" can be created as a branch in the TapScript to attach any data to a transaction and store it off-chain. This method allows for more than 80 bytes of free storage without ever pushing the taproot branch on-chain. Additionally, it provides proof that the data is connected to a taproot address pushed on-chain. However, this proposal only addresses committing to data and not publishing it. The email suggests that there are use-cases for both committing and publishing data through OP_RETURN.</summary>
