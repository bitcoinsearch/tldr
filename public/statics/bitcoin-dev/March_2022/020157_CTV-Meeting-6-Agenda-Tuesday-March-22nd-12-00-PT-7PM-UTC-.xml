    <summary>The 6th fortnightly CTV meeting will be held on March 22nd at noon Pacific 7 UTC, featuring a tutorial on using Sapio Studio. The agenda for the meeting will build on the knowledge from the 4th meeting and require attendees to build a Sapio WASM blob and CLI. The tutorial will cover everything else in detail, including trying out different contracts. After the tutorial, there will be a discussion about tooling and infrastructure. Attendees are advised to review the notes and tutorial from the 4th meeting. There will also be basic steps posted later tonight for setting things up from start to finish. A preview of the software that will be used is provided as an image.</summary>
