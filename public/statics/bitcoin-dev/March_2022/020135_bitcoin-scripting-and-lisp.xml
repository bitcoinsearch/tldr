    <summary>In an email conversation, Anthony Towns notes that PTLCs (Pointlock Time Contracts) are not compatible with Chia because of two reasons. Firstly, Chia lacks secp256k1 operations. Secondly, scriptless-script PTLCs cannot be done as the required information is lost when signatures are non-interactively aggregated via BLS. This adds an expensive extra ECC operation rather than reusing an op already being paid for. In contrast, HTLCs (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) only require a cheap hash operation.However, the CLVM (Chia Lisp Virtual Machine) currently supports BLS12-381 group 1 point operations that it uses to support taproot, which may be sufficient to support PTLCs despite not being compatible with secp. Additionally, in the future, there may be a soft fork to include a complete set of BLS12-381 operations primarily to support ZK (Zero-Knowledge) implementation.</summary>
