    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the use of testnet3 and signet for testing sidechains. While some argue that pegging worthless coins into another system of worthless coins is pointless, others believe that testing pegging is necessary for introducing sidechains.Testnet3's scarcity of coins is considered a feature, allowing miners to create, move, and destroy zero satoshis and see what can happen with a chain after many halvings. Testnet3 is deemed good enough to represent the main chain during sidechain testing because it is permissionless and open, allowing anyone to start mining sidechain blocks.To put the proposal into practice, creating one Taproot address per signet in testnet3 would suffice, allowing for moving coins to and from testnet3 every three months. Signets can be pegged in with a 1:1 ratio, and existing signets can transform into signet sidechains if the signet miners rule those chains and enforce any transition rules. New signets can also be pegged into Signet as the official signet. However, it is noted that signet degrades to a testnet if the key is set to OP_TRUE.The discussion also touches on the difficulty of obtaining testnet coins for testing purposes. The lack of coins makes mining less cumbersome and does not require finding testnet coins and pegging them. Furthermore, the discussion debates the usefulness of testnet in light of signet, a more reliable testing network with improved security measures.Overall, the focus is on finding the best way to test sidechains using available resources while ensuring adequate chainwork protection.</summary>
