    <summary>In a message sent to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list on March 5, 2022, Jeremy Rubin expressed interest in knowing about AJ's experience with building Chia Lisp and what the Lightning Network looks like on Chia. While questioning the suitability of simplicity and Chia Lisp for a ZK prover, he acknowledged that it would be an interesting concept to explore. ZmnSCPxj responded by stating that they had experimented with compiling Simplicity to Boolean circuits, and although it was done a while ago, the result of compiling their SHA256 program was within an order of magnitude of the hand-made SHA256 circuit for bulletproofs. ZmnSCPxj also noted that compilers for ZK-provable circuits are still not as effective as humans.</summary>
