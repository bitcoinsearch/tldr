    <summary>The invitation to participate in pleb.fi/miami2022 has been extended to developers interested in building bitcoin stuff in rust with a focus on Sapio and a hackathon. The event will take place on April 4th and 5th near Miami. Due to the scheduling overlap of the CTV Meeting, the host Jeremy Rubin regrets his inability to host it, and meeting #7 will resume at the time meeting #8 would have taken place.</summary>
