    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on March 11, 2022, Russell O'Connor addressed concerns about the "no-miner-veto" system in Speedy Trial's deployment mechanism. O'Connor acknowledged that the short timeline of Speedy Trial addresses some concerns, but it still relies on miner approval. He suggested that a UASF fallback be released in parallel to address this issue. When asked to create a new deployment mechanism that satisfies both the "devs-do-not-decide" and "no-divergent-consensus-rules" factions, O'Connor pointed to BIP8 as a solution. O'Connor then disputed the claim that BIP8 lacked broad consensus, arguing instead that it did have such support before some developers decided to take their own course of action. He referenced luke-jr's proposal to mandate eventual forced signaling, which failed to gain widespread agreement due to many miners lacking the necessary firmware at the time. However, O'Connor argued that the potential risks associated with forcing signaling were overstated, as miners had 18 months to update their firmware.</summary>
