    <summary>A proposal for a coin-weighted signature-based poll is discussed, where every pollee signs messages for each UTXO they want to respond to the poll with. Poll results are considered only at each particular block height, where the support and opposition responses are weighted by the UTXO amount. This system is not vulnerable to sybil attacks because it requires access to UTXOs and response-weight is directly tied to UTXO amount. The proposal also suggests using two public keys/spend paths in a new address type to prevent public key exposure prior to spending for current addresses. The consequences of a soft fork are also discussed, including the fact that all the consequences of the change are not opt-in, and that a plan to preserve a minority fork during the period of time it takes for an economic shock to reach its new equilibrium should be considered. Speedy trial is preferred over BIP8+LOT=true for a proposal that one does not want to succeed, as it has less chance of causing an actual fork, whereas LOT=true guarantees a fork if even a single person is running it.</summary>
