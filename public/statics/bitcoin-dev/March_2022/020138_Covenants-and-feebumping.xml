    <summary>The email conversation discusses the concerns regarding the use of a signature challenge for hot contracts. The concern is that the use of multiple network monitors increases the risk of DOS attacks, while reducing uptime risks. A cleverer way to solve this problem is suggested - using a DLC oracle. This method involves creating adaptor signatures for each feerate version, and sending them to multiple watchtowers. The watchtowers can only publish one of the feerate versions, unless the DLC oracle is hacked and publishes multiple scalars. However, there are still risks involved, such as third-party trust and time-bound DLCs. Therefore, the use of DLC oracles may not be suitable for hot protocols.</summary>
