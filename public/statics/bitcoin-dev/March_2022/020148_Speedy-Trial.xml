    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin proposed a soft-forking mechanism against activation. When asked what more users want, he replied that ideally resistance should be a priori rather than a posteriori. Another member of the group disagreed, saying that it was a reasonable ask and that he had written 40 lines of python code to achieve it. However, the other member declined to review the code due to his disagreement on the analysis of the problem. He also took issue with the 'merry christmas' greeting, stating that it was not Christmas time and neither of them were Christians. He urged both parties to stay on topic and avoid negatively discriminating each other for off-topic reasons. The email ends with a peace message from Jeremy.</summary>
