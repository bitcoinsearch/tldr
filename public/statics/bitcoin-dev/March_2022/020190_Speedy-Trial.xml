    <summary>There is a discussion about whether bitcoin upgrades are made if and only if miners vote to approve those changes. Some people still think that it is voting, but the problem is not imaginary, as evidenced by examples like a mining pool. However, changing how bitcoin is designed is not the solution to people misunderstanding the design. Instead, simple persistent explaining can fix this. One person suggests using a better activation method like BIP 8/LOT=TRUE to solve the problem and lists other positives for using this method. However, another person objects to changing how we engineer Bitcoin because of optics and believes that the solution is to explain speedy trial better to the group of important people that think miner signaling is voting. They argue that a bad explanation of speedy trial can mislead people into thinking miner signalling is how Bitcoin upgrades are voted in, but a bad explanation can explain anything badly. Overall, there is a debate about how to address misunderstandings about the bitcoin upgrade process.</summary>
