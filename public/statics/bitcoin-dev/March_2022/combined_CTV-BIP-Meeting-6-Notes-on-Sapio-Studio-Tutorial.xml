    <summary>The 6th CTV meeting focused on a tutorial for Sapio Studio, which is a Bitcoin wallet/IDE that allows users to work with Bitcoin Smart Contracts. The software is currently in its alpha stage of development, but it has been improving over time. During the tutorial, participants were guided through the process of setting up Sapio Studio and creating a Bitcoin Vault instance similar to one shared by James O'Beirne. However, some issues were faced by participants during the tutorial, including build system problems, valid argument passing, minrelay fees, and minor GUI bugs.Despite these challenges, the software was successfully used, as demonstrated in the tutorial's screenshots. Sapio Studio has several useful features: it can restart and resume sessions, recompile with effect updates, and enforce recursive covenants that are compatible with any covenant upgrades. However, the participants identified areas of improvement needed to make the GUI more intuitive, which will be incorporated in the coming weeks.</summary>
