    <summary>On March 5, 2022, ZmnSCPxj wrote an email to Russell regarding a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about Chia Lisp and Simplicity. Jeremy Rubin expressed interest in knowing what could be built with Chia Lisp and how the Lightning Network would look like on Chia. He also questioned if neither Chia Lisp nor Simplicity would be well-suited for a ZK prover. In response, ZmnSCPxj mentioned that he had experimented with compiling Simplicity to Boolean circuits and that the result was within an order of magnitude of the hand-made SHA256 circuit for bulletproofs. However, ZmnSCPxj did not clarify if the compiled circuit was larger or smaller than the hand-made one.</summary>
