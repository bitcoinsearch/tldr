    <summary>In a recent conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, members discussed why an approach that allows blocking an "evil" fork, even when others don't agree it is evil, would give an enemy of bitcoin the power to block a good fork. They concluded that such a solution would not be well-designed as it would fail in cases where an attacker decides to take advantage of it. The discussion also went on to compare the benefits of bip8/lot=true (the activation process for Bitcoin upgrades) versus speedy trial, which refers to the time taken before knowing the outcome of an upgrade proposal. The discussion then moved on to talk about hypothetical scenarios, where someone being able to block a change is undesirable and could harm bitcoin. An example was given of an enemy of bitcoin trying to stop a good idea that most of the community supports. Despite such a scenario, the enemies of bitcoin should not have the power to stop a good idea from being implemented.</summary>
