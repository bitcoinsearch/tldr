    <summary>Wasabi Wallet 2.0 does not have coin control, but this is not a problem for privacy if transactions are made with coinjoined coins that are indistinguishable. If coinjoined coins cannot be used, there is still an improved version of coin control that selects clusters of coins assumed to belong to the same wallet. Wasabi assumes no coins as private, but the owner has control over who the ownership of equalized coinjoin UTXOs is revealed to. The wallet works with the user's assumption of its threat model and does not mislead the user. Using a change address in transactions affects privacy and can be debatable, but using a change address same as other outputs would make it difficult to analyze for possible recipients. Wasabi does not have different types of addresses to use for a change, but Bitcoin Core recently made some related improvements that would improve privacy. There are several things not fixed and shared in different GitHub issues or discussions regarding privacy, security, and other things. The bitcoin-dev mailing list may not be where the target users of Wasabi 2.0 are to be found, but developers could benefit from knowing about its innovations.</summary>
