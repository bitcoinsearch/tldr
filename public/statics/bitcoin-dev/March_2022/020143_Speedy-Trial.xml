    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has raised concerns about the possibility of a "dumb majority soft fork" in the future. This scenario could occur if mainstream adoption leads to a crisis that convinces a large number of people to demand changes to the Bitcoin protocol, such as increasing the block size to 1GB. This could happen via a segwit-like soft fork and pose security risks for the network. In such a situation, those who disagree with the new rules may need to hard fork away from the economic majority. The success of a minority fork would depend on the amount of mining power it can attract, which tends to align with rewards offered by the chain. However, perfect competition is just a theoretical concept.</summary>
