    <summary>The conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list started with Jorge Tim√≥n asking about the potential for CTV (Consensus-enforced Transaction Validity) to be added to Bitcoin Core, prompting Michael Folkson to caution against assuming community consensus. He also suggested that discussions of activation mechanisms and soft fork proposals should be kept separate, and that patience is key in achieving community consensus on any future changes. ST (Speedy Trial), the activation mechanism used for Taproot, was discussed, and Michael emphasized that criticism should be welcome and that we should avoid blindly trusting any individual person. Finally, he stated that deep technical review and community consensus are crucial before any soft fork proposal is implemented.</summary>
