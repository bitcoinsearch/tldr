    <summary>In an email thread on Bitcoin-dev, Jorge Timón sparked a debate about the Speedy Trial deployment design. The proposal was initially introduced by Mark Friedenbach and aimed to address concerns raised by different factions, including the "no-miner-veto" faction. However, Timón criticized the design, prompting Friedenbach to defend it, saying that it was designed to take into account all the concerns raised. He added that the short timeline of Speedy Trial would address the "no-miner-veto" concerns, as there would be no more waiting for miners who drag their feet. Friedenbach acknowledged that some people may not like the design, but he believes that he meaningfully addressed those miner-veto concerns and other people agree with him. He challenged Timón to design a new deployment mechanism that addresses the concerns of the "devs-do-not-decide" faction and the "no-divergent-consensus-rules" faction if he is so concerned about listening to legitimate criticism. Friedenbach also highlighted a major contender to the Speedy Trial design at the time, which was to mandate eventual forced signaling, championed by luke-jr. However, that proposal did not get broad consensus because a large amount of hash power did not have the firmware required to support signaling at the time. In retrospect, the design might have risked knocking a significant fraction of mining power offline if it had been deployed, making Speedy Trial a better option.</summary>
