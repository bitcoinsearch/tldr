    <summary>When a flawed proposal manages to pass through the activation parameters and get released, but fails to achieve supermajority hashpower support, it is considered a failure of the review process. The percentage of supermajority hashpower, which is decided by Bitcoin core developers, can choose to not follow either old or new consensus rules at any given time. This issue is worsened by BIP8/LOT=true in comparison to speedy trial, the latter having misled many Bitcoin users, including miners, into considering signaling as voting. In speedy trial, majority votes decide whether a soft fork gets activated, whereas with BIP8/LOT=true, things are kept simple, and miners need only follow consensus rules as they currently do if they wish to mine blocks for subsidy and fees. It's important to note that mining pools or individual miners can participate in soft fork discussions regardless of activation method and share their concerns, which can be evaluated based on technical merits.</summary>
