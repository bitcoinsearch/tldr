    <summary>Asher Hopp, a contributor to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, has proposed a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to change the maximum supply of bitcoin from 21 million to 21 trillion by moving the decimal place six places to the right while reserving two degrees of accuracy after the decimal point. The proposal is based on Satoshi Nakamoto's response to a bitcointalk forum discussion in 2010 about the divisibility and economics of bitcoin as a global currency. The proposed change would offer several benefits including unit bias, community cohesion, simplicity, and standardization. Hopp argues that this change will benefit Bitcoin's adoption by eliminating the negative perception of its unit size, promoting community cohesion, and simplifying standardization across different regions. The only drawback identified is a psychological one, where moving the decimal place may produce bad optics in the short-term. However, implementation of the BIP would require updating the configuration of wallets' CLI/GUI displays, which can be done through software updates. As this BIP is a consensus change around the display of Bitcoin wallet balances and transaction amounts, everything remains backward compatible with previous versions of Bitcoin, and there would be no interruption in services for Bitcoin wallets that do not implement this BIP.</summary>
