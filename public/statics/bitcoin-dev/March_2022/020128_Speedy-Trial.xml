    <summary>In this conversation, the participants discuss a mechanism of soft-forking against activation and whether it is enough for a hypothetical group of users who may or may not exist. One participant suggests that writing code on behalf of these users to have a node that remains stalled on Speedy Trial lock-in isn't reasonable, but another disagrees and shares a python code of about 40 lines that accomplishes this task. The conversation ends with a Christmas greeting and a request to vet the code carefully before running.</summary>
