    <summary>In this conversation, the topic of Chia Lisp and its potential applications is discussed. AJ is asked about their experience with building using Chia Lisp and how the Lightning Network would look on it. The question of whether Chia Lisp is suited for a ZK prover is raised, and it is suggested that something like Cairo could be adapted for Bitcoin transactions to achieve better privacy and enable various programming paradigms.</summary>
