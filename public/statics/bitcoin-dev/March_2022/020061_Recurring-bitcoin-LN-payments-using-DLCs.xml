    <summary>The context includes a link to a GitHub repository containing an old Python sapio contract that allows for cancellable subscriptions, which function as a time-based autopay scheme. In this scheme, cancellation provides the receiver with time to claim the correct amount of money. The email thread discusses a proposal for pre-approved lines of credit from a Bitcoin wallet, which can be drawn down with oracle attestations and may include locktimes for rate limiting. One potential application for this scheme is commissioning work from an unbranded workperson and using an oracle to judge if the work has been completed before compensating the worker. The discussion also touches on the possibility of multiple PTLCs triggered by a single oracle and whether this is the best application for the proposed scheme.</summary>
