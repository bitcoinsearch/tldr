    <summary>A discussion on the third-party malleability in Bitcoin transactions took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. ZmnSCPxj pointed out that using the annex opcode for adding weight to a transaction does not require a signature and would make it third-party malleable. However, if a “valid” transaction has the minimum necessary Annex weight, then any malleated transaction with lower or higher Annex weight fails validation or cannot evict it from the mempool respectively. The use of OP_ANNEX was also debated, with some suggesting it should be banished while others argued that it may have utility for increasing limits on SCRIPT execution.</summary>
