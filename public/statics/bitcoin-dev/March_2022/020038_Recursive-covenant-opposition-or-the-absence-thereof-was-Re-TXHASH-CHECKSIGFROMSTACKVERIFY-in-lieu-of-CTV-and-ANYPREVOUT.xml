    <summary>In a recent conversation thread, ZmnSCPxj discussed the differences between continuous operation of a sidechain and a channel factory. He noted that a sidechain would require a constant stream of 32-byte commitments while a channel factory, in the absence of membership set changes, could operate with zero bytes per block being published. However, ZmnSCPxj also mentioned that a sidechain could push zero bytes on-chain by placing a sidechain hash in OP_RETURN inside TapScript. This allows every sidechain node to verify the connection between the sidechain hash and the Taproot address without pushing 32 bytes on-chain. However, it's important to note that the Taproot address itself would still take up 32 bytes on-chain, so there wouldn't be any significant savings in this approach.</summary>
