    <summary>The context discusses the use of escrow providers and how they require interactiveness at settlement time while PTLCs do not. This results in a better user experience for Alice and Bob. The oracle or escrow provider just issues attestations, which are then used by Bob or Alice to complete the adaptor signature. Non-interactive settlement is a significant advantage of DLC style applications. However, the interactiveness requirements for LN are very high, making developing applications difficult, especially for mobile applications. It is suggested that reducing interactiveness requirements with new bitcoin applications can provide better UX.It is also mentioned that 2-of-3 contracts are not transportable over LN, but PTLCs are transportable. Therefore, the idea of using PTLCs as a replacement for 2-of-3 escrows still has merit for LN.</summary>
