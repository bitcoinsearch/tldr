    <summary>The discussion revolves around the misconception of signaling for readiness during a soft fork deployment. While some users, miners, and exchanges consider it as voting, this misunderstanding is not relevant and has no concrete downsides. The argument that changing the design will improve the situation is perplexing, and changing the idea based on that argument is completely unconscionable. However, the author believes that BIP 8/LOT=TRUE is a better activation method for future soft forks. The downside of the signaling period being a waste of time if mining pools that agreed on a soft fork earlier do politics or are influenced by councils such as BMC or governments during signaling can be fixed using the new activation method. Despite attempting to explain how signaling works to this group of people, they still misunderstand it. The solution is not to change Bitcoin's engineering but instead to explain speedy trial better to this imaginary group of important people.</summary>
