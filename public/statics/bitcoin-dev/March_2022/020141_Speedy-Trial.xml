    <summary>In a discussion on improving how Bitcoin does soft forks, Billy Tetrud suggested involving users more in activation and a mechanism for people to signal opposition. However, he believes that miners are users too and have important interests that differ from most users. He also thinks that chain splits should be avoided and orderly coordination of miners is necessary. Tetrud supports the original BIP8+LOT=true proposal and wants users to easily coordinate resistance to any change. However, he opposes using speedy trial for any consensus rule change deployment. In response to a question about a block size increase through an extension block softfork, Tetrud advocated for using BIP8+LOT=true over speedy trial. It should be noted that any user polling system is vulnerable to sybil attacks.</summary>
