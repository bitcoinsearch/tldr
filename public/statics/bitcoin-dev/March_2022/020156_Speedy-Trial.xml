    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, there is a proposal for a coin-weighted signature-based poll that is resistant to sybil attacks. The proposed poll involves signed messages that are only valid while the corresponding UTXOs have not been spent. Poll results are considered at specific block heights, with support and opposition responses weighted by UTXO amount and the support/oppose fraction in the message. Lightning channels with multiple participants could sign together, supporting fractions that match their respective channel balances. However, changes to lightning channel balances could add complexity to the signaling process. The proposal also suggests adding an optional human-readable message to the poll messages. The storage of poll data doesn't require a chain or validation by all full nodes. Finally, the proposal suggests using taproot leaf to validate a signaling signature.There is a discussion about using a "cold" key and delegates for voting in a secure manner. The "cold" key is the most trusted option, but it cannot be online all the time due to security concerns. Therefore, the idea of using delegates who are semi-trusted is being considered. However, there are issues related to the weight of vault owners' votes and their potential reluctance to vote due to risk. Another problem is indicating that a long-term-cold-storage UTXO has a signaling pubkey, which may require a softfork. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem. Overall, the focus is on finding a secure way to ensure that the "cold" key is used for voting while minimizing risks and addressing technical challenges.</summary>
