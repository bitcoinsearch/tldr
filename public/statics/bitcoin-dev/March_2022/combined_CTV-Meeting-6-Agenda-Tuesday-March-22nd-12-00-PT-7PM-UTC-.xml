    <summary>The 6th fortnightly CTV meeting is scheduled to take place on March 22nd at noon Pacific 7 UTC. The meeting will feature a tutorial on using Sapio Studio, with the agenda building on the knowledge gained from the 4th meeting. Attendees will be required to build a Sapio WASM blob and CLI, with the tutorial covering everything else in detail, including trying out different contracts. After the tutorial, there will be a discussion about tooling and infrastructure, with attendees advised to review the notes and tutorial from the 4th meeting. Basic steps for setting things up from start to finish will also be posted later tonight. A preview of the software that will be used is provided as an image for attendees to familiarize themselves with beforehand.</summary>
