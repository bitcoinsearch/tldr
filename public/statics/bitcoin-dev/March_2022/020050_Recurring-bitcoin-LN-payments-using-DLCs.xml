    <summary>After a few days of consideration, Chris agrees with ZmnSCPxj that when it comes to recurring payments, this proposal is similar to nLocktime. To prevent malicious parties from withdrawing multiple subscriptions using oracle attestations, subsequent UTXOs can be rate-limited with nlocktimes. The scheme proposes pre-approved lines of credit from a bitcoin wallet which can be drawn down with oracle attestations. Locktimes can be mixed in to rate limit or allow the full utxo to be spent by the borrower depending on the use case. Overall, the context suggests a method for implementing pre-approved lines of credit with oracle attestations and optional locktimes for rate limiting.</summary>
