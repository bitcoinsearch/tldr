    <summary>The Wasabi Wallet automatically selects private coins with sufficient sats to spend Bitcoin to an address. However, there are no 'private' coins in Bitcoin, and the wallet assumes certain coins as private, which can be misleading for the user. Coin control is not displayed to the user, and the user does not select coins because they are never shared with the user in the first place. The user can adjust the coin selection with the help of previously provided contact labels if the private balance is insufficient to make the payment. Selecting some labels with misleading text 'who can see this transaction' does not look helpful. Wasabi also suggests the user slightly adjust the payment amount to avoid the creation of a change utxo, decreasing fees and improving future privacy. The privacy involved in using a change or not using it is debatable. Not using a change address makes it easier to understand who might be the recipient in a transaction, whereas using a change address same as other outputs would be difficult to analyze for possible recipients. Wasabi Wallet does not have different types of addresses to use for a change; however, Bitcoin Core recently made some related improvements which would improve privacy. Developers working on Wasabi mentioned that WW2 is not developed for power users, so the bitcoin dev mailing list may not be the best place to look for newbies. Several issues such as privacy, security, and others are not fixed and are shared in different GitHub issues or discussions.</summary>
