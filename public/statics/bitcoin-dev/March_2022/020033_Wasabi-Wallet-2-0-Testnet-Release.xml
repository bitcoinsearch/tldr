    <summary>Wasabi Wallet 2.0 has been released for public preview with coinjoin on testnet. The new version provides effortless privacy for its users through a deep Tor integration and BIP158 block filters or the packaged Bitcoin full node. The privacy is upgraded on the blockchain layer with a new Wabisabi coinjoin implementation, which replaces the ZeroLink coinjoin coordination protocol. This implementation enables anonymous DoS protection for centrally coordinated coinjoins without relying on equal amount outputs. The coordination enables a more sophisticated amount decomposition, resulting in "changeless" coinjoins, reducing the amount of mining fees paid and the time until the user's utxo set is private. The UX is simple: receive, wait, spend privately. Whenever the user wants to spend bitcoin to an address, the wallet automatically selects those private coins with sufficient sats, showing coin control to the user. Wasabi suggests the user slightly adjust the payment amount to avoid creating a change utxo, decreasing fees and improving future privacy. Labeling is mandatory in Wasabi, hence the utxo concept is abstracted away, and only the contact labels are displayed for the users to choose from.Wasabi Wallet 2.0 can be downloaded from Github. Users are requested to test the completely new UI/UX, review the cryptography and coordination protocol, and especially coinjoin to analyze the resulting transaction graph in the wild. The release comes with a testnet coordinator.</summary>
