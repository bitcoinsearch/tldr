    <summary>The email thread discusses coordination efforts to prevent the activation of taproot transactions in a chain. Users who do not want to activate taproot can soft-fork their own rule to disallow version bits that complete the Speedy Trial activation sequence or make spending from/to taproot addresses illegal. However, coordination requires time. The opposition had over three years to coordinate before an activation method was merged, and then seven months after the activation method was merged before taproot enforcement began. In contrast, the UASF activation attempt for segwit took between four to six months to coordinate.The email also proposes steps to resist an activation proposal. First, explain why you want to resist it. Second, establish if either side is a paper tiger and set up a futures market. Third, use the speedy trial approach to agree to not adopt new rules with only 10% of hashpower not signaling over a three-month period. Fourth, if successful, try to resolve objections again. Fifth, accept defeat or create a new chain if you cannot prevent activation. Lastly, consider fixing problems via hard forks or forbidding blocks/transactions that attempt to use them.However, the email emphasizes that talking to each other and solving the problem before it's a problem is a better approach than risking money on futures markets or resorting to progressively worse options.</summary>
