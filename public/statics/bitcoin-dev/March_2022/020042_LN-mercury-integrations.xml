    <summary>The mercury statechain wallet/service is considering two new features and is seeking feedback. The first feature involves charging fees up-front via a Lightning Network (LN) invoice before generating a shared key deposit address, instead of collecting the fee in the withdrawal transaction as a UTXO paid to a fixed bitcoin address. This would mitigate issues such as small withdrawal transaction fee outputs and privacy concerns over labeling all withdrawn coins as mercury statechain withdrawals. Users would copy the LN invoice into a third party LN wallet and pay the fee, which would be verified by an LN node running on the mercury server back end.The second feature involves enabling withdrawal directly into an LN channel, including creating and co-signing partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) with the mercury server, sending PSBTs to the channel counterparty out of band or via a third party LN wallet/node, importing PSBTs created by the channel counterparty, signing them, and exporting and/or broadcasting fully signed PSBTs. This feature has the potential to eliminate an on-chain transaction, which could be valuable in a high-fee environment. While it seems possible with c-lightning and lnd via RPC, there are currently no LN wallets that support this type of direct payment to a dual funded channel opening transaction from a third party wallet.</summary>
