    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around the need for testing pegging and whether testnet3 should be permanently shut down after the availability of signet. While some argue that pegging worthless coins into a system of also worthless coins is pointless unless it is to test pegging, others believe that testing pegging is necessary for introducing sidechains. The question remains why more than 21 million coins are required for testing if they are not needed for real transactions. Some propose shutting down testnet3 and using signet as the official mainchain while pegging other signets into it. However, testnet3 is permissionless, allowing anyone to become a miner, which signet does not permit. Additionally, signet introduces new coins out of thin air instead of forming two-way peg-in between testnet3 and signet. Testnet3's scarcity of coins is considered a feature rather than a bug, allowing users to see what can happen with a chain after many halvings. Furthermore, miners can create, move, and destroy zero satoshis in testnet3, extending the precision of the coins. The lack of coins makes mining less cumbersome and does not require finding testnet coins and pegging them. Regarding sidechains' testing, creating a Taproot address per signet in testnet3 and moving coins to and from testnet3 via one testnet transaction every three months could enable the same coins to travel between many signets. New signets can be pegged in with a 1:1 ratio, and existing signets can be transformed into signet sidechains. Testnet3 is seen as good enough to represent the main chain during sidechain testing due to its permissionless, open nature and ability to test extreme scenarios.</summary>
