    <summary>The conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the activation rules for Bitcoin's proposed BIP8 soft fork. One user, @Jorge, is being called out for being difficult to communicate with and defensive. The discussion centers around involving users more in activation and the idea of some way for people to signal opposition. One suggested mechanism for signature-based user polling, while another involves miners actively signaling their opposition to a soft fork. However, the disagreement lies in that miners are also users with important interests that differ from most users. Additionally, chain splits should be avoided, so orderly coordination of miners is necessary. A major contender to the Speedy Trial design at the time was to mandate eventual forced signaling, but it did not get broad consensus due to a large amount of hash power not having the required firmware to support signaling. Another solution proposed was for users to actively oppose a proposal by invalidating the block that produces activation. Quantum computing concerns were also discussed, with the suggestion that if one is worried about funds not being secured by taproot, they should avoid using taproot addresses. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of finding common ground between different viewpoints while avoiding chain splits and ensuring the security of funds.</summary>
