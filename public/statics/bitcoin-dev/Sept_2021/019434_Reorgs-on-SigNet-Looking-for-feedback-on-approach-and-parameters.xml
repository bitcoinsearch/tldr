    <summary>The email exchange between Michael Folkson and Matt highlights a debate on the goal of Signet. While Folkson believes that the purpose of Signet is to create a testnet that reliably resembles mainnet behavior, Matt argues that matching mainnet's behavior is not an effective way of testing applications. Instead, he suggests that the goal should be to make testing easier and less time-consuming. He also points out that introducing complexity in multiple dimensions would make it harder to maintain and achieve the initial objectives. The conversation also touches upon the benefits of deterministic reorgs over probabilistic ones.</summary>
