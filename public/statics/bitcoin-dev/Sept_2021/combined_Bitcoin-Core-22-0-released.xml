    <summary>Bitcoin Core has recently released version 22.0, which includes updates and changes to the P2P protocol and network code, such as support for running Bitcoin Core as an I2P service and new RPC methods for external signers. Additionally, various GUI and API updates have been made, including improvements to `getblock` and error codes in `{sign,verify}message` RPCs. The release removes support for Tor v2 hidden services and adds NAT-PMP port mapping support via libnatpmp. The full list of changes can be found on the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository. Updates have also been made to the software's build system, testing, QA processes, and documentation, with added support for Android packaging and improvements to fuzz binary compilation under Windows. These updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to optimize and update the codebase, making it more robust and secure for end-users. Version 0.21.1 has also been released, featuring various improvements and bug fixes.It is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.14+, and Windows 7 and newer, but it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems. From Bitcoin Core 22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported. Overall, these updates represent significant progress in improving the Bitcoin network's functionality and security.</summary>
