    <summary>The speaker is curious about the motivation behind public signet and states that they may be a prime target market for it as someone developing bitcoin applications. However, they are not benefiting from signet due to slow and irregular block discovery times on testnet3 and mainnet. On testnet3, blocks can go days without being found and thousands can be found in a day, making it an unreliable testing environment. Conversely, signet mirrors mainnet in terms of block discovery time variance. The speaker also notes that using mainnet poses a risk due to Bitcoin's actual monetary value, and suggests that proposed soft forks may be activated on signet for testing before they are considered for activation on mainnet.</summary>
