    <summary>A new code is being written that would force a full node to shut down automatically if MTP-11 exceeds 5 years of the software release date. This code intends to give the community a time of approximately 5 years to upgrade to a new version that executes a new hard fork while keeping everyone in consensus, given that the change implemented is non-controversial. The purpose of this code is to ensure that all nodes are updated and running on the latest version of the software, thus maintaining consensus among participants.</summary>
