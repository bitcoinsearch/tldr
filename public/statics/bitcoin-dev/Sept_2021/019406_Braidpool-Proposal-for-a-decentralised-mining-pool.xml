    <summary>In an email exchange between Eric Voskuil and Dave, the topic of centralized mining control and payment censorship was discussed. Voskuil argued that centralization of payment ultimately controls transaction selection and results in censorship. However, Dave countered this argument by suggesting that if miners were paid after each share via Lightning Network (LN) and could switch pools instantly, then the worst case scenario with centralized pools would be not getting paid for one share. Dave also expressed interest in whether braidpool offered any significant benefits over an idealized version of centralized mining with independent transaction selection. No further information or context was provided.</summary>
