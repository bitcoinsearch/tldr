    <title>Reorgs on SigNet - Looking for feedback on approach and parameters</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo suggested that existing block producers each generate a new key to sign reorgs. This would allow users to choose whether or not they accept reorg-signed blocks by setting a flag. The proposal includes multiple sets of keys for different scenarios, including periodic reorgs for ongoing testing and frequent reorgs or on-demand reorgs to reduce testing delays. Dave suggests dropping the option for no reorgs and making periodic reorgs the default `-signet` in Bitcoin Core and other nodes, as he believes too few people currently test their software with reorgs.</summary>
