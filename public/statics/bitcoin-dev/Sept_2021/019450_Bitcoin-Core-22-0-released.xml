    <summary>Bitcoin Core has released version 22.0 with updates and changes to the P2P protocol and network code. The release includes support for running Bitcoin Core as an I2P service, and connect to such services. Wallet changes include new RPC methods for external signers like hardware wallets, and a new CLI command has been added to return the number of addresses known to the node per network type. Additionally, there are several new features added to the Bitcoin network, including the addition of fuzzing harnesses, per-peer message capture, and exposure of high bandwidth mode state via getpeerinfo. The update also includes improvements to address manager performance, replacement of `cs_feeFilter` with a simple std::atomic, and more. The release removes support for Tor v2 hidden services in favor of Tor v3 only and adds NAT-PMP port mapping support via libnatpmp. The full list of changes can be found on the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository. The Bitcoin Core software has undergone a series of updates and improvements, including changes to the GUI, API, build system, tests, QA processes, and documentation. The GUI updates include support for macOS Dark mode, external signer support, and improvements to the peers window and peer details. The API updates include improvements to `getblock`, error codes in `{sign,verify}message` RPCs, and better error messages for invalid addresses. The development team has fixed various bugs and added new features such as the ability to change the autoprune block space size in the intro dialog. Other notable changes include revamped context menus, saving/restoring column sizes of tables, and improvements to GUI responsiveness when progress dialogs are used. Additionally, there are now keyboard shortcuts for context menus, runtime appearance adjustment on macOS, and improved GUI responsiveness when progress dialogs are used.Updates have been made to the software's build system, including adding support for Android packaging, updating miniupnpc and crc32c subtrees, and dropping unneeded macOS framework dependencies. In terms of testing and QA processes, the team has added test and refactoring feature_block.py, fixed fuzz binary compilation under windows, improved macro for testing -latomic requirement, and disabled deprecated-copy warning only when external warnings are enabled. The team has also made various other improvements and bug fixes, including updating documentation, replacing `getmempoolentry` with `testmempoolaccept` in MiniWallet, and consolidating fuzzing TestingSetup initialization.Overall, these updates represent significant progress in improving the Bitcoin network's functionality and security. They demonstrate ongoing efforts to optimize and update the codebase, making it more robust and secure for end-users. Version 0.21.1 has also been released, featuring various improvements and bug fixes. It is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.14+, and Windows 7 and newer, but it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems. From Bitcoin Core 22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported.</summary>
