    <title>Braidpool: Proposal for a decentralised mining pool</title>

    <summary>In a recent email to the Bitcoin development mailing list, ZmnSCPxj pointed out that Braidpool's payout server is still a single central point-of-failure despite claims of using Tor hidden service to protect against DDoS attacks. This would leave the system vulnerable to accidents, war, or other unforeseeable events. The paper relies on economic arguments as a safeguard, but this may not be enough in a monopoly where hashers might tolerate minor issues with the hub to let the pool continue. ZmnSCPxj suggests that multiple hubs would be preferable if possible, and mentions Chris Belcher's original proposal for using payment channels as a construction for multiple hubs. Decentralizing hubs is the end goal, but Belcher's idea has the added advantage of reducing required liquidity at each hub as more hubs join. As Braidpool is built, more ideas for decentralization will likely emerge. However, it may be more beneficial to get something working now instead of waiting for the perfect solution.</summary>
