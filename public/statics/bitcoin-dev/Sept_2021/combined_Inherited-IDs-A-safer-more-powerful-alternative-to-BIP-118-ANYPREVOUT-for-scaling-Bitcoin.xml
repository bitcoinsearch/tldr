    <summary>John Law has proposed a new method called Inherited IDs (IIDs) as an alternative to BIP-118. The IID proposal is a softfork that alters signature rules for calculating certain signatures and supports signatures that commit to the parent transaction's IID instead of its transaction ID. IIDs do not allow floating transactions but they are safer and more scalable than those proposed in BIP-118. Transactions signed using IIDs cannot be used more than once or in an unanticipated location, thus making them much safer than a floating transaction. The proposal includes a protocol called "2stage" which enables fast closing of channels with two participants, eliminating the need for watchtowers. Additionally, IIDs support channel factories that are far more scalable and powerful than any previously proposed channel factories. These channel factory protocols make critical use of IIDs and do not appear to be possible with BIP-118.However, the IID proposal does not support the eltoo protocol, but it does support a 2-party channel protocol called 2Stage that has constant worst-case on-chain costs. To make channel factories work in this model, invalidation trees have been introduced to allow updating the split of funds between groups of participants. A hierarchy of update transactions is proposed to reduce delays substantially. The proposal is being compared to eltoo and statechains with special consideration given to two-party channels.Implementing the "iid" concept would require adding information to the UTXO database, possibly resulting in a 1.4GB increase to the database, but iid transactions are expected to be uncommon and short-lived. John has provided three options for how IIDs could be added to Bitcoin via a softfork. If anyone finds the IID proposal valuable, they are requested to pick the best option (or invent an even better option) for adding IIDs to Bitcoin and create a BIP for that option.References have been provided for BIP-118, scaling Bitcoin with Inherited IDs by John Law, eltoo, the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and scalable funding of Bitcoin micropayment channel networks. Acknowledgments have been given to Ruben Somsen and Jeremy Rubin for their helpful comments, and to Bob McElrath for his original brainstorm that led to the creation of the IID concept.John has informed that he has posted some responses in his Github repository regarding btc-iids. It is suggested to respond to him through Github issue or similar platforms. The link to his Github repo is https://github.com/JohnLaw2/btc-iids.</summary>
