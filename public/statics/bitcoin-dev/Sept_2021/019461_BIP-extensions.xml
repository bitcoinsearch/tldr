    <summary>A member named Michael Folkson is pushing for a revision to BIP 2, which is being discussed in the "BIP process meeting" thread. There's a wiki page with ideas for this and the current plan is to modify pull request #1015 or some other pull request to reflect what everyone decides. Karl-Johan Alm proposed that changes to BIPs of the second and third type are done as BIP extensions. BIP extensions do not require the approval of the extended-upon BIP's author, and are considered independent proposals entirely. By making extensions to BIPs, rather than modifying them long after review, they are giving the community the assurance that a BIP will mostly remain in its form forever, except if an obvious win is discovered, the ability to judge modifications to BIPs, such as activation parameters, on their merits alone, and the path to propose modifications to BIPs even if their authors have gone inactive and cease to provide feedback.</summary>
