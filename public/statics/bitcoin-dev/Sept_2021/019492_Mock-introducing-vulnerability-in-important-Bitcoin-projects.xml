    <summary>The email thread discusses an answer on Bitcoin StackExchange about companies potentially hiring individuals to introduce backdoors in Bitcoin Core. The writer suggests preparing for such situations and mentions a link shared in the comments in which vulnerabilities were almost introduced in Linux. They propose creating new GitHub accounts, studying issues in important Bitcoin projects, preparing pull requests to introduce vulnerabilities, and documenting the responses of maintainers and reviewers. The email also includes advice on how to protect one's identity and intentions while conducting this exercise.</summary>
