    <summary>A developer named Riccardo Casatta has written the Rust implementation of Bitcoin signature messages and created some test vectors to double-check. These test vectors can be found on GitHub. Meanwhile, Giacomo Caironi has worked on a Python implementation of Bitcoin signature messages and noticed that there is better documentation for Segwit signature message than Taproot. He suggests creating a different BIP only for Taproot signature message instead of defining it in BIP 341 and keeping the test vectors in a different BIP. The test vectors for Taproot have no documentation and are not atomic, which makes debugging difficult. In contrast, BIP 143 provides hash preimages for debugging the function in Segwit signature hash. Caironi is willing to write the test cases for Taproot if his idea is accepted. This is his first time contributing to Bitcoin and he apologizes if he wrote something wrong due to English being his second language.</summary>
