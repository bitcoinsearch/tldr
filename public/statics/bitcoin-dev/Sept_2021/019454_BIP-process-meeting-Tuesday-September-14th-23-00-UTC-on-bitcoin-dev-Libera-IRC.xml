    <summary>A proposal shared on bitcoin-dev mailing list can be considered a BIP, and anyone can create directories for them. A mailing list post is static, while a BIP goes through multiple edits and revisions. The Git version control system can help with that. It would be unwieldy to attempt this via a mailing list. There is no need to worry about the perception of authority in the bitcoin/bips repository. There needs to be a central repository for all BIPs, managed by the two BIP editors Kalle and Luke. A bot could notify maintainers and contributors about pull requests based on different things. Prayank created a BIP Gallery project to help newbies understand the importance of BIPs in Bitcoin. However, it wasn't well-received, and some suggestions were made to improve it. Greater use of informational BIPs may be useful for new implementers or casual readers.</summary>
