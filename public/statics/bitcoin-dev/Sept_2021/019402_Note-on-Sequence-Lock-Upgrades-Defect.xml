    <summary>Jeremy, a member of the Bitcoin Dev community, noticed a flaw in the Sequence lock implementation regarding upgradability. He questions whether this is protected against by some transaction level policy or not and provides a blog post explaining the defect and patching it. Another member, Dave, suggests that this could be resolved by using tx.version=2 and deploying new nSequence rules with tx.version&gt;2.</summary>
