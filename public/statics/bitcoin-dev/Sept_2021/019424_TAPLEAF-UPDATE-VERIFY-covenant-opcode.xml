    <summary>The author expresses interest in a proposal and responds to Matt's comment that more covenants research is needed before moving forward with any. The author compares Coin/Payment Pools with CTV and finds that CTV has an advantage in terms of chain load and privacy. They then do basic math to compare the space utilization efficiency of TLUV and CTV in trustlessly withdrawing all participants, finding that CTV is about five times more efficient. The protocols are identical in the cooperative case. In terms of privacy, CTV is slightly worse, but it might be reasonable to assume that uncooperative counterparties might dox you anyways. CTV trees are also superior during updates for privacy in the cooperative case. CTV's TXID stability also lets you embed payment channels easier. The author finds it exciting to think about payment pools where every node is an updatable channel.</summary>
