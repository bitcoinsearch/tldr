    <summary>Stratum v2 and its benefits have been discussed in comparison to other mining methods. The protocol is designed to help miners with encryption, broadcasting new blocks, signaling bits, and choosing transaction sets. However, it has been noted that mining pools still have the ability to reject negotiations and censor payments. There are also suggestions that Stratum v2 could be used in combination with other technologies, such as discreet log contracts, which may provide additional benefits. The email linked proposes this idea. Ultimately, there is a belief that Braidpool does a better job than Stratum v2 in addressing these issues, but further exploration into the topic is needed.</summary>
