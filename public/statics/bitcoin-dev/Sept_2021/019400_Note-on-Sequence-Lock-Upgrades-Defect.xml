    <summary>A Bitcoin developer named Jeremy Rubin has discovered a flaw in the Sequence lock implementation with respect to upgradability. He has proposed a patch for this flaw on Github and has also written a blog post explaining the defect and how to fix it. However, before implementing the patch, he suggests that the community should be widely surveyed to ensure that no one is depending on the current semantics in any live application, which could cause a confiscatory effect. It is not clear if there are any transaction level policies protecting against this flaw.</summary>
