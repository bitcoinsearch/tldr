    <summary>There is a discussion about whether Stacks is a Bitcoin sidechain or not. The opinion is that it is not, as it has its own native token which is not pegged to BTC and was premined. Stacks uses Bitcoin as a storage and broadcast medium for recording all blocks. However, some believe that the marketing of Stacks contains a lot of misinformation and ultimately, none of these things benefit Bitcoin.</summary>
