    <summary>The largest pool is known to be the most profitable, however, centralized pools are easily controlled. Decoupling selection without decoupling payout is considered an engineering change that does not affect pooling pressure change. Eric Voskuil mentioned that payment centralization ultimately controls transaction selection leading to censorship. In response, David A. Harding stated that if one gets paid after each share via LN and can switch pools instantly, the worst case scenario with centralized pools is not getting paid for one share. If the hasher sets their share difficulty low enough, then it shouldn't be a big deal. David A. Harding expressed interest in whether braidpool offers any significant benefits over an idealized version of centralized mining with independent transaction selection.</summary>
