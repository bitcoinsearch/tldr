    <summary>In this context, the issue of a malicious miner cheating other miners of their reward is discussed. The malicious miner broadcasts {m1, m2 ... mn} at regular intervals and also broadcasts {m1*, mn*} where mn* is the bitcoin block. The problem arises as the bitcoin block is used as the sentinel to mark the shares from DAG that need to be rewarded. This issue can be resolved by having the hub broadcast a "sentinel" to mark out the point in logical time up to which shares will be rewarded.</summary>
