    <summary>In a recent revelation, it has been noted that Braidpool's payout server remains a single central point of failure. While the paper claims to use Tor hidden service to protect against DDoS attacks, this centrality cannot protect against sheer accidents. The paper relies on economic arguments, but economic arguments tend to be less powerful in a monopoly, and the hub effectively has a monopoly on all Braidpool miners. Hashers might tolerate minor peccadilloes of the hub, simply to let the pool continue. It would be ideal to use multiple hubs if possible. The Lightning model could be considered where multiple hubs offer liquidity to the Braidpool network, hashers measure uptime and timeliness of payouts, and the winning hasher elects one of the hubs. However, this design may be too complicated, and it may be more beneficial to get something working now instead of waiting for the perfect solution.</summary>
