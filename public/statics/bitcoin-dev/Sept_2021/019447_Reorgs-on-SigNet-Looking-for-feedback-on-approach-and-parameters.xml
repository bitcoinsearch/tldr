    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin development email thread, AJ proposed an opt-out option for SigNet users in case they want to remain unaffected by reorgs. The proposal involves setting a version bit to distinguish valid-but-will-become-stale blocks from invalid blocks. However, Matt Corallo pointed out that this approach seems more complicated than the original proposal of having a different reorg signing key. Anthony Towns explained that there were two problems with the original idea, one being that the signet block signature encodes the signet challenge. To avoid discouraging/disconnecting logic, nodes that opt-out of reorgs need to distinguish between valid-but-will-become-stale blocks and invalid blocks, which can be achieved through the use of a versionbit.The reorg-interval on SigNet varies depending on user needs. While some argue for frequent reorgs to allow developers in different time zones to test their reorgs, too frequent reorgs could hinder other SigNet users. Matt Corallo suggested that it would be practical to reorg every block or as often as possible for users who opt-in to testing with reorgs. However, Anthony Towns clarified that blocks on signet are mined at a similar rate to mainnet, so users may still have to wait up to an hour. Nevertheless, some developers find that the slow and irregular blocks on SigNet make it less beneficial than testnet3/mainnet testing.</summary>
