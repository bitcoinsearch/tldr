    <summary>The email exchange between Prayank and ZmnSCPxj discusses the differences between federated sidechains and Drivechains. Federated sidechains are custodial and use a predetermined signing set for their federation, while Drivechains use mainchain miners as custodians. The security parameter for Drivechains can determine how easily sidechain funds can be confiscated by a 51% attacker, leading to slower sidechain-&gt;mainchain withdrawals. It is suggested that if sidechains are for prototyping new features, it may be better to create a federation with developer friends. In terms of scaling, creating more blockchains may not be the best solution. A 2-of-2 federation with atomic swap mechanisms is proposed as an alternative, which is similar to Lightning Network. Links to information on LND, Liquid, and Rootstock are also provided.</summary>
