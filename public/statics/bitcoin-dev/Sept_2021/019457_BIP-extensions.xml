    <summary>Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are proposals that begin as ideas, are formulated and discussed on the BIPs repository list, then assigned a number by editors and merged. Once entities place their weight behind a BIP, it becomes a standard. BIPs are modified for spelling errors or to improve on their description without changing what is proposed, to improve the proposal in some way after discussion or feedback, or to add missing content such as an activation strategy. It is proposed that changes of the second and third type, unless they are free from contention, should be done as BIP extensions. These are considered independent proposals entirely and do not require the approval of the original author. An extension that extends on BIP XXX is referred to as BIP-XXX-Y. By making extensions to BIPs, instead of modifying them long after review, the community can be assured that a BIP will mostly remain in its form forever, modifications to BIPs can be judged on their merits alone, and there is a path to propose modifications to BIPs even if their authors have gone inactive and cease to provide feedback.</summary>
