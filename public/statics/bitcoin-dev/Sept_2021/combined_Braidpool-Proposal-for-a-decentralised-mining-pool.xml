    <summary>In recent discussions on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, several topics related to decentralized mining pools have been discussed. The Pool2Win team proposed a decentralized solution called Braidpool, which uses a DAG of shares replicated at all miners and pays out rewards using one-way payment channels via Tor's hidden services. While the proposal aims to address issues faced by P2Pool and facilitate building a futures market for hashrate, concerns were raised about a miner's incentive to not reference other miners' shares in their own shares, potentially rendering the pool unprofitable for good miners. Additionally, the issue of conflict resolution was discussed, with two possible methods presented: using the longest chain or the chain with the most work. However, both methods have limitations.There were also discussions comparing the advantages of a decentralized mining pool using BetterHash or StratumV2 with payouts made via Lightning Network (LN) to a centralized mining pool. The key difference between the two approaches is that a decentralized pool does not centralize payment, which ultimately controls transaction selection (censorship). While the use of LN for payouts can be beneficial in terms of speed and cost, it still relies on a centralized authority to select and validate transactions.The email exchanges also touched on issues related to centralized mining control and payment censorship. Voskuil argued that centralization of payment ultimately controls transaction selection and results in censorship. However, Dave countered this argument by suggesting that if miners were paid after each share via LN and could switch pools instantly, then the worst case scenario with centralized pools would be not getting paid for one share. Dave also expressed interest in whether braidpool offers any significant benefits over an idealized version of centralized mining with independent transaction selection.Finally, there were concerns raised about Braidpool's payout server remaining a single point of failure, despite claims of protection against DDoS attacks via Tor hidden service. Suggestions were made to use multiple hubs to reduce the risk of a single point of failure, with the Lightning model being proposed as one possible solution. However, it was acknowledged that getting something working now may be more beneficial than waiting for a perfect solution.Braidpool is a proposed decentralized mining pool that aims to overcome the issues faced by P2Pool and facilitate building a futures market for hashrate. Braidpool offers several key features, including lower variance for smaller miners even when large miners join the pool, miners building their own blocks just like in P2Pool, payouts requiring a constant size blockspace independent of the number of miners in the pool, and providing building blocks for enabling a futures market of hash rates. The developers note that Bitcoin P2Pool's usage has steadily declined over the years, negatively impacting Bitcoin's decentralization. They propose a solution that uses a DAG of shares replicated at all miners, which is then used to compute rewards for miners. Rewards are paid out using one-way payment channels by an anonymous hub communicating with the miners using Tor's hidden services.However, concerns have been raised about the centralization of Braidpool's payout server, which remains a single point of failure despite claims of using Tor hidden service to protect against DDoS attacks. This would leave the system vulnerable to accidents, war, or other unforeseeable events. The paper relies on economic arguments as a safeguard, but this may not be enough in a monopoly where hashers might tolerate minor issues with the hub to let the pool continue. Suggestions have been made to use multiple hubs to reduce the risk of a single point of failure, with one idea being a Lightning model where multiple hubs offer liquidity to the network, and the winning hasher elects one of the hubs to receive the payout.In addition, there have been discussions about the proposal that every share can reference more than one previous share. Concerns have been raised that a rogue miner could avoid referencing other miners' shares to keep the rewards for themselves, rendering the pool unprofitable for good miners. The issue of resolving conflicts between conflicting versions of the DAG is also raised, with two methods proposed: using either the longest chain or the one with more work. However, both methods present issues. ZmnSCPxj suggests that in the Braidpool system, every share can reference multiple previous shares, so a good hasher will refer not only to their own shares but also to those of a "bad" hasher. Honest hashers will base their decisions on the share that refers to the most total work rather than a single chain.Overall, Braidpool is viewed as an improvement to P2Pool in terms of making a peer-to-peer pool work on a larger scale. In contrast, Stratum v2 brings many engineering improvements to centralized pools. However, the pool still controls both accepting a proposed block and refusing payouts. Centralized pools that use PPLNS are opaque, making it difficult for smaller miners to view shares received by the pool and ensure fair reward calculation. Braidpool offers transparent views of shares received by the pool</summary>
