    <summary>A proposed change has been made to Bitcoin-compatible client software that would force a full node to shut down automatically if MTP-11 exceeds 5 years of the software release date. This code is intended to give the community approximately 5 years to upgrade to a new version that executes a new hard fork while keeping everyone in consensus, provided the change implemented is non-controversial. The purpose of this code is to ensure that all nodes are updated and running on the latest version of the software, thus maintaining consensus among participants.Bitcoin-compatible client software can be changed, but there is no guarantee that others will run that version or shut down when desired. Miners often use custom software for mining blocks and pools, and there are many clients compatible with consensus, but different than Bitcoin Core. The Bitcoin community typically makes changes using soft-forks to preserve backward compatibility. Even "evil soft-forks" are possible, which are still better than hard-forks.On September 12th, 2021, James Lu via bitcoin-dev proposed a change where if MTP-11 is greater than 5 years after the release date of the current software version, the full node should automatically shut down. This proposal aims to allow for code to be written that gives the community approximately 5 years to upgrade to a version that executes a new hard fork while keeping everyone in consensus, provided the change is non-controversial. By implementing this code, it is expected that all nodes will eventually be updated and running on the latest version of the software, ensuring consensus among the participants.</summary>
