    <summary>Mike Rosset, a developer, posted a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list seeking help with inconsistencies he encountered while experimenting with Bitcoin using GNU Guile Scheme. He created a toy Bitcoin miner and attempted to create templates for the Merkle root by concatenating transactions data. However, he was unable to create the coinbase transaction without the json cointbasetxn field in getblocktemplate. He requested assistance in acquiring the coinbase transaction and ensuring that his Python and Guile Merkle roots matched. Mike provided a test template response data and a modified version of the merkle python reference script found on the wiki page. With it, he was able to replicate a Merkle root hash, but it did not include the coinbase transaction.</summary>
