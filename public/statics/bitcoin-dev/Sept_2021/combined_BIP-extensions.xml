    <summary>Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are proposals that begin as ideas and are formulated and discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Once entities place their weight behind a BIP, it becomes a standard. There has been a discussion among Bitcoin developers on the status of BIPs. Some developers suggested that BIPs should be called "standards" once they are incorporated into the Bitcoin ecosystem, but others disagreed, arguing that a proposal is still a proposal until it is accepted as a standard by the community.The discussion then moved to how to improve BIPs. Karl-Johan Alm proposed creating BIP extensions instead of modifying existing BIPs long after review, which can cause contention. BIP extensions are separate BIPs that extend an existing BIP and do not require the approval of the original author. By making extensions to BIPs, instead of modifying them long after review, the community can be assured that a BIP will mostly remain in its form forever. However, other developers expressed concern that this approach could obstruct the BIP process and encourage contentiousness.As an alternative, it was suggested that draft BIPs be separated from those in Active/Final status. A new BIP would be marked as a "Draft" until authors are happy with the text, at which point it becomes a Final status BIP without modification. The suggestion was made to avoid making modifications outside of drafts unless absolutely necessary, and only allow adding additional info in Acknowledgements or See also sections, adding Superseded-By links, and updating additional tables designed to be updated.Karl-Johan Alm has suggested that changes to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be done as BIP extensions. BIPs are proposals formulated and discussed on the bitcoin-dev list before being turned into pull requests to the bips repository, assigned a BIP number by the editors, and merged. By making extensions to BIPs rather than modifying them long after review, the community is given assurances that a BIP will mostly remain in its form forever. This allows the ability to judge modifications to BIPs on their merits alone and provides a path to propose modifications to BIPs even if their authors have gone inactive and cease to provide feedback.Federico Berrone supported Alm's proposal and suggested that additional information can be added in a separate piece to de-clutter BIPs and make proposals more understandable without modifying the original proposal. The proposed method ensures that IPs from those in Active/Final status are considered, avoiding modifications, and allowing only minor updates. In conclusion, the debate surrounding BIPs centers around how to ensure that proposals are fully evaluated and reviewed before being accepted as standards in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Some developers suggest creating BIP extensions to avoid contention, while others argue for separating draft BIPs from those in Active/Final status, avoiding modifications, and allowing only minor updates. Michael Folkson is pushing for a revision to BIP 2, which is being discussed in the "BIP process meeting" thread.</summary>
