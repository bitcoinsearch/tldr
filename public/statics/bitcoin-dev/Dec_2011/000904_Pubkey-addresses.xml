    <summary>In this email conversation, Wladimir and Luke-Jr are discussing the idea of standardizing and supporting public key addresses. While Luke-Jr acknowledges that these addresses may not be ideal for humans due to their length, he believes they would be a better fit for large QR codes. Wladimir sees no reason why public key addresses couldn't be another, longer address type in the blockchain. He suggests that this could allow for shorter transactions. The email thread ends with a promotional message from Microsoft about an upcoming training event for developers to learn about Windows Azure.</summary>
