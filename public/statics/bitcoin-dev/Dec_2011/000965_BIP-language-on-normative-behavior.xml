    <summary>Luke-Jr and Amir Taaki were discussing the acceptance of bitcoin URI in the standard. Amir had previously contacted IANA and had to read five large documents as a prerequisite. He did not end up writing the RFC. Luke also contacted IANA but never heard back. Luke requested that whoever Amir discussed it with should get in touch with him, and whatever they index should be compliant with the spec on the wiki as-is. This is especially important because it should not be BTC unit specific, which is non-scalable.</summary>
