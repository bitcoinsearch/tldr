    <summary>The speaker was at brmlab, and wanted to pay for a Club Mate using bitcoin. As they did not have a mobile phone, the QR code on the wall was useless to them. They then remembered FirstBits, an online service that translates names to bitcoin addresses. Using their terminal, they typed in 1brmlab and received the bitcoin address from the website, which they copied and pasted into their terminal to send 1 BTC. The conversation then moves on to discussing the usefulness of FirstBits. The other party suggests that if FirstBits did not exist, the speaker would have simply gone to brmlab's website and copied the address from there. They argue that the example used by the speaker does not demonstrate the usefulness of FirstBits, as it did not save any effort.</summary>
