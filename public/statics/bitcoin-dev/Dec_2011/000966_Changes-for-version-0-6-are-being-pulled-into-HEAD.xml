    <summary>On December 20, 2011, Gavin Andresen wrote that he had been busy pulling patches into git HEAD for a Bitcoin version 0.6, with the goal of having a Release Candidate 1 out in a couple of weeks. He also mentioned that he had rebuilt his 'next' and 'next-test' branches. The post included details about various merges that had been accepted, were ready for acceptance, needed review, or could not be merged cleanly. There were also some patches that had not yet been written, including one about treating generation almost like normal receive and another about JSON-RPC with integer amounts. The post contained links to various pull requests and branches on gitorious.org.</summary>
