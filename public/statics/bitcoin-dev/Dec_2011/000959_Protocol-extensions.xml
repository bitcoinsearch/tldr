    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Jordan Mack and Stefan Thomas discussed the idea of adding anonymity to Bitcoin via an extra layer. However, Wladimir J. van der Laan, a Bitcoin Core developer, advised against rolling out an onion network for Bitcoin due to the non-trivial nature of getting security and anonymity to an acceptable level. Instead, he suggested using Tor because of its mixing effect and the ability to integrate Tor functionality into the client itself at some point. He also proposed making a "bitcoin tor bundle", analogous to the firefox Tor bundle available on the Tor site. However, packaging the blockchain with it would be necessary as downloading that over Tor takes ages and causes unnecessary load on the network.</summary>
