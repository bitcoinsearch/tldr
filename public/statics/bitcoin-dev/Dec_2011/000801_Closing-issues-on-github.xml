    <summary>Over the weekend, old GitHub issues that was no longer reproducible or needed input from the submitter were closed. Some of the issues that dealt purely with Wx UI issues such as bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/425 were also closed since the old UI was no longer supported. The question was raised if anyone wanted to take up maintenance of the old UI, but it was deemed unnecessary and not a priority for the main project. Although some of the older issues are still relevant, there were 150+ open issues which was not ideal. The writer wondered how other open source projects deal with this without stepping on others' toes.</summary>
