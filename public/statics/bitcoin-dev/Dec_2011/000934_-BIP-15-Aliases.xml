    <summary>In a conversation that took place on December 18, 2011, slush questioned the usefulness of providing aliases in URLs containing another hash. The extended URI allows servers to negotiate payment details such as payment and order information, fees, and privacy address instead of sending a simple payment to a fixed address. However, without CA trust, the use of aliases may not be practical. An organization can opt to leave off the address portion to provide more human-friendly URIs if they trust a CA with all their funds.</summary>
