    <summary>In a conversation dated December 8, 2011, Stefan Thomas and Dr. Andy Parkins discussed Bitcoin's ability to reject transactions based on the reversal of outputs. They also talked about the limitations of hosted wallets that depend on services that can get tricky, leading to the problem of what happens when a transaction is financially dependent but not technically. The MyBitcoin debacle was cited as an example of this issue. Hosted wallets were suggested to keep each account as separate public keys for better risk isolation. However, Dr. Parkins raised concerns about the one-to-one correspondence between address and account as it is highly identifiable and trackable, and all funds would have to be kept online.</summary>
