    <summary>On December 21, 2011, Luke-Jr posted a message indicating that a change had been accepted for the 0.6 version of an unknown software or system. However, Jeff Garzik replied, stating that the change was not accepted as discussed the previous day on IRC. Garzik advised Luke-Jr to find buy-in from other miners to ensure that the change was what "they" wanted, rather than just what Luke-Jr wanted.</summary>
