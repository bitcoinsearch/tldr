    <summary>In a discussion post, Gavin Andresen urges everyone to focus on the issues and avoid turning it into a flame war. He praises Walter Stanish for bringing up several good points that may have been missed in previous discussions. Stanish emphasized that the banking industry has been dealing with many of these issues for years and their experience should not be dismissed. Andresen agrees that there is a huge public relations benefit to using a standard like IIBAN instead of inventing their own. He believes that a Bitcoin Payment Routing Address that looks like the number issued by big financial institutions will give people more confidence. Andresen doesn't care about what happens behind the scenes as long as it is secure. He compares it to HTTPS connections that are not perfect but are the best we have. He also reiterates that there does not have to be just one solution. However, he expresses concern that the IIBAN is yet another fledgling standard and the remaining details could take years to work out.</summary>
