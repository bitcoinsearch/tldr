    <summary>The discussion around using distributed hash tables (DHTs) for transactions took place on the Bitcointalk forum and there were concerns about the security of such a scheme from Sybil attacks. Gavin Andresen, who participated in the discussion, expressed concern about adding protocol messages for lightweight clients that could potentially make it easier to carry out denial-of-service attacks on full nodes. He also speculated whether full nodes may eventually refuse requests from lightweight nodes, which could present a tragedy-of-the-commons problem.</summary>
