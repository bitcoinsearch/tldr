    <summary>It is important to consider the susceptibility of a DOS attack on a publicly available alias system. In the case that an alias lookup triggers the creation of a new Bitcoin address, the private key would need to be retained indefinitely. This could potentially consume a significant amount of resources over time if left unnoticed. Unlike other types of data such as system logs, this private key information cannot be easily pruned. It is worth noting that this vulnerability could pose a threat to the security and stability of the system in question. Therefore, it is crucial to take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk of a DOS attack on a publicly available alias system.</summary>
