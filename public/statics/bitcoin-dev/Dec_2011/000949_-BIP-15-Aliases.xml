    <summary>The discussion is about the payload format to be used for a proposal of Bitcoin URIs with "amount", "label" and other parts. The author, Slush, believes that there is no need for any extra payload format like JSON or XML. In his opinion, all that is needed is an address in response and potentially some HTTP redirects to provide additional compatibility. On the other hand, Jordan Mack suggests that using JSON would make it easier for developers to implement the proposal quickly and easily. He also argues that using HTTP for data interchange with multipart responses would be difficult for many developers. Overall, the debate centers on the best way to keep the proposal simple and easy to implement while ensuring compatibility and ease of use for developers.</summary>
