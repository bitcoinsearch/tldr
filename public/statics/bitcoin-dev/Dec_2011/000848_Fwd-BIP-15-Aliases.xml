    <summary>In this context, there is a conversation between two individuals. One of them suggests to send something to an email address containing the word "bitcoin". The other person points out that it is not a valid URI. The first person seems confused and asks for clarification. The second person responds by giving an analogy. They ask if when someone tells you to check out a web page, do you simply type the web address into your browser or do you use the link provided by the person? This seems to be their way of explaining why a valid URI is important. Overall, the conversation seems to be about the importance of using correct formats and links when sharing information, particularly in the context of digital communication.</summary>
