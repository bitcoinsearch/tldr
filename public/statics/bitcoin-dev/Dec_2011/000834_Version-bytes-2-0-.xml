    <summary>The conversation is about the merging of Matts change. However, the issue is how people will find out about this capability as expecting them to hand-craft Bitcoin links won't work. To solve this, an easy UI could be created using Qt which supports copy/paste and drag/drop of rich content. Clicking on the link in the UI would prompt an alert showing options to drag the link to an email, chat window or editing program. This idea can be integrated with QR-code generation that adds "create a payment link" functionality. Currently, it exports the link as a QR code. Wladimir suggests this as a good idea.</summary>
