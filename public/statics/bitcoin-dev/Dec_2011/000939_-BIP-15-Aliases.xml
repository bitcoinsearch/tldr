    <summary>In a discussion on using HTTPS for Bitcoin, Jorge Tim√≥n suggests that HTTPS may not be the best option due to potential attacks, but asks if a warning message could be added. However, Dr. Andy Parkins points out that the issue with HTTPS is more social than technical, as multiple Certificate Authorities (CAs) have been coerced or scammed into issuing fake certificates. The use of a CA certificate implies trust in the issuer, and currently there are too many CAs with misplaced trust. While this problem is outside of Bitcoin's scope, Dr. Parkins suggests restricting the trusted CA certificates to those with good identity verification practices rather than having pre-installed trust in browsers.</summary>
