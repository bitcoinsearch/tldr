    <summary>In an email from Michael Grønager on December 22, 2011, he discusses the importance of monitoring peers in a network to ensure they are actively participating in validation work. He argues that allowing nodes to choose to verify at random can lead to lazy implementations where nodes do not participate in validation work but still benefit from others' announcements. In contrast, monitoring peers in the hash space part allows for identification and disconnection of malicious or lazy nodes. Grønager acknowledges that forcing nodes not to be lazy is impossible, but emphasizes the importance of truthful reporting when they do engage in verification work. Andy Parkins agrees with Grønager's stance, noting that no node should be forced to do work it does not want to do, but should be held accountable for honest reporting.</summary>
