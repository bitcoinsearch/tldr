    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin-development mailing list revolves around the adoption of a standard like IIBAN for Bitcoin payment routing address instead of inventing their own. The banking industry has experience in dealing with such issues, and participants should focus on the issues/ideas rather than a flame war. Standards take time to develop but allow additional participation and drive interoperability. IBANN is not the end of the discussion; it's just a starting point. The use of established standards like IIBAN would give people the warm fuzzies, and it is as secure as an HTTPS connection. There does not have to be just one solution, but the concern is that IIBAN is yet another fledgling standard, and those little details that remain to be worked out could take years to work out. Microsoft held a special Learn Windows Azure training event for developers to learn more about Windows Azure and what it provides.</summary>
