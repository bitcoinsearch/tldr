    <summary>On December 19, 2011, Gregory Maxwell and Luke-JR had a discussion on IRC regarding BIP_0014. The argument arose due to Gavin's recent commit which had used the same version string for both the GUI interface and the daemon mode. Luke believed that this was a violation of BIP_0014 and an error in judgement on Gavin's part as it failed to conform to the community-adopted standard. However, he clarified that he believes lying about the client is a violation.Gavin's commit intentionally reports "bitcoin-qt" for bitcoind, which is not compliant. Luke further stated that there isn't anything that says a version must be reported at all, let alone for a specific component, so it could comply by leaving that part off. But if there is a common part, it certainly isn't Bitcoin-Qt. A fix was presented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715 which would fulfil everyone's desires.Gavin wanted security by obscurity by making bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt indistinguishable, and this would be achieved with pull #715.</summary>
