    <summary>The author of the context believes that if alias resolution was solely based on the address, then there may not be a need for serialization. The plain text response of an address would suffice. However, there are ideas about extending the alias protocol and the author is concerned about future backward compatibility issues. They suggest having a serialized response upfront to avoid such issues. A forum post from 2011 by user slush agrees with keeping things simple and suggests that a payload format may not be necessary. Instead, all that is required is an address in response and potentially HTTP redirects for additional compatibility for proposals of bitcoin URIs with "amount", "label" and other parts.</summary>
