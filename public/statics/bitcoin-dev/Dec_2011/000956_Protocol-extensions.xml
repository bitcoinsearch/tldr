    <summary>In a conversation on 12/18/2011, Stefan Thomas suggested that those who desire anonymity should connect through Tor or Freenet rather than adding an extra layer of anonymity at the protocol level. He argued that it is easy to add anonymity via an extra layer, but impossible to add performance on top of a slow system. The suggestion was well-received and deemed unnecessary complication at the protocol level. Alternatives such as Tor could be used to provide the desired effect of anonymity. Developers could even integrate Tor functionality into the client itself in the future.</summary>
