    <summary>The proposal suggests combining the DNSSEC TXT record and HTTPS proposals to get the advantages of both. The DNSSEC TXT record would provide instructions on how to query an HTTPS server for the address, which would provide dynamism without a rigid URL scheme for querying the server. The context includes an email conversation from December 14th, 2011 between Rick Wesson and Luke-Jr regarding the use of secured zones to publish TXT records to digital currencies, with Rick in favor of using TXT records in this way and Luke-Jr emphasizing the importance of using a new address for every transaction. The conversation is part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list and also includes a link to tips for better server consolidation.</summary>
