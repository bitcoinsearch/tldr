    <summary>In a discussion about the use of HTTP standard and bloating payload with JSON/XML, Luke argues that the HTTP standard is sufficient and that using JSON/XML is unnecessary. Another person, Jordan Mack, notes that JSON support is fairly common but personally prefers XML in most cases. He also points out that since JSON is already being used with server RPC, it seems like a natural fit here. However, he questions the need to send back binary data in an alias response and suggests using base64 encoding for such cases. It is also mentioned that using JSON to solve certain problems on the server side can lead to issues with data types.</summary>
