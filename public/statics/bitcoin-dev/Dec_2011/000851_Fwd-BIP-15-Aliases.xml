    <summary>The internet standard DNSSEC is widely deployed in the root, many TLDs, ccTLDs and second level domains. It takes at least 20 years for the IETF or ICANN to adopt new standards. Using secured zones, TXT records can be published to digital currencies like bitcoin. The format for bitcoin could be "_btc." followed by the user's domain name. It has been suggested that "bitcoin://" could be specified to make it easier for software to detect a bitcoin address when going to a URL. This could be optional in the bitcoin client and replaced by http. Parameters for the client could also be added, such as specifying an amount or green address list. Bitcoin URIs are being planned by the community.</summary>
