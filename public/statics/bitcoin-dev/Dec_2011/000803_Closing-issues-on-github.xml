    <summary>It has been suggested that someone could take up the task of backporting to wx 2.8 for wxBitcoin. However, it is no longer considered an issue for the main project. The term "main project" refers to the issue list of bitcoin/bitcoin project on Github, which only deals with that project and not its forks. It is argued that there should be no centralization mindset as there are various forks, including bitcoind, wxBitcoin, Bitcoin-Qt, and MultiBit, each with their own issue lists. Despite this, the message is not an official document deciding the future of bitcoin.</summary>
