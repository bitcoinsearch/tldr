    <summary>The discussion is centered around finding a secure and easy solution for Bitcoin payment addresses. HTTP is not considered secure, while HTTPS may need a warning message due to possible attacks. The use of Namecoin as a host identifier is deemed the most secure but integrating it with clients may be difficult. Using Namecoin to directly specify payment addresses is not recommended. JSON is suggested as an answer format, but a negotiating protocol like what luke-jr proposes is preferred. Slush agrees that an easy solution is needed for daily use, but for high-value transactions, asking for the real Bitcoin address is the most secure option available.</summary>
