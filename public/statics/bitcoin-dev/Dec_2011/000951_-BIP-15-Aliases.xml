    <summary>The conversation starts with a person expressing confusion over how binary data fits into the process of alias resolution. They were under the impression that it would be a simple HTTP request and response. Another person responds by stating that computers work with binary and that implementing a fully functional script assembler just to send funds isn't practical. They also mention that JSON-RPC won't last forever and that bitcoind's use of it has highlighted the poor support for JSON in many common languages. Despite this, another person argues that JSON-RPC still serves a purpose in terms of developer accessibility. If support for it is removed, a large pool of high level language developers will be lost. They suggest that even if it remains as a secondary protocol with limited capability, it should not be dropped entirely. Most high level developers are only going to use it for basic functions anyway.</summary>
