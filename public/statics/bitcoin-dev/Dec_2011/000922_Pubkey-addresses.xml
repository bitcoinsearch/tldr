    <summary>In a discussion on December 18, 2011 at 9:28:36 AM, Jorge Tim√≥n asked whether putting the whole pub key in each output was being proposed. The response was affirmative, stating that it would be more efficient overall for the blockchain. However, sipa's key extraction was regarded as a much better solution. If this could be achieved without a blockchain fork, it would be preferred.</summary>
