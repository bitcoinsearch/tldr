    <summary>During a discussion about URLs, Walter Stanish proposes that third-party hosted services are more likely to provide aliasing resolution for bitcoin addresses. He suggests that alias resolution services will operate on an alias at provider mechanism such as IIBAN and its "institution" codes. However, he questions why the proposed URLs cannot simply be formatted as bitcoin://url.without.explicitly.specifying.provider, bitcoin://alias@provider or bitcoin://IIBAN@authorizedBitcoinInstitution. Additionally, Walter expresses his dislike for the idea of a single authorized institution mapping IIBANs to Bitcoin addresses.</summary>
