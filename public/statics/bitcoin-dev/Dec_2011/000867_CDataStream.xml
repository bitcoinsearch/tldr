    <summary>A user has requested for an update in the CDataStream test table of the code as the arguments for the custom stream are incorrect. The user has mentioned that stringstream is faster than CDataStream by a factor of 10-20% and has provided a comparison chart between the two on OS X (g++). The user also suggests that changing the default allocation chunk size can improve bad stringstream numbers on Windows. The user has added that speed is not a reason for reimplementing stringstream and has asked for the output on other OS' as well. The serialize.h file with TESTCDATASTREAM defined shows that CDataStream takes longer than stringstream to execute, as per the chart mentioned in the request.</summary>
