    <summary>In a conversation on December 19, 2011, Jordan Mack suggested that HTTPS should be used as a minimum standard for Bitcoin websites dealing with financials, and that TLS/SSL should be required in some form. He also shared his preference for XML over JSON, despite the latter being commonly used with the RPC. However, he acknowledged that most languages have a library for JSON, but they often have one issue or another. Similarly, XML shares the same binary-data problem as JSON. In response to a question about sending back binary in an alias response, it was noted that computers work with binary, and no one wants to implement a fully functional script assembler just to send funds. Finally, when asked about a custom output script, a link was shared to a resource providing information about how Bitcoin works.</summary>
