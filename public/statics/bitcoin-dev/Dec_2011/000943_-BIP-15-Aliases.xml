    <summary>In a discussion on December 19, 2011, Bitcoin developer Andy Parkins suggested that the Bitcoin client should be stricter about which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted. He proposed restricting it to those who have good practices for verifying identity, rather than relying on pre-installed trust in browsers. However, another developer argued that accepted CAs should be determined by the operating system rather than any particular software. They also pointed out that further restrictions could make the Bitcoin client even more difficult to use, as there are already only one or two CAs that provide a free certificate for personal or small users. Restricting the CAs to high-class ones could limit aliases without a key in the URI to those willing to pay a lot of money.</summary>
