    <summary>The article discusses the need for interaction in order to generate temporary addresses to preserve anonymity. The author provides three possibilities for generating temporary addresses, but none of them meet requirements for most users. One concern is the need to track inbound payments and assign a unique recipient address to each client. A possible solution is using an IIBAN draft, which would require mapping bitcoin addresses to the bitcoin subspace. However, if this is not possible, a central institution would be needed to manage the mapping, which decreases decentralization. The article concludes with a discussion of how most users lack the technical skills to configure and manage their own alias service hosts, which could push Bitcoin towards hosted wallet solutions.</summary>
