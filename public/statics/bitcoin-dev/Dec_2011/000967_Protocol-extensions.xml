    <summary>The issue of IP address anonymization is not the only one that needs to be addressed in the Bitcoin protocol. The aggregation of funds makes it easy to associate all public keys with a single entity. Large movements of bitcoin to previously unseen addresses are often interesting events that can be correlated with transactions on exchanges or other data sources. However, the Bitcoin protocol itself is not designed to address these issues. Anonymizing cryptocurrencies is a separate subject that needs to address how to hide the identity of those who relay transactions and how to organize and manipulate wallets to thwart attempts at block chain analysis. This topic was not intended to be addressed in the thread. Instead, the thread's purpose was to address the issue of extending the protocol to allow for independently running thin or specialized services that can interface via the Bitcoin protocol without requiring special gateway access.</summary>
