    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in December 2011, theymos proposed reusing Bitcoin's code and protocol for transactions to IP addresses to enable dynamic address lookup. They suggested making some changes to the protocol, such as extending it so that "reply" messages can be signed by a fixed public key and enabling DNS lookups for IP transactions. This could be done with minimal fuss/bloat, and would mitigate the security flaws of IP transactions. Furthermore, having a proxy node running 24/7 to serve public keys in lieu of users is another advantage of this approach. The aim was to avoid bloat in the Bitcoin protocol and ensure careful cautious planning for any future extensions.</summary>
