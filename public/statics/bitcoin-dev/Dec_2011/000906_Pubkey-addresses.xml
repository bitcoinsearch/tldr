    <summary>The use of firstbits in Bitcoin addresses has been deemed an unscalable and potentially harmful idea by developers. While it may seem like a clever solution to shorten lengthy addresses, it could lead to errors as people attempt to manually type in the shorter string. Additionally, firstbits addresses could be exploited by malicious individuals who secure similar addresses in hopes of typos or stencil extra characters onto public posters. Matt Corallo, a developer, warns against supporting the use of firstbits because it provides incentives for people to spam the blockchain in order to obtain them. As Bitcoin moves towards SPV clients, the use of firstbits is not a viable solution.</summary>
