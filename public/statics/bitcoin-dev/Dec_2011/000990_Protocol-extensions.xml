    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen raised concerns about nodes that do not check transactions themselves. He argues that such nodes cannot reliably forward failed verifications without getting blamed for faulty work and may have the incentive not to relay failed verifications. This makes it important to know which nodes will be checking transactions or not. Another participant in the discussion, Andy Parkins, argues that negative announces can defend against maliciousness because when a node negative announces a transaction, that transaction is going to be checked. However, Chris warns that using negative announces may lead to a DoS as a malicious node might trigger verification for every transaction.</summary>
