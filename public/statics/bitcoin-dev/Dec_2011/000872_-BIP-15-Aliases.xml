    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin's protocol for transactions to IP addresses, theymos suggests reusing the code and protocol for dynamic address lookup. However, this is deemed overcomplicated by some in comparison to DNS or HTTPS methods. Changes to the protocol include extending it so that "reply" messages can be signed by a fixed public key and enabling DNS lookups for IP transactions. The public key for signing "reply" messages can be obtained from TXT records, which will be safe with DNSSEC and Namecoin. However, full DNSSEC-capable resolver would have to be built into bitcoind for this to work securely. While some suggest asking the user to verify the public key, this may not be foolproof and could lead to users losing their coins.</summary>
