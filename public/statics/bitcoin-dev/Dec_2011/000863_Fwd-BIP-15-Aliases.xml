    <summary>In a discussion about preserving anonymity through temporary addresses, it is noted that generating a temporary address requires interaction with the entity hosting the wallet. The options for interaction are discussed, including a static address or having the server store the recipient's private keys and generate a new one for each payment. The IIBAN proposal is also mentioned, which would have IANA in charge of issuing namespace portions for bitcoin. However, there is concern over the use of a centralized proxy system or organization as an instantaneous financial settlement provider. The possibility of needing a central institution to manage the mapping of bitcoin addresses is discussed, which could be a step back in decentralization. The search for a deterministic method to map the subspace of all possible bitcoin addresses continues.</summary>
