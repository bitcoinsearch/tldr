    <summary>Setting up an HTTP server is easier than setting up a DNS record. It is recommended to use a different address for every payment. Wikipedia has become an indispensable part of daily life and needs donations for its protection. Kyle Henderson questions the need for HTTP when a query for a string and an answer can be handled via DNS. Zell Faze suggests combining the proposal and the HTTPS proposal. The DNSSEC TXT record could provide instructions on how to query an HTTPS server to get the address, offering the dynamism of HTTPS without having a rigid URL scheme for querying the server along with the benefits of DNSSEC.</summary>
