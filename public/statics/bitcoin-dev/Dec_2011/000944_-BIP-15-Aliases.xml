    <summary>The writer expresses their opinion that HTTPS should be used as a standard for every website dealing with financials, including Bitcoin. They argue that even though HTTPS is not perfect, it should still be the minimum requirement. The writer also mentions that they believe JSON support is common and works well with RPC. However, they prefer XML in most cases. The writer also notes that binary data can be base64 encoded but questions why one would need to send back binary in an alias response. In response to Luke-Jr's suggestion that they stick to simple standards, the writer argues that HTTP alone should be sufficient to build on. They disagree with Luke-Jr's assertion that JSON has poor language support and cannot effectively represent binary data. Instead, the writer suggests that HTTP allows binary data in multipart content without issue. Finally, the writer asks for clarification on what is meant by "custom output script."</summary>
