    <summary>On December 21, 2011, a conversation was taking place between developers Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik about the acceptance of a certain feature into version 0.6. Luke-Jr had mentioned that the feature, called "Coinbaser," had been accepted for version 0.6. However, Garzik objected to this claim and stated that it was necessary to get buy-in from other miners to ensure that the feature was something they wanted, not just something that Luke-Jr wanted.Luke-Jr then claimed that Gavin had approved the feature on IRC before the previous day. Garzik deferred to Luke-Jr's judgment on Coinbaser but requested data backing up Luke-Jr's statement that there was buy-in from other miners.</summary>
