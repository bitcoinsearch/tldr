    <summary>On December 20, 2011, Gavin Andresen announced that he had been busy pulling patches into git HEAD for a Bitcoin version 0.6 and aimed to have a Release Candidate 1 out in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile, Luke-Jr rebuilt his 'next' and 'next-test' branches with 21 merged branches. The update included those accepted for 0.6, those ready for acceptance, those that required review, those that could not be merged cleanly, and those yet to be written. Some branches required binaries to get wider testing. The accepted branches were Coinbaser, Context menu updates for TransactionView, QR Code generation via libqrencode, and Bitcoin-Qt signmessage GUI. The Ready for acceptance branches were Add -keepnode which attempts to -addnode and keep a..., Specify fees explicitly via JSON-RPC, Compressed pubkeys, Full URL Support in bitcoin-qt, 'getmininginfo' method, Testnet difficulty calculation changes, to take effect..., and Use standard C99 (and Qt) types for 64-bit integers. Some branches required review, including added option -forceresendtx, Execute a command when the best block changes..., Temporarily disable "minimize to tray" in the startup..., Multithreaded JSON-RPC with HTTP 1.1 Keep-Alive support, FastGetWork optimization, Bugfix: comply with BIP 0014 ..., -acceptnonstdtxn option to skip "non-standard..., Typo-tolerant (optimized) Base58 parser, Parse URIs with non-BTC amounts, Optimized binary-to-hex converter (ToHex). Some branches could not be merged cleanly (at least not into next-test at this point), such as joelkatz optimizations, JSON-RPC API versioning, IPv6 JSON-RPC, and IPv6. Finally, there were branches yet to be written, including Treat generation (almost) like normal receive and JSON-RPC with integer amounts.</summary>
