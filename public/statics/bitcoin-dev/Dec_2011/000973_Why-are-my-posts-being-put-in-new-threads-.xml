    <summary>The author of the post is seeking clarification on how email message threads are identified. They had made posts intended for a specific thread, but they were placed in new threads instead. The author is curious about which part of the email message is used to identify the thread to which it belongs. They initially thought it was the subject line, but have since learned that this is not the case.</summary>
