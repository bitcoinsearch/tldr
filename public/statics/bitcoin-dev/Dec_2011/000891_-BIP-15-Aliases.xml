    <summary>In a discussion about using Namecoin for aliases, Slush expresses his concern over the complexity and difficulty of integrating it with Bitcoin. He believes that implementing aliases should be as easy as possible for everyone to adopt and use, rather than relying on superior technology that is hard to understand and implement. As an example, he mentions how he implemented HTTPS lookup for addresses in his fork of Electrum client in just 15 minutes, using only 20 lines of code. He argues that this approach allows anyone to implement it in their own solutions and practically remove the need for standard Bitcoin addresses. He also mentions IIBAN as a potentially useful concept that could be added to the Bitcoin client in the future. Slush concludes by emphasizing the importance of keeping things simple and easy to understand for wider adoption.</summary>
