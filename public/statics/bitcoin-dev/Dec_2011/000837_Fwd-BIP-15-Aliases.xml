    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a software developer and Bitcoin enthusiast, agrees with Mike Hearn and Christian Decker that paying someone at foo.com should become a HTTPS query to https://foo.com/something. He also suggests that if Namecoin ever takes off, payments will be made to somebody at foo.bit. Andresen believes that if the address was DNS-based, it would be something like somebody.bitcoin.foo.com, but he thinks it's unlikely that people will set up and run a custom DNS server just to support Bitcoin payments. In conclusion, Andresen proposes that paying to '@eff.org' could work nicely as a donation method.</summary>
