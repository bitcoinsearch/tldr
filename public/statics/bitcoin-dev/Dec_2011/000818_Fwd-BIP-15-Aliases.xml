    <summary>In a discussion from 2011, Jorge Timón asks if it would be odd to use Namecoin to reserve email addresses and other strings. Luke-Jr responds that using Namecoin has the same problem as FirstBits, which is that they are both dirt cheap. However, vanitygen at least slows down grabbing all the common words. Someone asks if the point is to have different hosts like in jtimon at gmail.com, jtimon at timon.es, etc., so if jtimon is already taken, they can take another host. Another person suggests reserving directly the string "jtimon at nottaken.org" or "jtimon::public::receiving::bitcoin" in Namecoin. The original poster is confused about the problem they are trying to solve.</summary>
