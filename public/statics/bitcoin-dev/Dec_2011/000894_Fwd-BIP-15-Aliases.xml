    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 70, the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) was debated. While the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) does not specify anything in the PATH part of the URI, there are many types of URI schemes. It was argued that using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is important for creating an infinitely expandable mapping system as people already have web servers and understand URIs. However, it was noted that forcing every mapping service to be identical and limited would not address usability at all. The mapper should get to choose the variation of URI used, which can be no less elegant than a simple email.</summary>
