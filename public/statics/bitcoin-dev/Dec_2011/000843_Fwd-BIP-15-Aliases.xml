    <summary>In a discussion about the HTTPS proposal, Amir Taaki expressed his disagreement with the idea of a hard-coded mapping. He believed that server operators should have the freedom to arrange their domain names and paths as they choose. Furthermore, he stated that DNS is not the appropriate technology for this application. Another participant in the discussion suggested using https://foo.org/bitcoin-alias/?handle=genjix instead of an encoding scheme to map email-like addresses to Bitcoin addresses. This would allow the author of the service to use any URL they prefer. The URLs are familiar to users and can be specified as default https. In the future, if Bitcoin gets a distributed peer-to-peer alias system, a new URL type can be added easily. OpenID chose to use URLs for ID for similar reasons.</summary>
