    <summary>In December 2011, Luke-Jr and Gregory Maxwell had a discussion on enabling new opcodes in the bitcoin protocol. Gregory expressed irritation that recovery discussion in OP_EVAL was dropped due to the belief that input script size does not matter because of pruning. He also expressed concern about adding another address type, which would create bloated transactions where there is pruning. In response, Luke-Jr stated that he missed that bit but was willing to defer full OP_EVAL support on Eligius to enable key recovery. They both agreed to revisit the doors that enabling new opcodes opens.</summary>
