    <summary>In the world of Bitcoin, privacy and anonymity are highly valued. One way to achieve this is by using Tor to obfuscate one's IP address. According to a statement made by a Reddit user, the original "satoshi" bitcoin client already supports use over TOR with the proxy option. It is believed that Satoshi Nakamoto himself regularly used this feature. Developers in the crypto community have also been exploring ways to integrate Tor functionality into various cryptocurrency clients. This would provide an added layer of privacy for users who value anonymity while transacting in cryptocurrencies.</summary>
