    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol for transactions to IP addresses can be reused for dynamic address lookup, according to a proposal. The process would require a few changes such as extending the protocol to allow "reply" messages to be signed by a fixed public key, and enabling DNS lookups for IP transactions. The public key for signing "reply" messages can be obtained from TXT records, which would be safe with DNSSEC and Namecoin. With plain DNS, Bitcoin could take a SSH-like approach to ask users to verify the public key the first time it is used and remember it later. This proposal also handles DoS attacks by giving the same bitcoin address to the same IP address until it pays.</summary>
