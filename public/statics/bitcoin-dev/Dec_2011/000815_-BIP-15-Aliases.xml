    <summary>In a discussion about BIP 15, the implementation of aliases in Bitcoin, Luke-Jr argued that a decentralized solution should be found to maintain the decentralization of the protocol. He also expressed concern over the potential for a "gold-rush" if FirstBits were implemented. In response to suggestions for implementing HTTPS, Luke-Jr argued that it would not improve security since it relies on centralized certificate authorities. While he stated that an address of some form is necessary, he did not believe that HTTPS should be added to the protocol, but could be a useful client feature. The email exchange was part of a larger discussion about how aliases could be implemented in a decentralized manner in Bitcoin.</summary>
