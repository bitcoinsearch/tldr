    <summary>During a conversation on IRC, Sipa/Gmaxwell speculated that UPnP may no longer be functioning. However, there is currently no way to test this theory. In response, the speaker created an alternate chain and ran the daemon on their VPS. The connection acceptance was inconsistent and patchy at times. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the situation, the speaker wanted to share their experience with others.</summary>
