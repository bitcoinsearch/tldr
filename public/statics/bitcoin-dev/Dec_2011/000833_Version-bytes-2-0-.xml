    <summary>The Base58 encoding used in Bitcoin was not chosen for human readability, but rather for ease of copy/pasting and hand-writeability. Satoshi originally imagined most transactions being done directly between pairs of IP addresses. Currently, copy/paste of HTML content is not possible, but the bitcoin: link can be dragged and dropped into the client. A pull request by Bluematt aims to automatically handle bitcoin: URLs when clicked in the browser. However, it may be difficult to educate users on this capability. An idea is to create an easy-to-use UI that allows users to click a "Pay me" button and copy the corresponding HTML content into an email or HTML editor. This method would not work for forums that use bbCode, though it could potentially be converted into [url=] automatically by the forum software.</summary>
