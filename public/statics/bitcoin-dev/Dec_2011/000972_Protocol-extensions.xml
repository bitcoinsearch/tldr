    <summary>The emergence of supernodes that can validate transactions for other nodes seems inevitable. These supernodes would not necessarily need to store the entire block chain and transaction pool, but instead keep lists of IP addresses of trustworthy nodes. Trusted supernodes could provide just enough incentive to ensure the nodes they vouch for are legitimate. However, unless the supernode is validating the entire block chain and transaction pool itself, it could only assess the trustworthiness of other nodes by performing random sampling. Partitioning the hashspace could minimize the risk of an attacker gaining control over a disproportionate share of the hashspace.</summary>
