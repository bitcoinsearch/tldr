    <summary>The importance of the appearance of an address is questioned in this context. The fact that users are seeing addresses indicates a usability failure, according to the author. This is commonly seen today as there is no proper URL handling support in the main client for browser integration.

This can be achieved through copy/paste of text/html content.</summary>
