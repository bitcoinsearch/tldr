    <summary>The discussion is about the use of URLs, specifically how identification of a resource is different from interacting with it. The proposal is to use bitcoin URLs with temporary addresses for preserving anonymity. However, generating temporary addresses requires interaction with the entity hosting the wallet. There's also concern about a single authorized institution mapping IIBANs to bitcoin addresses and potential privacy breaches. The IIBAN proposal does involve one entity (IANA) issuing namespace portions, but policies are strict and open for discussion and modification. Walter Stanish from Payward, Inc. suggests that a more efficient and fair way of assigning namespace prefixes to random entities is needed, and while a bitcoin-like 'community consensus' system is possible, it's not necessary.</summary>
