    <summary>In a conversation on Saturday, December 17, 2011 at 6:46:34 PM, Gregory Maxwell expressed his irritation that discussion on recovery in OP_EVAL was dropped. He was annoyed because people were talking about adding another address type which creates bloated transactions where there is pruning, even though its slightly smaller in the no-pruning case and still not as small for key recovery. Maxwell is willing to defer full OP_EVAL support on Eligius in order to enable key recovery.</summary>
