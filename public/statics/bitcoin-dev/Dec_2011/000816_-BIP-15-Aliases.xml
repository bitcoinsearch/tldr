    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Zell Faze and Luke-Jr discussed the need for a decentralized solution in implementing BIP 15. They both agreed that Bitcoin should remain decentralized in every aspect of its protocol to maintain its greatest strength. While they found HTTPS useful as a client feature, they did not think it was something that should be added to the protocol. FirstBits was deemed bound to create a gold-rush to grab every nice-looking address, while HTTPS was only as secure as centralized CAs, making it no better than TXT records. Zell Faze suggested using Namecoin as an alternative solution, but Luke-Jr thought it would still require block exploring servers, and therefore proposed finding an easier decentralized solution. Jorge Timón chimed in to say that he didn't like the proposal if it relied on servers, even though it can still be useful for QR-codes. He also suggested that namecoin could be a viable decentralized solution.</summary>
