    <summary>In a conversation from 2011, Christian Decker suggested structuring the network in a hypercube and using prefixes to address different parts of the network. Each vertex in the hypercube would be a small, highly connected cluster of nodes for storing items such as transactions and blocks. The author advises others not to use this scheme unless they can demonstrate the feasibility of solving attack resistance problems with a working implementation. They express frustration with people suggesting "DHT" for every distributed systems problem without understanding what a hash table is or how to solve real problems first. To address concerns about the tragedy of the commons, the author suggests mutually authenticating peers so that full nodes can choose which lite nodes they are willing to work with based on trust.</summary>
