    <summary>On December 16, 2011, Rick Wesson responded to a proposal by slush regarding standard URLs. Slush had expressed preference for this proposal as compared to DNS mapping or email aliases converted to URLs with some weird logic. Wesson then pointed out that there were thousands of examples where some smart engineers chose the exact opposite path which slush proposed. Andy Parkins signed off this conversation thread.</summary>
