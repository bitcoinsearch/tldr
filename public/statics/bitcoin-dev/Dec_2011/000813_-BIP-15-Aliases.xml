    <summary>Amir Taaki, a Bitcoin developer, proposed the idea of Aliases in a pre-draft. The objective of this proposal is to provide an alternative that allows users to send Bitcoins without having to use long and complicated wallet addresses. Instead, they can use an Alias, which can be set up through different options. Amir lists his preferences for these options, with web service being his first choice for its ease of use. He explains that anyone can set up a web host easily, by providing a PHP script and a text file. HTTPS + CA is explained as the most secure option among the rest. Amir invites other ideas on the matter.</summary>
