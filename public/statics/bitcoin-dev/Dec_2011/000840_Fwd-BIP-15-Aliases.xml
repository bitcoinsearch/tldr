    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin payments took place on December 13, 2011. Gavin Andresen agreed with the suggestion of Mike Hearn and Christian Decker that paying to 'somebody at foo.com' should become a HTTPS query to https://foo.com/something. They believed that paying '@eff.org' should work fine for people who want to donate to eff.org. However, Andresen expressed his concern over introducing security risks in this approach. He suggested that if it was DNS-based, the address should be something like 'somebody.bitcoin.foo.com'. But he also pointed out that it is unlikely that people will set up and run a custom DNS server just to support bitcoin payments. Lastly, he suggested using a fixed address and emailing somebody at foo.com a signed message as an alternative.</summary>
