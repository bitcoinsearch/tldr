    <summary>The bitcoin address is just an opaque identifier for machines to send messages, not intended for human readability. Copy/pasting is the preferred method of handling addresses, and even for security reasons manual checks are not necessary. As a usability improvement, it would be better to focus on alternative ways that don't involve typing or seeing the addresses. Drag&amp;drop the bitcoin: link to the client is currently possible, but Bluematt has a pull request to automatically handle bitcoin: URLs when clicked in the browser. Mike Hearn suggests that finishing off URL handling support in the main client for browser integration would be a much better use of time, making it easy for people to create links containing a bitcoin: URL (like with copy/paste of text/html content).</summary>
