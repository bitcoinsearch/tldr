    <summary>It has been proposed that the simple URI naming convention could still allow for integration of Namecoin to map the IP of a server. This raises the question of whether this would eliminate the need for certificates, and if so, users should be given the choice between HTTP, HTTPS, Namecoin or any other trusted option. However, there is also discussion about the format of the response message, specifically regarding fields such as "amount" and "concept". It is important to consider these details in order to ensure effective communication and functionality.</summary>
