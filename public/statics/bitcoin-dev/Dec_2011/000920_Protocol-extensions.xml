    <summary>In December of 2011, Jordan Mack expressed his concern about the development of a header-only client for Bitcoin. He believed that this would break the most fundamental aspects of Bitcoin's security model because if a client only has headers, it cannot do full verification and must trust data from random anonymous peers. Dr. Andy Parkins, however, was working on a client that could download-on-demand. This means that the block chain headers would be downloaded and maintained, but the block bodies would be downloaded as needed for full verification. Although not possible with the current protocol, Dr. Parkins believed it was a conceivable application that slots between headers-only and full client conceptually.</summary>
