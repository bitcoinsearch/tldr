    <summary>A proposal has been put forward to make it easier for software to detect when a bitcoin address is expected. The suggestion is to specify "bitcoin://" in the browser or bitcoin client, which would make it optional to have the prefix if the context already implies that an address is expected. This could also be extended to include parameters such as amounts and green addresses. The bitcoin client could even download web pages to look for occurrences of "bitcoin://" or valid addresses, and cache and display them to the user for action. The proposal is open to community discussion and development.</summary>
