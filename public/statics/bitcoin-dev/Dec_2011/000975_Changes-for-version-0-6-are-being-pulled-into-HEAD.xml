    <summary>Mike Hearn raised a concern about Git not producing helpful summaries when every commit is a merge. He suggested that this makes it difficult to guess what a change does based on the name of the topic branch. In response, someone suggested using the command `git log --no-merges` to address the issue.</summary>
