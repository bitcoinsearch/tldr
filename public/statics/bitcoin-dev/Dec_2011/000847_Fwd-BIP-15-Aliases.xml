    <summary>In an email exchange on December 14, 2011, D.H. suggested that the hardcoding of "https", "bitcoin-alias", "?handle=", and the email address "genjix at foo.org" be forgotten in favor of simply using the URL for a bitcoin service. This suggestion was met with approval and deemed easy to implement and set up. However, when the proposed URI "david.bitcoin.se" was mentioned, it was pointed out that it was not a valid URI.</summary>
