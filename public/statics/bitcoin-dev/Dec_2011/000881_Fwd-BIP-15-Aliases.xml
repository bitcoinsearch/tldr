    <summary>In this conversation, Slush supports the KISS attitude of using URLs as a simpler approach than the other proposals for implementing aliases in clients. They express concern about over-engineering and difficulty in implementation if other approaches are chosen. Sipa's idea of posting back the transaction ID is also discussed as an interesting possibility. Rick Wesson challenges Slush's opinion by suggesting that many smart engineers have chosen different paths in the past and suggests reviewing some relevant RFCs. The conversation touches on various possible solutions and the potential drawbacks of each.</summary>
