    <summary>The need for HTTP is questioned in relation to DNS. While a query and response can be handled via DNS, it is easier to set up an HTTP server to dynamically respond with addresses. The idea that every individual will run their own DNS or HTTP based alias system seems far-fetched as it would provide little added value and significant hassle. Third party hosted services are more likely to provide aliasing resolution, including transaction metadata exchange. This process may include, among other things, transaction description, taxation information, currency exchange rates, shipping terms, transaction reversal, and escrow terms.</summary>
