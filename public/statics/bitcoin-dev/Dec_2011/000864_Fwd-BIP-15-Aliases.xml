    <summary>The discussion revolves around the various possibilities to define how the server will get the address, without affecting the anonymity. The possibilities discussed include a static address, recipient private keys stored by servers, and a set of addresses provided by the recipient. The minimal protocol that needs to be supported by everyone should be separated from the best practices, as the user doesn't need to know about the standardization part. There could be a 1-to-1 mapping between the details page and the bitcoin address, while tags like OpenID server delegation mechanism could be used for customers to open the transaction details page, paste the same URL into the bitcoin client, and retrieve the URL. The Bitcoin Client can also send an Accept header, which tells the server to return just the address. The format suggested is either a Bitcoin address or a Bitcoin URI, flexible enough for customers to track transactions.</summary>
