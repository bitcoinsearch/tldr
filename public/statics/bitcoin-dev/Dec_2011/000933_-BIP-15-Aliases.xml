    <summary>In this email conversation between members of the Bitcoin development community, there is a discussion about the validity and authentication of URLs and URIs. One member questions the usefulness of providing aliases with additional hashes in the URL. Another member suggests that if a simple URI proposal is chosen, Namecoin can still be integrated to map the IP of the server for those who want to do so. They discuss the necessity of certificates for authentication, and the vulnerability of HTTP. The use of self-signed SSL keys and DNSSEC/Namecoin is suggested as alternative methods of authentication. Finally, they touch on the need for a proper protocol to negotiate payment in future developments. The email ends with an announcement for a Learn Windows Azure training event for developers.</summary>
