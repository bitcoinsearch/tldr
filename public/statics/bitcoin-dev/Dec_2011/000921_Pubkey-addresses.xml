    <summary>In a conversation thread from 2011, Jorge Timón and Luke-Jr discuss the use of "Green addresses" in POS payments. Luke-Jr seems to be in favor of using them, but Jorge Timón argues that they are a "broken-by-design feature" and should be discouraged. It is unclear what flaw Luke-Jr may have been referring to. The conversation then shifts to whether it would be practical to put the entire public key in each output.</summary>
