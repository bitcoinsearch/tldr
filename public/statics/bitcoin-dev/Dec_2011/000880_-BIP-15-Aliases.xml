    <summary>In a conversation from 2011, Pieter Wuille and Rick Wesson discuss the relationship between protocol hardening and usability. Wesson suggests looking at the IETF's work on addressing similar issues and mentions the elegance of the bitcoin protocols. He criticizes the proposals in the thread for being unclear and inelegant, suggesting that schemes should strive for a high level of sophistication. Wuille defends the use of URI+bitcoin address pairs and SSL communication authenticated using the corresponding bitcoin pubkey as a way to prevent spoofing. Wesson argues that aliases are not as secure as https secured URI+bitcoin address pairs, further emphasizing the importance of balancing security and usability.</summary>
