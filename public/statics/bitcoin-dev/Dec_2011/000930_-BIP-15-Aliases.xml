    <summary>In a discussion regarding Namecoin, HTTPS requirements and answered message formats, one user is unsure about the use of HTTPS, stating that without it, the resolution is open to a man-in-the-middle attack. However, they suggest requiring HTTPS with a warning message displayed if HTTP is used. In response to a proposal for a simple URI, another user suggests that Namecoin can still be integrated to map the IP of the server by those who want to, but questions whether this removes the necessity of certificates. They suggest giving people the option to choose between HTTP, HTTPS, Namecoin or whatever they trust. The user also brings up the topic of valid answered message formats, suggesting fields like "amount" and "concept" should be discussed. It is not clear if JSON is the assumed format for these messages.</summary>
