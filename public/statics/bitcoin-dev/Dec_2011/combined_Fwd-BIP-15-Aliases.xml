    <summary>The context highlights the issue of usability while making Bitcoin transactions. The author visited a place called brmlab to pay 1 BTC for a Club Mate but faced difficulty in using the QR code displayed on the wall as he didn't own a mobile phone. He then used FirstBits to get their bitcoin address from the website and copied that to send 1 BTC. The article also discusses the proposals for Namecoin and how it would make bitcoin implementations dependent on unproven technology. It suggests that HTTPS/DNSSEC, which have been around for a long time, are responsible for many mission-critical systems and has a lot of momentum behind those projects compared to Namecoin, which could die tomorrow. It also goes on to mention that the centralization of Namecoin is not a big deal and is merely a convenience for end-users that does not affect the core system much.In addition, the article also discusses the need for different hosts like jtimon at gmail.com or jtimon at timon.es, etc., so that if jtimon is already taken, one can take another host. It proposes reserving the string "jtimon at nottaken.org" or "jtimon::public::receiving::bitcoin" in Namecoin. However, the article concludes by saying that the author is confused about the problem they are trying to solve.</summary>
