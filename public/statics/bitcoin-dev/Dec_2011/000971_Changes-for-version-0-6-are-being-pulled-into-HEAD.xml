    <summary>In December 2011, Gavin Andresen announced on the Bitcoin-development mailing list that he had been busy pulling patches into git HEAD for a Bitcoin version 0.6. He aimed to have a Release Candidate 1 out in a couple of weeks and encouraged others to help test, code review, etc. Wladimir responded with excitement, mentioning that he would merge some GUI pull requests for 0.6.x that week or the next. The email also included information about the Intel AppUpSM program developer opportunity.</summary>
