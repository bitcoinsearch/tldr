    <summary>The author, Walter Stanish, introduces IIBAN, an Internet Standards Draft he authored on behalf of his employer, Payward Inc., while working on Bitcoin-related development. The draft offers a solution to the problem of merchants needing a way to translate human-readable addresses into Bitcoin addresses. IIBAN is a centralized, delegatable namespace allocation system that uses mature transposition error detection, has a fixed length, and is shorter than both Bitcoin addresses and many national bank account numbers at 13 characters. It is superset-compatible with existing financial networks utilizing the IBAN standard. The proposed IANA management of IIBAN's initial institution namespace is indeed centralized but the IIBAN draft is liberal in its assignment policy, which can be viewed within the draft document linked above, and whose terms are binding for IANA.</summary>
