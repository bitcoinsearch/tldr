    <summary>In a discussion, Matt argued that the scalability issues associated with firstbits do not apply to green addresses since they are meant to shorten Bitcoin addresses in the protocol to enable multiple Bitcoin addresses in the same QR-code. Amir said that he likes the DNS proposal because it allows for both centralized and decentralized options to be used. Theymos agreed with the DNS proposal, saying that the protocol should be done entirely in DNS, not using HTTP connections to the server. He added that the CA model is broken and should never be used by Bitcoin.</summary>
