    <summary>The user at server.com model is preferred by the speaker, with a protocol entirely in DNS for easy compatibility with Namecoin or other DNS replacements/enhancements later. An optional crypto feature is suggested to prevent MITM attacks. The speaker is not too concerned about the ease of setting up the server software as most users will be unable to have an always-on Internet service. FirstBits is not recommended because registrations last forever and short names will quickly be taken, making it expensive for clients to query. Finally, the speaker believes that the CA model is broken and should never be used by Bitcoin.</summary>
