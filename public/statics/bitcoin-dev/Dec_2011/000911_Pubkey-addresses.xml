    <summary>A proposal has been made to require full public key addresses to be "compact" with a length of 33 and to use version 21, which begins with '4' and is redundant with version 20 for 20-byte data. The purpose of this proposal is unclear, but the author is seeking feedback on whether this would be workable. No further information is provided about potential benefits or drawbacks of implementing this proposal.</summary>
