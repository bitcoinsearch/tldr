    <summary>In a conversation from 2011, Jordan Mack raises concerns about the susceptibility of a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on a publicly available alias system. Mack suggests that if an alias lookup triggers the creation of a new Bitcoin address, the private key would need to be retained indefinitely, which could consume considerable resources over time. Unlike system logs, this would not be easily pruned. In response, it is suggested that servers should not use a different address with every lookup and instead should only change it once per minute, hour, or some other set timeframe. Another suggestion is to wait for payment to be made to an address before giving out another one. These measures could potentially reduce the risk of DOS attacks on the alias system.</summary>
