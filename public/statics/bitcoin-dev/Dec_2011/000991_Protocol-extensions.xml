    <summary>In this discussion, Joel and Michael are discussing the issue of validations in a distributed stored and validated block chain setup. They point out that the only ones with incentives to do validation are miners who risk having their mined blocks invalidated later by less lazy miners and those who are to send and accept transactions. However, a non-enforced random validation approach would lead to super nodes being created, namely miners, who could charge for validations. This might result in a situation where the p2p network is only for miners, while the rest of us connect through https and use json-rpc to post transactions to them. Joel adds that nodes that are not doing any checking themselves cannot reliably forward failed verifications without getting the blame for doing faulty work. Those nodes would then have the incentive not to relay the failed verifications. Therefore, it becomes essential to know which nodes will be checking transactions or not so that one doesn't isolate themselves from other nodes that are also checking transactions.
