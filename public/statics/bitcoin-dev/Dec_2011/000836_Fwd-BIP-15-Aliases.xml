    <summary>The author states that there is currently no decentralized solution for non-fixed addresses. They suggest that if reliance on servers is necessary, dynamic addresses should be offered. The author mentions a bitcoin service in the forum, which allowed merchants to send different addresses and manage payments without holding private keys. The service identified each shopping cart by a combination of the total amount and selected address for that cart. However, the author does not remember the name of the service. Additionally, the author suggests that the service could easily implement aliases, allowing for the same alias to be used for various rotating addresses. Despite this, the service provider would still have access to the user's income and new addresses would need to be provided to maintain privacy. Overall, the author shares this information in hopes of inspiring someone to develop a similar service.</summary>
