    <summary>The discussion started on December 29, 2011, when roconnor at theorem.ca commented that OP_SHA256 OP_EVAL runs random code that is more than 5 bytes, which was not adequate. The other participant argued that they should be able to run random code and mentioned that the random code could always be put in the script verbatim.The debate revolves around the use of OP_SHA256 OP_EVAL, which is a Bitcoin scripting language operator that allows running arbitrary code. However, roconnor pointed out that this poses a risk as it can run more than 5 bytes of random code, which is not enough for security purposes. The other participant argued that there is no reason why they shouldn't be able to run random code and suggested that they could include the random code in the script verbatim. However, this approach may not be secure enough, and roconnor's concern about the use of OP_SHA256 OP_EVAL seems justified. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of security in Bitcoin scripting language, and the need for careful consideration of the potential risks associated with various operators and codes.</summary>
