    <summary>Luke-Jr, a Bitcoin Core developer, has provided an update on the features that have been Acknowledged, are possibly good and need more review/support for version 0.6 of Bitcoin. The Ack'd features include Caps Lock detection to askpassphrasedialog (585), Coinbaser (569), Multisignature and OP_EVAL support (669), QR Code generation via libqrencode (629) and Bitcoin-Qt signmessage GUI (582). These features are available merged in his personal "next" branch on GitHub. The features that are possibly good for version 0.6 include Add -keepnode which attempts to -addnode and keep a connection open (454), specify fees explicitly via JSON-RPC (570), store fewer time samples (673), compressed pubkeys (649) and full URL Support in bitcoin-qt (593). These features are available merged in his personal "next-test" branch on GitHub.Lastly, there are several features that need more review and support including IPv6 support(lots of complicated conflicts merging) (427), Multithreaded JSON-RPC with HTTP 1.1 Keep-Alive support (568), FastGetWork optimization (565), SIGUSR1 new block notifications (555), advanced anonymity features: send from address(es), view address linkages, view all addresses (415) and Address Book related Fixes (358).</summary>
