    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, Gavin Andresen suggested that using a standard like IIBAN for Bitcoin Payment Routing Address could provide public relations benefits. However, Dr. Andy Parkins questioned the need to map human-opaque numbers to another, and proposed the possibility of having human-readable names for bitcoin-addresses in the future. He gave an example of a scenario where someone could request for bitcoins owed to them to be sent to a name like "bitcoin.yahoo.co.uk/andyparkins".</summary>
