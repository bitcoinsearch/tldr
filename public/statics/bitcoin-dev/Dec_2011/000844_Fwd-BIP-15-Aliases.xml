    <summary>In a thread discussing IBAN numbers, Gavin Andresen suggests experimentation with clients supporting different schemes for bitcoin address aliases and using plugins to extend the schemes. He also mentions defining Bitcoin as an IIBAN "institution" with 36^6 "accounts", but is unclear on how those accounts would get allocated and mapped into bitcoin addresses. He suggests a central organization to map IIBAN account numbers to domain names and then have clients or plugins query that trusted central organization and the account holder's domain to get a public key or bitcoin address. He emphasizes that IIBANs should not be the only way of aliasing bitcoin addresses to more-human-friendly strings.</summary>
