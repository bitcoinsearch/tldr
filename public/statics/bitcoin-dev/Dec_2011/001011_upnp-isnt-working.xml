    <summary>In 2011, Amir Taaki reported an issue with the functionality of upnp on Bitcoin's daemon. Sipa and gmaxwell had proposed that the protocol may no longer be working, but there was no way to test it. To troubleshoot this, Taaki created an alternate chain and ran the daemon on his VPS. However, he noticed that the connections were sometimes accepted while other times they were not due to patchy behavior. Matt, another contributor to the discussion, suggested that the issue may not be with the function itself but with the failure to re-announce to the router that the port needs to remain open.</summary>
