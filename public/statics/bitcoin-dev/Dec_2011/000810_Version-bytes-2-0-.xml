    <summary>Base58 encoding may not be suitable for creating user-friendly addresses, despite being intended for human use. A radical proposal by Luke suggests removing the "version" notion from version bytes and changing testnet addresses. While this is a significant change, it could be worth it as it improves the recognizability of data classes, particularly for OP_EVAL addresses. Pieter supports this proposal, which would introduce new versions for different types of addresses on both mainnet and testnet, including pubnet hashes and private keys. He seeks comments on this proposal.</summary>
