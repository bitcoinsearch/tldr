    <summary>In an email thread, Khalahan has outlined the problems with proposals for enabling Bitcoin transactions using domain names. The first proposal, FirstBits, is centralized, while DNS TXT Records limit usage to engineers and some domain names. Other proposals that involve DNS lookups for IP transactions or HTTPS web services are not reliable and require certificates that expire, thereby reducing anonymity. While there have been attempts to integrate Namecoin as a solution, slush, in a separate message, believes it is over-engineered and suggests that aliases be made as easy as possible so that everyone can adopt it.</summary>
