    <summary>In a 2011 email exchange, John Smith discussed the closure of some issues related to Wx UI issues. He stated that they no longer support the old UI and suggested that someone should take up wxBitcoin, possibly after backporting to wx 2.8. However, he admitted that he had no interest in this as he preferred Qt. Smith also cautioned against a centralization mindset and highlighted that there are several non-functional clients that should be given equal footing. He further noted that while some of the older issues are still relevant, having over 150 open issues is not ideal. Smith expressed his curiosity about how other open source projects deal with this issue without stepping on people's toes. In conclusion, Smith mentioned that KDE recently closed a bug he reported in 2002 because the component with the bug has not been part of KDE since 2008.</summary>
