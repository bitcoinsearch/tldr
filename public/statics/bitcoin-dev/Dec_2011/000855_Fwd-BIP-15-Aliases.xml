    <summary>In a discussion about the need for HTTP, it was suggested that queries and answers could be handled via DNS. A proposal was made to combine the DNSSEC TXT record with HTTPS to get the dynamism of HTTPS without having a rigid URL scheme for querying the server. This would also provide the advantages of DNSSEC. The proposal suggested that the DNSSEC TXT record could give instructions on how to query an HTTPS server to get the address.</summary>
