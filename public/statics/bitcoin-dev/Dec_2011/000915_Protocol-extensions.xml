    <summary>The concept of using DHT for storage of the block chain is intriguing, but it may not be feasible due to the difficulty in guaranteeing against data loss or manipulation. Gavin noted that verification of transactions on the network would be difficult, as peers cannot necessarily be trusted. Trust in the full block chain allows the client to trust no one. Additionally, the use of DHT may not solve the problem of scalability in regards to broadcast messages. Despite these challenges, the idea of using DHT for block chain storage remains interesting.</summary>
