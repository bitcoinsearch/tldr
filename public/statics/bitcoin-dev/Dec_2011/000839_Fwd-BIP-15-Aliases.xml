    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gavin Andresen agreed with Mike Hearn and Christian Decker that paying to someone at foo.com should become a HTTPS query to https://foo.com/something. If an individual wants to donate to eff.org, then paying to '@eff.org' ought to work nicely. In case Namecoin takes off, an individual will pay to 'somebody at foo.bit'. Gavin Andresen thinks that it is unlikely people will set up and run a custom DNS server just to support bitcoin payments. The email also mentions the use of HTTPS service and server service for contacting aliases, and how the system responds with a bitcoin address. The author clarifies that whether the system gives a new address from a pool of addresses or contacts the merchant behind the scenes is implementation defined. Finally, the author expresses interest in arguments in favor of a server service (daemon answering queries).</summary>
