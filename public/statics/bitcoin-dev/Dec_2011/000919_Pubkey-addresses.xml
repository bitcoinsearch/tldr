    <summary>In a conversation that took place on December 18, 2011 at 7:15:26 AM, Jorge Tim√≥n expressed his opinion about the usefulness of "green addresses" in a particular case. However, it is worth noting that "green addresses" are considered to be a broken-by-design feature and should not be encouraged. The conversation does not provide further information about what a "green address" is or why it is considered to be broken-by-design.</summary>
