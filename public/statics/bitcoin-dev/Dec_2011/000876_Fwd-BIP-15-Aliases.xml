    <summary>In a discussion about preserving anonymity through the use of temporary addresses, it was suggested that interaction is required to generate these addresses. However, Pieter, in response, explains that some interaction is necessary but not necessarily directly with the entity hosting the wallet. He suggests using EC crypto tricks, often mentioned under "deterministic wallets" which involves the wallet-hosting entity having a private key x and public key X. The address-generating entity knows X and generates a fresh private key y for each transaction. For each transaction, it calculates Z=y*X and asks the client to pay to hash160(Z). Then, it can send a bunch of y's to the wallet hosting service which can reconstruct z=y*x for each transaction. Alternatively, the y's can be generated according to a predefined scheme.</summary>
