    <summary>Amir Taaki responded to a message regarding FirstBits, which he believes is useless. He argues that the reason for this is not because of the reasons specified by the other person, but because the resources needed for it rises exponentially as the number of participants in the network grows linearly. Amir proposes a shared naming scheme between bitcoin implementations that would allow users to send directly to a specific address without having to use a website to lookup addresses. However, he acknowledges that there may be implementation details to figure out to ensure that the transaction actually goes to the intended recipient.</summary>
