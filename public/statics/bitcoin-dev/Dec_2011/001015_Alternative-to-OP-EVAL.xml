    <summary>In a discussion about the Bitcoin script language, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen suggested restricting the number of executions of OP_EVAL allowed per transaction to prevent unlimited looping. He believed that 3 would be enough for most purposes. However, roconnor at theorem.ca warned that OP_EVAL adds dangerously expressive power to the scripting language. Gavin himself showed how to use OP_EVAL to loop using the stack operations. The addition of OP_EVAL made the script language essentially Turing complete, with only an artificial limit on recursion depth preventing arbitrary computation. Zell agreed with Joel and said that most OP_EVAL transactions won't be complex enough to require more than a few loops. Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, once said that it has become an indispensable part of our daily lives and asked people to donate to protect it. Citrix VDI-in-a-Box was promoted as an all-in-one solution for virtual desktops, offering easy deployment and cost savings.</summary>
