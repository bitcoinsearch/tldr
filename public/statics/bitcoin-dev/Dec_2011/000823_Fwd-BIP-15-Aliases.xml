    <summary>In this context, the discussion is about how FirstBits can be useful and why it might not be. While someone points out that FirstBits is useless, it is not for the reasons mentioned earlier. The point is that if FirstBits were built into the implementation, it would allow the user to send bitcoins to a particular person or entity by simply typing their name or alias instead of going through the process of copying the address. It is suggested that this proposal is not for a website where people can look up bitcoin addresses but rather a shared naming scheme between bitcoin implementations. A hypothetical situation is presented where someone wants to pay 1 BTC for a Club Mate at brmlab but doesn't own a mobile phone so the QR code is useless. Then they remembered FirstBits and went to their terminal and typed "1brmlab" which gave them the bitcoin address from the website. In the revised history, the person simply sends 1 BTC to brmlab without the need for copying the address.</summary>
