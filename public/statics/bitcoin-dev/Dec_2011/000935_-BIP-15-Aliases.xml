    <summary>In a discussion on the vulnerability of DNS-based alias systems to spoofing, Pieter suggests a solution involving embedding bitcoin addresses in identification strings themselves and requiring SSL communication authenticated using the respective key. While this approach may make identification strings less useful as aliases in the traditional sense, Pieter argues that this is not a significant issue, as these identification strings are typically communicated through other electronic means anyway. Additionally, the embedded bitcoin address could be hidden from the user and stored in an address book together with the URI. Pieter points out that warnings about key changes will likely be ignored by most users.</summary>
