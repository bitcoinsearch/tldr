    <summary>A proposal for making a Bitcoin-compatible Namecoin address has been revised. The proposal defines different bits for network class and network, where 0 represents the main network, 64 and 128 are reserved, and 192 is the test network. For network, 0 represents Bitcoin, 16 is reserved, 32 is for others, and 48 is for Namecoin. In the case of Bitcoin, the remaining bits are left up to the network to decide. Bits 8, 4, and 2 define data class with options such as public key hash, script hash, public key (raw), signature, private key (raw), and other. Bit 1 is flexible to choose for aesthetic purposes.</summary>
