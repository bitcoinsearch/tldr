    <summary>A disagreement has arisen between two individuals, one being Gavin and the other being Luke-JR, regarding the use of the same version string for both the GUI interface and the daemon mode in a recent commit. Luke believes this to be a violation of BIP_0014 and an error on Gavin's part, while Gavin argues that BIP_0014 does not have mandatory requirements for the version field and that the software is the same, therefore should have the same name. While the two may not come to an agreement on this point, it does highlight some ambiguity in the interpretation of BIP language and what is permitted, encouraged, or required. The author suggests using the well-established standard language found in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt when writing BIPs to avoid such confusion.</summary>
