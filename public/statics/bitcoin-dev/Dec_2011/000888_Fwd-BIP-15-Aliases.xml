    <summary>The bitcoin protocol has been criticized for lacking elegance due to it being a message-based system over TCP with constantly changing endians. It also needs to lookup its own IP address on several websites. It has been deemed functional but not elegant. Insulting comments towards Slush, who runs one of the largest mining pools and is working on Electrum, and Sipa, who develops the Satoshi Bitcoin, have been deemed inappropriate. Namecoin, a peer-to-peer generic name/value datastore system, has been noted to have the same problem as DNS where updating records takes time, which creates security issues when new addresses are not used per transaction. In response to a proposal regarding standard URLs, Rick Wesson states that an elegant transformation is needed and challenges anyone advocating for https://authority/foo/user?tx=1zhd789632uilos as an elegant solution. He believes that experience is leading the conversation down a path of CGI and HTTP requests that hinder acceptance and participation. Providing a mapping from user at authority.tld addresses usability and identity. Rick suggests that having your scheme and having apps understand how to integrate with it has significant upside.</summary>
