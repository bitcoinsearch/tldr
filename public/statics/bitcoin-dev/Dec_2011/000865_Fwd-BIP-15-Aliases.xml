    <summary>The email thread discusses designing protocols versus applications. The writer suggests it is better to design a protocol and let the applications implement it for security purposes. The discussion then shifts to understanding how labels, such as DNS or URIs, can be used to securely obtain a Bitcoin address. One person in the thread argues that it is easier to set up an HTTP server to respond with addresses than a DNS record. Another person suggests combining proposals for HTTPS and DNSSEC TXT records to get the dynamism of HTTPS without having a rigid URL scheme for querying the server, while still maintaining the advantages of DNSSEC.</summary>
