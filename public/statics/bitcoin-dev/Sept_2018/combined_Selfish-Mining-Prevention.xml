    <summary>The context discusses various proposals by developer Andrew to prevent attacks on the Bitcoin network, such as selfish mining, collusion, and block withholding. One proposal involves adding "reserve fees" to transactions that incentivize miners not to drive out competition and create more space for transactions with fees. Another proposal suggests modulating the block reward according to peak hashrate but may require a new dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm. Damian Williamson expressed concerns about increased global resource consumption, while Andrew argued that centralization of energy does more harm than total energy consumption. The proposals aim to ensure the security and stability of the Bitcoin network.Several proposals have been made to address potential attacks on the Bitcoin network, including selfish mining, collusion, and block withholding. One proposal involves adding "reserve fees" to transactions, where users can specify a fraction of the total fee that is held in reserve for a set amount of time and paid to miners if the hashrate rises. Another proposal suggests "modulating" the block reward according to peak hashrate, which could incentivize miners not to collude but may require a new, more dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm. The 51% problem is also discussed, with potential solutions including increasing difficulty with a function instead of reward and trusting a small group of coins to be the best choice(s) to prevent attacks. Proof of memory (space) and merge mining are also mentioned as potentially efficient methods in the future, and while encouraging less resource usage is good, it falls outside the scope of the Bitcoin software protocol.A member of the mailing list has proposed adding "reserve fees" to help prevent mining centralization, which would release reserve fees to other miners if one attempts to drive out competition. Another member suggested an alternative solution called Helper Blocks, which assigns one satoshi from the unspent transaction output set with the power to generate a Helper Block that commits to a subset of transactions for inclusion in the next block.A proposal has been made to prevent subtle attacks on the Bitcoin network, including selfish mining and block withholding, by introducing "reserve fees". When a user makes a transaction, they can specify the fraction of the total fee that is held in reserve for a set period. If a miner attempts to increase their hashrate and drive out competition, the reserve fees would be released to other miners until the contract expires. The proposal is voluntary and requires a soft fork. Another member suggested an alternative solution called Helper Blocks, which randomly assigns one satoshi from the unspent transaction output set with the power to generate a Helper Block that commits to a subset of transactions for inclusion in the next block.A proposal was made by a developer named Andrew to add "reserve fees" in bitcoin mining to prevent selfish mining attacks and collusion. The reserve fees would be a fraction of the total fee that is held in "reserve" for a certain period of time. If the hashrate rises, the reserve fee will be paid to miners. This approach should incentivize miners not to drive out competition since they will receive less of these reserve fees if they do. The miner will get all the fees eventually, but with rising hashrate, they get an unconditional subsidy that doesn't require transactions, allowing more space for transactions with fees.Selfish mining is an attack where miners collude to mine at a lower hashrate than when all miners work independently. To prevent this, one idea is to modulate the block reward according to peak hashrate. The max block reward would be 0.5 r (1 + h/p), where p is the peak hashrate for 365 periods, h is the hashrate of the last 144 block period, and r is the base subsidy. If miners collude to mine at a lower than peak hashrate, they may be able to do it profitably for 144 blocks, but after that, the reward would get modulated and it wouldn't be so much in their interest to continue mining at the lower hashrate. However, this approach could be controversial due to easier mining present for early miners, so maybe it would have to be done in combination with a new more dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm.The share of a miner's hash power is proportional to capital investment, not the newness of the investment. The efficiency of a new mine can outperform other miners, thus resulting in their departure, allowing the entry of the former. Users can set a target hashrate, which can be less or more than the peak hashrate. As long as hashrate is rising and has not reached the target, miners will incrementally get the reserve fees. If hashrate remains the same or falls, then users get the reserve fees back.Zawy raised concerns about Andrew's proposal, which he believed could amplify oscillations. He suggested that an average of 144 past blocks be used to determine h as a way of reducing on-off mining. Zawy also mentioned the possibility of issuing too many or too</summary>
