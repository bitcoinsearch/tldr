    <summary>Andrew Kozlik, part of the TREZOR team, has written a new specification to split BIP-32 master seeds into multiple mnemonics using Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) scheme. Ignacio Berrozpe commented on the proposal, having previously published his own article proposing SSS to split Bitcoin private keys into shares that could be encoded directly using BIP-0039 mnemonic words. Berrozpe asked Kozlik whether he had considered standardizing the encoding format, splitting the pre-master secret into shares and deriving the master secret from the pre-master secret under the same proposal. Additionally, Berrozpe questioned whether there was a way to deal with the existing legacy private keys already encoded into BIP-0039 or stored in other formats and how to migrate them securely into a schema of encoded SSS shares.Kozlik responded that they intend to standardize the encoding format, splitting the pre-master secret into shares and deriving the master secret from the pre-master secret in a single document. However, only one of the four proposed master secret derivation functions will be selected for the final version. Furthermore, Kozlik stated that three of the four proposed master secret derivation functions are symmetric, meaning that they allow users to migrate any existing master secret (including a BIP-0039 mnemonic) to the new scheme.</summary>
