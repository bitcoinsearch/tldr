    <title>[bitcoin-core-dev] Bitcoin Core update notice</title>

    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user raised concerns about the "hype/hysteria" surrounding the need to upgrade to version 0.16.3 immediately. In response, another user clarified that the bugfix has already been backported to earlier versions and that the announcement on the Bitcoin Core site is clear. However, the recommendation to upgrade to the latest version still stands as running older versions can lead to other issues. The reasoning behind this is that although some may think a network exploitable crash is not a problem, it can lead to double-spends and long valid forks. The best advice available is to upgrade to the latest version, according to the user. The language used by Theymos, who made the announcement, was deemed stronger than necessary but it errs on the side of protecting people from harm.</summary>
