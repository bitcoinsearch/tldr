    <summary>The importance of attribution in sharing good ideas has been emphasized, as credit is the only compensation people receive. However, there have been instances where political attacks have led to withholding of attribution, which has caused disappointment. This issue has occurred in the Bitcoin space, where individuals who were previously walked through an idea in private have presented the same idea as their own without giving any credit to the original developers. Gregory Maxwell has experienced this twice, with Peter R regarding subchains paper and Justus Ranvier concerning compact fraud proofs. Maxwell has expressed his frustration over this issue and has forwarded the correspondence to the list for posterity because he never received a response from Justus despite complaining directly to him. This issue resurfaced when V. Buterin published a paper on lite client security that appeared to be unaware of proposals from the Bitcoin community on sampled anti-withholding. The paper cited Justus' writeup as evidence that sampling coded data was not previously considered and as the only example of fraud proofs previously. As a result, the Bitcoin community's past efforts on fraud proofs were unacknowledged, and they were not aware of the state of the art like anti-withholding.</summary>
