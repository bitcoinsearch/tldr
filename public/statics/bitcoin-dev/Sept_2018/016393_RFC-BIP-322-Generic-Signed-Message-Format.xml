    <summary>The proposal is to extend the existing sign/verifymessage format to a more generalized variant relying on the script verification mechanism in Bitcoin itself for message signing/verification, based on the original discussion. This new standard is called the Generic Signed Message Format and has been submitted as BIP 322 by Karl-Johan Alm. The current message signing standard only works for P2PKH (1...) addresses. By extending it to use a Bitcoin Script-based approach, it could be made more generic without causing too much burden on implementers who most likely have access to Bitcoin Script interpreters already. The Generic Signed Message Format introduces a new structure SignatureProof that is added as a simple serializable scriptSig &amp; witnessProgram container. Two actions, "Sign" and "Verify," are defined. The specification also outlines the steps for signing and verifying messages. The proposal can be extended to handle proof of funds using the message prefix "POF:", followed by a newline-terminated string, and a series of hex-encoded transaction ID:vout pairs. The proposal is not backwards compatible with the legacy signmessage/verifymessage specification but can be used with legacy addresses (1...) without any problems.The specification is still in the draft stage and no comments have been posted yet.
