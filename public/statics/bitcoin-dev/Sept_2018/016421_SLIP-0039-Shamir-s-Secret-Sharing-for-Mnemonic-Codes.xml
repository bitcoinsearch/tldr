    <summary>A new specification for splitting BIP-32 master seeds into multiple mnemonics using Shamir's secret sharing scheme is being written, and feedback is desired. The document can be found on Github and the focus should be on the "Master secret derivation functions" section. Christopher Allen and several companies and communities are interested in this, and he has some questions and suggestions. He asks about other teams or communities besides Trezor who are committed to standardizing a Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme. He also suggests incorporating the Lightning Network community's ability to have a birthday in the seed, which makes it easier to scan the blockchain for keys. Additionally, he suggests using his BIP-39 2048 word compatible word list filtered for memorability and iambic pentameter poetry.</summary>
