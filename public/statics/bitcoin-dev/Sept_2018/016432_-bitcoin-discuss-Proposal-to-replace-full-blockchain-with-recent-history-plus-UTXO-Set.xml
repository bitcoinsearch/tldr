    <summary>A proposal to replace the full blockchain with recent history plus UTXO set has been discussed on the Bitcoin mailing list. The idea suggests that if a UTXO block set type existed, then every so often, a bunch of blocks containing just the validated UTXO set to a given height could be appended onto the valid chain and nodes would be free to drop all preceding blocks. This could save a lot of storage and make it easier to run a full node. However, this has consensus implications, and there are bugs (some of which are fixed in later commits to that repository). The email also includes links to an implementation of UTXO loading and a script for the open-source Game-of-Life software Golly. A video was shared showing the game playing out into an apron-shaped image, and the author offered to send $50 worth of bitcoin to anyone who could provide them with a UTXO Set from the bitcoin client.</summary>
