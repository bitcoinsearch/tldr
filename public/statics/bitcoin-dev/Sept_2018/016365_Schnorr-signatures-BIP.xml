    <summary>On September 5th, 2018, Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev reposted a broken scheme originally posted on Bitcointalk. However, there was no response to the original post. The scheme is an M-of-N Bitcoin multisig solution. Despite the author's assertion that it is "so trivial nobody really talks about it," the vague proposal raises concerns about security and functionality. The proposed solution either does not work at all or is less secure than existing solutions. In contrast, musig provides proper delineation and interaction for a secure and functional multisig solution. When Pieter Wuille suggests a CAS implementation, he refers to a Sage notebook that allows for precise communication in both directions.</summary>
