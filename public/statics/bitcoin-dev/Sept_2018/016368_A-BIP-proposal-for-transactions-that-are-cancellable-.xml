    <summary>A proposal to extend OP_CSV (and/or OP_CLTV) in a new BIP has been put forward by Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa, Önder Gürcan and Sara Tucci-Piergiovanni. The proposal suggests allowing negative values to be interpreted in order to increase user fairness. By using a multisig option with a locktime pre-signed transaction that is broadcastable at the 24h mark, users can have different spendability without introducing reorg-induced invalidity. The implementation of this proposal should not be too difficult as it simply involves considering negative values that are currently discarded under the specification of BIP-112. The paper discussing the proposal can be found here: https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-01867357. The authors are seeking discussion before formally proposing the BIP.</summary>
