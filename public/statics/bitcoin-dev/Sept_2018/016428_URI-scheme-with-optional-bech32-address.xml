    <summary>A proposal for the adoption of bech32 QR codes in the Bitcoin network has been shared on Reddit. The proposal suggests that QR code adoption is important, but bech32 QR codes are not backward compatible and therefore many merchants and exchanges are opting for P2SH address QR codes instead. The proposed solution is a URI format which includes both bech32 and P2SH address options, allowing wallets to autopay using the lower transaction fee associated with bech32 addresses. The hope is that increased usage of bech32 will create a network effect and ultimately lead to widespread adoption of bech32 QR codes.</summary>
