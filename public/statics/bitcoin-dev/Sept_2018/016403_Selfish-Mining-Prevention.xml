    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list has proposed adding "reserve fees" to help prevent mining centralization. The idea is that each user can specify the fraction of their transaction fee that is held in reserve for a set period, such as 2,016 blocks. If a miner or group of miners attempts to drive out competition by increasing their hashrate, the reserve fees would be released to other miners until the contract expires. The proposal is voluntary and requires a soft fork, but could help incentivize miners to avoid colluding. Another member suggested an alternative solution called Helper Blocks, which randomly assigns one satoshi from the unspent transaction output set with the power to generate a Helper Block that commits to a subset of transactions for inclusion in the next block. Miners who do not use the Helper Block must satisfy a 25% higher difficulty.</summary>
