    <summary>In this conversation, the participants discuss the proposed BIP151 encryption for Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol. They agree that obfuscating the key exchange is important but achieving DPI robustness is out of scope. They suggest using TOR with OBFS4 and deterministic rekeying rules to address all-or-none censorship situations. The proposed encryption adds robustness to the threat model at low costs and low risks. They also discuss the use of chacha20-poly1305 and padding to hide message length without much overhead. They suggest using short IDs instead of ASCII commands for small messages that are used often. The conversation highlights the need for clearer specifications in the BIP, including what to do if MAC verification fails, how to handle even keys, and how to form a 64-bit nonce from one or two uint32. Pseudocode could help clarify some of these issues.</summary>
