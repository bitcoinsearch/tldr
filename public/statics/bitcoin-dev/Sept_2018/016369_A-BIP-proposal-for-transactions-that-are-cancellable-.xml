    <summary>A proposal has been made to extend OP_CSV and/or OP_CLTV in order to allow and interpret negative values. The proposal uses the negative bit value to increase fairness for users and make modifications more cost-effective. The implementation should not be too tedious as it simply implies considering negative values that are at the moment discarded as for the specification of BIP-112, leaving the sign bit unused. The authors of the proposal have prepared a text for the BIP and are seeking discussion before proposing it. They argue that breaking a principle where a transaction remains valid could lead to dangerous repercussions, such as a chain of transactions becoming invalid and resulting in losses. The paper discussing the proposal can be found here: https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-01867357.</summary>
