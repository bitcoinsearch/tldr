    <summary>The TREZOR team is writing a new specification for splitting BIP-32 master seeds into multiple mnemonics using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. The team has requested feedback on the high-level design of the new specification, with a focus on the "Master secret derivation functions" section of the document. The proposed solutions are being presented as a work in progress and technical details have not yet been fully specified. The team has provided a Design Rationale section at the end of the document to answer any questions that may arise. Feedback and suggestions from interested parties are encouraged and welcomed.</summary>
