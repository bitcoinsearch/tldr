    <summary>Recently, Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 was released with a fix for CVE-2018-17144, and Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-core-dev urged all network participants to upgrade to this version as soon as possible. However, some people are questioning the hype and hysteria about "everybody" must immediately upgrade to 0.16.3 when the bugfix can be backported to earlier versions. There is also no effort to correct this misinformation being spread on forums and Reddit. For those who build from source, the 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, and master branches on GitHub are also fixed.</summary>
