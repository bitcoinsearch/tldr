    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has discussed how transactions fees can guide towards a more censorship-resistant outcome. Transactions with a fee attached incentivize miners to add the transaction to the blockchain and get paid. Transactions from Bitcoin Core are only valid at a block height that is one higher than the last block, which incentivizes miners to build on top of the last block instead of reorganizing the blockchain. BIP 115 enables users to create transactions that are only valid if they are mined on top of a specific block, increasing the cost of intentionally reorganizing the blockchain. Coinjoin combines payments of multiple users into a single transaction, making it more difficult for miners to censor a single payment. A theoretical scenario where every block contains only a single coinjoin transaction, the validity of which depends on the inclusion of a specific previous block, could lead to a more empowered user base benefitting censorship resistance. However, this scenario is not easy to achieve in practice.</summary>
