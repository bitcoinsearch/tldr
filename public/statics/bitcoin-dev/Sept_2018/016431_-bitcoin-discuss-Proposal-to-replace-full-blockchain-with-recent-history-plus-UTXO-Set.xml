    <title>[bitcoin-discuss] Proposal to replace full blockchain with recent history plus UTXO Set</title>

    <summary>The proposal suggests relieving full nodes of storing the entire blockchain by using a UTXO set that is recognizable by humans at a certain block height. This would save storage and make it easier to run a full node. A utxo block set type could be appended onto the valid chain every so often, containing just the validated utxo set to a given height, say 100,000 blocks below the current blockheight, and necessary header data. Nodes would be free to drop all preceding blocks, but many may still desire to download the full blockchain. The proposal also mentions using the correct Merkle root for block 542322 instead of 542324 to see the correct Game of Life play out and make the apron image. The author offers $50 of Bitcoin to anyone who can tell them how to get a UTXO set from the Bitcoin client and send them the SHA256 hash of that set. The aim is to make a recognizable checkpoint for the Bitcoin blockchain, making it easier for more people to start running full nodes in the future.</summary>
