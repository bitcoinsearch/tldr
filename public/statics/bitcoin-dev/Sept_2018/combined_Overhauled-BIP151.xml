    <summary>The discussion in the Bitcoin-dev community revolves around improving privacy and security in Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (p2p) connections. One proposal is to use an ECDH key exchange with an encoding of public keys that provides indistinguishability from random bitstrings. However, this may not actually improve security as Bitcoin traffic is easily identifiable by its traffic patterns. Another proposal is to enhance BIP151, which currently does not add any long-term confidentiality for p2p connections running over Tor.Jonas Schnelli has proposed an overhaul of the BIP151 specification for Bitcoin, which he believes could be further optimized. A new proposal draft is available on GitHub and includes several changes such as a pure 32-byte per-side pseudorandom key exchange before any other communication, removal of the multi-message envelope, a new NODE_ENCRYPTED service bit, specific key derivation and communication direction, and a 3-byte integer for packet length. Short-command IDs have also been introduced to reduce bandwidth usage. Rekeying can now be signaled through the most significant bit in the packet-size field without requiring a message. Additionally, the author is considering adding the Hybrid NewHope key exchange to make the encryption PQ safe with little cost.In this conversation, the participants discuss the proposed BIP151 encryption for Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol. They suggest using TOR with OBFS4 and deterministic rekeying rules to address all-or-none censorship situations. The proposed encryption adds robustness to the threat model at low costs and low risks. They also discuss the use of chacha20-poly1305 and padding to hide message length without much overhead. The conversation highlights the need for clearer specifications in the BIP, including what to do if MAC verification fails, how to handle even keys, and how to form a 64-bit nonce from one or two uint32. Pseudocode could help clarify some of these issues.In a discussion about improving the confidentiality of Tor, Gregory Maxwell suggested that the current implementation provides "no confidentiality at all." He proposed using BIP151 to add some long-term confidentiality hedge. The conversation also touched on the possibility of making the traffic look like any other protocol which uses encryption to avoid censorship. The topic of re-keying was also discussed, with suggestions made for using a ciphersuite that effectively "rekeyed" every message or creating an adhoc construction. There were also suggestions about adding new message types that could contain messages and pads to obfuscate traffic patterns.Overall, the discussions aim to improve the security and privacy of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer connections. Various proposals have been suggested, including enhancements to BIP151 and the use of TOR with OBFS4 and deterministic rekeying rules. The need for clearer specifications in the BIP has been highlighted, along with the use of pseudocode to clarify some issues. The conversation also touched on the possibility of making the traffic look like any other protocol which uses encryption to avoid censorship.</summary>
