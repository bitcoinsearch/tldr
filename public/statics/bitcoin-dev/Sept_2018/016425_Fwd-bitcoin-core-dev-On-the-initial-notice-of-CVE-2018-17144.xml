    <summary>Andrea Suisani claimed on Twitter that the report by awemany was about an inflation bug, contrary to the timeline published. However, Gregory argues that this is not the case as the report specifically stated that inflation was not possible because the node crashed. Additionally, Andrea did not read the tweet properly and misunderstood the context of the discussion. The tweet referred to a Reddit post where awemany, while trying to prove he was the original author of the report, included a timestamped note containing text about BitcoinABC not checking for duplicate inputs when processing a block. This can create money out of thin air. The note was submitted before the report email was sent. Furthermore, Gregory claims that awemany had mentioned that the code seems to prevent the worse outcome of monetary inflation in the report. Awemany prioritized informing Core about the DoS vector identified and proved rather than exploring the idea of exploiting the code to create coins out of thin air.</summary>
