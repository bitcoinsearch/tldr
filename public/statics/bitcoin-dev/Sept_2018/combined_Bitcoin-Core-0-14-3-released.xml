    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.14.3 has been released with a recommendation to upgrade as soon as possible due to the detection of a denial-of-service vulnerability exploitable by miners in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. The new release also includes various bugfixes and performance improvements. Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems, including Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. However, it is not recommended to run the software on Windows XP due to known instabilities and issues. It is stated that Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.The approximate transaction fee shown in Bitcoin-Qt when using coin control and smart fee estimation does not reflect any change in target from the smart fee slider since 0.14.0. The fee calculated using the correct target is still applied to the transaction and shown in the final send confirmation dialog. The release notes outline changes to consensus, RPC and other APIs, P2P protocol and network code, build system, miscellaneous features, GUI, and wallet. The release credits contributors and those who reported security issues.</summary>
