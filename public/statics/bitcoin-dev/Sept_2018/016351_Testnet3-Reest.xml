    <summary>Ryan, a contributor to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, suggested implementing small blocks on testnet to simulate a fee-market-like situation. While recent testnet spam and full blocks have made testing easier, Ryan questions how long this situation will last. Another member of the mailing list, Gregory Maxwell, proposed creating a signed blocks testnet with a structured reorg pattern as an alternative to the current testnet. However, Maxwell notes that this approach previously increased the size of blockindex objects in memory, which could be rectified by turning one of the fields into a union with a pointer to a look-aside block index used only in signed block testnet mode. Such a mode would serve as a middle ground between a regtest that never sees anything surprising and a full on testnet where attempts to test against ordinary noise require coping with the universe being removed and replaced at the whim of some cthulhuian blind idiot god.</summary>
