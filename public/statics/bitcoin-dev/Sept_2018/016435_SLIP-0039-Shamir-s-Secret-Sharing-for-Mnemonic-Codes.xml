    <summary>A developer working on a new specification for splitting BIP-32 master seeds into multiple mnemonics using Shamir's secret sharing scheme has reached out to get feedback on the design from the Bitcoin development community. The developer asks that readers focus their attention on the section entitled "Master secret derivation functions," which proposes several different solutions. The document is currently a work in progress and some technical details have yet to be fully specified, but will be completed once the high-level design has been settled. Christopher Allen responded with great interest in this proposal as it relates to his previous work on improving mnemonic word lists. He also asked several questions about the design of the scheme, including what other teams or communities are committed to standardizing a Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme, where discussions should take place, and how adversarial problems associated with recovery of a SSS can be mitigated.</summary>
