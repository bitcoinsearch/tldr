    <summary>A proposal by Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa about enhancing OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY to allow outputs that are spendable by Alice until time foo, always spendable by Bob, and spendable by Joe only after time bar or other such cases was shared in an email chain. Brandon Smith responded that any UTXO spending a script with an expiration must be treated similarly to Coinbase. He proposed a solution to this, but it's complex and may have unforeseen implications. All existing software assumes that a transaction once valid stays valid, so any proposal to change this must ensure that existing wallets and users aren't immediately open to being scammed by malicious actors sending low fee expiring transactions. It was suggested that the more tenable ways to move forward on improving the ecosystem around delayed transactions and refunds are: Lightning, improved fee estimation, and improved mempool eviction/re-propagation resistance. The original reason for looking into this was because during high fee periods, transactions could re-propagate between mempools of differing policies resulting in coins being stuck unusable for far longer than the expected 1-2 week eviction. However, no concrete work is known to be going into investigating or improving this issue.</summary>
