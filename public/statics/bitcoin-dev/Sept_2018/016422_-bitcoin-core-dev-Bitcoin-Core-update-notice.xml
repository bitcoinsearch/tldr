    <summary>Recently, a bug fix for CVE-2018-17144 was released in Bitcoin Core 0.16.3. This update has been recommended to all network participants and the patch can be backported to earlier versions as well. However, the backported versions are still undergoing the Gitian build process and have not been released yet. Even though it is not misinformation that everybody must upgrade, there has been some hype/hysteria about upgrading immediately to 0.16.3, which has been discussed on forums and Reddit. Despite this, efforts to correct this misinformation are yet to be seen. Those who build from source can also access the fixed versions of 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, and master branches on GitHub.</summary>
