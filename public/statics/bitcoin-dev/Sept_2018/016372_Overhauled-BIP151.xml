    <summary>The author of the message has commented on various aspects of Bitcoin's security and suggested improvements. The post-quantum key exchange is considered overkill and may hinder adoption. Instead, it is suggested to have a simple ECDH key exchange with an encoding of public keys that provides indistinguishability from random bitstrings. A better key derivation method is proposed to avoid issues such as an attacker rerandomizing public keys. Deterministic rekeying rules are preferred over signalling re-keying in the length field as signal bits can be flipped by attackers. The lack of clarity in some areas of the protocol is pointed out, and suggestions for improvement are provided. Pseudocode is suggested to help understand the protocol better.</summary>
