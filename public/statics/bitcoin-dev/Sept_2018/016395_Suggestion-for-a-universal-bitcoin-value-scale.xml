    <summary>Martin Damgaard, an individual unfamiliar with the normal BIP procedures, has suggested a universal bitcoin value color scale to tackle the same decimal problem identified by the BIP 176 proposal. His suggestion aims to create a new attack vector by color-coding something to appear as more than it really is, and he has attached the document in three different formats for convenience. The proposal was sent via email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on August 19th, 2018.</summary>
