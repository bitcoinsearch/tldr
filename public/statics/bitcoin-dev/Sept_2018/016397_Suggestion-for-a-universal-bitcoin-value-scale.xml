    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list thread, Clark shared his opinion on the use of Bitcoin on the street. He emphasized the importance of observing how local wallet software displays bitcoin amounts and letting the standards write themselves over time. Clark also mentioned that the units debate has been ongoing for nearly as long as he has known about Bitcoin, but most tools display standard bitcoin amounts. In response to an earlier suggestion for a universal bitcoin value color scale, Karl-Johan Alm pointed out that it could potentially be a new attack vector. Martin Damgaard, the author of the initial suggestion, later retracted it due to this and other good remarks.</summary>
