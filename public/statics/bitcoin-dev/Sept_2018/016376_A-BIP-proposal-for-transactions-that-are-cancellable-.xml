    <summary>In an email thread, Alejandro suggests enhancing OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY to allow outputs that are spendable by Alice until a certain time, always spendable by Bob, and spendable by Joe only after a different specified time. He proposes adding an additional argument to OP_zzz to define the timelimit for Alice to keep the coin before ownership is transferred to Bob. Alejandro wonders if this approach would be considered harmful and asks for feedback. Brandon Smith responds with a link to a previous proposal he made on a similar topic seven months prior.</summary>
