    <summary>A new specification for splitting BIP-32 master seeds into multiple mnemonics using Shamir's secret sharing scheme is currently being written and open for feedback. The proposed solutions are available in the "Master secret derivation functions" section of the document found on Github. There are concerns regarding the complexity of Shamir Secret Sharing, and some companies and communities such as #RebootingWebOfTrust are interested in standardizing the scheme. Discussions can be held on the mailing list or issues in the SLIPS repo. Adversarial problems may arise during recovery of a SSS, such as impersonation of a reassembly request and MitM of a reassembly request, causing potential DOS attacks. Lightning Network community has added the ability to have a birthday in the seed for easier scanning of the blockchain for keys and a byte with a way to derive key paths. Chris Vickery worked on ways to improve mnemonic word lists and has created an iambic pentameter poetry-inspired word list filtered for memorability and suitability located on Github. The CMU dictitionary, top 5000 words, concrete word lists, and emotional words can be incorporated into the criteria for replicating what was done.</summary>
