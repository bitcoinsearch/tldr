    <summary>The author has been working on HTLC scripts and experimenting with a format tag for BIP 174 to support them. The proposed format involves adding a new input type that defines elements to be inserted in the final p2sh/p2wsh stack such as preimage or refund path flags. The process starts with creating a blank PSBT, updating it with redeem/witness scripts, sighashes, and partial signatures. Additional stack elements are then attached for non-signature elements, followed by finalization to create the final scriptSig and/or witness. Finally, the signed transaction is extracted for broadcast. The author acknowledges that this approach may be overly generic and asks if anyone else has considered using PSBTs in an HTLC context.</summary>
