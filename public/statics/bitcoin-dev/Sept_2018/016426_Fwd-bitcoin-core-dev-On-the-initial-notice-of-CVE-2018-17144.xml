    <summary>In this email thread, sickpig is questioning Andrea Suisani's claim on Twitter that the report by awemany was a report of an inflation bug, in contrast to the timeline they published. Sickpig provides the URL of the tweet and suggests that perhaps Andrea did not read it properly. Sickpig also mentions that awemany had stated in the report that the assert(is_spent) function "seems" to prevent monetary inflation. Sickpig further speculates that awemany may have prioritized informing Core about the DoS vector he identified rather than exploring the idea of creating coins out of thin air. However, there is confusion about whether awemany knew about the possibility of causing inflation or not.</summary>
