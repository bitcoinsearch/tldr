    <summary>Carlo Spiller, a Bitcoin user since 2014, has proposed an activation proposal for Taproot on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. His proposal involves deploying with LOT=false and an activation threshold of 95% miner signaling. If after six months Taproot is not activated by MASF but at least 80% of hash power signaled for the upgrade, LOT gets a lock-in date another six months later and the threshold for MASF is lowered to 90%. If 80% is not reached, the proposal expires. The Simple Majority Activation proposal (SMA) has a final activation threshold set to 51%, which removes the incentive to do a user-activated soft fork (UASF). Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces replied to Carlo's proposal, stating that SMA is similar to Carlo's proposal, except it has the final activation threshold set to 51%. However, he highlighted the problem with Carlo's proposal, which is that users don't know what to do if signaling is between 51% to 79%. A UASF can scare everyone else because they may be at risk of big reorgs to gain traction and followers. With the same proposal but the final threshold set to 51% instead of 80%, there can't be risk of a UASF because if 51% is not reached, they know they don't have enough miner support to keep the chain together.Carlo hopes to bring something new to the table as he now runs his own full node and follows development. The problem with Carlo's proposal is that users cannot activate Taproot if signaling is between 51% to 79%. The users that want to promote a UASF know that their miner majority can activate Taproot and activate without the 21% to 49% of miners needing to signal. A UASF movement needs to hard fork anyway to change the PoW (for protection) and change addresses to prevent double spends if support is less than 50%. A UASF with a miner majority can scare everyone else about them being at risk of big reorgs to gain traction and followers.</summary>
