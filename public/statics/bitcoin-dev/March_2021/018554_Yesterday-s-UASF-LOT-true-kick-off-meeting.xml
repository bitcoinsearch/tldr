    <title>Yesterday’s UASF (LOT=true) kick off meeting</title>

    <summary>A group of developers are posing a risk to the activation of Taproot, as they believe that conservative tones and endless philosophy talks make Bitcoin a dying and decaying system. The threat is a loud minority of users who are threatening to co-opt a LOT=false activation by switching the parameter and organizing a marketing blitz that could end in a fork if things don't go well. As long as this threat persists, consensus cannot be reached and an activation client probably won't be released. The writer suggests that Bitcoin should stay as is until the minority forks off with their own alt-node. If the UASF minority is set on creating the alt-node, then the writer hopes it's released quickly so the deadlock can break.</summary>
