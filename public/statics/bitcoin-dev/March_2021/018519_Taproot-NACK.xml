    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion, LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH expressed concerns over the supposed operation of Taproot, which may enable Monero-like features including the ability to hide transactions. However, Jeremy Rubin responded that Taproot does not enable such privacy features any more than already exist in Bitcoin today. It merely makes transactions with embedded smart contracts less expensive and marginally improves privacy dependent on user behavior. Taproot does nothing inherently to obfuscate the transaction graph as in Monero.Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces questioned HRMH's promotion of a Bitcoin mixer through his link in the signature block, which appears to contradict his concerns over increased privacy in Bitcoin. While HRMH insisted that the use of a Bitcoin Mixer is to enable equivalent privacy for cash, Lorenzo-Luaces requested clarification on HRMH's association with the mixer and urged him to always do proper disclosure when publicly talking about Bitcoin transaction privacy.HRMH disclosed his affiliation with Jambler.io, whose Bitcoin Mixer 2.0 he promotes through his referral website. The partner mixer is run by Jambler.io, and HRMH receives a service referral fee but not any part of the process transaction. He also provided links to the operation block diagram and installation script provided by Jambler.io, as well as their disclosure for the partner program. All partner profits are reportable on personal income tax.HRMH reiterated the importance of maintaining consensus values and the transparency of the blockchain wherein all transactions are published in an immutable record, and that forbids the redaction of information by any obfuscation. Nonetheless, users should not be compelled to reveal details of the content of their wallet publicly.</summary>
