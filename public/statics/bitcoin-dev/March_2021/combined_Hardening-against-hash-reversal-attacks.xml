    <summary>An email has been sent out suggesting the exploration of options to harden Bitcoin against potential attacks on RSA, ECDSA, and sha256. While the ideas presented are not deeply technical, they may inspire discussion for new BIPs. Some of the suggested defense strategies include alternate hashing methods, per address seed phrases, removing private keys from a wallet for safe storage in a separate location, completely removing wallets from the blockchain for 'absolute' cold storage (if technically possible), and burning old coins and generating 'new' coins to reset transaction history through a "Burn and Reissue" FIFO queue with set miner fees. The main goal is to prevent potential attacks as prevention is better than cure. However, the email acknowledges that these ideas are challenging and may be contentious.</summary>
