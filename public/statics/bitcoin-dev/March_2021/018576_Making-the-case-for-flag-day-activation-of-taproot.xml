    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is about the LOT parameter for soft fork activation. The argument is between those who support and oppose the forced signaling in LOT=true. The debate centers around two important principles: allowing everyone to operate on the contract they accepted when entering the system or protecting against protocol sclerosis. One question raised is whether miners have a higher obligation than economic nodes to evaluate upgrades. The LOT parameter would make this explicit. However, some argue that there was never any contract, and even full nodes must upgrade in a soft fork, or they lose their security and become comparable to light wallets. The ultimate question is which principle is more important for Bitcoin's long-term future.</summary>
