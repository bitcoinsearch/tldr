    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin Core contributor, has proposed collecting a survey on Taproot's usage. He believes there are many people tinkering with Taproot in conceptual, prototype, or implemented/spec phases, and wants to get insight into what sort of things people are excited about. Jeremy has requested interested parties to add their information to the Taproot Uses Wiki page.</summary>
