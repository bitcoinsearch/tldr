    <summary>In an email exchange regarding Taproot NACK, JAMES HRMH raised an objection to ZmnSCPxj's previous statement that verifiable and independently scrutinizable are not the same. However, ZmnSCPxj argued that the involved parties ultimately publish the data on the blockchain, which result in independently validatable data. In fact, creating summaries of multiple actions without revealing details has become a general class of techniques used to reduce the data pushed onchain for both scalability and privacy reasons. Various methods can be used to support the central point of preventing uncontrolled forgery in Bitcoin, including openly publishing cleartext amount values or using homomorphisms between a cleartext and a ciphertext. Nonetheless, any privacy improvement Taproot buys will still not allow fraud.</summary>
