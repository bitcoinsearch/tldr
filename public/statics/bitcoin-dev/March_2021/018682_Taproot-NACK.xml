    <summary>In this context, there is a discussion regarding the necessary goal of a public blockchain. The writer argues that the only necessary property to prove in a UTXO is that it does not create more coins than what was designed. The exact value, public key, and purpose of spending are not necessary to prove. The only thing necessary to prove is that inputs equal outputs plus a fee. It is immaterial if one can prove any other property as long as the goal is to prevent uncontrolled forgery. The writer also notes that this problem existed long before the existence of Bitcoin and suggests laying out the definition of fraud explicitly if it is broader.</summary>
