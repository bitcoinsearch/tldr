    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin Core contributor, is looking to gather information on Taproot's usage. He believes that there are many people who are experimenting with Taproot in conceptual, prototype, or implemented/spec phases, and wants to gain insight into what excites them about this technology. To achieve this, Rubin has suggested conducting a survey, and has requested interested parties to add their information to the Taproot Uses Wiki page.Taproot is a proposed upgrade to Bitcoin that aims to enhance privacy, scalability, and security by introducing new scripting capabilities. It utilizes Schnorr signatures to enable more efficient multi-signature transactions, and reduces transaction size by combining multiple signature types into one. With Taproot, it is possible to hide complex scripts within single public keys, making transactions appear simpler and less suspicious.Rubin's call for a survey comes at a time when Taproot is gaining momentum among developers and miners alike. Its activation requires support from at least 90% of the network's hash power, and discussions are ongoing regarding how best to achieve this consensus. The survey may provide valuable insights into the community's interests and concerns, and help guide the implementation of Taproot in the future.In conclusion, Jeremy Rubin is seeking to collect data on Taproot's usage through a survey, as he believes that many people are experimenting with this technology in various stages. Taproot is a proposed upgrade to Bitcoin that promises to enhance privacy, scalability, and security, and has gained traction among developers and miners. The survey may provide useful information for future implementations of Taproot, and could inform ongoing discussions around achieving consensus for its activation. Those interested in contributing to the survey can do so by adding their information to the Taproot Uses Wiki page.</summary>
