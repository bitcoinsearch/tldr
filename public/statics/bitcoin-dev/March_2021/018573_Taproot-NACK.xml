    <summary>In a recent discussion on bitcoin-dev, there was concern raised about the potential for obfuscation of the Pay To address through the use of complex scripts. However, it was pointed out that this is no different from options available in P2SH or from generating a new address for a payment.The concern over complex scripts stems from the fact that they can make it more difficult to trace transactions and identify the parties involved. However, it was noted that P2SH also allows for obfuscation of the Pay To address, as does generating a new address for each payment.While these options may make it more difficult to trace transactions, they also provide legitimate uses such as privacy and security for users. It was suggested that rather than trying to limit the use of complex scripts, efforts should be focused on developing tools and techniques to better trace transactions and identify bad actors.Overall, the discussion highlights the ongoing debate within the Bitcoin community around balancing the need for privacy and security with the desire for greater transparency and accountability.</summary>
