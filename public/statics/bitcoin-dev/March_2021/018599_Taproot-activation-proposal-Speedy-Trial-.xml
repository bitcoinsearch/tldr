    <summary>The email exchange between Michael Folkson and Matt Corallo discusses the potential risks of a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) during a "Speedy Trial" deployment. While both parties agree that a UASF during this time would be ill-advised, they cannot guarantee that others will not attempt it. Additionally, there is concern that if the activation fails, there may be a significant delay before activation occurs. One proposed alternative is to reduce the signaling windows and start them later to increase the likelihood of success. The parameters for the Speedy Trial are currently being discussed on IRC, and Folkson encourages Corallo to engage in those discussions. Folkson also notes that all proposals put forward by Corallo suffer from chain split risk in the face of a competing incompatible activation mechanism.</summary>
