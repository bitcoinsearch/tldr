    <summary>In an email conversation, Andrew from the Lonero Foundation discussed his aim to tackle cryptography in a way that goes beyond energy consumption. He is working on lowering invalid proofs while trying to get the best of both worlds in regards to PoW and PoC. The goal is to make PoC cryptographically compatible with PoW as it normally stands. Andrew has suggested looking at his entire proposal, which he hopes to draft out on GitHub if granted permission by the BIP team. Eric Voskuil responded with questions regarding the reduction of cryptography cost and its effect on energy consumption. Eric argues that non-staking attempts to improve energy efficiency are either proof of work in disguise or wasteful computing attempts. Additionally, he states that waste and renewable energy approaches at "carbon" reduction must still consume the same in cost as the reward. However, Andrew believes that Andrew's idea could still be beneficial for Bitcoin improvement. Andrew also mentioned that Bitcoin still needs upgrading in terms of cryptography and hashing algorithm to prevent it from being entirely broken in the future. He aims to build cryptography in a way that prevents such an event from happening if it ever occurs. Andrew has various research in regards to this area and works a lot with distributed computing. If the BTC community likes his proposal, he would single-handedly be able to build the cryptographic proof himself.</summary>
