    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list suggests that breaking an ECC key with quantum techniques may take a longer time due to the difficulty of maintaining the quantum state for a longer period. However, it is possible to use more quantum computers or attempts to scale up and make a month's worth of attempts in an hour. The attack would be probabilistic and scalable, similar to mining. It is also suggested that mounting a "fast" quantum attack may require energy approaching that required for mining, making it easier to just 51% the network without developing practical quantum computers.</summary>
