    <summary>The activation mechanism for taproot, as well as future soft-forks, is crucial to achieving consensus in the Bitcoin community. It is important to approach this topic with patience and calm, avoiding rushing into ill-considered decisions. Incremental improvements should be made, treating the topic with decorum and providing tight non-emotive reasoning. Failure to upgrade could be a systemic risk, demoralizing to protocol researchers, and potentially counter to Bitcoin user and investor interests. While achieving consensus can be tricky, an incorruptible machine that gathers the highest fee transactions from the mempool and posts them every 10 minutes could largely run Bitcoin itself. The mindset should be towards reaching an endgame where forks become a diminishing issue over time.</summary>
