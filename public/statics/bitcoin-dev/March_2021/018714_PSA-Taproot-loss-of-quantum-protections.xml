    <summary>Erik Aronesty from bitcoin-dev has proposed the idea of Bitcoin using zero-knowledge proofs to transition to quantum resistance. This proposal has sparked a discussion within the community about the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this plan. While there is interest in exploring this problem, it is not clear whether this is a good idea. One question that arises is whether a more efficient solution than a zero-knowledge proof is desirable, which could involve committing to a real public key of a simple post-quantum signature scheme such as a hash-based one-time signature scheme like Winternitz or W-OTS+ signatures. Further research and discussion are needed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposal.</summary>
