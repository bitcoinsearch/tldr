    <summary>The email discusses the tradeoff between time and space in integrating memory hard compatibility with mining algorithms. The author argues that memory hardness prevents the tradeoff by requiring a certain amount of memory, which makes it impossible to create smaller miners that take longer to mine. Additionally, the author suggests that any fixed program will always take less resources to run than a general-purpose computing device. Thus, if a specific algorithm is ever established, ASICs will arise that will run the algorithm faster and consume less energy than general-purpose hardware. The inevitability of ASICs and other specialized hardware is compared to the specialization of humans in their daily lives.</summary>
