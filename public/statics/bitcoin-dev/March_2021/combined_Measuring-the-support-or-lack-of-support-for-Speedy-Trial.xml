    <summary>The author has created a GitHub document to gather community feedback on the Speedy Trial activation proposal. The document is not a vote, but rather an opportunity for people to contribute their opinions and additional context with an ACK or NACK. The author encourages others to create their own methods of collecting feedback and share their findings on the mailing list or IRC channel. The author's contact information is also provided for further communication. This approach is intended to measure support for the proposal and help inform the decision-making process.</summary>
