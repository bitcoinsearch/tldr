    <summary>The author of the email suggests that a follow-up deployment should be scheduled around Speedy Trial (ST), as details around it are still unclear and dependent on its results. The activation proposal for ST has gained community consensus and is expected to be merged into Core soon, but until then, the finalization of startheight and timeout for ST cannot be determined. The author believes that any UASF release should fit around a Speedy Trial deployment in Core, and they would oppose any release that conflicts with or is not compatible with it. In response to a message from Luke Dashjr regarding the overlap of the last period before timeoutheight with the current BIP8(True) deployment plan, the author proposes moving the ST window one period earlier. Community feedback on the matter can be found in the provided link. The author's contact information is also included at the end of the email.</summary>
