    <summary>The Bitcoin development team is discussing parameter selection for the upcoming release, targeting a May 1st release date with activation on November 15th. If heights are selected, the first signaling period would be at block 683424 and the stop height would be at block 695520. If times are selected, they should target a mid-period MTP with a start time of May 7th at 1300 UTC and a stop time of August 13th at 1300 UTC. The team discusses potential mediantimes to ensure compatibility between the selected parameters and MTP logic. There is also discussion about adding a day to the selected times. The team notes that blocks are more likely to arrive earlier than later due to increasing hashrate.</summary>
