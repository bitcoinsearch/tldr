    <summary>The previous meeting had agreed on BIP8 activation parameters for Taproot except for LOT, assuming a release would occur around this time. However, since there has been no release yet, the new idea of Speedy Trial has been proposed to replace the original/main activation plan. The upcoming meeting agenda includes discussing the proposal for Speedy Trial and adjusting the timeline since the current draft conflicts with the original plan timeline. Post ST main activation moving startheight (and timeoutheight?) later is recommended due to insufficient progress made and to avoid conflict with the current ST draft. Additionally, more people need to get actively involved in materialising the main activation plan if it's going to move forward. This should not wait for ST to complete unless another 4-5 month slip of the timeline is acceptable. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 16th at the usual time of 19:00 UTC in freenode's ##Taproot-activation IRC channel. It may be postponed if turnout is low. The channel is open for ongoing discussion 24/7 with a web chat client available.</summary>
