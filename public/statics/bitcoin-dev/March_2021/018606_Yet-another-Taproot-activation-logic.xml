    <summary>A Bitcoin user since 2014, Carlo, expresses concern over the activation of LOT=false after witnessing miners' unwillingness to activate SegWit truly. He proposes an alternative solution which includes deploying with LOT=false and an activation threshold of 95% miner signaling, followed by a lock-in date another 6 months later if at least 80% of hashpower signaled for the upgrade but Taproot is not activated by MASF. If 80% is not reached, the proposal expires. This way, only 6 months are lost if miners do not signal at all before a new activation logic can be deployed. Carlo hopes to bring something new to the table as he now runs his own full node and follows development.</summary>
