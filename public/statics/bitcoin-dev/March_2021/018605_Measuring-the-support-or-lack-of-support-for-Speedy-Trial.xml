    <summary>The author has set up a document on GitHub to measure support for the Speedy Trial activation proposal and is asking for contributions of ACK or NACK with any necessary qualifications or additional context. The document is not a vote but rather an attempt to collect community feedback on the proposal. The author welcomes others to create their own feedback collection methods and report back to the mailing list or IRC channel. The author's contact information is also provided for further communication.</summary>
