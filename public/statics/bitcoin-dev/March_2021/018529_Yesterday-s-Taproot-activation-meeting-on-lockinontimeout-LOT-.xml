    <summary>On March 1, 2021, Erik Aronesty proposed a method of reducing the percentage of miners required for lock-in over time, which Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces agreed was a good idea. However, Ariel cautioned against a chain split of a low percentage of users and recommended changing the final percentage to 50% because non-upgraded users must activate to avoid the risk of being reorged. Ariel believed that the safest choice is LOT=true, but he wouldn't move to hold back a plan of LOT=false. During segwit, users started by cooperating (BIP9 or "LOT=false"), then a minority of miners didn't cooperate (small veto but remember the majority of miners cooperated), then users stopped cooperating in response (UASF), then miners reverted to cooperating (MASF while intolerant miners forked off). Today, users should start cooperating again to continue using the optimal strategy.</summary>
