    <summary>A proposal has been made for the activation of Taproot, which aims to implement an idea on top of Bitcoin Core's existing BIP9 code or its proposed BIP8 patchset. The activation proposal is much fuzzier and dependent on the results of ST itself. False signaling is one of the additional concerns of Speedy Trial, as it encourages miners to signal readiness to enforce rules that their nodes don't actually support. This could lead to long reorgs and unprepared miners losing significant amounts of money if most of them fail to upgrade by the activation date several months later. However, compared to other activation proposals, false signaling is possible with any other proposal, and the same problems can occur if miners fail to upgrade for any mandatory activation.Andrew Chow has suggested scheduling a follow-up deployment around the Taproot activation window. Luke Dashjr proposed moving up the ST window by one period to avoid the overlap with the current BIP8 deployment plan. David A. Harding also suggested a modification of the "Let's see what happens" activation proposal which would allow for nodes to begin counting blocks towards the 90% threshold required to lock in Taproot shortly after the release of software containing this proposed activation logic.One of the advantages of Speedy Trial is that miners are not required to signal at any time. This includes no mandatory signaling during the locked_in period(s), although such signaling will be encouraged. Another advantage is that users, developers, and organizations could get up to six months advanced notice of taproot activation, allowing them to prepare software, announcements, and celebrations for that event.Initial discussion about implementation may be found in today's ##taproot-activation log. If it appears Speedy Trial may have traction, Russell O'Connor has offered to work on a patch against BIP8 implementing it. The original idea for a short-duration attempt was discussed in the ##taproot-activation IRC channel last July, and the revised idea saw additional evaluation there this week.The contributors to this proposal should be commended for their overwhelmingly constructive discussion, including Adam Gibson, Andrew Chow, Anthony Towns, Chris Belcher, Jeremy Rubin, Jonas Nick, Luke Dashjr, Michael Folkson, Russell O'Connor, and IRC users maybehuman and proofofkeags.</summary>
