    <summary>In an email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrew from Lonero Foundation proposed a cryptography upgrade for Bitcoin which he believes could benefit both servers and ASIC specific hardware. He suggested submitting a BIP pull request for a draft via GitHub using BIP #2's draft format, which would allow people to ask questions in the request's comments without having to receive emails every time there is a reply. Andrew also mentioned that a large portion of BTC is already mined through AWS servers and non-ASIC specific hardware, so a hybrid proof wouldn't disenfranchise currently optimized mining entities.However, Keagan McClelland questioned the outlandish claim that a large percentage of nodes running on AWS, and that a hard fork in the hashing algorithm would invalidate the enormous amount of capital expenditure by mining entities and disincentivize future capital expenditure into mining hardware. Andrew responded that his cryptography proposal helps tackle problems such as NP-Completeness or Halting, which is something the BTC network could be vulnerable to in the future.Andrew wants to integrate some form of NP complexity in regards to the hybrid cryptography he's aiming to provide which includes a polynomial time algorithm in the cryptography. His goal outside of efficiency is to build cryptography in a way that prevents mathematical proofs from being entirely broken in the future, if it was to ever happen. Andrew hopes to send his BIP soon and asked the preferred format.</summary>
