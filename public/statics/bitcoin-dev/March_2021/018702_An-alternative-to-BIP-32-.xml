    <summary>The safety of a HD wallet scheme was questioned by vjudeu in an email to bitcoin-dev. The scheme can be specified in just three lines, without even defining the security goals. In response, Tim stated that it would not be safe to assume the implementation of such a scheme is secure. His comment may come across as harsh, but it is important to prioritize safety when it comes to cryptocurrency wallets. It is crucial for developers to thoroughly test and verify the security of any new implementations before use.</summary>
