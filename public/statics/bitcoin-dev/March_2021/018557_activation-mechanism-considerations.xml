    <summary>In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, John Rand emphasized the importance of achieving consensus for both taproot and the activation mechanism. He highlighted the need for positive progress on the activation topic without rushing anything ill-considered, as not all future soft-forks may be as widely supported as taproot. Rand stressed that it could become existentially critical that Bitcoin prevails in achieving a future upgrade in dramatic circumstances, even against powerful interests counter to Bitcoin user and investors' interests. He called for the activation topic to be treated in a considered way and with decorum, providing tight non-emotive reasoning devoid of frustration and impatience. Rand suggested incremental improvement is good for complex unintuitive topics, allowing people to learn as they go. Failure to upgrade permanently or demoralizing protocol researchers could be a systemic risk in itself, as there are more upgrades Bitcoin will need.Rand proposed using collective ingenuity to find an incremental improvement for activation. In response to this proposal, someone suggested having an incorruptible machine that could gather the highest fee transaction from the mempool and post it every 10 minutes, making Bitcoin largely run itself. They also suggested that forks could potentially be a diminishing issue over time.Overall, the discussion centered around achieving consensus for future soft-forks, highlighting the need to approach activation with consideration and decorum. The potential risks of failing to upgrade were also emphasized, and suggestions were made for improving the activation process.</summary>
