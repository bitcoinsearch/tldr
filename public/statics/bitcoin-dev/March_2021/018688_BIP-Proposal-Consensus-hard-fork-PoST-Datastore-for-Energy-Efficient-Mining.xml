    <summary>In an email exchange between Andrew and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the potential benefits of using general-purpose hardware or hardware outside of the realm of ASICs for mining cryptocurrencies. Andrew believes that access to more computational opportunities would result in a more scalable network and further options for optimization. He also notes that there is a huge demand for unmet needs in this space and questions why people should be forced to mine Chia if they want to mine BTC. ZmnSCPxj counters by suggesting that changing the underlying algorithm is simply an attempt to reverse history and instead proposes spreading the optimization of SHA256d-specific hardware so widely that anyone with 2 BTC liquidity in one location has no particular advantage over anyone with 2 BTC liquidity in another location. Additionally, he brings up the idea of patentable surprises being fewer and farther between with SHA256d than any newer, much more complicated construction. The conversation ends with both parties agreeing that the design and implementation of any changes need to be correct in order for them to work effectively. Andrew intends to look towards improving the algorithm to get the best of both worlds, but ZmnSCPxj stresses the importance of pushing forward rather than backwards. He suggests that it may be better to optimize SHA256d-specific hardware instead of starting a new strain of specialization.</summary>
