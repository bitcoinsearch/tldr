    <summary>The email thread discusses the activation mechanism for the Taproot soft fork. The proposal of LOT=false, where Taproot will be activated if at least 95% of miners vote yes, is compared to the LOT=true proposal, where Taproot will be activated if at least 0% of miners vote yes. The declining percentage of signaling activation is suggested as a compromise, where it becomes a LOT=true eventually. It is mentioned that LOT=true holds all the benefits, and all arguments for LOT=false are satisfied by the cooldown period. The email also points out that old node software will continue to work in the case of a soft-fork, and users following bip8 with lockinontimeout=false will enforce taproot rules if activation occurs. It is argued that the risk is maximally reduced by LOT=True being the only deployed parameter, and any introduction of LOT=False only increases risk probability and severity. However, it is mentioned that LOT=false is already the default behaviour of every single piece of node software out there. The email also addresses the concern of miners vetoing a BIP 9 activation, stating that miners were unable to do so in 2017. Furthermore, the email suggests a middle-of-the-road solution where Taproot will be enabled if miner support ever goes above 95%, or on flag day if miner support is &gt;20% then.</summary>
