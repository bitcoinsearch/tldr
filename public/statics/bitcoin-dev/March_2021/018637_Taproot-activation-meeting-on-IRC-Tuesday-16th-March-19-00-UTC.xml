    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin community has requested meetings to be scheduled with more than 24 hours' notice, as it has happened several times. They propose postponing the meeting for a week so that anyone who wants to attend can plan to do so and to avoid an arbitrary "too low turnout" measure. They suggest holding a general discussion the following day, with another meeting planned for the following week to resolve issues in a more binding way. It is suggested that this time slot should be held every other week to avoid the 24-hour issue altogether. The context is not related to whether ST is acceptable or not, and the schedules proposed for ST seem acceptable. In the original email, Luke Dashjr from Bitcoin-dev outlined the agenda for the next meeting tentatively scheduled for March 16th at 19:00 UTC in freenode's ##Taproot-activation IRC channel. The meeting will discuss Speedy Trial activation parameters and adjust them accordingly. If turnout is too low, they may postpone the meeting by a week. Additionally, they will discuss moving startheight later to avoid conflict with the current ST draft and involve more people in materializing the main activation plan. The channel is open for ongoing discussion, and there is a web chat client available.</summary>
