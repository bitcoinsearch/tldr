    <summary>The discussion revolves around the security of a proposed HD wallet scheme. The scheme involves using a private key to calculate a public key and incrementing it. However, all of the resulting public keys can be easily linked together, which is the only problem with this approach. To make it more secure, the suggestion is to use deterministic but less predictable offsets instead of simple incrementation. This would result in parent, first child and second child keys that cannot be linked together unless the offset is guessed by an attacker.When asked if this approach is safe enough to implement and use in practice, Tim Ruffing responds by saying that a HD wallet scheme that can be specified in three lines without specifying security goals should not be assumed safe to implement.</summary>
