    <summary>In an email exchange on March 17, 2021, Prayank discussed the rushed upgrade of Taproot. They debated whether or not it was a rushed approach, with one person arguing that it depended on the perception of time and past experience. They also discussed rules that can and cannot be changed in regards to upgrading Bitcoin Core and how much time is needed for users to make informed decisions. The conversation touched on various topics such as mass adoption, lightning network, and the freedom of users to decide which implementation to run. Finally, they agreed to involve as few people as possible to speed up the upgrade, while still welcoming everyone to participate and learn.</summary>
