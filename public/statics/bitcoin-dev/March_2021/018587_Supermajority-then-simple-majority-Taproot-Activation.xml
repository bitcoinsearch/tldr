    <summary>A new proposal for the activation of Taproot has been put forward by Luke Dashjr, gaining support on Reddit. The proposal suggests a gradual decrease in the activation threshold from 95% to 51%, with a mandatory signaling period at the 51% threshold. This approach builds on previous ideas while addressing several issues with previous proposals.The proposal guarantees that a majority of mining power are supporting Taproot so that the chain cannot be attacked, and nodes stay in consensus. Miners against the proposed feature are forced to hard fork with an anti-Taproot fork if signaling is greater than 51%. Late adopters don't need to worry about upgrading their client to not risk being reorged, and they will be on the taproot-activated chain. The proposal also ensures a safe supermajority activation, where the threshold will remain in supermajority territory (95%) before the MUST_SIGNAL phase. When a supermajority is achieved, there will be minimal disruption and minimal detriment to Bitcoin's security. Other benefits of this proposal include no UASF minority chain, no divergent consensus rules, no need for redeployment, no co-optable deployment, and no incentive to force signaling.Additionally, if this proposal gains consensus and can be released in core, it will avoid the issue of fracturing groups of core forks jockeying for user support. The proposal highlights several advantages, such as the ability to cancel activation if any issues are found, ensuring that only 51% of mining power can cancel if a bug is found, and removing the need for miner promises. It also removes the precedent of users forcing changes on miners because they must attain 51% miner support. If users have less than 51% miner support, they must hard fork instead.For supporters of a gradual decreasing activation threshold, the proposal removes gaming thresholds. The proposal is seen as conservative enough for core developers and could lead to further rounds of soft fork activation without contention. Overall, it is seen as a real solution rather than a compromise, bringing both sides of the LOT debate together.</summary>
