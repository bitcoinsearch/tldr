    <summary>Bitcoin Core developer David A. Harding has proposed a new activation proposal for Taproot known as "Speedy Trial" on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal aims to quickly succeed or fail without compromising safety and suggests an extended lock-in period of 14112 blocks over seven retarget periods. It assumes a mid-April release of Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 containing these parameters, with the earliest activation time being August 21st, 2021 if miners activate as soon as possible.One advantage of Speedy Trial is that it does not require mandatory signaling by miners, but there are concerns that the short timeline may encourage false signaling by miners and cause long reorgs if unprepared miners lose money. Implementation details are still being discussed, but Russell O'Connor has offered to work on a patch against BIP8 if Speedy Trial gains traction.The original idea was discussed in the ##taproot-activation IRC channel last July, and the revised idea saw additional evaluation this week. Despite growing frustration, discussion has been overwhelmingly constructive, and contributors have been commended for their input. Users and organizations would have up to six months advanced notice of Taproot activation, allowing them to prepare software and announcements.Taproot's underlying code was merged into Bitcoin Core over 140 days ago, and the proposal aims to generate fast progress that will either end the debate (for now if activation is successful) or give us actual data upon which to base future taproot activation proposals.</summary>
