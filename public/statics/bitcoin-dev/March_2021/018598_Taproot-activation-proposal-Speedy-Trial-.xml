    <summary>In an email thread discussing the activation timeline for Taproot, Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo expressed concern that a three-month window may not be short enough to prevent a network split due to divergent consensus rules. However, fellow developer Dave disagreed with this perspective, stating that he opposes designing activation mechanisms to prevent others from exercising self-determination over which consensus rules their nodes enforce. Dave argued that the three-month timeline was chosen to give miners a reasonable amount of time to activate Taproot without delaying other proposals with one-year timelines. He believes that this timeline has the potential to gain acceptance from multiple factions, allowing progress to move forward with rough social consensus and offering valuable information for future decisions.</summary>
