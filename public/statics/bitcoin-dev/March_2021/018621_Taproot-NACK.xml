    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member named R E Broadley pointed out that referring to Jameson Lopp as "Lord" or "Excellency" is unsubstantiated as he isn't noble nor a Lord. The purpose of this message was to ensure that people were not giving him more attention than any other person would be afforded. The email exchange was about Taproot, and in the same message, Broadley expressed their approval of it.</summary>
