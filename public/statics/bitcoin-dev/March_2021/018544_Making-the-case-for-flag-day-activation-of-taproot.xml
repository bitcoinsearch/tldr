    <summary>Chris Belcher, a Bitcoin developer, proposed the use of flag day activation to avoid social media brinksmanship in the adoption of new software. This method requires all users to run different node software and would prevent miner signaling from changing the activation date for nodes that didn't choose it. However, some argue that this would take away the power of social media opposition, which can be legitimate. Additionally, while this method may be efficient, some consider it immoral to force people to go along with Core's decisions. Yanmaani suggests making all controversial settings changeable by RPC command or command-line flag, rather than requiring a fork.</summary>
