    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has discussed the optimal strategy for activating Taproot. The "gradual" method of reducing the percentage of miners required for lock-in over time appears to be the optimal strategy. Jeremy believes that either plan is low risk, but the safest choice is LOT=true. Ariel argues that favoring LOT=true is like playing the prisoner's dilemma and never cooperating instead of using the most optimal strategy which is tit-for-tat. During segwit, users started by cooperating (BIP9, or "LOT=false"), then a minority of miners didn't cooperate, then users stopped cooperating in response (UASF), then miners reverted to cooperating (MASF while intolerant miners forked off). Today, users should start cooperating again to continue using the optimal strategy.</summary>
