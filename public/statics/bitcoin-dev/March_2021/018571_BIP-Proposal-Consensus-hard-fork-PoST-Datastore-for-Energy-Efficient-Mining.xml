    <title>BIP Proposal: Consensus (hard fork) PoST Datastore for Energy Efficient Mining</title>

    <summary>The writer of the message is seeking guidance on how to create a new BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) aimed at addressing energy efficiency concerns related to Bitcoin mining. They are unsure if there is a specific format they need to follow and whether they should attach a README to their draft proposal on their personal GitHub page. The proposed solution involves a hybrid mining integration with POW/PoST for BTC's SHA-256 hash algorithm, which is a cryptography proof. While a soft fork integration would be preferred, a completely different cryptography proof without affecting current node integration is not feasible. Despite being a Quantum Engineer and Bioinformatics consultant by trade, the writer believes their proposal could be of interest to some and wants to submit a detailed document explaining how it all works.</summary>
