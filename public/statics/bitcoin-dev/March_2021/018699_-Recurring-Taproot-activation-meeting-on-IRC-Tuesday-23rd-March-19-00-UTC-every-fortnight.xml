    <summary>Jeremy Rubin has proposed a Taproot Activation Meeting to finalize the parameter selection and raise any blocking issues. The meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday and will be held fortnightly in the future. Attendees are required to pre-register their comments, and the meeting will focus on resolving outstanding concerns around using a Speedy Trial to activate Taproot, selecting between start/stop heights and times for a speedy trial, parameter selection for start/stop/active points, parameter flexibility, and simultaneous UASF. Participants are encouraged to read the email for specific instructions for participation. A web chat client is also available for ongoing discussion.</summary>
