    <summary>Andrew has provided an update on his work, stating that he has added more details, updated terminology, and added a basic non-technical infographic. He also mentions that making a technical UML for the cryptographic mechanisms will be on his to-do list. In response to Yancy's email about his proposal appearing like gibberish, Andrew clarifies that he was referring to signature validation cryptography in that aspect. He emphasizes that his main point is not just to create a BTC hardfork or become another Bitcoin Cash, Gold, or SV, but to expand POW rather than replace or create an alternative. Andrew is willing to create preprints explaining the cryptography, hashing algorithm improvements, and consensus that he is working on once this proposal is assigned draft status.</summary>
