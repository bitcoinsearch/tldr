    <summary>In an email exchange between the Lonero Foundation and Yancy, it appears that Yancy mistook one of the Lonero Foundation's texts for generated text. The Lonero Foundation clarified that their proposal was not gibberish and admitted to making a mistake in the wording of their proposal. Yancy suggested that using the correct terminology would help people understand the proposal better. The Lonero Foundation emphasized that their primary goal with the proposal is to expand POW rather than create an alternative or hardfork, and they are willing to work on preprints explaining the cryptography, hashing algorithm improvements, and consensus. However, Yancy continued with sarcasm and humor, suggesting that the AI overlord will soon take over Bitcoin development. The Lonero Foundation responded by saying that they prefer constructive feedback over insults or making fun of one another.</summary>
