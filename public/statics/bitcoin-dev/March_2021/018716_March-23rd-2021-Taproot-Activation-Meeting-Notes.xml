    <summary>In a recent meeting, there was a discussion about the activation mechanism for Taproot. The meeting log and a livestream of the meeting have been made available for those who missed it. One topic that was discussed was the choice between using block heights consistently or a mix of both block heights and MTP in the activation mechanism. Michael Folkson weighed in on this topic and expressed his preference for a consistent use of block height. He also provided a link to his documentation of this preference. Folkson argued that using a mix of both block heights and MTP makes no sense to him. He stated that, while there are two arguments in favor of using a mix, he does not find them compelling. Regarding the first argument, he believes that the additional review required is not excessive and that there is sufficient time to review a consistent use of block height. Regarding the second argument, he believes that making technical decisions based on speculating on the marketing strategies of other projects is not in line with what he thought Bitcoin Core was about. Folkson concluded by stating that he would find it much easier to reason about timings and time intervals if block heights were used consistently across the activation mechanism. He also thanked Jeremy for organizing and hosting the meeting.</summary>
