    <summary>A proposal has been made that is believed to be a clear gain for multisignature wallets. The proposal gets rid of redundant data in the key record, separates keys/scripts, makes full use of descriptors and prevents key reuse. To restore a multisignature wallet, the user needs M private key data and all public keys. The descriptor provides the required public key data and tells the wallet which script to watch. The proposal also aims to prevent key discovery by standard derivation paths/script types. If a descriptor is used, one only needs to do what it says to discover the funds in a multisig wallet. Without a descriptor, one would need to search the `address_index` for each script type.</summary>
