    <summary>In a recent discussion about Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade, Matt Corallo expressed his concerns regarding the proposed activation timeline of three months. He believes that this period is not short enough to prevent network splits due to divergent consensus rules. However, David A. Harding, another participant in the discussion, disagrees with designing activation mechanisms that prevent others from effectively exercising their self-determination over what consensus rules their nodes enforce.Harding explains that the three-month timeline was chosen as it provides miners with a reasonable amount of time to activate Taproot while not delaying any existing proposals with roughly one-year timelines. He also notes that the proposal has the potential to gain acceptance from multiple current factions and move forward with rough social consensus. This attempt can provide useful information for future decisions.Corallo's point is that he is unsure if this proposal achieves its goal of keeping the community together. He suggests that there may be other solutions that are more likely to keep the community of nodes together. It is important to note that no one is proposing anything to "prevent" others from doing what they wish; rather, the goal is to propose a solution that is acceptable to everyone.</summary>
