    <summary>A meeting is scheduled for March 16th to discuss the proposed Speedy Trial activation plan for Taproot. There is disagreement among developers on whether this plan should be implemented, as it conflicts with the original timeline established for the upgrade. Some developers believe that changing established rules and rushing upgrades sets a bad precedent for Bitcoin development. Additionally, it is noted that progress has been slow on materializing the main activation plan, and more developers need to get involved if it is going to move forward. However, others argue that involving fewer people will make it easier to get the job done. The MAST threshold could be lowered to speed up the upgrade. If turnout for the meeting is low, it may be postponed to a later date.</summary>
