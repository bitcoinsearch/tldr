    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a new proposal called Speedy Trial for activating taproot has been discussed. This proposal was put forward by Russell O'Connor and aims to either quickly succeed or fail without compromising safety in either case. It includes three main points: starting soon after the release of software containing the proposed activation logic, stopping activation if the lock-in threshold isn't reached within approximately three months, and taproot being guaranteed to eventually activate if the lock-in threshold is reached but not until approximately six months after signal tracking started.The proposal aims to mitigate problems of early success by programming a delay between the time software with those rules is expected to be released and when the software starts tracking which blocks signal for activation. The idea can be implemented on top of either Bitcoin Core's existing BIP9 code or its proposed BIP8 patchset. False signaling is possible with any other proposal, and the same problems can occur if miners fail to upgrade for any mandatory activation. The proposal received significant discussion and seemed acceptable to several people who could not previously agree on a proposal. The earliest activation concept included in the proposal was particularly well-received. There were no major issues seen with this course of action, and it represents a reasonable compromise between all different perspectives. Jeremy Rubin expressed his support for the proposal, stating that it gives an opportunity to learn more about less 'slow' yet safe consensus upgrades.</summary>
