    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has seen discussions about the safety of Taproot against quantum computing. While some members have expressed concerns over the loss of an important safety protection against quantum, others believe that there is no significant difference between pre-Taproot and post-Taproot in terms of Bitcoin's vulnerability to quantum computing. The issue of address reuse has also been brought up as a factor in the debate. While hash-based addresses are promoted as a best practice to reduce the percentage of bitcoins affected by address reuse, many people still reuse Bitcoin invoice addresses. In response to Pieter's argument that 37% of the supply is at risk, one member suggested that quantum-compromised neglected or abandoned/lost coins could be seen as equivalent to Bitcoin mining.</summary>
