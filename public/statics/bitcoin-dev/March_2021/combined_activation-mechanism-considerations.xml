    <summary>The activation mechanism for taproot and future soft-forks is crucial in achieving consensus in the Bitcoin community. It is important to approach this topic with patience, avoiding rushing into ill-considered decisions. Incremental improvements should be made, treating the topic with decorum and providing tight non-emotive reasoning. Failure to upgrade could be a systemic risk, demoralizing to protocol researchers and counter to Bitcoin user and investor interests. An incorruptible machine that gathers the highest fee transactions from the mempool and posts them every 10 minutes could largely run Bitcoin itself, potentially diminishing the issue of forks over time.John Rand emphasized the importance of achieving consensus for both taproot and the activation mechanism. He stressed that it could become existentially critical that Bitcoin prevails in achieving a future upgrade in dramatic circumstances, even against powerful interests counter to Bitcoin user and investors' interests. Rand proposed using collective ingenuity to find an incremental improvement for activation. In response to this proposal, someone suggested having an incorruptible machine that could gather the highest fee transaction from the mempool and post it every 10 minutes, making Bitcoin largely run itself. The discussion centered around achieving consensus for future soft-forks, highlighting the need to approach activation with consideration and decorum. The potential risks of failing to upgrade were also emphasized, and suggestions were made for improving the activation process.</summary>
