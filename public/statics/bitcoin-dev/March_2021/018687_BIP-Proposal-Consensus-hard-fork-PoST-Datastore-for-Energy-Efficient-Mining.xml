    <summary>The email conversation between Andrew and ZmnSCPxj discusses the possibility of integrating memory hard compatibility with the mining algorithm. Andrew believes that memory hard computation allows for time and space complexity for data storage functionality. He thinks that this can be implemented without disenfranchising current miners or their hardware if done right. However, ZmnSCPxj believes that the requirement for memory hardness is a red herring in the design of proof-of-work algorithms as spinning rust consumes electricity as well, and any operation that requires changes in data being stored requires a lot of energy. Andrew also suggests providing access to other forms of computation along with ASICs. He thinks it is feasible to provide multiple forms of computation without disenfranchising one over the other. Andrew acknowledges the existence of different hardware systems like generic HDDs and CPUs. He believes that the algorithmic implementation he is providing would likely make them more adaptable. He suggests that specialized HDDs similar to BurstCoin Miners and 128-core CPUs could be inevitable, but the main point is to provide access to other forms of computation along with ASICs.ZmnSCPxj counters Andrew's argument that someone with $2m of regular hardware can't mine the same amount of BTC as someone with $2m worth of ASICs. He suggests that ASICs will arise which might need to be connected to an array of (possibly specialized) HDDs but which will still outperform general-purpose hardware connected to an array of general-purpose storage. Further, he opines that various storage solutions already have different specializations like SMR HDDs replacing tape drives, PMR HDDs serving as caches of SMR HDDs, SSDs serving as caches of PMR HDDs, etc. He suggests that an optimized technology stack like that can outperform a generic HDD. He concludes that you cannot fight the inevitability of ASICs and other specialized hardware, just as you cannot fight specialization.</summary>
