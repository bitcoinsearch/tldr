    <summary>In an email conversation between Craig and Robert Spigler regarding a BIP proposal, concerns were raised about the security of multisig wallets. Craig suggested that if someone has the threshold and all the cosigner seeds, the funds in a multisig wallet could potentially be discovered by checking a handful of standard derivation paths/script types. However, Robert believes that the proposed BIP would excel in multisig and initially designed it for that purpose before extending it to single sig wallets. Nevertheless, ghost43 and Jochen Hoenicke brought up important issues with the proposed BIP concerning single sig wallets, so Robert decided to revert it back for multisig derivations to address all concerns. The updated version of the BIP can be viewed on Github.</summary>
