    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev meeting, there was discussion on selecting parameters for the upcoming release. It was agreed upon that they would target a May 1st release date with one week from rc1 start time/height and an activation time of around November 15th. There was some confusion whether the release would be on May 1st or the start height, but it was suggested that they could shift everything back two weeks if needed. When it came to selecting MTP, there were no hidden agendas; instead, a mid-period MTP was estimated. It was mentioned that midnight UTC is not sacred and that they can adjust the parameters according to preference. The idea of picking a mid-period MTP is that drift will not matter much. On the topic of parameter selection, if heights were selected, the first signaling period would be at block 683424, and the stop height would be at block 695520. If times were selected, a mid-period MTP should be targeted. Currently, it looks like a 1300 UTC May 7th start time and stop time would be 1300 UTC August 13th. It was suggested that the mediantime should not be later than ~139 days later than block 676080, which had a mediantime of 1616578564. This would result in MTP logic matching the height parameters above. It was noted that adding days would likely cause MTP to have more signaling periods than height-based, rather than avoid having fewer. It was also mentioned that blocks are more likely to arrive earlier than later, which is expected with increasing hashrate.</summary>
