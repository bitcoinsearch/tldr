    <summary>A conversation on bitcoin-dev mailing list highlighted the advantages of a softfork with LOT=false activation method. It can be achieved without the need for social movement, but only requires convincing 95% of miners. The apathetic users will not notice any service disruption, regardless of the success or failure of the activation. This is why it became the default activation method. However, forcing rules without social support is considered a 51% attack, which is not a softfork.On the other hand, LOT=true requires 51% of the blockchain to win the apathetic users, which can lead to disruptive reorgs. However, this is not true as LOT=true does not create an invalid chain. Miners can create an invalid chain at any time, with or without a softfork involved.</summary>
