    <summary>A small group of conservative Bitcoin developers have been hindering the progress of the activation of Taproot. They engage in endless philosophical discussions, causing delays in upgrading and preparing for manageable risks later in the year. This is frustrating for those in the industry who are waiting on this upgrade, but the developers are wasting time monitoring arguments instead of preparing for the upgrade.There are concerns that the current environment is not conducive to development and review. Core may only ship BIP 8 (1 year, LOT=false) as there is no alternative available, which could lead to Core shipping nothing at all. A trillion-dollar industry is waiting on this upgrade, and a UASF (LOT=true) project needs to be ready to assemble to ensure that a small group of individuals do not block progress. Once the situation has calmed down, progress made should be revisited, and decisions taken from there.In an email exchange between Michael Folkson and Ariel Luaces, they discuss the activation of Taproot on Bitcoin. Michael expressed concern that the greatest risk to Taproot dying a slow death is a small group of conservative developers who are ignoring the work done by others and blocking progress until they find their philosopher's stone. Ariel believes that the current risk to Taproot and all future activations is a loud minority of users who are threatening to co-opt a LOT=false activation by switching the parameter and organizing a marketing blitz that could end in a fork if things don't go well. As long as that threat persists, consensus won't be reached.Michael, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has expressed his disappointment over the failure of the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade activation. In a post on his personal blog, he explained that despite overwhelming support from the community, the upgrade was not activated due to a lack of miner support. The Taproot upgrade is aimed at enhancing the privacy and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions. However, its activation required 90% of miners to signal their support for the upgrade within a two-week period, which did not happen.Despite the setback, Michael expresses hope that people will reconsider their stance when a LOT=true (UASF) version of Taproot is the only way to activate the upgrade. He believes that the UASF version would be more successful in activating the upgrade since it does not require miner support. In conclusion, the failure to activate the Taproot upgrade has disappointed many in the Bitcoin community, including Michael. However, he remains optimistic about the potential for future activation through alternative means like the UASF version. The Taproot upgrade is still seen as an important development for Bitcoin, and its eventual implementation will bring significant benefits to users.</summary>
