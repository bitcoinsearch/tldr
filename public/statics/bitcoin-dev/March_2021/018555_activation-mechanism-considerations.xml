    <summary>Consensus is crucial for both the activation mechanism and taproot. Achieving progress on the activation topic without rushing something ill-considered is important, as there are more soft-forks that Bitcoin will need in the future. While not all future soft-forks may be as widely supported as taproot, it could become existentially critical that Bitcoin prevails in achieving a future upgrade in dramatic circumstances, even against powerful interests counter to Bitcoin user and investor interests. It is imperative to treat the activation topic with decorum and provide tight non-emotive reasoning devoid of frustration and impatience. Incremental improvement is good for complex unintuitive topics, and people have varied views about the deciding factor or even which factors resulted in segwit activating after BIP 141 failed using BIP 9. It is not necessary to solve everything in one step; learning as we go is essential. Failure to upgrade if permanent or demoralizing to protocol researchers could be a systemic risk in itself as there are more upgrades Bitcoin will need. The goal is to find an incremental improvement for activation by using collective ingenuity. This is a low drama and convenient time to incrementally improve activation.</summary>
