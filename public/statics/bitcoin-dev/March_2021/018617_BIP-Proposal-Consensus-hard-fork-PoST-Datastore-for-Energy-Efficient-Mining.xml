    <summary>Andrew has submitted a BIP Pull Request on GitHub for the draft prior to development/reference implementation. The link to the BIP proposal is provided on Lonero Foundation's own repo. Andrew wants to submit a pull request on the BIPs repo for this to go into draft mode. He proposes a better cryptography layer to get the most out of hashing for validation. Lonero Foundation suggests creating the BIP in Andrew's own repository and bringing it to discussion on the mailing list, then doing a PR. Andrew wants to integrate some form of NP complexity in regards to the hybrid cryptography he is aiming to provide which includes a polynomial time algorithm in the cryptography. A cryptography upgrade like this is beneficial as it prevents BTC from being entirely broken.</summary>
