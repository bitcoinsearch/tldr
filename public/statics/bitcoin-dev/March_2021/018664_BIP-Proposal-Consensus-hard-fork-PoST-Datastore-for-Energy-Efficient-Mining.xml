    <summary>Andrew proposes a BIP that increases the security of Bitcoin. He argues that BTC can be more adaptable to a range of hardware without disenfranchising others or having major trade-offs. Andrew also notes that the technology and level of cryptography have changed significantly since Satoshi started developing BTC 14 years ago. Eric Martindale disagrees with the proposal, stating that reducing the overall expenditure of mining would decrease the resilience of Bitcoin. Martindale believes efficiency at converting energy into hashpower is the driving factor in profitability. There are concerns about missing out on subsidy or fee revenue; however, individuals can grab sub-500mSAT USB miners and access cheap power. Lord James HRMH proposes turning mining into a lottery to reduce costs and make it more accessible. Andrew also discusses another cryptography proposal to improve hashing for validation.</summary>
