    <summary>The email suggests that mining costs in kWh per block need to be reduced, and proposes a solution to turn mining into a lottery with authorized pay-to addresses to mine valid blocks. The proposal aims to limit mining to 50 people per continent to produce valid blocks at any one time with the help of a consortium to oversee the lottery. The email highlights that this proposal would not affect the current algorithm or consensus of Bitcoin. The email also mentions that the BTC network could be vulnerable to problems such as NP-Completeness or Halting in the future, and the author proposes a BIP regarding cryptography layer for better hashing validation. Finally, the email provides contact details for the author's projects and states that it does not constitute general advice.</summary>
