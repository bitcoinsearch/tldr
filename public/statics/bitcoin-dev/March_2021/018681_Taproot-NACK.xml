    <summary>The idea of consensus and its relevance in discussions may seem mundane or philosophical, but it cannot be ignored if one wants to understand how Bitcoin is censorship-resistant. To delve deeper into this topic, the libbitcoin-system wiki provides a detailed explanation of the property of censorship resistance in Bitcoin. It is important to understand this property because it enables Bitcoin to function as a decentralized currency that is not controlled by any central authority or government. By using complex cryptographic algorithms, Bitcoin ensures that transactions cannot be censored or altered by anyone. This makes it a powerful tool for financial freedom and privacy.</summary>
