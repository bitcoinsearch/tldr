    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev conversation between Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces and Luke Dashjr, the former made a statement implying that LOT=false activation method is better than LOT=true. Dashjr corrected him by saying that miners enforcing rules without social support is not a soft fork but a 51% attack. Ariel responded by stating that he never said LOT=true does it; rather, it must achieve 51% miner support to pose reorg risks to force apathetic users into paying attention. Dashjr further explained that LOT=True doesn't cause such disruption unless miners choose to create an invalid chain, which they could do at any time with or without a softfork involved.</summary>
