    <summary>Luke Dashjr has proposed a new approach for the activation of Taproot, which is gaining support on Reddit. The proposal suggests gradually decreasing the activation threshold from 95% to 51%, with a mandatory signaling period at the 51% threshold. This proposal guarantees that a majority of mining power supports Taproot so that the chain cannot be attacked, and nodes stay in consensus. Late adopters don't need to worry about upgrading their client to not risk being reorged, and they will be on the taproot-activated chain. The proposal also ensures a safe supermajority activation, where the threshold will remain in supermajority territory (95%) before the MUST_SIGNAL phase. When a supermajority is achieved, there will be minimal disruption and minimal detriment to Bitcoin's security. Additionally, the proposal highlights several benefits, such as no UASF minority chain, no divergent consensus rules, no need for redeployment, no co-optable deployment, and no incentive to force signaling.If this proposal gains consensus and can be released in core, it will avoid the issue of fracturing groups of core forks jockeying for user support. The proposal is seen as conservative enough for core developers and could lead to further rounds of soft fork activation without contention. Overall, it is seen as a real solution rather than a compromise, bringing both sides of the LOT debate together.</summary>
