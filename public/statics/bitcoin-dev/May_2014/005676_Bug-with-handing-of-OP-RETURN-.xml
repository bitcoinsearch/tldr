    <summary>On May 3, 2014, Flavien Charlon asked the Bitcoin development mailing list why a particular transaction was rejected by Bitcoind 0.9.1 with error code -22 on Mainnet. According to Debug.log, the following error message was shown: "ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: nonstandard transaction: scriptpubkey." The decoded transaction showed the following information: lock_time, inputs (with one prev_out), vout_sz, vin_sz, and out (with three address values). The script_string included "OP_RETURN 4f41010001 753d," which is supposed to be standard in 0.9.1. The standard format ended up being exactly "OP_RETURN". The data was split across two PUSHDATA's, but the standard should have allowed the data to be split up like that. Pull requests were accepted. A link to SauceLabs was also shared in the email thread.</summary>
