    <summary>In May 2014, a member of the Bitcoin development mailing list named Alex Kotenko raised an issue with the DNS seed daemon, which was not able to serve more than one name at once. As a result, he could not serve testnet and mainnet seeds off one daemon instance, and had to buy two IP addresses for it. Andreas Schildbach confirmed that there were no working DNS seeds at the testnet3, and encouraged Kotenko to start his own DNS seed using the DNS seeder daemon, which most other seeds were also using. Kotenko planned to set up DNS seeds for mainnet and testnet at bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me and testnet-seed.alexykot.me, as well as well-connected nodes for both mainnet and testnet on the same server. Michael Wozniak then suggested setting up two daemons listening locally on different ports, with a separate daemon or normal DNS server that proxies incoming queries to either domain. It is unclear whether this suggestion was taken up by Kotenko.</summary>
