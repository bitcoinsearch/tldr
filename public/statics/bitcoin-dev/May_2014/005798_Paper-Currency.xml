    <summary>There is a need for a counterfeit-resistant, inexpensive, internationally recognized, machine-readable paper currency that can fit in a wallet. The idea was pitched at the Cincinnati Bitcoin meetup and has been documented into a proposed standard called provisional BIPs numbered BIP-80 to BIP-84. The proposal can be found on GitHub and the author welcomes discussion about the idea.</summary>
