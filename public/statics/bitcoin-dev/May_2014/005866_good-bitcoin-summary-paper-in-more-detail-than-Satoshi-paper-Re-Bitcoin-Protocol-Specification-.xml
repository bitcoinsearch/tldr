    <summary>Krzysztof Okupski shared a protocol specification document on Bitcoin development mailing list for review and improvement. The paper is a 29-page write-up with more details of formats, scripts, and examples that are otherwise hard to put together without examining the source or asking people knowledgeable at algorithm/code level. Adam Back suggested summarizing the topic of the paper in a paragraph so that people can know if they feel qualified and if they need to review it from their interests. Krzysztof provided the link to the PDF file and requested errors or suggestions from the audience.</summary>
