    <summary>The writer of this message provides a crash course on patents, stating that the first rule is to not go looking for them. This is due to US law being written in a way that makes knowingly infringing on a patent result in triple damages. Additionally, many companies have banned their staff from reading patents as it can lead to potential legal issues. The author urges people to not patent any Bitcoin-related research they do, even if they believe it's for the best. Defensive patenting doesn't work and attempting to "fight back" against a patent is not a viable strategy. It's better for new ideas to be put into the public domain. Lastly, patenting with the intention to sue people using Bitcoin will not make any friends.</summary>
