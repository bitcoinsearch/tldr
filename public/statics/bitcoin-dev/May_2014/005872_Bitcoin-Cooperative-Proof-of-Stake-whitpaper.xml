    <summary>The author of the email has completed a whitepaper for Bitcoin, proposing a proof-of-stake version that would use a single nomadic verifiable mint agent and distributed replication of a blockchain to achieve faster transaction acknowledgement times. This version would pay dividends to holders instead of miners, making subsidized transaction fees lower. However, the author expresses concern about the complexity of the proposed system and suggests incentivizing full nodes instead. The author plans to hard fork the Bitcoin blockchain in early 2016 after a year of public system testing and wide approval. Readers are encouraged to comment on the project thread, which will function as a development diary.</summary>
