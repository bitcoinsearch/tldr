    <summary>In May 2014, Krzysztof Okupski sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list requesting that readers review a Bitcoin protocol specification he had written. He acknowledged that the document was still in development and needed improvement. The email contained a link to the front page of the document and his contact information. The purpose of the email was to ask for feedback from experts on any errors or suggestions they might have, and to improve the quality of the protocol specification. Additionally, the email included a promotional message for automated cross-browser testing software at the end.</summary>
