    <summary>The context suggests that a pull request may not be accepted due to its potential impact on the blockchain. The concern is that each additional transaction output (txout) adds at least 9 bytes, with no benefit gained from serializing the data together in a single OP_RETURN. In a communication dated May 3rd, 2014, Peter Todd noted that the standard format should be a single OP_RETURN, and splitting the data across two PUSHDATA's would not meet this requirement. However, it appears that the pull request was accepted despite this deviation from the standard format.</summary>
