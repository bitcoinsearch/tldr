    <summary>Peter Grigor proposed a new way to calculate transaction fees in an email on May 12, 2014. The proposal suggests that the transaction fee should be calculated based on a percentage of the input amount, divided by the number of confirmations of the input, and then multiplied by the number of inputs. This proposal was made in response to concerns about the safety of tiny "spam" transactions that could potentially become unsafely inexpensive with the use of 0 confirmation inputs.</summary>
