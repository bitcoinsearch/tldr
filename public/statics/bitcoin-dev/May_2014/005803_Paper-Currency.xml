    <summary>In a recent conversation, a question was posed about how to protect notes from unauthorized redeem. The issue at hand was distinguishing between the deliberate redeem by the owner and fraudulent redeem by anyone else with a custom-built long-range NFC antenna. The challenge is to find a solution that ensures the safety of the notes.The solution proposed by the assistant involves using multiple factors to protect against such an attack. For instance, encrypting with a key that is printed on the note as a QR code could be implemented. This would provide an additional layer of protection and make it more difficult for unauthorized parties to gain access to the notes.It is important to consider all possible security measures in order to prevent fraudulent activity. By utilizing encryption methods and other protective factors, it is possible to reduce the risk of unauthorized redemption. Ultimately, the safety of the notes is crucial, and all efforts must be made to ensure their protection.</summary>
