    <summary>Bitcoin.org is soon to merge a new section called "Developer Documentation". The website has made a live preview available at bitcoindev.us.to/en/developer-documentation. The documentation has been created with quality in mind and feedback from experienced Bitcoin developers is now being sought. The general feedback received so far has been positive. Interested parties are invited to proofread the documentation before it is published. However, it is requested that comments be kept off the mailing list to avoid spamming everyone. Instructions for commenting on the pull request or Bitcoin-documentation mailing list can be found at github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/pull/393.</summary>
