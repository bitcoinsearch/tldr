    <summary>In May 2014, David Shares forwarded a Reddit post about a virus signature in the Bitcoin Core software to the bitcoin-development mailing list. The Reddit post contained a link to a Github issue discussing the problem. The email also included an advertisement for a cross-browser testing platform. The purpose of the email was to raise awareness of the potential vulnerability and encourage developers to take action. The mailing list is used by Bitcoin developers to discuss issues related to the development of the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
