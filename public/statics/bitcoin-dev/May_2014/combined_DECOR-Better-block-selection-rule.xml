    <summary>The author presented the DECOR protocol in an email extract. The assumption was made that the amount of coins earned by each miner in competing blocks was approximately the same, but this may not be true for Bitcoin due to the halving reward and uncertainty surrounding fees. The author then goes on to explain how to use the DECOR+ protocol to prevent miners from abusing the system. In situations where two miners are competing for a certain block height with blocks A and B respectively, and Alice's block reward is half of Bob's reward, even if Hash(A) &lt; Hash(B), Alice can still win by following the DECOR+ protocol. BlockReward() returns the block subsidy plus the transaction fees in the block. It is important for the conditions on constants to be satisfied if different values of a,b,c,d,e are chosen, which will force miners selections to converge into a single parent.Interestingly, it is now much easier to prove that for two competing miners, the DECOR+ protocol cannot be abused since there is no dependence on the block content. This new protocol provides a potential solution to the problem of miners abusing the system and earning a disproportionate amount of rewards in the competitive market.</summary>
