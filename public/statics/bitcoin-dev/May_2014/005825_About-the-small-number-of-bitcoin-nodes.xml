    <summary>In an email conversation between Bjørn Øivind Bjørnsen and Wladimir, they discussed the implementation of network rate limiting in the bitcoin codebase. Bjørnsen, who is not familiar with the codebase, suggested adding network rate limiting to the list of features. However, Wladimir informed him that an old patch already exists for it but it won't be merged until headers-first and parallel block download is in place. He further explained that it's only safe to allow limiting rates when the node can download blocks from multiple peers at once. There are some tricks to limit rates like the script in contrib/qos but it needs to be generally available first.</summary>
