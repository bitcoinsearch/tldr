    <summary>In a communication between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik, they discussed the idea of depending solely on a communications backchannel to retrieve funds. They quickly rejected this idea as any communications medium that isn't the blockchain makes the payment non-atomic, which creates opportunities for it to fail. However, Jeff Garzik argues that putting the communications medium in the blockchain itself is wrong and encourages ephemeral, junk data in the blockchain. He believes that this approach is not scalable and goes against the purpose of the blockchain. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist who works at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
