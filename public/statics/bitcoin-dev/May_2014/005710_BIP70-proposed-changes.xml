    <summary>The email conversation between Odinn Cyberguerrilla and the Bitcoin developers Andreas Schildbach and Jeff Garzik discusses the progress of two-factor authentication and bitcoin. The developers are working on a decentralized authentication protocol based on bitcoin-like addresses. BitPay is also working on a new standard for authentication, which they hope to establish with the help of the community. The developers are still at the development stage with a lot of work left to do. Progress can be followed on the Github page provided. Additionally, Odinn asks about the progress of a fully decentralized way of residing on one's device or devices. Finally, there is mention of maidsafe, a decentralized internet platform, and whether bitcoin core developers have talked with maidsafe developers regarding fine points.</summary>
