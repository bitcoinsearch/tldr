    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin's transaction confirmation time, Christophe Biocca suggests that it is easy to split the network into two halves by ordering transactions in a specific way. However, Tom Harding points out that this is not a practical solution and proposes a consensus rule to prevent double-spending attacks. This rule states that blocks containing a transaction (tx2) that spends an output of another locally accepted transaction (tx1) should not be accepted if the timestamp of tx2 minus the timestamp of tx1 is greater than T. The use of this rule would help prevent 50% of nodes from misidentifying respend attempts.</summary>
