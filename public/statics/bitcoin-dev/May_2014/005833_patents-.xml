    <summary>The writer of this post questions the need for patents in the bitcoin industry and suggests that companies should consider putting their patents into a Linux Foundation defensive pool. The writer states that patents held by individuals or companies can be dangerous, citing the example of digicash patents after the company went bankrupt. The patents were sold to a large company that parked it in its pile of patents, preventing anyone else from using it and stalling Chaum dependent payment innovation for five years until the patent expired. The writer concludes by saying that this topic is non-dev related and there is no convenient mailing list format for non-dev stuff.</summary>
