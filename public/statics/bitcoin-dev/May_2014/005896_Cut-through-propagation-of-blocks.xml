    <summary>In an email thread from May 24, 2014, Ashley Holman proposed skipping the inv/getdata sequence for new blocks in order to save one round trip per hop. However, upon further reflection, Holman removed this proposal as it was deemed an unrelated optimization that could potentially distract from the main point of cut-through forwarding. Nonetheless, the rest of the proposal would still work even if the inv/getdata sequence was kept in place.</summary>
