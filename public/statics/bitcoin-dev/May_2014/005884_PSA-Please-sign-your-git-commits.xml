    <summary>In a discussion thread from 2014, Mark Friedenbach posed an honest question about the benefits of signed commits in Git. He questioned what problem it would solve and how it could be easily implemented. Although Git places signatures in the history itself, making it difficult to use signatures to indicate acceptance after code review, as opposed to using monotone. Mark's conclusion was that signed commits would make it easier to identify if someone's Git account or the Git site had been compromised and used to submit commits.</summary>
