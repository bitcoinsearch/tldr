    <summary>In May 2014, Andreas Schildbach raised an issue about the unstable Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure. He suggested that it may be due to using a custom DNS implementation that is not fully compatible and there have been bugs in the past. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, agreed that the problem seeds should be fixed but pointed out that it could also be a problem with bitcoinj or other layers if a malfunctioning seed is an issue for the app. Garzik further explained that seeds are essentially a backup for peer exchange and relying solely on them can cause problems. There are multiple seeds to avoid being impacted if some seeds malfunction or die. Therefore, all Bitcoin apps must take this into account. Garzik works for BitPay, Inc., which is a payment service provider that allows merchants to accept Bitcoin payments.</summary>
