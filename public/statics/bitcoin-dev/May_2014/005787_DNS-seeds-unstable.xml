    <summary>The DNS infrastructure for dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org is facing a fundamental problem as the authoritive server is not responding to DNS queries. Despite trying multiple ISPs, the issue persists. Similarly, testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org is also facing a SERVFAIL error but only from Telefonica. The alias'd aws dns service on 23.21.243.183 for testnet-seed-ns1.bitcoin.petertodd.org is also unresponsive from various test locations in Europe. These issues seem to be common firewall or connectivity issues at first glance. Anyone who needs a domain and highly redundant DNS can email the developer for assistance.</summary>
