    <summary>The discussion revolves around the topic of patents and their impact on Bitcoin. The person suggests that the world is much bigger than the USA, and it is difficult to educate people about why patents are as bad as they are if the discussion remains restricted to only Bitcoin. They suggest finding examples not related to Bitcoin to discuss the patent system in general. However, the other person argues that keeping patent discussion off mailing lists is appropriate and wise while suggesting discussing Bitcoin-relevant patents elsewhere. The former person disagrees, stating that to say this is silly when tech news is full of such discussion.</summary>
