    <summary>The email conversation between David A. Harding and Chris Beams discusses how to enable signing commits by default in Git. They mention the use of a script that can be added to .git/hooks/post-commit and post-merge to ensure proper signature of commit messages. The email suggests using an alias for 'commit' that includes the -S option to sign all commits, and provides instructions for adding the script to all new projects. However, they note that this approach may cause issues when rebasing, as the use of 'yes' in the script can block the process. They suggest a pre-push hook instead to defer the check for signatures until the last possible moment, or a git config option to always sign commits. Overall, the conversation provides useful tips for ensuring proper signature of commit messages in Git projects.</summary>
