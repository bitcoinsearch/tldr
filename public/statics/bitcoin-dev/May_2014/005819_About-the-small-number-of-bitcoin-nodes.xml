    <summary>In May 2014, Wladimir suggested the creation of a tool for bitcoind that could be packaged with the software or as a separate package. He proposed using ncurses to create a tool similar to Tor's 'arm', which provides various statistics and graphs such as bandwidth usage, CPU usage, and connected peers. Wladimir included a link to screenshots of Tor-arm to illustrate what such a tool might look like.</summary>
