    <summary>In an email exchange between Wladimir and Chris Beams, Chris suggests complying with commit signing for future commits but questions the effectiveness of it, referencing Linus' negative opinion on signed commits. Wladimir suggests a compromise in which only the most recent commit in a stack would be signed as each commit contains the cryptographic hash of the previous one, making multiple signatures redundant. He plans to update the document and put it in the repository.</summary>
