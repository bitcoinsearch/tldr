    <summary>In an email conversation on May 12, 2014, Matt Whitlock questioned the high bar for getting a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) number assigned. He referred to BIP 1 which suggests that assigning a BIP number is not a big deal, but in reality, even proposals with hours of work put into them are not getting BIP numbers. Whitlock wondered if the numbers are only assigned to well-liked proposals and asked if the point of assigning numbers was not to have organized discussions about all proposals, even the ones people do not like.In response, it was explained that assigning numbers to proposals that have not been publicly discussed is not part of the BIP process. If someone wants to create specifications that are purely their own work and not a public discussion, they can do so, but BIP is not the process for that. The purpose of assigning numbers is to have something to call a proposal before other things happen. This issue arises elsewhere as well.</summary>
