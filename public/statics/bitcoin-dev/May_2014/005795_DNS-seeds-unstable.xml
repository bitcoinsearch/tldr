    <summary>The best way to contribute to infrastructure is by testing the current infrastructure and identifying where it is not working. It is not helpful to throw additional hardware at a problem if the root of the problem is not understood. In a discussion thread from 2014, Alex Kotenko asked Jeff Garzik how to host a testnet seed. Garzik responded that there are only two testnet seeds listed in bitcoind and one of them returns SERVFAIL while the other just returns one A record. He also added that if one is going to depend on testnet, they should contribute to the infrastructure as it doesn't fix itself for free.</summary>
