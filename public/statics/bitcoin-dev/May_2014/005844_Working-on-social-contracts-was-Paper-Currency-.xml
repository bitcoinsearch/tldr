    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin industry, has made a promise to never endorse or work on changes to the Bitcoin system that would allow for confiscation, blacklisting, or devaluation of anyone's Bitcoin. He made this promise in response to calls for him to write a Request for Comments (RFC) regarding possible changes to the Bitcoin system. Despite these requests, Andresen stated that he has higher priorities on his to-do list and encouraged others to write the RFC themselves.</summary>
