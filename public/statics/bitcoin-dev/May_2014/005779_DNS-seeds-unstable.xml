    <summary>The writer states that their android wallet is working "OK" despite some temporary availability problems with seeds. They mention that there are a couple of pull requests outstanding to include hard coded seed peers and getaddr sourced IPs which will provide more backup paths once they are merged in. In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Gregory Maxwell on May 15, 2014, Schildbach brings up the issue of Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure being unstable due to a custom DNS implementation that is not fully compatible and has had bugs in the past. Maxwell responds by suggesting that relying exclusively on DNS seeds increases isolation vulnerabilities and that clients should be robust regarding DNS lookups. However, Schildbach still believes that maintaining a quality infrastructure is the first step towards addressing the issue. The email exchange ends with a promotion for automated cross-browser testing.</summary>
