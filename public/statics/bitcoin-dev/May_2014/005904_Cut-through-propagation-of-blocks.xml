    <summary>The idea of having multiple protocols for Bitcoin transport is suggested for better robustness and feature velocity. However, implementing features twice in two different protocols could slow things down. The current p2p protocol is considered to be efficient, and fixing the 100msec sleep and measuring latency and queuing inside the code are seen as the lowest hanging fruit for improvements.</summary>
