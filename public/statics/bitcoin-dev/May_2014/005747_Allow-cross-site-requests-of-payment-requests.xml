    <summary>Andy has proposed amending BIP 70 to suggest implementers include an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" response header for their payment request responses. This would allow pure HTML5 web wallets to use the payment protocol entirely in-browser, without the server hosting the wallet's HTML having to fetch payment requests on the browser's behalf. Andy believes this approach is more elegant and has fewer security/resource implications for the back-end. He does not anticipate any useful attack vectors being opened up by this amendment.</summary>
