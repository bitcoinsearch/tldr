    <summary>To configure BIND as a DNS forwarder, it should be set up as a forwarder instead of a zone transfer to BIND. This will proxy the request every time and only cache based on any TTL that is set in the response. An example of how this could work can be found on Planet JBoss, which provides instructions for setting up a forwarding DNS server or DNS proxy with ISC BIND.In response to Robert McKay's suggestion that different zones could be forwarded to different dnsseed daemons running on different non-public IPs or two different ports on the same IP, Jeff Garzik argues that using the bind/zone-xfer system would result in fewer total addresses being sent to clients due to the addition of caching levels that the bind/zone-xfer system brings. He suggests that bind is a better option than no-service if there is a choice between the two.Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc. In his email, he also promotes Sauce Labs' automated cross-browser testing platform, which allows users to run Selenium tests across 300+ browser/OS combinations for free.</summary>
