    <summary>The average person has little need to prioritize computer science as something to keep in the forefront, which is why they routinely confuse RAM and hard drive sizes. While it may seem like a rounding error to them, this confusion can lead to issues for those who believe that everyone should be an expert at computer science. Bitcoin, with its already confusing terminology, does not need yet another word added to the pile for the sake of aesthetics. It's necessary to avoid poor understanding by targeting the language to achieve the clearest communication to the widest possible target audience using the language most likely to be understood by them in light of our objectives. This makes it easier for people to understand enough about Bitcoin to use it, while understanding computer science at large at the same time may not be achievable for everyone.</summary>
