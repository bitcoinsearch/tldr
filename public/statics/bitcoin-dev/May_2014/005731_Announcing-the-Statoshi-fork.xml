    <summary>The conversation between Mike Hearn and Wladimir is regarding the similarities between how Bitcoin DNS seeds work and Tor directory authorities. Both are trying to find stable nodes, but Tor directory authorities are authenticated while DNS seeds aren't. Bitcoin puts more emphasis on decentralization than Tor does. The conversation also touches on the idea of having authenticated "directory authorities" in the Bitcoin source code and the possibility of making the stats public or private/authenticated to parties configured by the node owner.</summary>
