    <summary>Recently, Jameson Lopp shared that he chose StatsD for sending the stats via UDP rather than TCP. He chose it because it is a non-blocking operation and he didn't want the sending of stats to affect the node's performance. Wladimir suggested having statistics available as part of the installer for running a (wallet-less) node as an OS background service. They had already decided that they would need something like Python for the stats service. Implementing things like web services in C++ is not realistic given the time constraints and the great already-written code that is out there. As an optional tool, it should be external, not part of `bitcoind` itself. The chart rendering happens client-side. In that case, the web service just has to collect and provide the data, and serve static HTML/JS files.</summary>
