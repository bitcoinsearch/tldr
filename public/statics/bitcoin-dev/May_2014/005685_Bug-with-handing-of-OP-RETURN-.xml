    <summary>In an email exchange on May 3, 2014, Flavien Charlon questioned why a particular transaction was being rejected despite meeting the stated guidelines. The issue seemed to be that while the outputs were valid, the inputs were not spent properly. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, responded to Charlon's email explaining that the data in question needed to be contained within one pushdata in order to meet the required standards. It is worth noting that Garzik was associated with BitPay, Inc. at the time of this exchange.</summary>
