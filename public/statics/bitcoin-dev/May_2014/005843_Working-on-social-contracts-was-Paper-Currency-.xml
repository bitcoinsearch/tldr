    <summary>In this context, Gavin Andresen expresses confusion about why he or Mike Hearn would have the authority to write a social contract that promises anything about the future of Bitcoin. The author of the message responds by stating that anyone can make promises about their future behavior, including developers like Andresen and Hearn. The community can keep track of which developers make promises about what changes they will or will not attempt to implement in Bitcoin, and use that information to make informed decisions about which software to support. The message includes a PGP signature for security purposes.</summary>
