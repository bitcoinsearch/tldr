    <title>Regtest Address Version Change Proposal</title>

    <summary>A proposal has been made to change all address versions in -regtest mode to be unique and no longer identical to testnet. This would involve changing the prefix for regtest pubkey hash addresses so they begin with either 'r' or 'R'. The purpose of this change is to ensure uniqueness. However, it is important to determine if any existing tools would need to be modified to support this change to regtest. It is unclear if existing tools outside of pull tester expect regtest to have testnet addresses. If only a small quantity of tools currently handle regtest, then modifying them to the new address versions may be feasible. The proposal was made by Warren Togami.</summary>
