    <summary>In an email conversation between Robert McKay and Jeff Garzik in 2014, McKay suggested that it is possible to configure bind as a DNS forwarder. This can be done in a zone context and allow different zones to be forwarded to different DNSseed daemons running on different non-public IPs or two different ports on the same IP. However, Garzik argued that quite the opposite is true since dnsseed data rotates through a lot of addresses if available. Using the bind/zone-xfer system would result in fewer total addresses going through to the clients, thanks to the addition of caching levels that the bind/zone-xfer system brings. Nevertheless, Garzik concedes that if the choice is between no-service and bind, bind it is. At the time of the conversation, Garzik was working as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
