    <summary>In an email conversation between Ben Davenport and Luke Dashjr on May 2, 2014, the topic of using SI prefixes with currency units was discussed. Ben argued that no world currency uses SI prefixes and that it is more common to use informal formats such as $63k or $3M instead of attaching prefixes like kilo- or mega-. He stated that there should be one base unit that is not modified with SI prefixes. Luke disagreed with Ben's argument and pointed out that 'k' and 'M' are actually SI prefixes and that people do use them with currency units. He also mentioned that SI units have not been widely adopted except by force of law, and that most naturally adopted units factor to twos and threes.</summary>
