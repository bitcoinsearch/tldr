    <summary>In a mailing list discussion, Jeff Garzik emphasized that current multi-sig wallet technology is arguably more secure than PGP keyring. Wladimir added that it would be incredible to have multisig for git commits but mentioned that git doesn't support multiple signers for one commit. He further stated that the process of single-signing commits is already simple but stressed that creating a good workflow for multi-factor designs where the damage when a devâ€™s computer is compromised would be reduced may take a lot of work. In response to this, another participant in the discussion suggested considering switching to monotone, which has a flexible DAG structure and workflow built around programmable multi-sig signing of commits. The participant recommended exploring monotone at least for personal projects if it's too late to make that choice for bitcoin. They also highlighted that using monotone would enable less trusted and less centralized development.</summary>
