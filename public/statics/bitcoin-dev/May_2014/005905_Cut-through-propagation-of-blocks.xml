    <summary>In an email exchange between Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn and others, the idea of creating an alternative to the current P2P protocol was discussed. While some argued that such a move could improve feature velocity, Hearn pointed out that implementing features twice in two protocols would slow things down. However, he did concede that certain use cases, such as fast block relaying or complex network coding schemes, might require an alternative protocol. One advantage of an alternative protocol is that it can proceed asynchronously with implementation development, allowing for faster revving of versions. Additionally, if there are bugs, it wouldn't break the nodes using it, making it less risky than experimental p2p code inside production bitcoinds themselves.</summary>
