    <summary>In an email exchange between Alex Kotenko and Sergio Lerner, Alex expresses interest in the Firmcoin concept, although he mentions that prices for their smartcards are currently unacceptable. He decides to follow their progress and see how they manage to bring down the self-cost. In response, Sergio provides more information about Firmcoin's security measures to prevent unauthorized redemption. The device has two capacitive buttons that need to be pressed in sequence to redeem coins, making it impossible for anyone with a custom-built long-range NFC antenna to access the wallet. Sergio also mentions that patents are pending for the device.</summary>
