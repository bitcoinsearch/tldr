    <summary>The discussion is about the installation process of bitcoind and Bitcoin Core in Linux repositories. Jeff Garzik suggests that example configs should be used, perhaps tuned by the distro. He adds that if the distro chooses to install a bitcoin.conf in the proper location, it's up to them. Then he agrees with the idea of having bitcoind and Bitcoin Core in Linux repos under certain conditions. Firstly, the distro must let Bitcoin devs dictate which dependent libs are shipped with or built statically into the bitcoin binaries/libs. Secondly, the distro must permit fresh updates even to older stable distros. Finally, the maintainer(s) must be active, follow Bitcoin development, release status, etc., on a near-daily basis, and be able to respond quickly if security issues arise. In addition, if bitcoind behaves like a proper daemon, syslog support should be included. Also, the option to store things in FHS-compliant directories (not somewhere/.bitcoin) should be provided. The message ends with a PGP signature indicating its authenticity.</summary>
