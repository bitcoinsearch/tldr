    <summary>Mike Hearn proposes the Bitcoin community to work on a social contract or a promise of what features will never be added or taken away from Bitcoin, citing that it is not acceptable to propose anything at all. He suggests starting with things like how the Bitcoin protocol will never change to allow for confiscation of funds. He also encourages Gavin and the community to improve the atmosphere of the list where ideas can be proposed without fear of getting flamed or laughed at. The email thread includes a PGP signature and an attachment of Mikeâ€™s public key.</summary>
