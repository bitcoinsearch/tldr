    <summary>On May 9, 2014, Mike Hearn discussed the reinvention cycle in Bitcoin and mentioned Amir Taaki's proposal for the design of what became stealth addresses. However, they rejected the idea of depending solely on a communication backchannel to retrieve funds and argued that any communications medium other than the blockchain makes the payment non-atomic. Additionally, he pointed out that using certain solutions as anti-social "bloat" is silly because the resource being used is ultimately the same. Hearn also addressed the recent advancements in ECDH multi-party signing and stated that there still is a strong need for discrete key multisig, such as for Greenaddress.it. Overall, he emphasized the importance of letting the free market for fees do its job and not dictating the right trade-offs based on top-down edict.</summary>
