    <summary>The article discusses an ECDH extension for BIP 70 which is not backward compatible with the stealth address proposal. The proposed stealth address design requires huge sacrifices to keep everything within the blockchain and suffers from privacy issues. By adding ECDH to the payment protocol, we can attach messages to payments and other commonly requested features, resolving the privacy problems inherent in the stealth address design. A straw man in the article presents a way to combine nonces to arrive at the address, making it backwards compatible. To make this work, there needs to be a backchannel from payer to payee, which could be a simple email-like store and forward network where HTTP POSTs to a server get queued up and delivered later. The article also discusses the justification for the original stealth address design and why it seems better to crack the SaF problem earlier than jam a square peg into a round hole.</summary>
