    <summary>Chris, a user on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, expressed concern about the viability of using paper currency as a means to transfer bitcoins due to the need for immediate redemption and the potential for fraud. He also noted that this method would not work well in areas with poor internet connectivity. In contrast, Jerry Felix proposed the idea of creating a counterfeit-resistant, inexpensive, internationally recognized, machine-readable paper currency that could be used to transfer bitcoins. He documented his proposed standard in BIP format and shared it on GitHub for discussion. Despite expressing some fear of being laughed out, he submitted his proposal with humility.</summary>
