    <summary>The writer proposes using Unicode character U+0180, lowercase b with a stroke, as the symbol to represent the microBTC denomination. The currency unit should be standardized on microBTC and called 'bits' or something else. The writer prefers 'bits' since it is part of the name Bitcoin and an obvious choice for the currency unit. However, colloquial names for the units will vary depending on language and culture. People might end up calling 1e-06 BTC "bits" in some geographic or language area, but using that as the official name in software would be strange and confusing. The writer thinks we need a more distinctive name than 'bits'. Another candidate for the symbol is Unicode character U+2422, the blank symbol, but the writer prefers stroke b.</summary>
