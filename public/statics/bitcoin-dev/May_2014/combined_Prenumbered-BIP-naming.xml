    <summary>In May 2014, there was a discussion about the high bar for getting a Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) number assigned. This was prompted by BIP 1, which suggests that assigning a BIP number is not a big deal, but proposals with hours of work put into them are not getting numbers. It was questioned whether numbers are only assigned to well-liked proposals and if the point of assigning numbers was not to have organized discussions about all proposals, even those that people do not like.It was explained in response that assigning numbers to proposals that have not been publicly discussed is not part of the BIP process. If someone wants to create specifications that are purely their own work and not a public discussion, they can do so, but BIP is not the process for that. The purpose of assigning numbers is to have something to call a proposal before other things happen.To overcome the issue of individuals facing difficulties in assigning labels to their BIPs that are yet to be numbered, it has been suggested to label them as "draft--" followed by the name of the BIP, for instance, draft-maxwell-coinburning. This labeling style is inspired by the pre-WG IETF drafts.Gregory Maxwell also suggested in May 2014 that people struggling to attach labels to their yet-to-be-numbered BIPs should call them "draft-- does&gt;" like draft-maxwell-coinburning in the style of pre-WG IETF drafts. However, despite there being no shortage of integers, there still seems to be a high bar to getting a number assigned to a BIP. Regardless, numbers are supposed to be assigned to all proposals so that organized discussions can take place regarding them, even those that are not well-liked.</summary>
