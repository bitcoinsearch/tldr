    <summary>In this email conversation, Raúl Martínez suggests some ways to increase the number of Bitcoin full nodes. He recommends allowing users to view the bandwidth used by Bitcoin Core and educating advanced users about the correct setup of a Bitcoin node through a tutorial on bitcoin.org. He also suggests creating a default configuration file with a random RPC password and username for setup without GUI and making bitcoind and Bitcoin Core available in Linux repositories. Furthermore, he proposes the creation of a graphical interface for bitcoind on Linux servers and splitting the Bitcoin wallet from Bitcoin node. Additionally, he suggests informing users if the 8333 port is closed and keeping connections if bitcoind is restarted. In response, Wladimir offers his insights regarding these suggestions and points out that maintaining and improving infrastructure is currently the most urgent issue.</summary>
