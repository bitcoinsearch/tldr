    <summary>In this email thread from 2014, a proposal to switch to the use of "bits" as the default unit for Bitcoin transactions is being discussed. The idea is supported by several individuals, with one suggesting that BitPay, Coinbase, Blockchain and Bitstamp should collaborate to agree on the use of "bits" and educate customers about the change. Additionally, there is a suggestion to stop using SI prefixes in currency units, with the base unit being 100 satoshi. One participant in the discussion suggests updating Armory's interface to reflect the proposed change, with a popup introducing the change and input boxes auto-updating nearby labels with converted-to-BTC values. All displayed BTC values will show both, but the 1e-6 unit will always be default or first unless changed explicitly in the interface.</summary>
