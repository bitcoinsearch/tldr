    <summary>The number of full nodes in Bitcoin network does not matter as long as it is enough to satisfy demand by other nodes. However, having a high number of nodes has some benefits such as lower cost of running each node and psychological benefit of making Bitcoin appear bigger and more robust. Establishing better metrics to measure capacity vs demand is necessary as we do not have a good way to measure it currently. It is important to know the reason behind the drop in the number of nodes, whether it is insufficient interest or running a node is too painful.  The characteristic of being able to make use of non-dedicated nodes should be regarded as an advantage of the Bitcoin protocol, and not something to get rid of as it may lead to even more robustness than decentralization alone.</summary>
