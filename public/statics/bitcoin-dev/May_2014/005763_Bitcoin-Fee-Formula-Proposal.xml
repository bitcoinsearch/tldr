    <summary>Peter Grigor proposed a new method to calculate the transaction fee for Bitcoin in a message posted on GitHub issue manager. The proposed method involves calculating the fee from a percentage of the input amount divided by the confirmations of the input multiplied by the number of inputs. However, some responses in the issue tracker suggest that this method may not be suitable for Bitcoin and that it could potentially do more harm than good. As a result, there are concerns about whether or not this proposal should be implemented.</summary>
