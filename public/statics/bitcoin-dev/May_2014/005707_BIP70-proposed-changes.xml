    <summary>A user named Odinn had some questions regarding the progress of two-factor authentication and Bitcoin. They were curious if the Android developer working on this had made any progress towards an open issue or pull request that would allow for fully decentralized authentication residing on one's device or devices. The post mentioned that maidsafe developers could potentially be a useful resource in these efforts. Another user, Ryan X. Charles, mentioned that BitPay was working on a new standard based on Bitcoin-like addresses for authentication, and proposed that they work with the community to establish a complete, decentralized authentication protocol. Andreas Schildbach found this idea interesting and requested to be kept updated on any developments. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, linked to the Identity Protocol v1 on the Bitcoin wiki and provided a link to a whitepaper on managing the performance of cloud-based applications.</summary>
