    <summary>The email conversation is between Alex Kotenko and Robert McKay about setting up DNS seeds. Alex had set up DNS seeds a week prior to the email exchange but there was a problem that they could not sort out. He could reach his nameserver and get DNS seed responses if he queried it directly with dig but when he tried nslookup, it failed. Robert suggested using bind forwarding which would allow cascading of non-matching requests to other DNS servers at IP:PORT. However, this solution did not work as bind was stripping off the authoritative answer bit in the reply causing the recursor to go into a loop chasing the authority server. Robert mentioned that he could not see any way to make bind return authorative answers in the configuration. Alex suggested setting up a custom SOA record for it to fix the problem, but he was unsure what the SOA name should be assuming that the NS record for testnet-seed.alexykot.me was pointing at alexykot.me. Robert pointed out that the problem was the 'aa' flag was missing in the flags section in dig, and suppressing the authority records was not a good solution even if it might work for some resolvers. The email thread ends with Robert sharing his email address for further communication and a link to download web API in 5 minutes.</summary>
