    <summary>The discussion on the small number of Bitcoin nodes and its possible consequences took place among developers in 2014. The concern was raised about the network being vulnerable to attack due to the small number of full nodes running. It was suggested that financial incentives could be a way to encourage more people to run nodes. A tool similar to Tor's 'arm' was proposed to provide users with information such as bandwidth up/down graphs, CPU usage, connected peers+statistics, and currently active configuration. The tool could be packaged with Bitcoin or offered as a separate package. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Felipe Micaroni Lalli, the developer of Bitcoin Paranoid Android, provided his contact details at the end of the email.</summary>
