    <summary>The context discusses a rejected idea of using a communication backchannel for retrieving funds due to the fact that it would make the payment non-atomic. The proposal is instead to send payment messages directly to the merchant, who takes responsibility for broadcast. Once transactions are delivered successfully, the payment is considered made from the sender's perspective. The author argues that a good store and forward network does not allow messages to go missing, therefore atomicity is not a concern. The proposal is presented as an alternative design call that reasonable people may disagree on.</summary>
