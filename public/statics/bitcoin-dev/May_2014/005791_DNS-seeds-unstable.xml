    <summary>On May 16, 2014, Rob Golding reported that dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org was experiencing SERVFAIL and multiple ISPs had already tried to resolve it. The domain's authoritative server jun.dashjr.org was not responding to DNS queries at the time of the report. In response to the report, Luke stated that jun.dashjr.org had resolved 130 requests in the past 12 hours. However, there were two potential problems observed. Firstly, there were significant routing issues on the IPv4 internet for the past 24-48 hours which caused people using various diverse ISPs, including Luke himself, to be unable to route to any of his servers. Secondly, the DNS seeder only responded to requests over IPv4, leaving IPv6 DNS servers with no response.</summary>
