    <summary>The discussion revolves around making sure that notes being accepted are loaded and when someone is redeeming the notes, they have control over the physical object itself. The challenge is to achieve this without any active powered electronics in place. One solution suggested is multisignature P2SH addresses where several independent entities are trusted to combine paper notes into one piece. However, it is still uncertain if all private keys can be recovered in case of a failed print. Alex Kotenko suggests that even with paper notes printed proprietarily by some business, there can be routes for independent blockchain-based verification without having to trust anyone to test it. The only issue is technical security, which needs to be addressed. Trusted Platform Modules are suggested as a possible solution, but it requires trusting the manufacturer of the device and ensuring it has no exploitable side channels.</summary>
