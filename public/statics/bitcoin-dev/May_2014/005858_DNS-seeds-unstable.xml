    <summary>In a thread of emails between Robert McKay and Jeff Garzik, McKay suggested that it is possible to configure Bind as a DNS forwarder by doing so in a zone context. This would allow different zones to be forwarded to different DNS seed daemons running on different non-public IPs or two different ports on the same IP. However, Garzik argued against this, stating that the use of bind/zone-xfer system would result in fewer total addresses going through to the clients due to caching levels, and if the choice was between no-service and Bind, Bind should be used. In response to McKay's concern that setting it up as a zone forwarder would cause each request to go through to the DNS seed backend for each request, Garzik provided links to stackoverflow and zytrax which suggest that it is possible to forward to different ports on 127.0.0.1 for each DNS seed instance.</summary>
