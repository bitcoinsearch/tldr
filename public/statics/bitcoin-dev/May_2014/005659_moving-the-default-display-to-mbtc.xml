    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Ben, they discuss the need for a standardized base unit for Bitcoin that doesn't use SI prefixes. Ben suggests using 100 satoshi as the base unit, and emphasizes the importance of BitPay, Coinbase, Blockchain, and Bitstamp getting together to agree on its usage and promote a joint customer education campaign. He also argues against using SI prefixes in currency units, stating that it is not an accepted standard in any world currency. In response, Jeff provides a link to BitPay's blog post on where to place the decimal point in Bitcoin.</summary>
