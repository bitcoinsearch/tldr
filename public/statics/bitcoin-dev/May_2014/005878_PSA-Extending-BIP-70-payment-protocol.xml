    <title>PSA: Extending BIP 70 / payment protocol</title>

    <summary>The author, Jeff Garzik, advises that payment protocol extensions should be put into a new draft BIP rather than updating BIP 70 continuously. He suggests following the IETF model where new RFCs are produced as protocols are extended and once published, an IETF RFC is considered static. However, he acknowledges that it is okay to break this "static" rule for significant BIP bugs or harmless maintenance of links-to-resources. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
