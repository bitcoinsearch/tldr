    <summary>Avoiding patent infringement no longer requires paying a patent attorney for a freedom to operate review. However, reading patents may not always be productive. If a company learns about a patent that it violates and continues to do business, it becomes a willful violator. This is a logical consequence, as there is likely to be at least one patent violation. Despite this, it never makes sense to read patents. There is only potential for loss.</summary>
