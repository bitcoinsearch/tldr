    <summary>Andreas Schildbach had an issue with testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org. He tried using nslookup but it failed with "server can't find testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org: SERVFAIL". Andreas asked if the requests could be checked in logfiles. The response was that there are no logfiles for DNS requests. The assumption was that the DNS resolver locally or at ISP is unable to handle the fact that the second DNS seed serving the domain testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org is down. Some ISP's run buggy DNS servers and redirect traffic intended for Google's 8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 DNS servers to their own servers. It was suggested that an alternate HTTP(S) based DNS seed be set up for protocol redundancy. When asked what was fixed, peter replied that he did not know exactly but when he logged into the machine it appeared to be running fine but for some reason DNS requests were not being resolved which was corrected after restarting.</summary>
