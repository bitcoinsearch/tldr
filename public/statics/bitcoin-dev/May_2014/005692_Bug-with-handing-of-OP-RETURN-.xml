    <summary>In an email conversation between Flavien Charlon and Jeff Garzik, Flavien expressed confusion regarding a rejected Bitcoin transaction. Flavien noted that the outputs were above dust and inputs were not spent, and that the carried data was well below 40 bytes, so he didn't understand why it was being rejected. In response, Jeff Garzik explained that all of the carried data must be contained within one pushdata. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
