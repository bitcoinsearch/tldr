    <summary>On May 3rd, 2014 at 3:55 p.m., Mark Friedenbach wrote in response to Peter Todd's message regarding the "standard format" of OP_RETURN. Todd had stated that the standard format was simply "OP_RETURN", however, Friedenbach pointed out that the code did not actually implement this standard format when he last checked it. According to Friedenbach, any opcode after OP_RETURN is accepted, such as "OP_RETURN OP_CHECKSIG".</summary>
