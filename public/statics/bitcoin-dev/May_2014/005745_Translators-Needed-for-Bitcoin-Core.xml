    <summary>The Bitcoin project is seeking volunteers to help improve translations in many languages. The 0.9.2 release candidate is scheduled for May 13th, and translations will be accepted for at least a week after that. Native non-English speakers are encouraged to join Transifex to clean up the translations, which will also be used by Litecoin. Volunteers can try nightly builds of Bitcoin Core as it heads towards 0.9.2, join Transifex as a translator and add their account to their language, and join the Translator mailing list to be notified when translations are needed. Even those who do not speak other languages can help by pointing others who do to the translation page.</summary>
