    <summary>The author of the message has a PGP smart card reader and card with a securely generated key and pin entered per signature. They mention that having a single maintainer signing commits isn't enough and that PGP isn't perfect, but "perfect is the enemy of good." Jeff Garzik mentions that current multi-sig wallet technology being rolled out now, with 2FA and other fancy doodads, is arguably more secure than his PGP keyring. He likens his PGP keyring to a non-multisig wallet (set of keys), with all the associated theft/data destruction/backup risks. He thinks that improvements in bitcoin wallets make his PGP keyring appear antiquated and that it lacks 2FA. However, he does note that offline signing works well, mostly.</summary>
