    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, posted on a forum discussing the benefits of stealth addresses and payment protocols. According to him, while stealth addresses are perfect for anonymous donations, communicating with the receiver directly has its own benefits that do not overlap with stealth addresses. The communication enables negotiation of transaction details, messages associated with the transaction, refund information, and no need to scan the blockchain for incoming transactions while allowing both parties to cancel if they disagree. Wuille suggests improving atomicity in the payment protocol instead of adding stealth functionality as a last resort. However, this may not be practical due to the way payments tie up txouts, leading to many edge cases. Another issue is IsStandard() rules, which Wuille plans to write a much-relaxed version of based on soft-fork safe whitelisting/blacklisting of opcodes, version numbers, mutability, etc.</summary>
