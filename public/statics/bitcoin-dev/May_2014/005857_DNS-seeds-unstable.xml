    <summary>In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Robert McKay on May 19, 2014, the possibility of configuring bind as a DNS forwarder was brought up. This could be done in a zone context allowing different zones to be forwarded to different dnsseed daemons running on non-public IPs or different ports on the same IP. However, Jeff Garzik argued that using the bind/zone-xfer system would result in fewer total addresses going through to clients due to the caching levels it brings. Setting up bind as a zone forwarder would cause each request to go through to the dnsseed backend for each request. Despite this, if the choice is between no-service and bind, bind is the better option.</summary>
