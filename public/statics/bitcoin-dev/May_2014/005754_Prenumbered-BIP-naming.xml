    <summary>It has been observed that some individuals are facing difficulties in assigning labels to their BIPs that are yet to be numbered. In order to overcome this issue, it is suggested to label them as "draft--" followed by the name of the BIP, for instance, draft-maxwell-coinburning. This labeling style is inspired by the pre-WG IETF drafts.</summary>
