    <summary>Chris Pacia and another individual discussed the potential of using the payment protocol for stealth, but they realized that doing so would require frequent wallet backups. They considered having wallets auto-respend transactions to a private HD derived key to make them easier to find, but this approach would be inefficient in terms of block space. Although wallet backups may become more valuable over time as they contain more essential data not found on the blockchain, the ability to access funds with just 12 words and a date is a desirable safety feature.</summary>
