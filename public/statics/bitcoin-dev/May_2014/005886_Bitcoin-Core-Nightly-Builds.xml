    <summary>Bitcoin Core now has deterministic builds for MacOS X, thanks to the efforts of Cory Fields. The nightly builder now has Windows, Linux and MacOS X test builds available for download. Warren Togami Jr., on April 16, 2014, announced that the Bitcoin Core developers have a desire to do a mostly bug-fix, cleanup, and translation update release in v0.9.2 a few weeks from then. He urged power users to test the master branch using unofficial nightly builds, to aid in finding bugs and polishing things up faster. In addition, translators can more easily run the latest code and see what strings need to be translated as they rapidly approach the next stable release. The details can be found at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=571414.0.</summary>
