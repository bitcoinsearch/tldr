    <summary>In an email thread discussing the protection of paper wallets from unauthorized redeem, Andreas Schildbach suggests using multiple factors to protect against such attacks. He proposes encrypting a key that is printed on the note as a QR code. However, Alex Kotenko responds with a reminder that usability cannot be sacrificed in the process of implementing security measures. He highlights that people have high expectations when it comes to the usability of paper money and any sacrifices made in this area could lead to the failure of the entire system. The email thread ends with a promotion for SauceLabs' automated cross-browser testing platform.</summary>
