    <summary>It seems that the sender of this message, Alex Kotenko, is discussing a problem with protecting notes from unauthorized redeem. He asks for suggestions on how to distinguish between deliberate redeem by the owner and fraudulent redeem by anyone else with a custom-built long-range NFC antenna. The recipient, Sergio, suggests checking out Firmcoin as it has two capacitive buttons that need to be pressed in sequence to redeem coins, which cannot be done with a long-range antenna. Firmcoin's website (http://firmcoin.com/?p=92) provides more information on its features and patents pending.</summary>
