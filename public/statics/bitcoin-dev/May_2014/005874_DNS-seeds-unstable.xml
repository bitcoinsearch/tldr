    <summary>Alex Kotenko suggested setting up bind forwarding requests to two dnsseeds running on separate ports. However, there seems to be a problem with testnet DNS seed as it only returns one IP address, unlike the mainnet nodes which are working fine. The seeds can be reached through mainnet seed or testnet seed. Robert McKay suggested configuring bind as a DNS forwarder in a zone context, which can forward different zones to different dnsseed daemons running on different non-public IPs or different ports on the same IP. Jeff Garzik contradicted this idea and said that using the bind/zone-xfer system would result in fewer total addresses going through to the clients.</summary>
