    <summary>Andreas Schildbach raised the issue of the instability in Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure caused by a custom DNS implementation that is not entirely compatible. In the past, there have been bugs due to case-sensitive matches for domain names. However, if software relies on DNS seeds exclusively and cannot function properly if one or two are unavailable, it may be using them poorly. DNS seeds should only be used as fast connectivity hints primarily for initial connectivity. Relying solely on DNS seeds increases isolation vulnerabilities since attackers can replace results with ones that isolate a user on a bogus network.</summary>
