    <summary>The email is about setting up bind forwarding requests to two dnsseeds running on separate ports. However, the sender notes that there is a problem with testnet DNS seed as it only returns one IP address while the same DNS seeder looking for mainnet nodes is working fine. The email provides links to access the seeds through the mainnet seed or directly, as well as the testnet seed. The recipient suggests configuring bind as a DNS forwarder, which would result in fewer total addresses going through to the clients, thanks to the addition of caching levels that the bind/zone-xfer system brings. The recipient also provides links to a stackoverflow post describing a similar situation and to information on forwarding to different ports on 127.0.0.1 for each dnsseed instance.</summary>
