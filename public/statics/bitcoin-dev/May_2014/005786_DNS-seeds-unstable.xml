    <summary>Alex Kotenko is facing issues with Andreas' testnet Bitcoin Wallet due to a failure in peer discovery, making it difficult for him to demonstrate XBTerminal POS at the Bitcoin Conference. To resolve this issue, Alex is setting up his own full node and will set it as a trusted peer in the Wallet settings. However, the DNS discovery problem is causing issues even for testnet. Additionally, he had trouble firing up the full bitcoind node for the same reason and had to ask Andreas to paste his node list to manually seed the nodelist. Alex has set up and will run a well-connected testnet node, which they require for XBTerminal. He requests to be informed if he can help fix the DNS discovery issue. Meanwhile, Laszlo Hanyecz suggests that the issue may be firewalled and requires fixing ACL in EC2. Andreas Schildbach reports on the unstable state of Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure and its bugs, such as a case-sensitive match for the domain name. Telefonica, one of Europe's largest ISPs, is unable to communicate with Peter Todd's server. Andreas suggests improving DNS but cannot do so himself as he is not capable of writing C.</summary>
