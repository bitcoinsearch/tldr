    <summary>In a conversation between Jameson Lopp and Wladimir on May 7, 2014, the possibility of offering stats with the installer for running a wallet-less node as an OS background service was discussed. Jameson expressed that there were dependencies on several other pieces of software to do all the heavy lifting of stats aggregation and chart rendering. He asked if Wladimir would be opposed to packaging other software along with the installer if needed. Wladimir responded by stating that it depends on the amount of stuff required. He agreed that having some statistics available would be worth some extra download size. However, he emphasized that implementing things like web services in C++ is not realistic given the time constraints and the great already-written code that is out there. Therefore, something like Python would be necessary for the stats service. Wladimir also suggested that since the chart rendering happens client-side, the web service just has to collect and provide the data, and serve static html/js files. He concluded by emphasizing that as an optional tool, it should be external and not part of bitcoind itself.</summary>
