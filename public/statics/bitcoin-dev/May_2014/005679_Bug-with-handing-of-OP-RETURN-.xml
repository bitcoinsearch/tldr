    <summary>In an email conversation from May 3, 2014, Bitcoin Core developer Mark Friedenbach expressed doubts about accepting a pull request that would add additional transaction outputs to the blockchain. The proposed change aimed to minimize impact on the blockchain, but Friedenbach argued that each extra transaction output would add nine bytes minimum without providing any benefit over serializing the data together in a single OP_RETURN. However, Friedenbach noted that the issue at hand was not extra transaction outputs, but rather additional pushes. He acknowledged that the only potential issue with this proposal would be extra complexity in the IsStandard rule, but questioned the purpose of making hash commitment less uniform with the rest of the network if the application already defined the meaning of the data.</summary>
