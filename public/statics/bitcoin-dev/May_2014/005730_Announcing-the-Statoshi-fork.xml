    <summary>The Tor network's P2P architecture is somewhat similar to how the Bitcoin DNS seeds work but more extensive. However, there are differences in authentication as Tor directory authorities are authenticated while DNS seeds are not. Additionally, Bitcoin places a greater emphasis on decentralization than Tor does. While having a P2P network is necessary for building an anonymity network for Tor, it is not the end goal. Decentralization is the ultimate objective for the Tor network.</summary>
