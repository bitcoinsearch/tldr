    <summary>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Mike Hearn proposes a method to achieve atomicity and stealth payments without additional space in the blockchain. A lightweight client would identify transactions via the payment protocol. If a payment gets lost, a last-ditch "scan for stealth payments" button could be implemented that either asks a semi-trusted server to scan the blockchain or accepts the bandwidth hit and does so itself. The scan pubkey used to find payments is unable to spend those payments.</summary>
