    <summary>In May 2014, Gregory Maxwell suggested that people struggling to attach labels to their yet-to-be-numbered Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should call them "draft-- does&gt;" like draft-maxwell-coinburning in the style of pre-WG IETF drafts. However, there seems to be a high bar to getting a number assigned to a BIP, despite BIP 1 suggesting it's no big deal. Some proposals with hours of work put into them aren't getting BIP numbers. It's unclear why this is the case, as there's no shortage of integers. Numbers are supposed to be assigned to all proposals so that organized discussions can take place regarding them, even those that are not well-liked.</summary>
