    <summary>In a communication dated May 7, 2014, Mike Hearn suggested an idea of exporting stats over regular TCP and making them public so that anyone can listen to the stats feed for any node. This suggestion was made in the context of an unknown project or initiative. It is worth noting that TOR uses a similar approach to make its statistics public through torstatus.blutmagie.de. However, it is unclear what technology or tools TOR uses to submit or gather these statistics.</summary>
