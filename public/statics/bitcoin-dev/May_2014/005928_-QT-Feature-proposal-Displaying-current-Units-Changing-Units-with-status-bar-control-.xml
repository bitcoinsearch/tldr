    <summary>There has been a debate over the default unit of display to use for Bitcoin transactions. The conversation can be found on GitHub and was closed. Regular users may have trouble finding a way to change the current unit of display, so having a status bar component that shows the current unit of display and allows easy changing could be beneficial. The proposed component would show the current unit of display at all times and allow users to easily change it. Feedback is being requested before submitting a pull request to polish the component.</summary>
