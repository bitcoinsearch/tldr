    <summary>The Bitcoin network is looking for ways to limit rates and make block download more robust. A short-term solution could be adding a service bit that says "I have chain data and am willing to Bloom filter it for you, but I won't serve full block data". This would allow home users who may have no tolerance for block chain uploads at all to still take part and offer useful services to the network. The idea of an "archival node" service bit has also been suggested. It's possible that "I have CPU and can filter" needs to be separated from "I have bandwidth and can serve" more vigorously.</summary>
