    <summary>Bitcoin Core developers are advised to sign their git commits as it helps in ensuring the integrity of the tree. To sign a commit, users need to provide the `-S` flag or `--gpg-sign` to git commit when committing changes. Users can also retroactively sign previous commits using `--amend`, or use the interactive rebase command with 'edit' to go back further. It is important to note that rewriting history will require resigning as signatures will be lost. To check if commits are signed, users can use git log with show-signature. Pieter Wullie has created a script that simplifies merging and signing and can be found in contrib/devtools. The script can be used to merge pull requests and drop users into a shell to verify changes and test.</summary>
