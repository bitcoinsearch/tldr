    <summary>In an email conversation between Jameson Lopp and Wladimir, they discussed the difficulties of shipping an integrated stats/monitoring feature in the short term. As a solution, Jameson created a public Statoshi instance with a nicer interface. Wladimir provided feedback on the graphs, suggesting that visualizing smaller quantities made them invisible due to scale. He also suggested adding random stats such as the number of connected peers that are SPV clients or full nodes, current block height to detect stuck nodes, number of transactions in mempool and UTXO set, fee statistics, and number of orphan blocks/orphan transactions.</summary>
