    <summary>The conversation revolves around the need for a team that cares about the operations side of the network. One person in the conversation points out that assuming knowledge of what statsd is, could be an issue. They had believed it to be a small UNIX daemon, but discovered that it's actually a Javascript tool. The discussion then moves onto setting up a monitored bitcoind setup, which seems like a lot of work. The idea is raised to simplify the process by running a community statsd and graphite instance, allowing for aggregate statistics across many nodes without individual node operators having to set everything up themselves.</summary>
