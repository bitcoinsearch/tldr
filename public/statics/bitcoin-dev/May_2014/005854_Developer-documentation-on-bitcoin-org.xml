    <summary>Saïvann Carignan, a Bitcoin developer, announced that a new "Developer Documentation" section will soon be merged into bitcoin.org. The documentation has been worked on extensively to ensure good quality and general feedback has been positive. Experienced Bitcoin developers are now invited to help proofread the documentation before it is published. The pull request for the documentation can be found on GitHub, where reviews and feedback are welcome. The pull request will be merged on May 24th and any inaccuracy or mistake should be reported as soon as possible. Comments on the pull request or bitcoin-documentation mailing list are requested instead of commenting on the mailing list to avoid spamming everyone. A live preview of the documentation can be found at bitcoindev.us.to/en/developer-documentation and a Bitcointalk thread about the documentation can be found at bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=511876.0.</summary>
