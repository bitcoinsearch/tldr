    <summary>The Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure seems to be unstable, as it is not 100% compatible with its custom DNS implementation. There are currently only two testnet seeds listed in bitcoind; one of them returns SERVFAIL (testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org), and the other just returns one A record (testnet-seed.bluematt.me). It is unclear what seeds bitcoinj uses. Users who depend on testnet, especially for important demos, are encouraged to contribute to the infrastructure, as this stuff does not fix itself for free. Andreas' testnet Bitcoin Wallet did not work because of a fail in peer discovery, which caused problems while demonstrating the XBTerminal POS on the Bitcoin Conference. Alex Kotenko set up and ran a well-connected testnet node to resolve the issue. In May 2014, Laszlo Hanyecz suggested that the problem might be firewalled, and probably just needs ACL fixing in EC2. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, was also involved in the discussion thread. During the conversation, they discussed the instability of Bitcoin's DNS seed infrastructure and how it can be improved. They also shared links to SauceLabs, an automated cross-browser testing platform that could be useful for testing purposes.</summary>
