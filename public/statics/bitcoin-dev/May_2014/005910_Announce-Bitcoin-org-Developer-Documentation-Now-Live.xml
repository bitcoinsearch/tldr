    <title>Announce: Bitcoin.org Developer Documentation Now Live</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin.org has released the first version of its Developer Documentation, comprising two main documents - an overview-level guide and a more detailed reference. The page also links to individual sections of the documentation and noteworthy off-site documentation. The current version is approximately 130 pages long in total and contains plain-English descriptions of the block chain and transactions, including several illustrations. It also includes information about wallet formats, payment processing details (currently aimed primarily at developers writing payment-receiving applications for merchants) and a description of every RPC included in Bitcoin Core 0.9 cross-referenced with the other sections of the documentation and augmented with actual examples of the command in use. In addition to this, there are over 2,000 cross-references in the text. Additions and improvements to the text are being worked on right now, with an average of 200 lines of text being added each day. However, expert reviewers are needed and issues can be opened on the main Bitcoin.org repository. The work was done by volunteers who are always looking for more contributors.</summary>
