    <summary>Alex Kotenko inquired about the non-functioning DNS seeds at testnet3 and proposed starting his own DNS seed to solve the issue. Andreas Schildbach suggested testing the current infrastructure and finding solutions for problems rather than throwing additional hardware at a problem. Jeff Garzik mentioned that there are only two testnet seeds listed in bitcoind, and one of them returns SERVFAIL while the other just returns one A record. He also suggested contributing to the infrastructure if depending on testnet for an important demo, as it doesn't fix itself for free.</summary>
