    <summary>The discussion is centered around the idea of embedding electronics that can run an SPV client into printed paper. It is mentioned that passive NFC tags can be printed on paper, but not actual chips and power modules. However, even if paper notes are printed by a business, they can still have routes for independent blockchain-based verification, eliminating the need to trust anyone for testing. The only issue here is technical security, which the author is seeking solutions for. The conversation then shifts to Trusted Platform Modules, which are like smartcards that won't leak their keys and allow the holder to spend coins. These devices could have their own SPV wallet client and use attestation features provided by the TPM to prove the software is unmodified to the current holder. However, one would still need to trust the manufacturer of the device and ensure there are no exploitable side channels.</summary>
