    <summary>The conversation involves the use of SI prefixes and their relevance. The initial point made was that 'k' and 'M' are the SI prefixes and people use them to refer to sums of money such as 63k USD, $63k and $3M. This point is agreed upon with another person commenting that it is an excellent point. The conversation then shifts to discussion about the use of the term "bits" to refer to mili-bitcoins or mBTC, which some pronounce as "mili-bits" or "m-bits", instead of referring to uBTC. The conversation ends with a PGP signature.</summary>
