    <summary>Jameson has set up a public Statoshi instance and added a nicer interface on top of it since it seems unlikely that an integrated stats/monitoring feature will be shipped in the short term. The public Statoshi instance can be accessed at http://statoshi.info, while the raw Graphite stats can be viewed at http://statoshi.info:8080/. Jameson also invites those with metrics that they think would be helpful for development or monitoring purposes to let him know so he can add them.</summary>
