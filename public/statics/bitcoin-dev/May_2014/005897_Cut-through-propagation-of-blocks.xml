    <summary>In an email thread on May 24, 2014, Ashley Holman stated that nodes would receive blocks as they do currently and invalid blocks meeting the PoW would be broadcast to everyone. A motivated attacker could subjugate the entire Bitcoin network with a DoS attack through cut-through forwarding of blocks. Attackers could also use block bodies that never arrive leading to empty mining blocks based on valid-PoW headers whose body never arrives. These attacks could be mitigated by allowing nodes to send messages stating that the header they sent is valid PoW but its body is invalid. Network DoS should not be possible since it is expensive to make invalid blocks that meet network PoW.</summary>
