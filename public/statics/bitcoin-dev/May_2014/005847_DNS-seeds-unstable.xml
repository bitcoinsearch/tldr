    <summary>Alex Kotenko, a Bitcoin developer, has set up a DNS seed for mainnet and testnet at bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me and testnet-seed.alexykot.me respectively, but is facing an issue as the dnsseed daemon cannot serve more than one name at once. This means that he cannot serve both testnet and mainnet seeds off of one daemon instance, requiring him to buy two IP addresses for it. He cannot solve this problem by himself as he cannot work with C++. Andreas Schildbach, another Bitcoin developer, confirms that there are currently no working DNS seeds at the testnet3 and that Alex's plan to set up a DNS seed for both testnet and mainnet would be helpful. The DNS seeder daemon that Alex plans to use is what most other seeds are using. Schildbach encourages Alex to let him know if he has something to test.</summary>
