    <summary>This is a message from Mike Hearn, in response to someone who he believes is causing problems on a development list. The other person had suggested that certain ideas were too dangerous to discuss. Mike disagrees with this and believes that creating a parallel forum where people have to swear an oath not to think bad thoughts is medieval thinking. He also mentions that the other person's "vicious attacks" are causing problems on the list and suggests they should unsubscribe. The message ends with a PGP signature.</summary>
