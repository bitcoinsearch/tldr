    <summary>In a discussion about options for implementing clients, Nelson Castillo suggests using SNMP as there are many existing tools written for it. However, Wladimir expresses concern that even implementing SNMP on a client device/application is complex and suggests that registering custom OIDs can be complicated. He questions the added value in this case, noting that while there are tools for monitoring SNMP, those tools also support other ways of collecting statistics.</summary>
