    <summary>The discussion starts with a link to bitcointalk.org, where the protocol of supporting UDP transport is suggested. This would allow for NAT traversal and more people to run effective nodes. The idea is to offer UDP as a full TCP replacement capable of STUN-assisted NAT traversal and possibly swarmed blockchain syncs. It would require open TCP nodes to facilitate "connection" establishment. Jeff Garzik spec'd out the UDP traversal of the P2P protocol and agreed that it seems reasonable especially for "inv" messages. Andy Alness, a software engineer at Coinbase in San Francisco, CA, is curious if this could improve block propagation time. The conversation then shifts to the potential for a blockchain fork due to network split happening, and whether mining interests in China will make special arrangements to circumvent the GFwOC. It is unlikely that any significant portion of miners in China will continue to mine on a China-specific chain since it will certainly be outmined by non-Chinese miners and will be orphaned eventually. Users who can't access the worldwide blockchain will notice horrendously slow confirmation times and other side effects.</summary>
