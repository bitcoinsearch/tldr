    <summary>In a mailing list message, Raúl Martínez discusses the issue of the small number of Bitcoin full nodes. As an owner of two Bitcoin Nodes, he offers his thoughts on how to increase the number of nodes. Another party, Bjørn Øivind, adds his own suggestion of implementing network rate limiting for nodes, as it caused him some issues when he first set up his node. He also mentions that he has been satisfied with the packages provided by Arch Linux for running a Bitcoin node.</summary>
