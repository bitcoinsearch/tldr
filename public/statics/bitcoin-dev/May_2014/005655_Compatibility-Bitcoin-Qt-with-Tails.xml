    <summary>In an email conversation on May 2, 2014, Kristov Atlas confirmed that a dev binary runs smoothly in the latest version of Tails, v1.0, which was tested by him. He also provided a screenshot as proof. Wladimir assured that the usual Linux binary would be compatible when incorporated into the next release of Bitcoin Core. However, he added that they may add a binary linked to Qt 5.x for newer distributions at some point in time. Nevertheless, compatibility remains their primary concern.</summary>
