    <summary>In an email from May 2014, Gregory Maxwell discusses the potential benefits of filing for a patent as a defensive approach to prevent others from patenting the same material in the future. By filing for a patent, the work is entered into the USPTO database, which examiners are guaranteed to consult during a prior art search. While it's possible that they may also search the internet and use other resources, consulting existing patents and applications is guaranteed. The email recipient then asks if applying for patents and letting the application lapse would be a viable strategy, but there is no response provided.</summary>
