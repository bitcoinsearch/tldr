    <summary>In a discussion from 2014 between Mike Hearn and Peter Todd, the idea of depending solely on a communications backchannel to retrieve funds was rejected due to non-atomicity issues. However, Todd proposed the idea again, stating that payment messages would be sent directly to the merchant who takes responsibility for broadcast, ensuring atomicity. He also plans on adding this feature to the stealth address standard in a backwards compatible way. The current standard allows senders who don't implement or choose not to use this feature to simply fall back to op-return.</summary>
