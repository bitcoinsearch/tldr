    <summary>In an email conversation on May 14, 2014 at 1:42 PM, Jameson Lopp thanked someone for suggesting metrics to collect and acknowledged that tracking per-peer pings is a different type of metric than what he's currently collecting. He mentioned that he had noted the lack of pong messages in a post he made a few weeks ago on coinchomp.com and provided a link to it. The email also included a pull request #2784.</summary>
