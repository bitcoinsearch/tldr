    <summary>The writer is bringing up the issue of Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure being unstable. The problem arises due to the use of a custom DNS implementation which is not completely compatible and has had past bugs like case-sensitive match for domain names. The current state of Bitcoin DNS seeds taken from bitcoinj shows that some are okay while others have SERVFAIL issues, one is tried multiple ISPs and one only returns one node. Telef√≥nica, a large European ISP, is experiencing problems with testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org. The writer would like to improve DNS but cannot write in C, so their fix would be to re-implement everything in Java, although they believe others may not be happy with that solution.</summary>
