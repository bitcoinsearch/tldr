    <summary>In this email exchange, Toshi Morita reports a bug found while running bitcoind under valgrind. The uninitialized variable in question is located in the CWallet class and causes a conditional jump or move depending on uninitialised value(s). The bug occurs because nTimeFirstKey is not initialized when the wallet is instantiated. Toshi provides a fix for the issue in his fork of the code, which involves initializing nTimeFirstKey to 0. Mark Friedenbach suggests that Toshi submit a pull request on Github, where it will likely be merged quickly.</summary>
