    <summary>There are issues with the Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure being unstable and not 100% compatible. Some of the seeds like dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org and testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org are experiencing SERVFAIL errors when tested by different ISPs. Even large ISPs like British Telecom and Telefonica are unable to access the servers. The current DNS implementation has had bugs in the past, such as a case-sensitive match for domain names. Andreas Schildbach suggests improving DNS but admits he is not capable of writing C. He proposes a fix of reimplementing everything in Java which may not be acceptable. The email also includes a message promoting SauceLabs, an automated cross-browser testing platform.</summary>
