    <summary>In a discussion on the use of commit signing in Git, Chris Beams expresses his willingness to comply with it while also questioning its efficacy. He points towards the arguments against commit signing and Linus Torvalds' negative opinion on it. In response, Wladimir acknowledges that he has read the arguments but questions whether signing tags would be more helpful. However, the issue with Git is that signatures are placed in the history itself, making it difficult to indicate acceptance after code review. It is suggested that Git was not designed for a commit-signing workflow.</summary>
