    <summary>In an email conversation dated May 8, 2014, Gregory Maxwell explained the workings of the Tor network. The network operates on a centralized but theoretically federated trusted directory service, which is responsible for much of the data that is not related to relay. Semi-trusted bandwidth authorities generate data by measuring node performance back to the directory authorities, similar to how Bitcoin DNS seeds work. However, this process is more extensive and involves third-party testing on nodes.</summary>
