    <summary>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Alex Kotenko, Kotenko shares that he has set up BIND forwarding requests to two DNS seeds running on separate ports. However, he notes a problem with the testnet DNS seed as it only returns one IP address. He provides links to reach both mainnet and testnet seeds separately. In response, Schildbach asks if Kotenko plans to make the seeds reachable on port 53 eventually, but notes that currently bitcoinj cannot deal with nonstandard ports. The email chain also includes discussions about configuring BIND as a DNS forwarder and forwarding requests to different ports on 127.0.0.1 for each dnsseed instance.</summary>
