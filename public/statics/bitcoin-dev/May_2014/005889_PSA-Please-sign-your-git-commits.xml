    <summary>In a conversation between Jeff Garzik and Wladimir, they discuss the security of multi-sig wallets compared to PGP keyrings. Garzik believes that current multi-sig wallet technology with 2FA and other features is more secure than his PGP keyring, which poses theft, data destruction, and backup risks. He notes that the more improvements he sees in bitcoin wallets, the more outdated his PGP keyring appears. Despite the PGP keyring compromise process being rarely exercised and lacking 2FA, offline signing works well. The discussion then shifts to the possibility of having multisig for git commits, which would allow for interesting multi-factor designs that reduce damage when a developer's computer is compromised. However, Wladimir notes that it may require a lot of work to establish a good workflow. Finally, he invites anyone interested in exploring this further to pick it up.</summary>
