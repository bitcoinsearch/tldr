    <summary>The issue at hand is that the server can't find 'testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org: SERVFAIL'. The person addressing the issue has asked if they can look at the logfiles to see how the requests arrive. The requester has also asked what particular thing was fixed for future outages. Peter Todd, who had previously discussed this in Github, noted that if your application breaks because all DNS seeds are down then the application is broken and insecure. He suggests using fallbacks such as hardcoded node lists and manual peer entry. Todd also recommended running your own centralized high-availability/low-latency nodes if instant startup is needed, but acknowledges that either way, you're depending on a centralized resource.</summary>
