    <summary>In May 2014, Adam Back initiated a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the non-development related topics being discussed. He expressed his concern about the lack of a convenient mailing list format for non-dev stuff and suggested that web forums were not ideal for this purpose. Jeff Garzik then informed the group about the existence of a little-used "bitcoin-list" on SourceForge that could be used for general discussions. Garzik suggested that the list could be rebooted with new rules such as being good to each other and allowing only topics related to decentralization, consensus, proven data structures or crypto. Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
