    <summary>During a discussion on May 30, 2014, Andreas Schildbach suggested that the seeder or bitcoind should be taught how to write a zone file and use DNS servers to serve this zone. However, he was uncertain if this approach would work since he had never run his own DNS before. Matt's implementation is already following this approach, thus Andreas does not need to run his own implementation. Pieter chose not to do so as he wanted to serve different responses to each query, but more diversity in implementation is still beneficial.</summary>
