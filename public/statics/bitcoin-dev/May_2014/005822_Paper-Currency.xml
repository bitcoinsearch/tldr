    <summary>The author expresses some fear in proposing ideas on the Bitcoin mailing list and suggests ways to improve the atmosphere. Gavin Andresen requested a solution to the forum trolling problem during his Bitcoin 2014 keynote. The author suggests that people should continue to share their ideas and mute threads if they don't care about them. However, if someone becomes too aggressive, it is up to the rest of the group to remind them that this behavior is unacceptable. Additionally, Gavin and the author are looking for neutral individuals who are willing to become list moderators and help keep the debate civilized. While moderation is not ideal, consistent feedback from many people indicates that it is necessary.</summary>
