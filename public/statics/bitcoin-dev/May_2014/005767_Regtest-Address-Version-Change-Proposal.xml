    <title>Regtest Address Version Change Proposal</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around changing the address versions in -regtest mode to be unique so that they are no longer identical to testnet. The proposal is to modify the regtest pubkey hash addresses to begin with "r" or "R". However, bitcore guesses the network from the address version in several places in its code and does not want to change it. Bitcoinj supports and uses regtest mode but would also have to be changed. There is a concern that changing the address code would disrupt a bunch of people and seems kind of annoying. The existing tools outside of pull tester need to be modified to support this change to regtest. Warren Togami Jr. proposed this change and also wants to know if any existing tools would need to be modified to support this change.</summary>
