    <summary>The security of current multi-sig wallet technology is being improved with 2FA and other features, making it more secure than PGP keyring. PGP keyring is like a non-multisig wallet with all the associated risks, such as theft, data destruction, and backup. The compromise process of PGP keyring is rarely exercised, and offline signing works well. Gregory Maxwell suggests that signed commits would make it easier to sort out things like git account compromises and used to submit commits. However, Mark Friedenbach asks what signed commits would do to help in this situation. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
