    <summary>In an email from May 2014, Bitcoin Core developer Alan Reiner proposed modifying the way Bitcoin Core prioritizes blocks. Currently, it uses the first full block verified instead of considering the first valid header received as the highest priority, but only mining on it once it has done a full verification of the block. Reiner suggested this change because the current system opens up an attack where one can delay announcing the content of a block while continuing to mine on it, thereby depriving others of their winning position.Reiner also addressed concerns about the 1-3 second gap that could occur with the new system and advised miners to focus on making sure the transactions they are mining are well-propagated already. Additionally, he suggested that with an alternative transport protocol, similar latency could be achieved without increasing the motivations for miners to misbehave.</summary>
