    <summary>A Java implementation of BIPSS can be found on Github and is based on a GF2^8 implementation. The use of 3 encoding formats (long/short/compact) is considered over-engineered, with the long format being the only necessary option from a user experience perspective. A fork of Matt's proposal converted to GF(2^8) is also available on Github. This fork includes changes such as allocating only six application/version bytes, encoded prefixes being SK/SL for a shared private key and SS/ST for a shared BIP32 seed, using only SHA-256 hash function and double SHA, and bias-less encoding of M and x. It is suggested that addresses and related things contain an opaque 'version' identifier to identify the purpose for the data.</summary>
