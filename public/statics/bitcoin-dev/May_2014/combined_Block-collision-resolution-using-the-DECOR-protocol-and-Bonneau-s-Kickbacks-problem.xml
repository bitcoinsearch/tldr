    <summary>In a blog post titled "Decor," author Sergio Lerner proposes a method of decorating Bitcoin transaction messages to add personalization and privacy. The format for these decorated transaction messages includes a unique identifier followed by the desired message and a checksum for verification purposes. Lerner argues that this method of decorating Bitcoin transaction messages adds a level of personalization and privacy to the Bitcoin network, and encourages others to adopt this method. Lerner also addresses the Bonneau's Kickbacks problem, which creates a destabilizing incentive in the Bitcoin network. He proposes a conflict resolution strategy called DECOR (DEterministic COnflict Resolution) that benefits all members of the network and prevents kickbacks. The DECOR strategy can be implemented along with the GHOST protocol, which aims to achieve higher TPS securely by changing the way nodes decide which is the best chain fork.However, one issue not considered in the GHOST protocol paper is the existence of a selfish bias independent of the minerâ€™s hashing power. Double-betting is a mining strategy pre-programmed in the Satoshi reference miner. To prevent kickbacks and provide a conflict resolution strategy that benefits all members of the network, the DECOR strategy has been discovered. It incentivizes resolving conflicts in a deterministic way that benefits all conflicting miners at the same time and can practically eliminate any possible block-chain reversal when miners are rational.There are concerns about kickback-style attacks and selfish mining becoming more profitable, but it is difficult for miners to prevent others from including the uncle block and taking the reward. The attack would be costly and inefficient, with each bribery payment having to be higher than the 5 BTC reward for including the uncle block. In terms of selfish mining, GHOST does not affect it, but DECOR changes revenue collection significantly. Although selfish miners can still cause others to reduce their revenue by having them work on older blocks, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer believe that selfish miners cannot gain any advantage under the DECOR protocol because blocks that lose the latency race will come back as uncles and still get their share of the reward.Finally, to break ties between blocks A and B, a better approach than hashing the blocks would be to see if H(A||B) &gt; in advance if their block is likely to win a collision. By using both protocols together, along with route optimizations proposed here, maybe 2000 TPS can be achieved today.</summary>
