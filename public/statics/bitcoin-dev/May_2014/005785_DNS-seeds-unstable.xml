    <summary>On May 15, 2014, Andreas Schildbach raised an issue with the Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure. He assumed that it was unstable because a custom DNS implementation was being used which was not fully compatible. There had been bugs in the past such as case-sensitive matching for the domain name. The current state of seeds was listed for both mainnet and testnet. Peter Todd's server was also not accessible to British Telecom, another large ISP in Europe. Telefonica, one of Europe's largest ISPs, could only access one node from testnet-seed.bluematt.me. Andreas suggested improving DNS but stated that he was not capable of writing C, and his "fix" would be to reimplement everything in Java.</summary>
