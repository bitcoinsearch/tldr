    <summary>The email is a discussion on the first rule of patents which states that one should not go looking for patents. US law is written in a way such that if you knowingly infringe, damages triple. Most companies have banned their staff from reading patents, ensuring that the whole point of patents, the sharing of knowledge, doesn't actually function. The author argues that keeping patent discussions off mailing lists is inappropriate and unwise, especially when the tech news is full of such discussions.</summary>
