    <summary>It seems that there is an issue with the DNS settings of testnet-seed.alexykot.me and bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me. The nameserver can be reached and a dnsseed response can be obtained if queried directly using dig @node.alexykot.me, but nslookup fails when trying to access testnet-seed.alexykot.me. A custom SOA record may potentially resolve this issue, although it is unclear what the appropriate SOA name should be assuming that the NS record for testnet-seed.alexykot.me is pointing at alexykot.me. Robert McKay suggested using bind forwarding, but this caused issues with the authoritative answer bit being stripped off in the reply, causing a loop in the recursor chasing the authority server. It is uncertain whether this issue can be fixed without hacking the bind source code. Alex Kotenko requested assistance in debugging and configuring the DNS settings for the seed.</summary>
