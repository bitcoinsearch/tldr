    <summary>Bitcoin's protocol has undergone a significant upgrade with the activation of Taproot. The upgrade has been recorded through various key events, including the first valid Taproot spends in Block 709635, mined by Foundry USA. Individuals such as bitbug42, Andrew Chow, Pieter Wuille, BitGo, jaoNoctus, narcelio, and ottosch have completed Taproot spends after the activation. Alekos Filini used modified code from the BDK library to complete the first use of OP_CHECKSIGADD on mainnet. Several individuals and entities, including 0xB10C, Greg Maxwell, Murch, Daniel McNally, Rearden Code, Chun, and pinheadmz, monitored and highlighted these various events online.However, the recent soft fork activation has exposed some issues with Taproot readiness among mining pools. F2Pool and AntPool were slow to upgrade their nodes to include P2TR spends. F2Pool was not connected to any P2TR-spend-relaying peers due to a custom patch to their node's peer selection behavior based on a heuristic that had broken unnoticed. AntPool also had issues with P2TR spends, but they were quick to react once notified. It is believed that some mining pools were signaling readiness without being fully prepared due to community pressure or running nodes with custom patches. A feature may be implemented to alert/warn a node operator if his node does not have any peers relaying a particular soft-fork transaction. Additionally, for the next soft-fork where relay is affected, instructions for mining pool signaling could state: "Upgrade to version Z and make sure you have a few version Z peers before starting to signal readiness". Despite these challenges, there was significant interest and scrutiny of this successful upgrade, demonstrating a promising future for Bitcoin.</summary>
