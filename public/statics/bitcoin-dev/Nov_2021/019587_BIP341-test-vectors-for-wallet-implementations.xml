    <summary>Pieter is proposing a set of test vectors to be added to BIP341 on GitHub. These test vectors are focused on wallet implementations, covering Merkle root/tweak/scriptPubKey computation from key/scripts, sigmsg/sighash/signature computation for key path spending, and control block computation for script path spending. All values in the test vectors are generated from an actual scenario tested against Bitcoin Core, involving constructing and mining transactions with specified data. The tests are mostly focused on features that are likely useful/testable in implementations right now, and excludes sighashes that involve annexes for that reason. However, if anyone relies on features that are useful but aren't covered, Pieter is happy to add more scenarios.</summary>
