    <summary>On November 17th, 2021 at 1:07 PM, Andrew Chow via bitcoin-dev discussed a change made in version 0.19.0 where creating outputs with an unknown witness version was considered non-standard and violated BIP 173. This issue was fixed for version 0.19.0+ in PR #15846. However, Pieter pointed out that the problem OP is facing is with getting P2TR spends to relay. Currently, all post-segwit pre-taproot Bitcoin Core releases will reject these spends.The issue of getting P2TR spends to relay was discussed on the Bitcoin development mailing list. Prior to version 0.19.0, creating outputs with an unknown witness version was considered non-standard and a violation of BIP 173, which was fixed in PR #15846 for version 0.19.0+. However, the issue at hand concerns the relaying of P2TR spends, which will be rejected by all post-segwit pre-taproot Bitcoin Core releases. A potential solution was suggested by a user on the Bitcoin StackExchange forum, where they made it so the client only connects to nodes with at least protocol version 70016, and found that it worked well.A developer named n1ms0s shared their work on a fork of bitcoinj with basic Taproot support. The fork currently supports basic sending and receiving with Taproot addresses using a bitcoinj SPV wallet, along with public/private key tweaking. However, n1ms0s encountered an issue when broadcasting a Taproot transaction to older nodes (around version 0.18.0), resulting in an error response of "Witness version reserved for soft-fork upgrades." They sought help by posting a question on Stack Exchange and encouraged others to look at their work and provide feedback or even contribute by submitting pull requests. The developer is currently seeking assistance to resolve this issue.</summary>
