    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, n1ms0s proposed a solution to ensure lite wallets connect only to nodes with at least protocol version 70016. However, this protocol version was introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.21.0 which will not relay taproot spends because it does not contain taproot activation parameters. This means that the proposed heuristic is imperfect and will only work if connected to Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 and 22.0 versions or compatible nodes programmed to begin relaying taproot spends starting one block before activation. Dave asked if anyone could recommend a better heuristic for lite wallets to connect to a taproot-activated node and suggested that this could be something that nodes advertise during activation of future protocol extensions. Dave also provided links to relevant sources for further reading.</summary>
