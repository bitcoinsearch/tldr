    <summary>On the Bitcoin development mailing list, a discussion was held regarding the issue of getting P2TR spends to relay. Prior to version 0.19.0, creating outputs with an unknown witness version was considered non-standard and a violation of BIP 173. This was fixed in PR #15846 for version 0.19.0+. However, the issue at hand concerns the relaying of P2TR spends, which will be rejected by all post-segwit pre-taproot Bitcoin Core releases. In response, a user on the Bitcoin StackExchange forum suggested a potential solution in bitcoinj, where they made it so the client only connects to nodes with at least protocol version 70016, and found that it worked well.</summary>
