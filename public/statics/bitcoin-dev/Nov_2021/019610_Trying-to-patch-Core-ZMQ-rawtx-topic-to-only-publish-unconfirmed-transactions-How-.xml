    <summary>To solve a problem, Prayank suggested a solution to Ali, which involved saving zmqpubsequence=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332 in bitcoin.conf file, running bitcoind, and executing a Python script that can be found at https://pastebin.com/raw/tNp2x5y3. The results of the script execution were shared in two screenshots showing the status of accepted, connected (block), and removal transactions. Prayank recommended modifying the script to manage transaction duplication since transactions could be printed twice. Alternatively, he suggested using debug=mempool and reading debug.log for changes without polling.</summary>
