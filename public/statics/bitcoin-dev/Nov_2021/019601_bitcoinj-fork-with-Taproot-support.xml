    <summary>On November 17th, 2021 at 1:07 PM, Andrew Chow via bitcoin-dev discussed a change made in version 0.19.0 where creating outputs with an unknown witness version was considered non-standard and violated BIP 173. This issue was fixed for version 0.19.0+ in PR #15846. However, Pieter pointed out that the problem OP is facing is with getting P2TR spends to relay. Currently, all post-segwit pre-taproot Bitcoin Core releases will reject these spends.</summary>
