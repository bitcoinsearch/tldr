    <summary>A developer is working on a fork of bitcoinj that includes basic Taproot support, allowing for sending and receiving with Taproot addresses using a bitcoinj SPV wallet. The code also supports public/private key tweaking and the developer welcomes feedback or contributions from others. However, the developer is currently experiencing an issue when broadcasting a Taproot transaction to older nodes (~0.18.0), resulting in an error response of "Witness version reserved for soft-fork upgrades." The developer has posted a question about this issue on Stack Exchange and is seeking assistance.</summary>
