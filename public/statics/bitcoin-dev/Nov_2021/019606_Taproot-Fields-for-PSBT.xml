    <title>Taproot Fields for PSBT</title>

    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sjors Provoost expressed confusion over why PSBT_IN_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION and PSBT_OUT_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION contain not just the derivation path for the xonlypubkey, but also the tapleaf merkle path. Andrew Chow had proposed a BIP which defines new fields for Taproot support in PSBT. The proposal includes the Taproot Key BIP32 Derivation Path for both PSBT_IN_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION and PSBT_OUT_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION. These fields contain the 32-byte X-only public key, a compact size unsigned integer representing the number of leaf hashes, followed by a list of leaf hashes, followed by the master key fingerprint concatenated with the derivation path of the public key. Public keys are those needed to spend this output. The leaf hashes are of the leaves which involve this public key.</summary>
