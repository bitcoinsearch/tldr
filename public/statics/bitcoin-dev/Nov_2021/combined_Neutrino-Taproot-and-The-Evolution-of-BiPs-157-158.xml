    <summary>Last week, a faulty heuristic in the neutrino client code caused some issues related to Taproot on testnet. However, the client side and protocol are fine, and the problematic heuristic has been removed in lnd 0.14, which will be included in neutrino 0.13. To ensure that users handle the Taproot upgrade on mainnet smoothly, they can upgrade to 0.14 or apply a small patch. In terms of adding more taproot specific functionality, there are several items that need to be considered. These include reviving old projects to include a micropayment-for-data layer to incentivize nodes to serve the filters and other data, creating new segwit-only filters with re-parameterized fp rates, creating filters that include witness data to allow matching on internal/external keys, the control block, merkle root, annex, etc. Moreover, there is a plan to add a new protocol extension to btcd (with a corresponding BIP) to allow nodes to fetch block undo data to fully verify fetched filters or a node needs to reconcile conflicting filters.Additionally, there is a proposal in progress that allows filters to be committed either as a soft-fork or a "velvet fork" where miners optionally commit to the past filter header chain. Lastly, new filters that span across multiple blocks, as previously worked on by Kalle Alm, are also being considered.</summary>
