    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Prayank shared his opinion on how to improve Bitcoin's decentralization. He suggested that more people should use alternative full node implementations, such as Bitcoin Knots, to decrease the reliance on Bitcoin Core, which currently accounts for 98% of nodes. He also emphasized the importance of having maintainers who do not "simp" for anyone and individuals from different countries getting involved in important roles. Additionally, Prayank believes that organizations funding different Bitcoin projects should consider contributing to alternative full node implementations as well. He quoted a recent Medium post, stating that accepting problems, looking for solutions, and trying to improve things is the best approach for engineers to follow. Prayank also mentioned that only around 1337 blocks are left for Taproot to activate, which he sees as another success for Bitcoin and its regular improvement. Meanwhile, in response to a question about the new website and GPG signers, Prayank pointed out that Wladimir's decision to stop signing releases was a sensible way forward to decrease bus factor. He also shared a link to a blog post discussing decentralization. The email exchange ended with a reminder to always verify the tree hash and trust signed annotated tags when building releases.</summary>
