    <title>Taproot Fields for PSBT</title>

    <summary>In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sjors Provoost expressed confusion regarding the PSBT_IN_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION and PSBT_OUT_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION fields. Specifically, they questioned why these fields contain not only the derivation path for the xonlypubkey but also the tapleaf merkle path. In response, Pieter Wuille clarified that these additional fields are necessary for signers who may not have prior knowledge of the script being signed. By providing information on which keys are present in which leaves and how those keys are derived, signers can sign without fully understanding the script or needing to parse it at all. However, the actual script information is still included for those who do want to analyze it or factor it into their decision whether to sign or not.</summary>
