    <summary>Recently, a faulty heuristic in the neutrino client code caused some issues related to Taproot on testnet. However, there is nothing fundamentally broken with BIP 157/158 as it relates to taproot and a mitigation patch has already been implemented for the encountered issue. The problematic heuristic has been removed, which will be included in lnd 0.14 and has been tagged with neutrino 0.13. To ensure that neutrino clients handle the Taproot upgrade on mainnet smoothly, users can upgrade to 0.14 or apply a small patch. In terms of adding more taproot specific functionality, further progress is being made towards a proposal that allows filters to be committed either as a soft-fork, or a "velvet fork" where miners optionally commit to the past filter header chain.</summary>
