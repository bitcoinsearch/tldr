    <summary>Pieter has proposed a set of test vectors to be added to BIP341 on GitHub. These test vectors are mainly focused on wallet implementations and cover various aspects such as Merkle root/tweak/scriptPubKey computation, sigmsg/sighash/signature computation for key path spending, and control block computation for script path spending. All values in the test vectors are generated from an actual scenario that was tested against Bitcoin Core. The tests are primarily geared towards features that are currently useful and testable in implementations. However, Pieter is willing to add more scenarios if anyone relies on features that are not covered. The tests exclude sighashes that involve annexes for that reason. Overall, these test vectors should be helpful for those working on Bitcoin wallet implementations and looking to ensure correctness and compatibility with Bitcoin Core.</summary>
