    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a Bitcoin developer, describes an algorithm based on semispace garbage collection (GC) in a message to a list. However, he points out that spam is likely to match well with the "infant mortality" concept in GC, where most objects die young, and suggests that a nursery/generational GC approach may be more effective against spam in practice. He refers to proposals for "pre-mempool"/"memswamp" as similar approaches. ZmnSCPxj suggests continuing to consider these approaches rather than his GC concept.</summary>
