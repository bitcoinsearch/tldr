    <summary>In the past, creating outputs with an unknown witness version was considered non-standard and violated BIP 173. However, this issue was resolved for version 0.19.0+ in PR #15846. Recently, a developer named n1ms0s shared their work on a fork of bitcoinj with basic Taproot support. The fork currently supports basic sending and receiving with Taproot addresses using a bitcoinj SPV wallet, along with public/private key tweaking. However, n1ms0s encountered an issue when broadcasting a Taproot transaction to older nodes (around version 0.18.0), resulting in an error response of "Witness version reserved for soft-fork upgrades." They sought help by posting a question on Stack Exchange and encouraged others to look at their work and provide feedback or even contribute by submitting pull requests.</summary>
