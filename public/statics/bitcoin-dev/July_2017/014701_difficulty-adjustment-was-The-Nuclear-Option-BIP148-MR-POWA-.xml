    <summary>The idea of splitting the Bitcoin network into two or three different blockchains has been proposed to triple its capacity. This idea is highly contentious as it could permanently split the network, but it could also heap additional pressure on miners to follow a specific chain and ensure a minimally disruptive upgrade. The MR POWA (Mining Reactive Proof of Work Addition) method has been suggested for introducing an additional proof of work to a blockchain in response to detected mining behavior. In the case of BIP148, the criteria for activation could be when the software detects a non-BIP148 compliant chain that is 144 blocks ahead of a BIP148 compliant chain. The difficulty should be low, and each method would have its own difficulty. It could be a requirement that POW methods alternate to neutralize attacks from the other chain. This would guarantee SegWit activation. Henning Kopp suggests that forks grow with the same block frequency as the main chain implying that the longest chain rule becomes irrelevant since all chains will have the same length. Rather, the chain with most work is the true one. Finally, Kopp advises finding a simple and robust difficulty adjustment that occurs every block instead of bitcoin/litecoin's 2016 block use.</summary>
