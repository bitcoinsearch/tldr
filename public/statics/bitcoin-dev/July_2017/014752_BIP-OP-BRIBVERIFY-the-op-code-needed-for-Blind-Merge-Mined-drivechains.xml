    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion, ZmnSCPxj proposed improvements to the OP_BRIBEVERIFY proposal. The first improvement suggested was to remove the need for coinbase commitments by having the miner commit to the sidechain_id and h* in the transaction that pays the OP_BRIBEVERIFY instead. This would allow the h* commitment to occur only once in the block. The second improvement suggested was to keep a set of sidechain IDs when verifying a block and fail the script processing if an OP_BRIBEVERIFY already exists for that specific sidechain ID. Additionally, a question was raised about eliminating the use of scripting entirely and instead using a special non-standard OP_RETURN output to hold the sidechain_id and h*. It was suggested that a soft fork rule could be implemented to limit this output to one per block per sidechain_id.</summary>
