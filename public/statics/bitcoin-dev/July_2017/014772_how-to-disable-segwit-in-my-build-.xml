    <summary>On July 12th, 2017, Dan Libby reached out to bitcoin-dev stating that he was running bitcoin releases prior to 0.13.1 specifically to avoid segwit activation until he was comfortable with it. However, this is not a supported configuration and even if it were, it would not be supported in the future after segwit activation. The purpose of avoiding segwit activation seems unclear, as having a node that supports it will not make it more likely to activate nor will one's own transactions use segwit simply because their node supports it. The only reason that has been identified for intentionally not running with segwit support is to temporarily have a block as the tip that steals segwit transactions, which is not desirable either personally or publicly.</summary>
