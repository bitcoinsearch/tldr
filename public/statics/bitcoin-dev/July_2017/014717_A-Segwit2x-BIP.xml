    <title>A Segwit2x BIP</title>
    <updated>2023-06-12T03:24:49.111062+00:00</updated>

    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that matches the reference code published by the Segwit2x group, which satisfies the requests of a large part of the Bitcoin community for a moderate increase in the Bitcoin non-witness block space coupled with the activation of Segwit. The BIP draft is available at a GitHub link. The discussion also touches on the timeline and political aspects of the proposal, including concerns about hard forks requiring consensus from the entire ecosystem to prevent a fork, funds loss, confusion, and harm to the robust guarantees of the Bitcoin system. More than 80% of miners and many users are willing to go in the Segwit2x direction. Without Core, there will be a temporary split, and both sides will have to hard-fork. One email expresses opposition to the proposal due to its short timeline and lack of detail in the text.</summary>
