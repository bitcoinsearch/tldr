    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, shaolinfry brought up criticism of BIP9's blocktime based thresholds. Some argue that they are confusing, and miners could fiddle with timestamps to prevent or delay activation. Shaolinfry suggests that if miners start doing 1 second timestamp advances, it would be simpler and safer to require a minimum block time spacing of say 30 seconds or 1 minute. He also believes that any attempt to block activation in this way would simply be an expensive temper tantrum for any miners foolish enough to try it. On the other hand, the exact date of a height-based threshold is hard to predict due to difficulty fluctuations, but there is certainty at a given block height and it's easy to monitor. Shaolinfry offers to amend BIP8 to be height-based if there is sufficient interest. He had originally omitted height-based thresholds for the sake of simplicity of review, but now that the proposal has been widely reviewed, it would be a trivial amendment.</summary>
