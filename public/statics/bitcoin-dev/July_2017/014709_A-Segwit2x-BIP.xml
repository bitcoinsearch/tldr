    <title>A Segwit2x BIP</title>

    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner has submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that matches the reference code built and published by Segwit2x group. The BIP suggests a moderate increase in the Bitcoin non-witness block space with the activation of Segwit. The plain block size is defined as the serialized block size without witness programs. The BIP calls for a modified BIP91 to activate Segwit, replacing the signal "segsignal" with "segwit2x." The BIP also states that if segwit2x activates at block N, then block N+12960 will activate a new plain block size limit of 2 MB (2,000,000 bytes), resulting in a soft fork. However, there is no hard fork, and any transaction with a non-witness serialized size exceeding 1,000,000 is invalid. Matt Corallo pointed out that the specification is under-specified and not possible to implement from what's written, and the implementation doesn't match at all.</summary>
