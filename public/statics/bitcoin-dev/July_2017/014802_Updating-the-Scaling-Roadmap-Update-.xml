    <summary>Paul Sztorc, in his post, has suggested updating the Core Scalability Roadmap. Greg Maxwell, who authored the original roadmap, has NACK'ed the concept and regrets writing the first one. Tom Zander is the only other individual who did not ACK it due to its labeling as a "Bitcoin" document, instead of a specific project document. The draft has been uploaded to GitHub and updated based on all the feedback received from week 1. Spaces have been added at the bottom for comments and expressions of interest. However, the document will probably be unable to gain traction without interest from the maintainers of bitcoincore.org. Paul presents his reason for updating the roadmap, stating that it synchronized the entire Bitcoin community and brought finality to the endless conversations of that time, getting everyone back to work. He mentions that the Dec 7, 2015 roadmap has become obsolete and needs to be revised. He also highlights the fatal O(n^2) scaling problem of the scaling conversation itself. The new roadmap updates the previous roadmap of Dec 2015 and lists technologies that increase Bitcoin's maximum tps rate or make it easier to process a higher volume of transactions. Paul emphasizes concrete numbers and dates and does not write it from his own point of view but tries to capture the community view. He admits that he is partially campaigning for his Drivechain project and the "scalability"/"capacity" distinction but welcomes edits and feedback.The technologies listed in the new roadmap include VersonBits (BIP 9), Compact Blocks (BIP 152), FIBRE Network, Check Sequence Verify (BIP 112), Segregated Witness (BIP 141), Lightning Network, Transaction Compression, Schnorr Signature Aggregation, and drivechain. If the capacity improvements outlined are insufficient, it may be necessary to use a hard fork to increase the block size by a moderate amount. Paul requests  feedback and edits from the community and provides a Google Doc link for those interested.</summary>
