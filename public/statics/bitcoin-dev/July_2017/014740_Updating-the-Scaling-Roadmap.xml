    <summary>Gregory Maxwell, a developer of Bitcoin, suggests that rather than creating roadmaps for Bitcoin development like in Linux kernel development, the focus should be on finalization and release processes once basic technology is finished. The current political situation surrounding Bitcoin development is different from that of Linux with scalability being a major concern. A roadmap could provide insight into what is being planned for Bitcoin, especially regarding scaling solutions. However, it would not be responsible to include deadlines as volunteer developers cannot predict their free time or commitment to the project. Instead, a document describing intentions for scaling solutions can be updated regularly without the traditional concept of a roadmap.</summary>
