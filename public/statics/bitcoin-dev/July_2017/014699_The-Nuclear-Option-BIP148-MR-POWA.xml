    <summary>The proposal to split the Bitcoin network into two or three blockchains as a way to triple its capacity is highly contentious and risky, according to a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list by John Hardy. Hardy suggests that this could be a game-theory exercise to test theories. He also advises finding a simple and robust difficulty adjustment that occurs every block instead of bitcoin/litecoin's 2016 block use. Hardy's post also introduces Mining Reactive Proof of Work Addition (MR POWA) as a method to introduce an additional proof of work to a blockchain in response to detected mining behaviour. The criteria for activation in the case of BIP148 would be when the software detects a non-BIP148 compliant chain that is 144 blocks ahead of a BIP148 compliant chain. This would guarantee SegWit activation, but might permanently split the network.</summary>
