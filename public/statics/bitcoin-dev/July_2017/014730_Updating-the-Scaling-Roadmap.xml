    <summary>The writer appreciates experimentation with technologies like drivechains and sidechains, but points out that their security model differs from Bitcoin's. They also raise a question about the security model for SegWit, which they believe is distinct from Bitcoin's original definition of a "chain of digital signatures." However, they acknowledge that the hash state is still respected at the block level. The writer seeks clarification on this matter and welcomes any insights.</summary>
