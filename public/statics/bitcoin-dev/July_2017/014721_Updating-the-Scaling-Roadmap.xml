    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Chris Stewart expressed his support for drivechains, stating that they should be viewed as the way to scale. However, Pieter Wuille strongly disagreed with this statement. Wuille argued that drivechains and other sidechain ideas are not scalable improvements but are merely options for users to opt-in for another security model. He also noted that this particular model is not interesting due to its validation cost to auditors and the extra risk of miners being able to vote to steal money. While different technologies may be needed in the future, Wuille doesn't believe this option is worth pursuing.</summary>
