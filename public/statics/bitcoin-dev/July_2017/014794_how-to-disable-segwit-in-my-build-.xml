    <summary>In this conversation, Hampus Sj√∂berg explains to the recipient that there are two ways to be fully secure regarding chain transactions. The first option is to validate using the new rules of the network by running a SegWit node. The second option is to avoid any transaction chain that contains a SegWit transaction. The recipient expresses uncertainty about how to achieve the second option, as anyone who has transacted with or knows their address could send them coins at any time. The only way to be certain would be to run a node that has never published an address to a third party. The recipient also considers modifying their own node to reject such transactions but recognizes that this would defeat the goal of remaining with status-quo rules and that the rest of the network would still accept the transactions. They suggest that it might be possible without modifying any rule to construct a "certain balance" and an "uncertain balance," but they do not intend to make any modifications and are just trying to understand the situation. Hampus provides links to explain the new witness program, which is encoded in a new format that old nodes do not understand. For old nodes, a number &gt;0 will be put on the stack, and the script will be evaluated to true (because of &gt;0) and counted as a valid spend. The new witness program is explained more in detail in the provided links.</summary>
