    <summary>Lightning developers have started formalizing their informal Google Hangout, which is held every two weeks. The call is at 20:00 UTC on Mondays every two weeks and the next call is scheduled for July 24th. Developers working on the Lightning protocol who want to attend can send a ping to Rusty Russell, who will add them to the invite. The developers will be using #lightning-dev on freenode's IRC servers to communicate. Russell will produce an agenda of outstanding pull requests on Github and minutes each week and post the latter to the mailing list. Moving forward, all non-spelling/typo changes to the spec will require a vote, with no objections from call participants. Alternatively, any developer unable to make it can veto or defer by emailing Russell in writing before the meeting.</summary>
