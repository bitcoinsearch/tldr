    <title>A Segwit2x BIP</title>

    <summary>Recently, in the Bitcoin community, there are concerns about the urgency of the consensus change and reasons for not delaying until a better-engineered solution. BIP91 is being deployed like an emergency patch or quick bug fix to the system. Though it is not harmful, the hard fork portion of this BIP requires justification for its urgency and reason for not delaying until a better-engineered solution can be deployed, such as Spoonet or BIP103. Sergio Demian Lerner from the bitcoin-dev team has updated the technical specifications of the BIP by specifying block size increase in terms of weight and documented the maximum block sigops after HF. He urges users to start signaling something before block 475776. There is a discussion on the mailing list that the code to support 2x has been out and tested for much longer than one year. However, Jorge Tim√≥n refutes it, saying that while the code is different on top of segwit, the first attempt in btc1 didn't even increase the size.</summary>
