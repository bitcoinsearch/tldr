    <summary>A member of the Drivechain project added the CSidechainAddress class to the mainchainBMM branch a while ago. The class serves no purpose at the moment other than to demonstrate that sidechain deposit addresses can start with a '4'. To make the standard, the sha256 hash described by Paul could be added to a script with OP_RETURN at the front. In response to a message from ZmnSCPxj, Paul Sztorc expressed his support for having the permanent deposit address of a sidechain be equal to a deterministic function of the sha256 hash. This was discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
