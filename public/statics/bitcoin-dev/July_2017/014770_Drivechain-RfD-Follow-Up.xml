    <summary>In an email exchange, Tao Effect questioned Drivechain specification point 4, which states that everyone waits for a period of time to make sure the same WT^ is in both the Bitcoin coinbase and the Sidechain header. Tao Effect claimed that this was a point of disagreement. Paul Sztorc responded by clarifying four different types of user modes: [DC#0], [DC#1], [DC#2], and [DC#3]. Sztorc explained that if a node doesn't have the sidechain's information, it will assume every withdrawal is valid, which is comparable to someone who hasn't upgraded to support P2SH. From the perspective of a mainchain user, every withdrawal is valid, but for a full node of one or more sidechains, there would be an interest in understanding what is going on. However, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin Core and is off-topic for the mailing list.</summary>
