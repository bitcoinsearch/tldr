    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Karl Johan Alm suggested that Bitcoin development differs from Linux kernel development due to the fact that Bitcoin is being "patched in flight". However, this statement was challenged by Tom Zander who argued that just like a Linux box needs a reboot to get a kernel upgrade, a node needs a restart to upgrade and neither the entire internet nor the Bitcoin network would go down as a result. Zander agreed with Alm's suggestion of having a roadmap that gives the average user insights into what exactly is being planned for Bitcoin. However, he believes that individual groups should have solutions they believe are best, and then let the market decide which one should be activated. He also recommended that development groups should structure their roadmaps better than bitcoinhardforkresearch.github.io, and it would not make any sense to have a roadmap for the entire industry as it would require deciding on technical solutions before they are fully researched.</summary>
