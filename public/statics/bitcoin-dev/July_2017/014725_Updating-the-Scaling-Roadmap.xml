    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille expressed his disagreement with the idea that drivechains are the way to scale Bitcoin. He argued that drivechains and earlier sidechain ideas are not a scalability improvement, but rather allow users to opt-in for another security model. While he acknowledged that different technologies with different trade-offs will be necessary for wider adoption, he did not find this particular one interesting. He suggested that it has the same validation cost as just increasing the capacity on-chain, while also adding the extra risk of miners being able to vote to steal users' money. The main point of contention in the discussion was whether users could opt-in to another scaling model just as they can opt-in to another security model.</summary>
