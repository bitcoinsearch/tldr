    <summary>In an email conversation, Pieter Wuille and Paul Sztorc discussed drivechains as a way to scale the blockchain. Sztorc believes that drivechains are similar to hard forks, and neither of them improve scalability, but rather allow users to select a different security model. Wuille disagreed that drivechains could be compared to hard forks, and stated that drivechains offer increased capacity by having many chains combined without everyone verifying all of them. Sztorc argued that drivechains would only be useful if users felt sufficiently compensated for any risks, and Wuille believed that network effects or misinformation may push users beyond what is reasonable. Nonetheless, Wuille did not think that drivechains offer a security model that should be encouraged, and therefore do not have a place on a roadmap.</summary>
