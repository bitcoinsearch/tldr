    <summary>Bitcoin developer Paul Storzc's opinion is that Greg Maxwell's scaling roadmap has met with some success, but the document is now too old to be relevant and should be updated. The roadmap helped synchronise the Bitcoin community, but it is now 19 months old and does not reflect new high-likelihood improvements, such as Schnorr. Storzc has presented a first draft of a new roadmap that emphasises concrete numbers and dates, and his community view on what increases Bitcoin's maximum tps rate or makes it easier to process transactions. Storzc also believes there would be value in updating the roadmap for those who refuse to sign it.</summary>
