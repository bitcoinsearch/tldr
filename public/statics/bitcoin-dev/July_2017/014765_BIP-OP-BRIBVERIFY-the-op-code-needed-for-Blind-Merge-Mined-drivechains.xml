    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, there was a discussion about the proposal for a sidechain to offer merge mining without having to send the headers of all merged chains in each block, and how it could be enforced. The main issue was that the proposal contradicted the "blind" part of blind merge mining as a block list node is valid only if its block is valid. To protect against undercutting attacks in the sidechain, they would need to ensure that the sidechain cannot be reorged without the mainchain being reorged. There were some proposals made to improve the OP_BRIBEVERIFY proposal, including removing the necessity of coinbase commitments and using the hash of the sidechain's name or genesis block to identify them instead of numbering them from 0,1,2,3, etc. It was also suggested that miners will be willing and able to maximize their fee income by imposing a blocksize limit on themselves, orphaning non-compliants, which would be something softfork-esque but not necessarily enforced by non-mining nodes as it is limited to miner tx-acceptance policy.</summary>
