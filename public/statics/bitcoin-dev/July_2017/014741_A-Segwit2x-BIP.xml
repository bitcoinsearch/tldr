    <summary>On July 10, 2017, Sergio Demian Lerner via bitcoin-dev wrote about the timeline and UASF BIP 148 ultimatum. BIP148 started with eight months lead time, which was reduced to five months due to popular request and technical considerations. According to Luke Dashjr, there is nothing about BIP148 that compels an attempted hardfork 90 days later; it could have been 18 months instead. Dashjr disagrees with the statement that more than 80% of miners and users are willing to go in the Segwit2x direction. He observes that only approximately 20% of the community follow Core's technical lead without significant consideration of their own, and many people would oppose the hardfork attempt and fail even with Core's support. Regarding a temporary split without Core, Segwit2x's hardfork does not compel the remaining Bitcoin users to also hardfork. Dashjr agrees that he wants a united Bitcoin, but he disagrees with Lerner's approach that has any possibility of a united Bitcoin. He says that the only way to achieve that today would be to do Segwit+Drivechain, not Segwit+Hardfork.</summary>
