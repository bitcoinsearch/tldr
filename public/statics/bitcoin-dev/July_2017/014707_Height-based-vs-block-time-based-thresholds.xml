    <summary>Shaolinfry proposed a height-based implementation for BIP8, modifying the existing BIP9 to use height instead of time and removing the veto failed state. He argued that block time-based thresholds can be confusing and vulnerable to miners manipulating timestamps, while height-based thresholds provide certainty at a given block height and are easy to monitor. The code and updated BIP text are available on GitHub, and Shaolinfry is open to amending BIP8 to be height-based if there is sufficient interest.</summary>
