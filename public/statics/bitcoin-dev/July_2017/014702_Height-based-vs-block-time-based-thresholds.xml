    <summary>In a recent bitcoin-dev discussion, Hampus questioned the amendments to BIP8 and suggested that it be made into its own BIP or allow for more flexibility in the LOCKED_IN state. Luke Dashjr responded, explaining that the mandatory signal was not pointless, but rather a wake-up call for miners who may be "asleep at the wheel" to upgrade in time. He also noted that the mandatory signal fixed a serious bug in BIP9 and made activation of softforks decisive and unambiguous. Additionally, it enables deploying softforks as a MASF, only upgrading them to UASF on an as-needed basis. Shaolinfry brought up criticisms of BIP9's blocktime based thresholds and suggested amending BIP8 to be height based if there is sufficient interest. Luke Dashjr has already opened a PR to fix issues with BIP9 and it just needs approval to merge.</summary>
