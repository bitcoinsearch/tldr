    <summary>Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, and Ignotus Peverell, a developer on MimbleWimble, had an email conversation where they discussed proofs of position. Cohen shared his thoughts on the subject and also provided a link to his talk about it. Peverell appreciated the link and mentioned that while working on a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR), they arrived at similar conclusions regarding the hash function. He added that MMRs are append-only and make pruning easy, which is suitable for MimbleWimble. Although interested in proof of positions, Peverell said he would look into it when they're less busy implementing other things. Bryan Bishop, another developer on MimbleWimble, joined the conversation and shared a link to some recent comments made by Bram about Blake, the hash function being considered for MimbleWimble.</summary>
