    <title>A Segwit2x BIP</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Timón expressed his opinion that any hardfork should wait at least a year after the release of tested code by some implementation. Tom Zander responded, stating that code to support the 2x hard fork proposal has been out and tested for much longer than a year. However, he clarified that it is different code on top of SegWit and that the first attempt in btc1 did not even increase the size. He also noted that the current code has not been properly tested as of yet. Zander mentioned that one year from tested release should be the standard for hard forks, but since Segwitx2 has not been released, it may be too late to discuss a bip. Furthermore, the bip may end up being different from what has been released due to feedback, unless it is ignored again.</summary>
