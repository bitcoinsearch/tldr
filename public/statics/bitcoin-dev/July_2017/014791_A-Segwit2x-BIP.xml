    <summary>Block 475776 and block 477792 are the last two difficulty adjustment periods before August 1st. Sergio Demian Lerner updated BIP with changes including technical spec improvement, increased maximum block sigops after HF documentation, and comments added about worst case block size. He urged everyone to start signaling something before block 475776 which is just 90 blocks away. Charlie asked Andrew Chow what's special about block 475776 on July 13th, 2017. Jorge Timón said that he thinks anything less than 1 year after release of tested code by some implementation would be irresponsible for any hardfork, even a very simple one. Tom Zander stated that the code to support 2x (the hard fork part of the proposal) has been out and tested for much longer than that, but Jorge Timón disagreed.</summary>
