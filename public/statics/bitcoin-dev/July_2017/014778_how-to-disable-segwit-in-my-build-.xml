    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell responded to someone questioning why they would want to opt out of SegWit compliance. The original poster suggested that avoiding the extra bandwidth required for SegWit transactions might be a good reason to not use it. They also noted that running a 0.14.2 node means being okay with larger than 1MB blocks in case SegWit is activated and widely used. This could lead users who are not interested in SegWit transactions to prefer keeping the cost of their node lower.</summary>
