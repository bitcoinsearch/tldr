    <summary>Paul Sztorc and Gregory Maxwell had an email conversation regarding the roadmap for Bitcoin. Sztorc stated that the roadmap was helpful in communication, while Maxwell disagreed with the approach of a roadmap. Maxwell regretted writing the first email about the roadmap and acknowledged that it was a concept NACK from him. Sztorc asked Maxwell why he allowed so many people to sign the roadmap if he regretted writing it. Maxwell mentioned that there are unresolved objections to drivechain's security model but declined to share those objections with the list. Sztorc responded by saying that transparency is essential to avoid any appearance of misconduct. They also discussed the lack of reliable communication in the Bitcoin industry and how a roadmap differs from general communications.Sztorc mentioned that he had spoken to several people, including Adam Back, when creating the roadmap, while Maxwell felt that Sztorc had done no research. Maxwell believed that Blockstream was trying to influence the direction of Bitcoin by laundering proposals through an unaffiliated third party. Maxwell also checked with other top contributors and found out that Sztorc only spoke with Luke-Jr. before creating the roadmap.</summary>
