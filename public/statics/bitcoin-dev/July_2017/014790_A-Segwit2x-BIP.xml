    <summary>On July 13, 2017, Sergio Demian Lerner updated the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), specifying that the block size increase would be in terms of weight and not in bytes. Additionally, the maximum block sigops after a hard fork was documented and comments were added about the worst-case block size. Lerner urged others to start signaling something before block 475776, which was only 90 blocks away at the time. In response to Lerner's update, Tom Zander via bitcoin-dev stated that code to support 2x had been out and tested for much longer than a year. However, Jorge Timón via bitcoin-dev disagreed with this claim, stating that different code on top of segwit had been attempted and that the current code had not been properly tested. Timón argued that anything less than one year after the release of tested code by an implementation would be irresponsible for a hard fork, even a simple one.</summary>
