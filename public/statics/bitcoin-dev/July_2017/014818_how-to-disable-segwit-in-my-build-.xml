    <summary>A discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around the issue of disabling segwit activation in Bitcoin Core releases prior to 0.13.1. Dan Libby requested a way to avoid segwit activation until he personally feels comfortable with it, but Gregory Maxwell argued that it is not simple to do so correctly and is also an unsupported configuration. Maxwell's attitude was criticized by a respondent who believed that such an attitude will cause Bitcoin Core to be dropped, and multiple competing implementations will emerge instead. Libby argued that one of the adverse impacts of segwit is that less than one third of the consensus-critical code is visible on-screen, which makes maintenance and readability difficult. Libby suggested that users should have the ability to firewall off the code, perhaps even with #ifdefs, to provide better confidence that they are not running segwit.</summary>
