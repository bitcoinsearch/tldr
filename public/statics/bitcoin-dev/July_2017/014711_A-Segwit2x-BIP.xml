    <summary>In an email sent by Matt Corallo via bitcoin-dev, he clarifies that adding a new limit is a soft fork and not a hard fork. He also points out that the btc1 branch code did not previously increase block size, but it was adjusted at the last minute to do so. However, there are no tests implemented for this change, so it may or may not work. Additionally, the specification text appears to refer to the prior change that did not increase block size.</summary>
