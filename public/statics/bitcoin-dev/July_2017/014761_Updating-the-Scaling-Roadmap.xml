    <summary>The discussion of the usage of anyone-can-spend outputs has come up in the context of Drivechain. While such outputs are currently utilized by less than 0.1% of users, they are actively encouraged by design in Drivechain. This contrasts with the majority of software which does not allow for the possibility of anyone-can-spend outputs. The BIP16 protocol is widely used and it would be difficult to find a wallet that does not support it.</summary>
