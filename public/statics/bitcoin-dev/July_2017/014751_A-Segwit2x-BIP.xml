    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim√≥n expressed his opinion that any hard fork should not occur less than a year after the release of tested code by some implementation. However, Tom Zander responded with good news that the code to support 2x, which is the hard fork part of the proposal, has been out and tested for much longer than one year. Tom Zander provides links to his blog and vlog for more information.</summary>
