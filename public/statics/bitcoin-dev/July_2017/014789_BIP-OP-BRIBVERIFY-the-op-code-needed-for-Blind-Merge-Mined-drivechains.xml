    <summary>Chris Stewart, a Bitcoin developer, asked for clarification on the purpose of 'Ratchet' in BMM. Paul, another developer replied by explaining how new coins are held for 100 blocks in Bitcoin and how BMM is concerned about this. BMM wants to validate the mainchain as little as possible about each sidechain while ensuring that the validation is accurate. To achieve this, they created a new rule that requires h* to be accompanied by the modulus of its sidechain block number (BlockMod), which must be accurate in order for the sidechain block to meet the "synthetic" difficulty requirement. The mainchain also has a new rule that forces each new BlockMod to be in range [-X000,+1] relative to the old BlockMod, which means no skipping ahead but allowing reorg by starting a new chain from up to a=-X000 blocks ago. BMM also has a new rule that bribe isn't paid unless the sidechain block in question has been buried by [for example] 100 sidechain blocks. This prevents a situation where someone can be bribed to find a side:block only for it to be orphaned moments later, leaving the person with the bribe while the other party loses their earnings.</summary>
