    <summary>Greg Slepak, a Bitcoin security expert, has criticized the adoption of Drivechain and referred to it as an "unmistakeable weakening" of Bitcoin's security guarantees. He argues that opt-in systems are not a good idea for secure systems, likening it to giving a child a loaded gun. Drivechains is effectively a request to modify the Bitcoin protocol to make it easy for users to give their Bitcoins to miners, thereby compromising Bitcoin's security. Chris Stewart, on the other hand, argues that most users will not have to go through the drivechain withdrawal process and that better options are being worked on, but they take time.</summary>
