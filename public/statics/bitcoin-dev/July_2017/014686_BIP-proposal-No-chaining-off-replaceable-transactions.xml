    <summary>Rhavar has proposed a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to prevent the chaining off of replaceable transactions. The proposal aims to simplify feebump logic and make fee bumps more predictable. However, some have criticized the proposal for being paternalistic and contrary to miner income. In response, Rhavar argues that the proposal is no more paternalistic than non-BIP125 transactions and that miners who use the policy would make more money than those who don't. Additionally, he believes that the proposal would result in a more stable fee market and create little to no disadvantages. Ultimately, Rhavar asks if anyone can think of a legitimate use case for spending unconfirmed BIP125 transactions.</summary>
