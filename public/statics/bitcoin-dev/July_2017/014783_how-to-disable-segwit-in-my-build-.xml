    <summary>In a message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dan Libby asked how to disable enforcement of segwit rules. Anthony Towns responded by pointing out that Libby could not control the collective action of the bitcoin ecosystem to start enforcing the rules after a sufficient number of miners signal support. Towns also explained that Libby could choose not to enforce the additional consensus rules associated with segwit if he runs a node. However, if Libby does disable segwit enforcement, he risks accepting blocks that nobody else in the network will accept, potentially opening him up to higher risk of double spends. To avoid this, he would also need to stop setting the NODE_WITNESS p2p bit.</summary>
