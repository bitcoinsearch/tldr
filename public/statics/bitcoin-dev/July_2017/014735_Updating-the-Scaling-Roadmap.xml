    <summary>A person has noticed that an email sent by Gregory Maxwell was actually written in 2016 and he didn't mention it until the very end. Maxwell's email contained information on Bitcoin, including a section on roadmaps, which had been sent to him and others by Adam Back in 2016. The email has caused confusion and prompted a response from Paul Sztorc, who asked for clarification. Maxwell replied stating that while some of the email content was old, other parts were new. He also committed to a list of email recipients for future reference.</summary>
