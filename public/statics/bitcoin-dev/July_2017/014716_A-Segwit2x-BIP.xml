    <title>A Segwit2x BIP</title>

    <summary>The author expresses strong opposition to a draft proposal for a Bitcoin hard fork that seeks reviews just weeks before deployment. The author cites concerns about technical, ethical, and process-related issues with the proposal, including the lack of consensus from the entire ecosystem, which could cause confusion, harm, and fund loss. The author also criticizes the proposal's rushed timeline, which may discourage alternative implementations and centralize the ecosystem even further. Moreover, the author notes that the linked code does not uniquely identify itself on the network by user-agent, which all distinct implementations have done to date. Additionally, the draft BIP text lacks sufficient detail to implement from the text, unlike BIP141, which resulted in more confidence and testing of the specification. The author concludes that the proposal is an offense to all Bitcoin has achieved, and they cannot support it in its current form and timeline. The author also suggests that coercion has been used behind closed doors to gain more support, which includes approaching company investors to twist arms and veiled threats of blacklisting companies from further funding/collaboration. Finally, the author believes that the best outcome for this hard fork proposal is for it to be quietly ignored.</summary>
