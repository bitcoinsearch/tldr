    <summary>In July 2017, Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev wrote about the security model of sidechains and drivechains being distinct from that of Bitcoin's. He suggested that instead of positioning them as a major solution for the Bitcoin project, people should be allowed to experiment with these technologies at their own risk. Tom Zander agreed with this sentiment and proposed that smaller groups publish their individual roadmaps to show what they are working on in a place that people can easily access, such as a website. This would help with communication and understanding about who to support financially or otherwise.</summary>
