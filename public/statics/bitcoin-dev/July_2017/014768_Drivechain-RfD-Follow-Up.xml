    <summary>The conversation discusses the Drivechain specification and the different types of users it involves. There are four modes of use: [DC#0] for those who do not upgrade their Bitcoin software but experience the effects of new rules which miners add, [DC#1] for those who always upgrade to the latest version of the Bitcoin software with no interest in running or using sidechains, [DC#2] for those who upgrade to the latest Bitcoin version and also become full nodes of one or more sidechains but never actually use them, and [DC#3] for those who actively move money to and from sidechains after upgrading their software and running full nodes. The discussion then turns to point 4 in the Drivechain specification, which states that everyone waits for a period of time to ensure the same WT^ is in both the Bitcoin coinbase and the sidechain header. The waiting period can be several weeks, and the total ACK counting period can be several months. There is disagreement about whether the use of anyone-can-pay in Drivechain is the same as P2SH or SegWit. It is noted that P2SH transactions contain all the necessary information for full nodes to act as a check on miners mishandling the anyone-can-spend nature of P2SH transactions. The same is true for WT^ transactions for all types of users. In P2SH transactions, there is no need for people to contact each other to figure out what's going on, whereas it may be necessary for [DC#2] and [DC#3]. The security of WT^ transactions is discussed, with doubts expressed about whether it can be brought up to the same level as P2SH and SegWit transactions.</summary>
