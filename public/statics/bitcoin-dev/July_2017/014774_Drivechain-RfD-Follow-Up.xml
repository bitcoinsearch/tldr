    <summary>Drivechain is a concept that can be confusing for different people. It can be broken down into four modes. The first mode is someone who does not upgrade their Bitcoin software and experiences the effects of the new rules which miners add. The second mode is someone who always upgrades to the latest version of the Bitcoin software but has no interest in running or using sidechains. The third mode is someone who upgrades to the latest Bitcoin version, decides to become a full node of one or more sidechains but never uses them. Finally, the fourth mode is someone who upgrades their software, runs sidechain full nodes, and actively moves money to and from these. Greg is conflating modes DC#1 and DC#3 by using the word "steal" to mean two different things: spending an invalid transaction and a withdrawal that would not match the report given by a sidechain node. The two are quite different from each other. The document containing information about Drivechain is nearly two years old, and although it is still accurate, new optimizations allow pushing the waiting period to several weeks and the total ACK counting period up to several months. DC transactions follow the same rules as P2SH transactions. In Drivechain, all upgraded nodes will reject invalid DC transactions, period. However, users can choose to place some of their BTC at the relative mercy of the miners in creative ways, if they wish.In DC, miners cannot steal funds because all full nodes have a fully automatic enforcement policy. The [DC#2] and [DC#3] nodes would do exactly what the [DC#0] and [DC#1] nodes do when faced with an invalid WT^ transaction. There is no need to contact each other or figure out what is going on in Drivechain for [DC#0] or [DC#1]. [DC#2] and [DC#3] would have an interest in understanding what is going on, but that has nothing to do with Bitcoin Core.</summary>
