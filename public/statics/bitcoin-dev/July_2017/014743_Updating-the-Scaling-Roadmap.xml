    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev forum, Paul Sztorc wrote about his confusion in people calling the 2015 email a roadmap, and how it was causing harm due to timeline commitments to features. He also mentioned that giving guarantees would increase misunderstanding around how Bitcoin development works. However, he did agree that communicating about research directions and projects is useful and valuable. In response to criticism, he clarified that he did speak to several people and suggested that no one is qualified even to write a first draft of a summary of present day activities. Bryan, in his response, pointed out that criticism is often misinterpreted as hostile in Bitcoin's review environment.</summary>
