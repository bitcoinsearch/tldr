    <summary>Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin expert, expressed his opinion that the security model of drivechains and sidechains is not compatible with Bitcoin's. He suggested supporting experimentation with alternative technologies, but not promoting them as major solutions for Bitcoin. Paul, who had shared a document which included these alternative solutions, asked if Gregory's only objection was this incompatibility, to which Gregory responded affirmatively. However, he also criticized Paul's roadmap as being overly ambitious and not accounting for software delays. Paul explained that the roadmap was intended to provide clarity for outsiders about what is being worked on and when it might be ready. Gregory also questioned the sourcing of some phrases in the document and the lack of transparency around Adam Back's involvement. Ultimately, they agreed to remove the drivechain section from the document.</summary>
