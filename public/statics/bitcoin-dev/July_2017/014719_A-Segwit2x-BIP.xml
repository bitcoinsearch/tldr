    <summary>On July 10th, 2017, Sergio Demian Lerner via bitcoin-dev discussed the timeline and UASF BIP 148 ultimatum. The post stated that more than 80% of miners and users are willing to go in the SegWit2x direction. However, the author questioned the accuracy of this claim. There is no logical reason for miners to consider SegWit bad for Bitcoin but SegWitx2 harmless, and there is no evidence of 80% hashrate support for bip141. The author also noted that anything less than one year after a release of tested code by some implementation would be irresponsible for any hardfork. The author went on to express their disappointment at the idea of splitting the network into two coins due to lack of patience for deploying non-urgent consensus changes or disagreements about the right time schedule. While they want a united Bitcoin, they acknowledge that a split of Bitcoin may not be so bad and that each side could have its own vision.</summary>
