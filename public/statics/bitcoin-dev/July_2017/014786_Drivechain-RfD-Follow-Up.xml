    <summary>In a discussion about the security of softforks and drivechains, Hampus Sjöberg argues that 100% of all nodes and miners need to upgrade to new rules for softforks, while for drivechains only interested nodes validate the other chain. Paul Sztorc agrees with this but points out in drivechains even if some % of the network is validating both chains, there will be no chain split if miners improperly withdraw from a sidechain. Instead, the sidechain just dies a painful death. However, he also expresses his concern that people might turn sidechain theft into some kind of grand UASF-style campaign. In such ambiguous cases, we must rely on the miner's desire to maximize the purchasing power of each Bitcoin, and the technical wisdom of Bitcoin's future leaders in helping miners achieve this goal. Even though Hampus Sjöberg thinks that 100% of all nodes should have a full node for drivechains to be fully secure, Paul disagrees and tries to avoid it by designing a system with "half security." He further explains how sidechains/drivechains are not a scaling solution, but they could help free up more space on the core chain when some people leave and go to another chain.</summary>
