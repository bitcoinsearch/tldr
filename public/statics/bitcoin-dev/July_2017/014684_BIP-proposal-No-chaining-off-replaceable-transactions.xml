    <summary>The email conversation discusses the problems faced by low-fee transactions. In the case of paying multiple entities with a low-fee transaction and later wanting to replace it with a higher fee transaction, the cost of invalidating all the descendant transactions, which may have been out of the user's control, needs to be paid along with the replay cost. This can result in throwing away a significant amount of money. The proposal suggests a solution wherein users can dynamically increase their fees when dealing with withdrawals, especially batched ones, to avoid such problems and promote a stable fee market. The idea is to remove the chaining off of replaceable transactions, making the proposal practical for adoption.</summary>
