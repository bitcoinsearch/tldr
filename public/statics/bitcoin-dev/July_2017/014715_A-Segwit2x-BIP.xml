    <summary>The proposed hard fork of the Bitcoin network is being deployed with "emergency" speed, which could result in two chains without replay protection. The BIP91 portion of the fork appears acceptable, but there are timing issues. The BIP should be modified to provide evidence and justification for the timeline that is consistent with the level of risk the network would bear if enacted. The coercion used to drive production of this BIP is mired in a misinterpretation of BIP9 and sets a precedent for Bitcoin that may undermine the value prospect of all cryptocurrency in general. If one wants to code up a fork for the Bitcoin network, it is recommended to start with Luke's hard fork code and change the rates of growth as needed for your desired effect. Plans are already underway for a hard fork, for reasons that have nothing to do with block size, but could include a timeline for a block size growth consistent with global average residential bandwidth growth.</summary>
