    <summary>A discussion between two individuals named Rhavar and an anonymous person took place on July 2, 2017. The conversation revolved around the replacement of a transaction that has not yet been confirmed. Rhavar stated that in practice, some receivers do big sweeps and include unconfirmed inputs. He also mentioned that replacing the transaction incurs the cost of the sweep, which can be hundreds of dollars. The anonymous person responded by saying that they did not understand what Rhavar was saying. They added that if the receiver is paying a higher feerate than the replacement, then the receiver will get it confirmed as fast or faster than the replacement.</summary>
