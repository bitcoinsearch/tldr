    <summary>On July 4, 2017, shaolinfry via bitcoin-dev discussed the criticisms of BIP9's blocktime based thresholds, which some people find confusing and vulnerable to miners fiddling with timestamps. On the other hand, height-based thresholds are hard to predict in advance due to difficulty fluctuations but are certain at a given block height and easy to monitor. A combination of the two could be used for activation by having a timestamp plus a certain number of blocks (around 100) to ensure that all timestamp games have passed while not adding too much uncertainty to wall clock time.</summary>
