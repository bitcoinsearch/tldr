    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of NÂ² hashing problem and suggests several soft-forking solutions to it. The proposed maximum transaction size limit is not considered an ideal solution but still a good start. It also mentions that no one has exploited this vulnerability in four years, yet it's always cited in every block size discussion. The worst case for witness-serialized block occupying 8MB is mentioned and the guilt is put on the Segwit discount factor. The proposed solution is to remove the discount factor altogether and add a fixed (40 bytes) discount for each input with respect to outputs. Lastly, it is discussed that the signal "segsignal" needs to be redefined in the modified BIP91 proposal.</summary>
