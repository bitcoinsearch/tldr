    <summary>The author advocates for the creation of an updated roadmap, which he likens to a coordinator for planning a weekly movie outing. He suggests that core veterans compile an informed view of what looks likely to gain rough consensus and in what order. Although some may dispute priorities, the author believes that without coordination efforts, weekends can pass without progress. While specific deadlines may create more issues than they solve, clarifying priorities can still be useful. The author also expresses criticisms of the "movies chosen" so far and the criteria used to choose them. He supports an interpretation of "consensus" that takes note of non-dev constituents. Despite this, the author acknowledges that the consensus marshaling effort is still important and appreciated. Finally, the post concludes with a request to avoid going off-topic and stay focused on the idea of a new roadmap.</summary>
