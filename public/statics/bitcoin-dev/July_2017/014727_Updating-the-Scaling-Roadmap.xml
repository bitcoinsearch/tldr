    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Paul Sztorc explained that he wrote the project's roadmap to represent the Core/developer position. However, one developer responded that he only spoke with Luke-Jr and should have spoken to more developers next time. Although Sztorc is philosophically against hard forks, he left them in the roadmap because they were included in the previous version. He later clarified that the project is not completely against hard forks, but it strongly opposes the ultra-hasty and contentious changes being suggested on shorter timeframes. Regular developers are not opposed to hard forks if they change capacity well while improvements in technology and protocol improvements make it less of a trade-off. The opinions on hard forks are complicated, and the current smoke around poorly executed proposals clouds clear thinking.</summary>
