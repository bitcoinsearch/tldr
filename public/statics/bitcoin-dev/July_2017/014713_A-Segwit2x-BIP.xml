    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a developer involved in the Bitcoin community, stated that larger block sizes are unlikely to have a significant impact on fee pressure. He believes that any expectations that suggest otherwise are misguided and should not be the basis for changing Bitcoin. However, another individual disagrees with him, stating that larger block sizes will have an impact on fees in the short term, as evidenced by a drop in rates when demand falls below supply. While they agree with Luke in regards to the longer term, they believe the immediate effect will be noticeable.</summary>
