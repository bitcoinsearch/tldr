    <summary>In an email sent on 7/11/2017, Tao Effect expressed their concerns about the issues with Drivechain that they believe have not been properly addressed by Paul. Paul responded to the email at length and advised Tao Effect to read his response before replying with any outstanding objections. Tao Effect had stated that adopting Drivechain would be an irreversible course of action, which Paul disagreed with, stating that it could easily be reversed with a second soft fork. Additionally, Paul warned against the conversation going off-topic if it became exclusively focused on Drivechain review. The email response from Paul can be found in the provided link.</summary>
