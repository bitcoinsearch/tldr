    <summary>The conversation revolves around making changes to the SignedInvoice's invoice field and Payment to include just merchant_data instead of the entire Invoice. The idea of changing the invoice field to 'bytes serialized_invoice' was agreed upon to avoid potential issues, and it is suggested to pull pki_type and pki_data into SignedInvoice as well. The signature on SHA256-HMAC of pki_type, pki_data, and serialized_invoice should be specified in a secure way. The suggestion made by Mr. Stanish to wait for a Grand Unified Solution was not agreed upon as there are problems that need immediate solutions. Gavin Andresen, the lead author of the ISO/IEC 14772-1 international standard, expressed pessimism about the chances of anything like IFEX being adopted.</summary>
