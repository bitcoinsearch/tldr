    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) spec has been updated, with notable changes including the removal of SignedReceipt and the replacement of Invoice.x509chain with a "pki_type" and "pki_data" to make using other identity systems cleaner. In addition, a new section titled "Why not an existing electronic invoice standard?" has been added to the design notes. The changes are detailed in full in the updated spec on GitHub.</summary>
