    <summary>In an email conversation between Walter Stanish and an undisclosed recipient on November 26, 2012, Stanish inquired about the status of a particular draft standard. Specifically, he was asking about the X-ISO4217-A3 draft, which he noticed was not classified as standards track. Stanish wanted to know if there was a reason for this classification. He also noted that the draft did not seem to address any of the targeted items in the discussion. As such, he asked if there was another draft he should be looking for that had more overlap with the ongoing discussion. Unfortunately, the recipient's response to Stanish's questions is not included in the context provided.</summary>
