    <summary>In an email exchange, Gavin Andresen expresses his belief that "receipt" is the appropriate term to use in regards to payment confirmation. He argues that "receipt" simply means that one has received payment, not that the payment has cleared. To illustrate his point, he gives the example of a paper check being handed over and a receipt being issued, even though the check could still bounce. Andresen believes that if a transaction were to be rejected by the network for any reason, it would not be valid to claim payment based solely on an invoice or receipt.</summary>
