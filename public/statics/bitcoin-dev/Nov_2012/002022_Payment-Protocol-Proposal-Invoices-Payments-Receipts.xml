    <summary>The discussion revolves around the complexity and edge cases of having the merchant broadcast the transaction. An alternative proposal is suggested, where the buyer's client prepares the transaction and sends a ValidatePurchase message to the merchant containing proposed outputs and a copy of merchant data along with the transaction ID. If the payment is accepted as valid by the merchant, the pre-prepared transaction is broadcasted in the normal way by the buyer's client. The merchant is responsible for watching for this transaction over the p2p network or blockchain to complete the purchase. There is no need for a send-to-self to cancel it if the merchant rejects the purchase at the ValidatePurchase stage. An optional RequestReceipt message can be sent by the client after the transaction has been broadcast, but it is explicitly optional to rely on seeing the bitcoin transaction to 'commit' the payment and not on the RequestReceipt message. This proposal seems to have no more edge cases than the standard bitcoin protocol.</summary>
