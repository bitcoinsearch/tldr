    <summary>The "SignedReceipt" message in the Bitcoin payment system is not necessary as it only confirms what has already been proven through a signed invoice and accepted Bitcoin transactions. It may be better named "Acceptance" instead. Additionally, x509 inclusion is not required as the payment key can be used and the proof would still be valid for non-holders of x509 certificates. The intended use of x509 certificates is also being bent as host certificates typically do not have S/MIME Signing in their "purpose".</summary>
