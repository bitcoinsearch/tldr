    <summary>The conversation between Mike Hearn and Dr. Andy Parkins discusses the use of protocol buffers in creating invoices with right security bits. While protocol buffers can be easily extended, it is suggested that other schemes can also be proposed as extensions in the future. The conversation then moves on to discussing two additional identification types which include GnuPG and SSL/X.509. It is mentioned that GnuPG is used by every user for localised identity verification. A small group of companies can do the same thing as well. Invoices can be made secure by putting a hash of an invoice inside the invoice. This would ensure that the target of the payment is who the payer thinks it is.</summary>
