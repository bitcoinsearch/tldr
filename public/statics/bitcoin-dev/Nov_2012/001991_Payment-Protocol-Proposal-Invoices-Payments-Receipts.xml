    <summary>The establishment of an IETF working group has been sidelined due to bureaucratic issues, and a top-level IANA registry group is being established instead. This move is not expected to be controversial or blockable. However, there are no existing IANA registry groups, and forming one would require extensive support and time, as well as adherence to standards track RFC. ICANN runs the IANA, and the framework mentioned does not exist. Those applying for a gTLD are advised to proceed with caution.</summary>
