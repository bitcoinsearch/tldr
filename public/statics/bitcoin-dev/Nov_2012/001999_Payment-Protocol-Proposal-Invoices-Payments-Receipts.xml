    <summary>The use of x509 in invoice specification is not really necessary as the payment key can be used for signing invoices. However, the purpose of using X509 certificates is to obtain a verified identity, specifically a domain name, on the receipt. This verification is essential for multi-factor authentication as it requires a third party to assert an identity. Without this verification, multi-factor authentication cannot be implemented.</summary>
