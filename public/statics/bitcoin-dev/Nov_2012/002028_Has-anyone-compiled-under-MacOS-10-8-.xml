    <summary>It seems that there was an issue with the version of the Qt SDK used on MacOS. The user discovered that reinstalling Qt resolved the problem. In a related email, Mike Hearn noted that there may be compatibility issues between Boost and the default build instructions, possibly due to a switch to clang++. He requested assistance in finding a solution, suggesting that someone share a recipe to fix the issue.</summary>
