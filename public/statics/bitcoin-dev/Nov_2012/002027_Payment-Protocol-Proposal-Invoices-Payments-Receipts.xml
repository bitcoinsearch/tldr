    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, Mike Hearn explains the rationale for having the merchant broadcast a transaction. This includes reducing the risk of double-spending and providing transparency to the network. Another participant suggests an optional "ValidatePurchase" message that would allow a buyer to ask a merchant if they would accept a payment without actually supplying a signed transaction. This would reduce the need to trust the merchant not to spend a rejected transaction, and could be useful in cases where the client doesn't have the ability to broadcast a pay-to-self transaction.</summary>
