    <summary>In this email, Gavin Andresen responds to various comments and suggestions related to the Bitcoin specification. He agrees to remove a controversial element from the spec and defends another element that comes from the IETF's JSON Object Signing and Encryption working group. He expresses interest in adopting useful ideas from previous electronic invoicing standards but also acknowledges the need for security. He raises concerns about allowing txids in payments and suggests that using self-signed certificates could be an option with proper management of root certificates by Bitcoin clients.</summary>
