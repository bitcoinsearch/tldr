    <summary>The context discusses the support of all CAs used by popular browsers, to ensure that all SSL certificates owned by merchants are also okay for Bitcoin. The discussion also notes the inadequacy of X.509 for the web and how it limits delegation, defeating the benefits of chained certificates. For payment processors, a new cert specific to signing Bitcoin transactions should be issued, ensuring secure connections. The idea of redefining the certificate chain part of the protocol is suggested, which would allow for the introduction of new minimal certificate formats with desired features, through adding new enum types. It's important to note that old clients may encounter invoice cert types they don't recognize, leading to the suggestion of including a protocol version number when downloading invoices so that servers know when it's safe to use new invoice features.</summary>
