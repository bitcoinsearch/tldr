    <summary>Consistency is of utmost importance from a seller's perspective. To ensure that invoices appear as verified and are not subject to manipulation by viruses, it is essential to predict what CAs (Certificate Authorities) the user has. However, using the OS cert store could limit merchants to only what ships in all operating systems their users use. This could prove to be unnecessarily restrictive.It is important to note that every browser has its own cert store for this reason. Therefore, using the browser's cert store may be a better option than relying solely on the OS cert store.</summary>
