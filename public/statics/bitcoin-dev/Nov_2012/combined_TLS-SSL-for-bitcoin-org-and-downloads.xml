    <summary>The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), formerly known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is crucial for website and download security. A recent inquiry about the possibility of enforcing TLS for bitcoin.org and its downloads was made by Jay. It was revealed that the site currently supports both HTTP and HTTPS, but there are no plans to force TLS. However, it does encourage the use of HTTPS and offers a guide on how to download Bitcoin Core securely through HTTPS. Additionally, Bitcoin Core releases are signed with PGP keys to ensure authenticity.Users are advised to verify signatures before downloading any software from the internet to ensure safety. Although there are no immediate plans to force TLS for bitcoin.org and its downloads, the website prioritizes security measures such as HTTPS and PGP key verification. Users should always remain vigilant and take necessary precautions when downloading software from any source to avoid any potential risks.</summary>
