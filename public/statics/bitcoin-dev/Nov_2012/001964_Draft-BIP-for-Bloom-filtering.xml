    <summary>On October 24, 2012, Mike Hearn published a draft BIP on the bloom filtering protocol extension he developed with Matt. The purpose of this protocol is to reduce the amount of bandwidth used by Bitcoin nodes when propagating transactions to peers. The BIP can be found on the Bitcoin Wiki (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0037). In a follow-up comment, Pieter expressed some concerns about the proposed protocol. First, he suggested an alternative seed value formula that he believes would produce better results. He also voiced his uneasiness about the arbitrary filter parameters used for the implicitly created filter when sending filteradd without filterload. He argued that this could lead to server-side filters growing too large and proposed making filteradd always require an active filter. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of developing protocols that are both efficient and secure. By addressing these concerns, developers can ensure that the Bitcoin network remains reliable and user-friendly.</summary>
