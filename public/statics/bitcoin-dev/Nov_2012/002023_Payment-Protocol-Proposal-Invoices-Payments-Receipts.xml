    <summary>In this email exchange between Roy Badami and Gavin Andresen, they discuss the rationale for having the merchant broadcast a transaction during in-person payments using bluetooth/NFC on a phone. Mike Hearn had experimented with this technology and found that if the device has bitcoin-p2p-network-connectivity, then it might be cleaner for the client to broadcast the transaction. However, if the device can only connect to the merchant via a Bluetooth/NFC paymentURI, then clients have to deal with the case where the merchant also broadcasts the transaction, even if the merchant sends an "accepted : false" response. The discussion centers around whether or not having the merchant broadcast the transaction adds complexity and creates edge cases.</summary>
