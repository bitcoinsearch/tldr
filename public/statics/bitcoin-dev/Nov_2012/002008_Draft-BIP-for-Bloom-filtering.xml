    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0037, Pieter Wuille made two comments regarding the bloom filtering protocol extension developed by Mike Hearn and Matt Corallo. The first comment concerned seed values, which he explained were intended to produce large bit differences between hash function seeds. Wuille suggested that something simpler like k1*i+k2*n+tweak was better. The second comment was that the actual filter data in filterload could be made optional, with the filter being assumed to be all zeroes if it was omitted. However, Corallo pointed out that sending a filter just to use filteradd to add things to it manually was very wrong.</summary>
