    <summary>In an email exchange, Mike Hearn and Rick proposed discussing alternatives to X.509 chains while focusing on future extensions. They suggested that if someone has ideas for DNSSEC, DANE, custom PKI infrastructures, or any other alternative to X.509 chains, they should figure out how to extend the protocol in Gavin's email, rather than proposing replacements. The Invoice message is the only part associated with an x509 cert. To move the conversation forward without x.509 baggage, they suggested removing the cert and adding an opaque string called domain name or identityName.</summary>
