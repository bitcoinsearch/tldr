    <summary>In an email exchange on November 6, 2012, Luke-Jr expressed the importance of encouraging wider community participation for the success of BIP. However, slush argued that it's not about the BIP process, but rather the content of particular proposals. The discussion then shifted to the topic of stratum mining and its related protocol. Luke-Jr suggested that the mess with stratum mining is a direct result of lack of peer review and contribution toward the stratum protocol. However, slush countered that there have been peer reviews of the protocol and that stratum is not related to the Bitcoin protocol or implementation. Slush also expressed frustration with Luke-Jr's constant bashing of stratum in his posts and reminded him that he had promised to write a BIP draft for stratum and had proposed and implemented a get_transactions method for stratum jobs inspection. Slush apologized to other developers who had to read Luke-Jr's negative posts and vowed to try to refrain from responding in the future.</summary>
