    <summary>In this email, Mike Hearn responds to a previous message about the compatibility of libccoin and picocoin on Windows. He notes that while picocoin will work on Windows, it may be less secure than on other platforms due to the lack of fork. However, he suggests that Windows has good sandboxing support and that Win32 could be implemented later for the same purpose. The email includes a link to Go Parallel, a resource for staying up-to-date on parallel hardware and programming. The signature at the bottom of the email is from Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab.</summary>
