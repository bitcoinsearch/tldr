    <summary>In an email conversation between Luke-Jr and Rick Wesson, the topic of associating a certificate to a domain and payment address was discussed. Rick expressed his desire to be "knowable" as a merchant and did not mind if his identity was associated with his transactions. However, Luke-Jr stated that anonymity is not a feature nor goal of the project for the most part. Using a single Bitcoin address poses problems beyond non-anonymity such as denying customers basic privacy and no way to guarantee the user who says they paid actually did. It is considered a rule to always use a unique address per transaction or at least per customer. Rick then clarified that putting payment addresses in the DNS does not require that only a single address be used, but it is just one possible use case.</summary>
