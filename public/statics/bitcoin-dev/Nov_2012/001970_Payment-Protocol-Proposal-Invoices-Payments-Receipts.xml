    <summary>In an email conversation on November 26, 2012 at 11:02:14 PM, Mike Hearn suggested supporting all certificate authorities (CAs) used by the popular browsers. However, he expressed his preference for using user-accepted certificates at the operating system level. The discussion was likely related to ensuring secure communication between users and servers. It is important to note that CAs are trusted third parties that issue digital certificates to verify the identity of a website or server. Users rely on these certificates to establish secure connections and protect their sensitive information from being intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties. Therefore, choosing which CAs to support can have significant implications for security and privacy.Overall, the email exchange highlights the importance of carefully considering the implications of technological decisions, especially when it comes to security and privacy. By taking into account both technical considerations and user preferences, developers can design more effective and user-friendly systems.</summary>
