    <summary>In an email conversation between Walter Stanish and Rick, the former proposed a draft to include X-ISO4217-A3 in the standards track. However, Rick pointed out that the IETF and IANA do not function as proposed by Stanish, and that there is no support for a "finance" working group in the IETF. Additionally, Rick mentioned that Stanish's drafts are expired and require support from the IANA management.</summary>
