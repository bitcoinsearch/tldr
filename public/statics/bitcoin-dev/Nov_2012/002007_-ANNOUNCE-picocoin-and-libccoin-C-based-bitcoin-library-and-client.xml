    <summary>A new bitcoin implementation called "picocoin" has been announced. It includes a bitcoin library, "libccoin," which supports all key network datastructures, script parsing and validation, transaction and block validation, a headers-only or full block database, and many other features essential to any bitcoin client. Picocoin is a low resource, command line/JSON-driven bitcoin wallet with advanced security features such as required wallet encryption and fork-based process separation of P2P networking and wallet. The feature list includes support for multiple block chains, bloom filtering, and improved security. Code contributions, comments, and donations are welcome.</summary>
