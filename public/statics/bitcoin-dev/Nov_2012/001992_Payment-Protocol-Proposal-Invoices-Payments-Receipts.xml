    <summary>The Bitcoin community is establishing a top-level IANA registry group instead of an IETF working group. There are no IANA registry groups, but the IETF can request the IANA to form a registry which takes a lot of support and time, and is created through standards track RFC. ICANN runs the IANA and there is no framework for the establishment of a registry. The lack of a public list of requirements for codepoint issue in ISO4217 registry indicates the need for an open registry to support innovation and interconnectivity for all sectors of the internet's various financial communities. This will allow anyone, including innovators, to obtain interoperability via simple, hassle-free paths without encountering self-important bureaucrats. Victory is anticipated by February.</summary>
