    <summary>The discussion is centered around the use of X509 as an option for identification and security in invoice requests. The protocol buffers which are used for extending schemes are easily extensible, ignoring unknown fields. Two additional identification types have been proposed, one of which is GnuPG, but this has been met with skepticism due to the failure of the web of trust model and the widespread usage of SSL/X.509. The use of SSL/X.509 provides multi-factor authentication and protection from viruses, but small businesses that do not want to buy SSL certificates can opt for a reference number or memo field instead. However, this does not provide the same level of protection and incentive for sellers to get verified.</summary>
