    <summary>DANE leverages with DNSSEC and SelfSigned x.509 certs to associate a self-signed certificate with a domain name, which removes the critical path of whitelists and/or Root CA certificates. It can also associate a cert to a domain and a payment address if one were to put said address in the DNS. While anonymity is desired by the majority of the bitcoin user-base, as a merchant, it would be helpful to have identity known for commercial transactions, at least for the merchant. Jeff Garzik suggests that some provision for self-signed certs or equivalent thereof seems reasonable because many users want to operate outside the full root-CA chain. Payment message should include the ability to specify the transaction or a transaction id sent via normal means over the network. Feedback from other bitcoin client developers is welcomed.</summary>
