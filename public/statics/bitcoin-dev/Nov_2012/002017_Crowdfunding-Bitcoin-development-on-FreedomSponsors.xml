    <summary>The author Tony, a Brazilian software engineer, introduces himself and his free software crowdfunding platform called FreedomSponsors. The platform lets people place money bounties on issues of open source projects. Multiple people can chip in on the same offer if they have the same needs, and payments are made directly to developers after the issue has been resolved. Currently, the only supported payment option is Paypal but Tony is working on enabling the use of bitcoin as both a currency and payment option. The platform is open source on Github and Tony welcomes feedback from users.</summary>
