    <summary>In a discussion about the security of paying invoices with bitcoin, it was suggested that a hash could be reported via a secure channel outside of bitcoin's domain as a fallback option. The relevance of multi-factor authentication to invoices was questioned, but it was explained that it is important for ensuring that the person confirming the payment is actually the intended recipient and not a hacker who has compromised the original device. This involves confirming the payment on a second uncompromised device to ensure that the payment is being made to the correct recipient.</summary>
