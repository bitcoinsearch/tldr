    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, is calling for feedback from other Bitcoin client developers on a new initiative to agree on a standard way of doing things.

Additionally, Jeff Garzik, another developer, argues that some provision for self-signed certificates or equivalent thereof seems reasonable as many people may prefer to operate outside the full root-CA chain.</summary>
