    <summary>The discussion revolves around the topic of X.509 chains and alternatives to it. The speaker suggests that they should focus on other topics except for this one, but he is interested in knowing if these alternatives can be cleanly implemented with future extensions. The conversation shifts to DANE, DNSSEC, and custom PKI infrastructures. The speaker advises not to propose them as replacements, but instead, figure out how to extend the protocol in Gavin's email for a future extension. If there is no clean way to do it, then they can discuss it, but if there is a solution, they can table it for later BIPs.</summary>
