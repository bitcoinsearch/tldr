    <summary>The author of the message is unable to attend meetings on IRC and suggests using email for decision making. They also question the need for a process to allocate numbers in the BIP process and suggest removing the editing role. The author also expresses a desire for more time to work on bloom filtering before freezing features in version 0.8 of Bitcoin. They believe that promoting the release as important for scalability and performance will help encourage upgrades, with ultraprune and bloom filtering being the two major scalability improvements currently available.</summary>
