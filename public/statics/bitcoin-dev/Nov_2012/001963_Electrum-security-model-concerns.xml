    <summary>In this conversation, the speaker expresses concern about the handling of wallet state in the presence of re-orgs in a code they have reviewed. They mention that transactions are checked to appear in the blockchain, but it is not clear if the wallet will be in the right state in the case of a chain switch. The speaker also notes a message from Thomas on a thread about a bug that occurs when there is a re-org and the server provides the wrong histories. This implies to the speaker that there is no re-org handling at all. The conversation then shifts to a comparison between Electrum and MultiBit in terms of their handling of SPV work. The speaker asks how they differ beyond deterministic wallet seeding. The conversation ends with Mike expressing pleasure at hearing the previous statement.</summary>
