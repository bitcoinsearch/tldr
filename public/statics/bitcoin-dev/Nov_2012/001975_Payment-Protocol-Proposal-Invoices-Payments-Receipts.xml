    <summary>In a conversation on November 26, 2012, Gregory Maxwell discussed the state of browsers in relation to Bitcoin. He suggested that while the state of the world with browsers was not good, Bitcoin's user agents (UAs) could do better and get closer to that. The conversation then shifted to the centralization of Bitcoin and how competing clients having their own list of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) would only lead to uncertainty about whether or not a CA was on all lists. Maxwell proposed a solution in which there would be a static whitelist, an OS-provided list, a user-configured blacklist, and the option for sophisticated users to disable the whitelist. However, someone questioned how this whitelist would differ from the list of CAs included by default with every OS.</summary>
