    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin, Rick Wesson suggests that it can be associated with a domain and payment address if the address is added to the DNS. He acknowledges that while many Bitcoin users desire anonymity, as a merchant he would like to be identifiable and have his identity associated with his transactions. However, Luke points out that anonymity is not a goal of the Bitcoin project and using a single Bitcoin address can create problems such as denying customers privacy and being unable to guarantee that a user who claims to have paid actually did so. Therefore, it is recommended to use a unique address per transaction or at least per customer.</summary>
