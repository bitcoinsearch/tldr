    <summary>Bitcoin Core has announced new lower policy limits for related unconfirmed transactions that will be accepted in the mempool and relayed. This decision was made after a thorough review and has been merged into the master branch of Bitcoin Core for 0.12 release. The actual limits were merged in PR 6771 and further discussions can be found through links in the email. The new policy limits include: 25 unconfirmed ancestors, 25 unconfirmed descendants, 101kb total size with unconfirmed ancestors, and 101kb total size with unconfirmed descendants. These limits are just policy and do not affect consensus. It is important to note that these limits can be modified by command line arguments.</summary>
