    <summary>On November 24, 2015, Btc Drak via bitcoin-dev proposed that the name of BIP112 should be changed to reflect its specific use case. BIP112 introduced the opcode CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (OP_CSV) that verifies transaction inputs according to BIP68's relative lock-time. However, since BIP68 only defined a portion of the nSequence field, it left most bits undefined for future applications. Therefore, Btc Drak believes that the name OP_CSV is too broad and that the proposed change to CHECKMATURITYVERIFY would better reflect the opcode's purpose. Peter Todd responded by suggesting that a decision on the name change should not be made in haste as test programs were still being written to evaluate BIP112. He also noted that changing the name was a simple process that could be done prior to release. The email thread ended with Peter Todd's signature, which included a cryptographic hash.</summary>
