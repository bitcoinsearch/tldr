    <summary>The second Scaling Bitcoin Workshop will be held in Hong Kong on December 6th-7th, and technical proposals for improving Bitcoin performance are being accepted. The workshop is aimed at presenting potential solutions to scalability challenges while identifying key areas for further research. Researchers, developers, and miners can communicate about Bitcoin development at the event. Two types of proposals will be accepted; one where authors can give a 20-30 minute presentation and another where they can run an hour-long interactive workshop. Topics of interest include improving Bitcoin throughput, layer 2 ideas, security and privacy, incentives and fee structures, testing, simulation, and modeling, network resilience, anti-spam measures, block size proposals, mining concerns, and community coordination. Proposals should be submitted by November 9th and accepted authors will be notified by November 16th. All talks will be livestreamed and published online, including slide decks.</summary>
