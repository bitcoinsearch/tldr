    <summary>In November 2015, Eric Lombrozo submitted a BIP proposal to solve the issue of HD wallet structures. The use cases being considered involve generating signing key sequences from seeds that are easy to backup and easy to share with others to simplify multidevice synchronization, key management, account structures, etc. while also allowing for privacy by making it nontrivial to associate transactions for an account without knowing the seed/chain code. They referred to such sequences by a path to the immediate parent node in the tree and reserve the children themselves for the signing keys. Tamas Blummer asked if he could use a key for both signing and derivation of a deeper level of the hierarchy, but Eric did not provide any arguments discouraging this use.</summary>
