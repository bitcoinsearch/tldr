    <title>BIP 113: Median time-past is a HARDfork, not a softfork!</title>

    <summary>The discussion on a Bitcoin forum revolves around the comparison of locktimes for including a tx in a block. The current consensus rule is that a tx can be included in a block only if its locktime (x) is smaller than the timestamp of a block (y). However, BIP113 proposes that a tx can only be included in a block if x is smaller than the median-time-past (z). Since y &gt; z is already a consensus rule, the new rule is stricter than the old one, thus constituting a soft fork. A user named jl2012 queries whether their interpretation is correct and receives confirmation. Another user named Luke apologizes for causing confusion earlier.</summary>
