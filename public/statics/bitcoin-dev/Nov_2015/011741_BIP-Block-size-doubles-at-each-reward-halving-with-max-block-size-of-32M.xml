    <summary>In an email exchange, a user named digitsu at gmail.com asked if signaling intent to support an upgrade to one side of a hard fork could be seen as a bad thing. The idea was that it could make for a smoother transition since it would be harder to back out on the commitment after signaling intent. However, Luke, the recipient of the email, responded that signaling intent doesn't make it smoother because for a hardfork to be successful, the economy must switch entirely. The miners are unimportant in this matter.When asked who has a choice in hard forks if miners don't, Luke replied that developers have even less of a choice. Ultimately, what is relevant is the economy and who people want to spend their bitcoins with. There is no programmatic way to determine this, so the best solution is a flag day that gets called off if there isn't clear consensus.</summary>
