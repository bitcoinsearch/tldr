    <summary>The context discusses the concept of block transmission and its advantages. The author makes a quick observation that block transmission would involve compressing the data once and sending it multiple times, which makes the tradeoff better. However, the context is incomplete and does not provide any further details about what block transmission is.The context also includes a non-text attachment, which appears to be a signature in PGP format. This is likely unrelated to the discussion on block transmission and may be an additional piece of information provided by the author for identification purposes.Overall, the context provides some insights into the benefits of block transmission, but lacks sufficient detail to fully understand the topic.</summary>
