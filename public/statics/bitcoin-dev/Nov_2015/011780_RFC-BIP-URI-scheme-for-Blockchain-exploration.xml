    <summary>A proposed new URI scheme for blockchain exploration has been put forward, with the purpose of enabling users to handle all requests for details about blocks, transactions and addresses on a blockchain explorer. Currently, Bitcoin clients usually point to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when the user looks for the details of a transaction, while other times resorting to cut &amp; paste is needed. The same happens with posts and messages that reference some particular transactions or blocks, if they provide links at all. The URI follows a simple form: blockchain:The proposal states that keeping it simple should be practical enough and blockchain explorers can apply the same disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search box. From the point of view of a wallet developer (or other tool that needs to show any kind of blockchain references), using this scheme means they can simply make it a blockchain link and be done with it without having to worry about any specific blockchain explorer or provide a means for the user to select one. Blockchain explorers in turn will simply offer to handle the blockchain URI, the first time the user visits their website, or launch/install the application, or even set themselves if there isn't already one. The need for a URI for this came to mind again in the last days looking at Eternity Wall, which provides a use case that is expected to be seen more and more in the future. Using that service, when you want to check for the proof that a specific message was written in the blockchain, it lets you choose from five different explorers.</summary>
