    <title>Contradiction in BIP65 text?</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member raised concerns about the language used in BIP65 that suggests funds can be frozen. Jeff Garzik responded, clarifying that users choose to freeze their own funds and it is not an act of force. The original poster then asked if they could use BIP65 to freeze their own funds for various purposes, but the state of BIP65 made it unclear if this was possible. Both concerns were deemed valid and require further discussion.</summary>
