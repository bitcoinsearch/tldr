    <summary>The draft proposal suggests to change the maximum block size to 2MB at the next block subsidy halving and double it at each subsidy halving until reaching 32MB. The proposal aims to gradually restore the block size to the default 32 MB setting originally implemented by Satoshi while providing a long-term solution that does not make enthusiastic assumptions regarding future bandwidth and storage availability estimates. Increasing the block size at each milestone event with the goal of increasing awareness among miners and node operators is suggested. The proposed increase in maximum block size includes increasing it to 2MB, 4MB, 8MB, 16MB, and 32MB at different block numbers. However, all older clients are not compatible with this change, and the first block larger than 1M will create a network partition excluding not-upgraded network nodes and miners.</summary>
