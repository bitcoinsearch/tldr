    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter R discussed the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 consensus failures in the Bitcoin system. He clarified that the size of a block does not fall under Type 1 failure as there is a clear rule regarding the maximum block size. Any block exceeding the threshold is considered invalid. He argued that calling any violation of a known system rule a Type 1 failure would be inaccurate. Regarding Type 2 consensus failures, which are more severe but less likely, Peter mentioned the 92 million bitcoin bug from August 2010. He suggested that if Core were to accept a rogue transaction that created another 92 million bitcoins, it would be beneficial for other implementations to fork away from it. He concluded that almost all consensus failures fall under Type 2, with the exception being the BDB locks issue, which he believed may not entirely qualify as Type 1. Ultimately, Peter believed that most inconsistencies arise due to a lack of complete knowledge and understanding of the possible cases.</summary>
