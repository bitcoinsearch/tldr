    <summary>Onion-routing has been suggested as a method of improving privacy while using a payment network, where each node only knows the previous and next node in the payment route, with no knowledge of the position of the node in the route, the payer or the payee. However, the use of preimage-hash pair R-H in payments within the network makes it easy to breach privacy by reducing the number of nodes an attacker needs to control. The solution is to use private/public EC key pairs instead of RIPEMD-160 for preimage-hash construction. To make this possible, there would need to be a way to force a private key given a public key on the blockchain. By using one of the unused OP_NOP codes, deployment using a softfork would be allowed. Alternatively, it is possible to use a NIZKP to prove that a node can recover a preimage given certain information, but they are expensive to calculate.</summary>
