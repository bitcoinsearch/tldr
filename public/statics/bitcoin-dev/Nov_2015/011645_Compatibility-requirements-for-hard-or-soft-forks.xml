    <summary>On November 2, 2015, Justus Ranvier raised a question about who should decide the standards for Bitcoin usage. He believed that it is easier to justify the position that nobody has the right to change someone else's outputs rather than a small group of people deciding what is standard and what isn't. Presently, a small group of people are making decisions about how and if individuals can access their money in the Bitcoin network. Ranvier questioned how close Bitcoin developers want to sail to the shores of "administrators of a virtual currency." However, Luke-Jr clarified that it's not the developers who make this decision but rather the miners.</summary>
