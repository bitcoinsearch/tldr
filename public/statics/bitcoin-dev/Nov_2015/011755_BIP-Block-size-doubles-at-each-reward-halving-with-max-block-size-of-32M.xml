    <summary>In a conversation on November 14, 2015, Angel Leon questioned whether the money supply was part of the economy. Luke Jr., an expert in Bitcoin, replied that in the context of economic majority deciding hardforks, the money supply was not considered part of the economy. This is because the outcome of a hardfork determines the money supply. Therefore, if the former money supply does not support the change, they would no longer be involved in that capacity. However, the more relevant factor in terms of economic involvement is the acceptance of bitcoins as payment for real goods.</summary>
