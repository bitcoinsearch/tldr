    <summary>Eric and William Swanson have been working on a script template format to enable interoperability in accounts between different wallets. Although interest was initially low, recent advancements in script design such as CLTV, relative CLTV, bidirectional payment channels, and lightning have sparked renewed interest in the project. Eric has made progress on the standard and is open to comments, suggestions, and collaboration on the project. The draft can be found on GitHub. The purpose of this standard is to promote compatibility between different wallet systems. Non-generalized script formats will not support the rapidly advancing state-of-the-art in script design. Eric's work on the standard aims to address this issue. The draft for the standard is available on GitHub, where interested parties can view it and provide feedback. Eric is welcoming comments and collaboration on the project. This project is important for the advancement of script design and compatibility between different wallet systems.</summary>
