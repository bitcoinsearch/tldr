    <summary>The idea of data compression has been questioned by some engineers, who believe it should be left to the application layer rather than the transport layer or lower in order to give application designers more control over tradeoffs. In a message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on November 11, 2015, Marco Pontello raised the question of whether most communication over a data link is already compressed at some point, citing examples such as the V.42bis protocol used for modems and PPPoE for ADSL connections. He suggested that generic, data-agnostic compression may not offer real-life practical advantages, but that compression that takes advantage of specific knowledge of the data could be more useful.</summary>
