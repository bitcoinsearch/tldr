    <summary>The context provides results of Block Compression tests that were conducted to compare the performance of compressed and uncompressed blocks with added network latency. The test was carried out on two nodes running Windows 7, using compression level 6 and syncing the first 200,000 blocks from one node to another. The tests were conducted on a high-speed wireless LAN with no connections to the outside world. Netbalancer was used to induce 30ms and 60ms latencies.Results show that compressing blocks offers bandwidth savings as well as small performance savings. However, the overall value of compressing blocks is in terms of saving bandwidth. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in performance when no latency was present, indicating that the time it takes to compress is about equal to the performance savings in such a situation.The table provided in the context compares the tests in terms of how long it takes to sync the blockchain, compressed vs uncompressed and with varying latencies. The data shows the time taken to sync for both uncompressed (uncmp) and compressed (cmp) blocks, with 30ms and 60ms latencies. The results indicate that compression offers some benefits in terms of bandwidth savings, but there is no significant improvement in performance when latency is present.</summary>
