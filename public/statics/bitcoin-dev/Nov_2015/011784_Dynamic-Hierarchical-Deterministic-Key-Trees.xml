    <summary>Eric, a developer has submitted a BIP proposal to solve the issue of predefining HD wallet structures and nesting deeper levels in Bitcoin. The proposal is available on Github for public comments and feedback. This proposal aims to provide a solution to the limitations posed by the current structure of HD wallets in Bitcoin. The proposed solution would allow for arbitrary nesting of deeper levels, which would expand the capabilities of HD wallets in Bitcoin. Eric invites comments from the public on Github for further development.</summary>
