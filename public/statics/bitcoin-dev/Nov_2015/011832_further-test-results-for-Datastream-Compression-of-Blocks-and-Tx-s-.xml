    <summary>In this conversation between Jonathan Toomim and Peter Tschipper via bitcoin-dev, they discuss the meaning of compression ratio. Toomim clarifies that compression ratio is the ratio of compressed to uncompressed data, whereas Tschipper seems to be using (1 - compressed/uncompressed) to mean size reduction. Tschipper then provides a table showing the compression ratios achieved for various sizes of data using different methods, with Zlib being the most compressible and LZOx-999 coming close but at a cost. The table shows the compression percentages achieved by each method for data ranges of 0-250b and 250-500b.</summary>
