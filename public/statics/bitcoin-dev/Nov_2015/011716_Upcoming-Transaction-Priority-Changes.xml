    <summary>In a conversation with Chun Wang on November 12, 2015, Luke expressed confusion regarding a statement made by Chun. Chun had claimed that the priority space in a block is "always the best place for spam nowadays." Luke contradicted this claim, stating that spammers generally cannot use the priority space at all and that the space is actually a major way for legitimate users to have their transactions processed cheaply despite ongoing spam attempts. Luke asked Chun to explain their reasoning behind the statement.</summary>
