    <summary>The proposal of OP_CHECKWILDCARDSIGVERIFY was discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The idea is to have the wildcard signature apply to all UTXOs that are of a standard form and paid to a particular address, and be a signature of some kind of message to that effect. This would replace the programmatic nature of the requirement to spend Bitcoin with a requirement that the secret be known. However, there is no built-in assumption that the script always requires only that secret. It is suggested that the cost of re-scanning the UTXO set to find them all would justify a special extra mining fee for any transaction that used this opcode. The email also includes information about the sender's work and contact information.</summary>
