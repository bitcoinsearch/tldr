    <summary>A proposed new URI scheme for Blockchain exploration has been submitted by Marco Pontello. The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to handle all the requests for details about blocks, transactions, etc. with their preferred tool (being that a web service or a local application). Currently, a Bitcoin client usually points to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when the user looks for the details of a transaction. This new scheme will provide users with the convenience of using their preferred explorer, which can be especially handy on mobile devices where juggling with cut&amp;paste is far from ideal. Blockchain explorers in turn will simply offer to handle the blockchain: URI. The proposal is currently in draft stage on GitHub with the name 'URI scheme for Blockchain exploration'. The author has also created a pull request which can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/202.</summary>
