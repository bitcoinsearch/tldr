    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tamas Blummer noted that isolating storage from the rest of consensus code would be technically desirable. However, he also pointed out that implementations using different storage would be unlikely to be bug-for-bug compatible, which could lead to network splitting. The concern with unknown bugs is that their severity is also unknown, and a serious bug could have devastating consequences.</summary>
