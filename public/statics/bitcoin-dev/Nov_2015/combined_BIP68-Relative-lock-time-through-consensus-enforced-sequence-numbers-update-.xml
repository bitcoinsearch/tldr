    <summary>Over the past five months, developers have been working on creating a relative lock-time proposal using sequence numbers, which can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6312. The current implementation is mempool-only, and the soft-fork would be deployed at a later stage. There has been various discussion back and forth to refine the details over these months, and the BIP text has been updated accordingly. To summarize, BIP68 introduces consensus rules using some of the nSequence field, while BIP112 creates a new opcode OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (PR #6564) so relative lock-time can be verified from the Bitcoin scripting language. Ideally, it would be best to soft-fork BIP68, BIP112 (CSV), and 113 (MTP) together. BIP113 has already been deployed in 0.11.2 as mempool policy. The purpose of this email is to draw attention to the BIP68 pull-requests and to request final review at: BIP68 text - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/245 BIP68 implementation - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6312.</summary>
