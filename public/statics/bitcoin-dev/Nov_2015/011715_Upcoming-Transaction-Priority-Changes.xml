    <summary>The email exchange between Matt Corallo and Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev discusses the proposed changes for version 0.12 of Bitcoin. Matt Corallo states that high-priority relay is disabled when mempools are full, and there is an agreement to make mining code use starting priority for ease of implementation. Additionally, the default block priority size will be changed to 0. However, Luke Dashjr disagrees with changing the default value, stating it is not useful as casual mining has long been dead and pools have their own customized policies. He suggests changing the priority size to 0 instead, which is always the best place for spam nowadays. Luke also proposes merging priority, feerate, and sigoprate into one number, where 576 priorities trade for 1 satoshi per kb. He believes this would be a better solution than changing the default priority size. Finally, he argues that changing defaults should not influence miner policy.</summary>
