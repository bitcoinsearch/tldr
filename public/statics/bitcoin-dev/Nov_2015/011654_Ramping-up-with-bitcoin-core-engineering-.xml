    <summary>The Bitcoin.org Development Guide has experienced significant growth this year, offering two great introductions for those interested in contributing to the development of Bitcoin Core. The first introduction provides an overview of how a developer can contribute, while the second offers an in-depth reference to how the entire system works. Those seeking further involvement or information are encouraged to check out the Bitcoin Wiki and the #bitcoin-dev room on Freenode. A user named Panos Sakkos expressed interest in helping with the development of Bitcoin Core and asked if there was any documentation available to help him get started. He also offered to assist with test efforts if needed.</summary>
