    <summary>Luke Dashjr and an anonymous speaker discussed the issue of "signature malleability." While Luke believes that this issue is not a problem on its own, the anonymous speaker disagrees. They argue that segregated witnesses can solve signature malleability and be useful in some practical cases. The speakers also note that while they don't want to eliminate all forms of malleability, wallets should be looking at scriptPubKeys rather than transaction ID. This is separate from the issue of segregated witnesses solving signature malleability.</summary>
