    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email, Christian Decker discusses the possibility of piggybacking external scripts onto the normal messages of connected nodes. Non-upgraded nodes will read the entire message but only parse the classical transaction, dropping the external script and ignoring any new lists of signature lists included in the rest of the block. A solution is proposed by peering with other RBF nodes to ensure that you'll always be connected to at least some full-RBF peers. The system treats nodes the same as if none of your peers were advertising NODE_NETWORK.</summary>
