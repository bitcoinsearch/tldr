    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, there was a discussion about BIP65 which is a proposal to enable the freezing of funds in UTXOs directly on the blockchain. The original post questioned whether BIP65 can be used to freeze funds or not. The poster referred to the motivation section of BIP65 which explains that nLockTime field cannot prove that it is impossible to spend a transaction output until some time in the future. The poster interpreted this as meaning that nLockTime cannot be used for freezing funds. However, the motivation section also states that now funds can be frozen in UTXOs directly on the blockchain, in addition to using cold storage, hardware wallets, and P2SH multisig outputs to control funds. The discussion shows that there is some confusion over the interpretation of BIP65 and its potential uses. The original poster admits to being an end user and not having experience reading Bitcoin script. It is important to note that BIP65 is aimed at an audience with more experience. Overall, the discussion highlights the ongoing development of Bitcoin and the importance of clear communication about proposals like BIP65.</summary>
