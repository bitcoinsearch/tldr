    <summary>The Bitcoin network protocol is not completely consensus critical, but it is still important. However, there are potential issues with the decompressor that could result in a block being designed that won't decode properly for some client versions but would work for others, ultimately leading to a fork in the network. To avoid this problem, a new "cblock" message could be created that compresses only block messages and shouldn't reduce efficiency by much. If a client fails to decode a cblock, it can simply ask for the block to be re-sent as a standard "block" message, which means that this approach is purely a performance improvement. In case of any problems, the client can switch back to uncompressed mode for that block.A raw network library is unlikely to have the same decompressor issue and could provide a solution to the problem. Another option is to look into the block relay system, which gives a larger improvement than simply compressing the stream. This system reduces latency and eliminates the need to send actual blocks, providing a potential 50% compression ratio. Normally, a node receives all the transactions and then includes those transactions later in the block. One individual commented on the potential bandwidth savings of 25%, noting that it would be particularly beneficial for those running full nodes in countries like Australia where internet bandwidth is lower and data caps exist. However, it was emphasized that any trade-off decisions should be local and negotiated between peers rather than being a required feature of the network P2P.</summary>
