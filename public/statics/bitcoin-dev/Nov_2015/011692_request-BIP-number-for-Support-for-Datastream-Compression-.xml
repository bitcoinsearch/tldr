    <summary>The author has submitted a pull request (#6973) for Zlib Block Compression for block relay on Bitcoin Core. This feature was requested by @sipa and should have a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) associated with it. The goal of this feature is to compress the datastream before sending, which could potentially be done for both blocks and transactions. Initial results show an average of 20% block compression, taking 90 milliseconds for a full block on a slow laptop. The primary benefit of this feature would be less bandwidth usage, but there may also be a small performance gain during transmission, particularly in areas with higher network latency.If the BIP is accepted, the author suggests the title be "Support for Datastream Compression" rather than the more specific "Zlib Compression for block relay," as it may be used for transactions in the future.</summary>
