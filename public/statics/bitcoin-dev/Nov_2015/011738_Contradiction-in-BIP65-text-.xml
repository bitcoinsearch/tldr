    <summary>BIP65 is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that aims to freeze funds in UTXOs directly on the blockchain. However, the nLockTime field cannot be used for freezing funds as it cannot prove that it is impossible to spend a transaction output until some time in the future. The proposal suggests using cold storage, hardware wallets, and P2SH multisig outputs to control funds. The author questions whether BIP65 can be used to freeze funds or not, as they are an end user and not able to read Bitcoin script. They provide a neutral review from an outsider's perspective. The source of this information is a GitHub page containing the full text of the BIP65 proposal.</summary>
