    <summary>In an email conversation between two individuals, Peter R and Greg, the issue of using multiple database technologies was discussed. The concern was not that one node would prove a block to be valid while another node proves it to be invalid, but rather that one node might say "valid" while the other node says "I don't know." Peter R explains that sometimes errors are undetectable, while at other times they can be caught if you're vigilant enough to know that an error is even possible in that case. He cites an issue in leveldb where it would silently fail to return records before they used it, which highlights the importance of tracking consensus over bug-for-bug compatibility. According to Peter R, software must be completely free of errors that would violate this invariant.</summary>
