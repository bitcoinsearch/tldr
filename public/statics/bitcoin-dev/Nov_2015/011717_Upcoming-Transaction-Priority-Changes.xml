    <summary>The Bitcoin network is experiencing mempool bloating and GBT latency caused by the priority space. Many of the free transactions are not getting mined and cleared out of the mempool anymore. Setting minrelaytxfee=0.0001 is not enough to prevent the mempool from getting large during a spam attack; limitfreerelay=0 is also necessary to prevent GBT latency degradation. Without setting limitfreerelay=0, GBT degrades significantly for every hour bitcoind is running. However, spammers generally cannot use the priority space and it is a major way for legitimate users to get their transactions mined cheaply despite ongoing spam attempts.</summary>
