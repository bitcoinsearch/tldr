    <summary>Bitcoin developer Erik Fors has proposed a long-term solution for the maximum block size in Bitcoin. He believes that existing proposals such as BIP101, BIP102, and BIP100 have limitations that could centralize the currency or create issues. Instead, he proposes a formula for block size increase based on a large consensus of miners rather than a voting mechanism.The proposed rules indicate that the main target growth will be 2^(1/2) every second year, or a doubling of the block max size every four years. The growth rate every second year will strictly be limited by the formula 2^2 &gt; growth &gt; linear growth. Fors proposes a formula for block size increase that creates a number in the interval of 1 to 2, which can tell if the block max size every second year shall double or be the same based on the last six months of votes.Fors believes that there should always be an increase to secure a stable growth of the network, and there is also a linear formula that the growth cannot be lower than. He thinks that BIP105’s feature of placing a cost as a difficulty increase to vote is not a good option since it will make users refrain from voting to "earn" a difficulty lowering. Fors also discusses other BIP proposals, such as John Sacco's BIP proposal, and their limitations. He thinks that John's proposal is not similar to his one since there is no voting mechanism to make the increase dynamic. Also, John proposes that the size will double at each halving instead of each difficulty retarget. This could, in contrast, increase fees by making larger spaces in the blocks, decrease the fees because of that the fee required to enter the next block will be lowered. Also, it proposes a hard limit at 32 MB which, again, needs a new hard fork later.While there are some cons to Fors’ proposal, such as the possibility of a few single, large entities voting for smaller growth of blocks for an extended period of time causing mistrust in the bitcoin network, the overall aim is to provide a long-term solution that eliminates fluctuating block size and provides stability to the network. Fors thinks that if the 2^(1/2) block size limit actually works, it would not cause rounding errors in different implementations, and the next size should be calculated on that value.</summary>
