    <summary>The email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Peter R discusses the classification of consensus failures in Bitcoin. While Peter R suggests that exceeding the block size limit is a Type 1 consensus failure, Gregory states that it is not as there is a clear rule regarding the threshold. He argues that Bitcoin is governed by the code people choose to run and consensus is an emergent property represented by the longest persistent chain. The conversation also brings up the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 consensus failures, with Gregory stating that the latter is more common due to a lack of complete knowledge. Finally, Peter expresses his hope for design philosophies that support “bottom-up” governance instead of the current “top-down” model as Bitcoin evolves away from the current development monoculture.</summary>
