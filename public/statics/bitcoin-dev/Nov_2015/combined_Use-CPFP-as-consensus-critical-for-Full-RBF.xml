    <summary>The email thread discusses the safety concerns associated with Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transactions and suggests the opt-in RBF as a solution. The consensus rules cannot validate information that is not in the blockchain, which makes it difficult to differentiate between legitimate and malicious RBF transactions. The author believes that if CPFP consensus is made critical for all Full-RBF transactions, RBF would be safer to use. CPFP is needed so that merchants can bear the burden of fees, and this makes RBF much safer to use by combining the two. It is important to prevent the sender from signing off their own transactions, and the proposal is to allow Full-RBF up to the point where a recipient creates a CPFP transaction. Any transaction with full RBF that has not been signed off with a CPFP cannot go into a block, making it a consensus rule rather than a local policy. Opt-in RBF eliminates the trust required with miners, and allowing Full-RBF up to the point where a recipient creates a CPFP transaction can become a consensus rule rather than local policy thanks to the opt-in flags inside transactions. The author emphasizes that a way needs to be developed to mark which output is a change address and which is a payment. This will help differentiate between legitimate and malicious RBF transactions. If the recipient signs off on the one they know about using CPFP, there should be no problems. However, this might depend on the CPFP implementation.</summary>
