    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list conversation, there was confusion over the term "malleability" and what it specifically referred to. Some argued that it only applied to signature malleability, while others pointed out that conflicting spends of the same outputs also fell under the umbrella of malleability. Segregated Witnesses (SW) were suggested as a solution to signature malleability, but it was acknowledged that conflicting spends could still be useful in certain situations. Ultimately, it was agreed upon that malleability should be viewed in a broader sense and all kinds should be addressed in any practical solution.</summary>
