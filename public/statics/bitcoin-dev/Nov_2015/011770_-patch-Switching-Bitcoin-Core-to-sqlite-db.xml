    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer forum, a member asked what rules Bitcoin follows. Another member replied that thanks to the work of many people, some of the consensus rules are now encapsulated in the libbitcoinconsensus library. However, the first member expressed skepticism about the enforceability of certain rules, such as block size limits. The second member countered by asking what technical difference there is between different rules and questioned whether the market or the specification should decide consensus rules. The second member also challenged the assumption that users must always converge under the most-work chain, pointing out that they could consciously implement different rules leading to divergence. Finally, the second member accused the first member of introducing politics into the discussion.</summary>
