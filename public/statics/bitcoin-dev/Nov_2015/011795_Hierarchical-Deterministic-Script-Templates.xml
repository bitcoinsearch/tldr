    <summary>Eric, who had been working with William Swanson on a script template format to enable interoperability in accounts between different wallets, recently restarted work on a draft for such a standard. Interest was initially low but has picked up again due to recent developments such as CLTV, relative CLTV, bidirectional payment channels and lightning where non-generalized script formats will not support the rapidly advancing state-of-the-art in script design. Eric has made progress on the standard and is welcoming comments, suggestions, and collaboration on the project. The draft can be found on GitHub.</summary>
