    <summary>BIP68 is a specification for locktime in Bitcoin transactions, allowing them to be locked until a certain block height or time. Locks by height use a 16-bit integer while locks by time use a 25-bit integer with a granularity of one second, but this does not align with BIP113, which uses the median time-past as an endpoint and may pose problems for future upgrades. There are two cases to consider when using lock-time values: no competing transactions and competing transactions. The downside of BIP68 is that unused bits in nSequence present an awkward situation if new meanings need to be added and more than five bits are required. Peter Todd proposed changes to BIP68 on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, suggesting that users of by-height locktimes have 14 bits unused in nSequence, while by-time locktimes have only 5 bits. He recommended making by-time locks use the same number of bits as by-height locks and multiplying the by-time lock field by the block interval. Another participant in the discussion pointed out that this issue had already been addressed and resolved in a previous version of the specification. Todd was pleased to see that his conclusions matched those of previous discussions.In conclusion, BIP68 allows for locking Bitcoin transactions until a certain block height or time, but there are issues with its current specification and unused bits in nSequence. Peter Todd proposed changes to address these issues, but it was noted that they had already been addressed in a previous version of the specification.</summary>
