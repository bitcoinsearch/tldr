    <summary>In an email conversation on November 13, 2015 at 9:50:47 AM, John Sacco suggested the inclusion of block signalling in a BIP. However, Luke Dashjr, another participant in the conversation advised against it, stating that it is not useful and only serves to complicate the whole process. He also highlighted that including block signalling gives people the false impression that miners have a say in hardforks.</summary>
