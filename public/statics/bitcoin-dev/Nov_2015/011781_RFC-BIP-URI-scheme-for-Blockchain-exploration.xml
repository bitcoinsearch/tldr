    <summary>A proposal for a simple URI scheme for looking up blocks, transactions and addresses on a Blockchain explorer has been put forward in a BIP by Marco Pontello. The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to handle all the requests for details about blocks, transactions etc with their preferred tool, which could be either a web service or a local application. Currently, a Bitcoin client usually points to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when the user looks for the details of a transaction, other times resorting to cut&amp;paste is needed. Blockchain explorers can apply the same disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search box. From the point of view of a wallet developer (or other tool that needs to show any kind of Blockchain references), using this scheme means that they can simply make it a blockchain: link and be done with it, without having to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the user to select one.</summary>
