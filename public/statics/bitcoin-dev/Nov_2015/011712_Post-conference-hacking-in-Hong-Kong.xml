    <summary>After the success of the small code-sprint in Montreal, Cory invites attendees of the Hong Kong conference next month to stay an extra day or two to participate in some in-person hacking, code-review, and technical discussion. The plan is to have two rooms available for two days after the conference for general technical discussion related to Bitcoin. Attendees are encouraged to self-organize and huddle up as necessary to discuss any topic they wish, not just limited to Bitcoin Core. The event location is Video Conferencing Rooms 2 and 3, Level 3, Core C Cyberport 3, 100 Cyberport Rd, Telegraph Bay, Hong Kong. Coffee/tea/water will be provided, but food is not arranged. It's a great opportunity for nascent devs to ask veterans questions about development processes, hard-to-understand code, etc. Miners are also encouraged to come to discuss any technical hurdles or questions that may benefit from real-time technical discussion or debugging.</summary>
