    <summary>During an IRC meeting, the discussion centered around handling the old "transaction priority" in version 0.12 of Bitcoin. This feature has added a vast amount of code and developer effort, and there was a general agreement that it will either be removed or replaced with something less costly to maintain in the future.With the mempool limiting already in git master, high-priority relay is disabled when mempools are full. For version 0.12, the mining code will use starting priority for ease of implementation, the default block priority size will be set to 0, and the wallet will no longer create 0-fee transactions when mempool limiting is in effect.These changes mean that users should exercise caution when relying on priority to mine their transactions. If mempools are full, their transactions will be increasingly less likely to be relayed, and more miners may start disabling high-priority block space. Users must analyze previous blocks to determine if high-priority mining is still enabled and ensure their transactions will be relayed.</summary>
