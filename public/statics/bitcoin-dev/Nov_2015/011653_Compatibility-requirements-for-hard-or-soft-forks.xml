    <summary>On November 1, 2015, Tier Nolan discussed guidelines for Bitcoin transaction version numbers on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. According to the guidelines, transaction version numbers will be increased if possible, but transactions with unknown or large version numbers are not safe to use with locktime. Non-opt-in changes will only be made to protect the integrity of the network and reasonable notice must be given before any change is implemented. Locked transactions that can be validated without excessive load on the network will be safe to use even if they are non-standard. However, an OP_CAT script that requires terabytes of RAM to validate crosses the threshold of reasonableness. Gavin Andresen responded positively to these guidelines, but noted that there may be disagreement over what constitutes "reasonable notice."</summary>
