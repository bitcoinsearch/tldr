    <summary>In a recent email on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Peter R criticized the governance perspective that the discussion had taken. He suggested that this perspective assumed knowledge of both the code being run and the rules that the market wants. The email writer also expressed concerns about the lack of focus on Bitcoin development. Rusty, the moderator of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, then redirected the conversation to the appropriate forum, bitcoin-discuss. In addition, Rusty set the moderation bits on three contributors, including Peter R, meaning their next posts would be subject to approval before being published.</summary>
