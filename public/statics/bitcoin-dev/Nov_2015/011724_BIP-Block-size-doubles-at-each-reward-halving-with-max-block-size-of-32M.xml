    <summary>On November 13, 2015, John Sacco via bitcoin-dev proposed a draft to increase the maximum block size to 2 MB at the next block subsidy halving and double it at every subsequent halving until the limit of 32 MB is reached. The proposal was titled "Block size doubles at each reward halving with max block size of 32M" and belonged in the public domain. The motivation behind this proposal was to gradually restore the block size to its default setting of 32 MB as implemented by Satoshi, without making any assumptions regarding future bandwidth and storage availability estimates.The proposal aimed to exercise network upgrade procedures during the subsidy reward halving, a milestone event, to increase awareness among miners and node operators. The maximum block size of 32 MB would allow peak usage of approximately 100 transactions per second by the year 2031. The proposal suggested increasing the maximum block size to 2 MB when block 630,000 is reached and 75% of the last 1,000 blocks have signaled support. It further recommended increasing the maximum block size to 4 MB, 8 MB, 16 MB, and 32 MB at blocks 840,000, 1,050,000, 1,260,000, and 1,470,000, respectively.All older clients would not be compatible with this change, and the first block larger than 1 MB would create a network partition, excluding not-upgraded network nodes and miners. The proposal aimed to provide a longer-term solution that would prevent complications associated with additional hard forks. Scheduling the hard fork to occur no earlier than the subsidy halving in 2016 had the goal of simplifying the communication outreach needed to achieve consensus while also providing a buffer of time to make necessary preparations.</summary>
