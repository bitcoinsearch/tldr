    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email chain, a user expressed concern about the language used in regards to BIP65 and whether it could be used to freeze funds.

Users have the ability to choose to freeze their own funds, it is not an act of force from outside parties. This clarification has been mentioned before as it has worried some individuals.</summary>
