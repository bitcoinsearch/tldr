    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell suggested that a transaction which would never have been generated by any known software should be the minimum bar for "reasonable certainty". He added that surpassing that benchmark would involve adding redundancies such as OP_CHECKSIG and clear, widespread notification of change. If Bitcoin Core's policy includes making unspendable utxos created by software other than itself, then it should merit clear, widespread notification. Even if it is a good policy, reasons why it is so should be made abundantly clear. Alongside the email was an OpenPGP digital signature from Rusty Russell.</summary>
