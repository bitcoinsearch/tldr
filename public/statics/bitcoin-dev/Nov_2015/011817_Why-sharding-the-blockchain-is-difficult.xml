    <summary>The difficulty of sharding in a decentralized environment is discussed in a Reddit post. The poster proposes the use of fraud proofs to detect invalid parts of the blockchain, but questions guaranteeing detection and propagation of fraud. zk-SNARKS are mentioned as a possible solution, but their bleeding edge nature makes them risky. Coin history linearization is proposed instead for treechains, which can prove a single branch of the transaction DAG to linearize the coin history and prevent inflation. However, it is acknowledged that this system is more complex than Bitcoin's protocol. The incentives problem of exclusive knowledge of a block potentially being valuable and extorting coin owners for it is also addressed. Overall, the complexity of decentralization is highlighted, and the benefits and drawbacks of various solutions are discussed.</summary>
