    <summary>The debate over increasing the block size for Bitcoin has led to various proposals, but Emin Gün Sirer asks a more fundamental question: what are the grand goals that a truly perfect function would achieve? Rather than debating specific block size increase functions, Sirer suggests meta-goals such as increasing the block size while ensuring that large miners never have an advantage over small miners that they did not have in the preceding 6 months or increasing block size as much as possible subject to the constraint that 90% of the nodes on the network are no more than 1 minute behind one of the tails of the blockchain 99% of the time.To evaluate proposals, several meta-level criteria were suggested, including increasing block size while ensuring that large miners never have an advantage over small miners and increasing block size as much as possible subject to the constraint that 90% of nodes on the network are no more than one minute behind one of the tails of the blockchain 99% of the time. Additionally, the ability to run low-cost fully validating nodes, include additional data into the Bitcoin blockchain, reduce noise in the ledger, and address long-term scalability with well-defined auxiliary protocols to offer high-transaction throughputs were also proposed as important criteria.The author agrees with the idea of defining a formal set of criteria. Proposals that schedule future increases to the blocksize consensus maximum, or leave it for miners to decide, can't be evaluated without making assumptions about the future. To address this, the author suggests having simulation and benchmarking software that can analyze proposals, give resource consumption benchmark data about average and worst cases, and also give some kind of metric from "mining centralization dynamics simulations." The author believes it would be ideal to have a metric for concrete block sizes, unrelated to the deployment mechanism, proposed activation date, and other details.In response to a suggestion that no user on the network should wait more than an hour to get three confirmations on the blockchain, the author explains that this depends on block space demand, the fee paid by the user, local relay and mining policies in the network, the form of the transaction, and even the network topology. There's no consensus rule that can guarantee that all transaction from all users will be included at most three blocks after they are relayed. However, there is a fee estimator that observes the chain and can estimate the market situation to tell you the average number of blocks for a given transaction with a given feerate.The debate over the block size limit in Bitcoin's governance can be resolved by first deciding whether it should evolve from the "top down" or "bottom up." The former means that experts balance trade-offs, while the latter means that people weigh them and consensus emerges through a decentralized process. If it is decided that Bitcoin should be governed from the "bottom up," then node operators should have the freedom to express their choice regarding the size of blocks they are willing to accept while still tracking consensus. Ultimately, the block size limit debate comes down to how big of a block a node will accept and what it will do if the longest chain includes a block larger than its set limit.Defining these meta-criteria before evaluating proposals will help prevent unnecessary proliferation of block size increase proposals. Ultimately, even with meta-criteria in hand, there may be room for disagreement due to uncertainty about the future evolution of network access technologies and node placement. A new mailing list called bitcoin-discuss has been created for more free-flowing topics related to Bitcoin governance, policy, or other meta-issues.</summary>
