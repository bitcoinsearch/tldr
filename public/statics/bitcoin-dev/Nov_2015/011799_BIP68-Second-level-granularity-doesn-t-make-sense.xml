    <title>BIP68: Second-level granularity doesn't make sense</title>

    <summary>In this context, Peter Todd through Bitcoin-dev suggests that there is a downside to BIP68 as users of by-height locktimes have 14 bits unused in nSequence while by-time locktimes have just 5 bits unused. He further explains that if new meanings are added to nSequence and more than 5 bits are needed, an awkward situation may arise. Todd recommends changing BIP68 to make by-time locks have the same number of bits as by-height locks, and multiplying the by-time lock field by the block interval. However, someone replies that the specification was changed earlier so that the same number of bits were used for by-time and by-height. They also express their appreciation for Todd's independent conclusion which confirms good ideas.</summary>
