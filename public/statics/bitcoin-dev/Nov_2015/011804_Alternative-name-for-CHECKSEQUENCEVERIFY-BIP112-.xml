    <summary>In a message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list in November 2015, Peter Todd discussed the decision around what to call a proposed change to Bitcoin's protocol. He suggested that the change could be named "op_maturity" instead of the previously suggested "csv". Although he acknowledged that there was no rush to make a decision, he warned that the longer they waited, the more documentation would accumulate assuming that the name was csv, which would then need to be updated if they decided to change it later on. The discussion highlights the importance of careful naming and documentation in software development projects.</summary>
