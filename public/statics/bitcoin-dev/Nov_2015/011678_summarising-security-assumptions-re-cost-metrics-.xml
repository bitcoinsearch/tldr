    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil and Adam Back discussed the importance of economically dependent full nodes (validators) in assuring Bitcoin's security model. They emphasized that validators are more important than miners in terms of decentralization and security. The weakening of validators is occurring due to non-validating wallet software, centralized wallets, and centralized Bitcoin APIs. However, another participant in the discussion disagreed and believed that blockchain APIs are good for decentralization, as there are many different APIs available for use.</summary>
