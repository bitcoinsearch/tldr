    <summary>A discussion was held on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list about the use of Sequence for opting in as it is the only "free-form" field available for the purpose. There was a suggestion to use the same scheme as sighash_single, but it poses a privacy issue as it reveals change address information. Pre-committing via a hash and revealing it later is complex and not easily feasible with the current tx data structure. On 16th November 2015, Peter Todd wrote a message on bitcoin-dev regarding the use of Sequence for opting in as Luke-Jr proposed opt-in per output, but the CTxOut data structure does not have any extra fields to use for that purpose. The message also questions the use of the same scheme as sighash_single and suggests if input 0 has nSequence.... (the rest of the sentence is not provided).Bitcoin Core developers have decided to merge the opt-in Full-RBF pull request, which will allow senders to opt into full-RBF semantics for their transactions in a way that allows receivers to detect if the sender has done so. Transactions that do not opt-in remain unchanged with the existing "first-seen" mempool semantics. This feature is expected to be included in Bitcoin Core v0.12.0 pending code review. A transaction is considered to have opted into full-RBF semantics if nSequence &lt; (2^32 - 2), indicating that the sender may reissue the transaction with a higher fee.The first version of RBF was controversial due to concerns about it being used to double-spend, but opt-in Full-RBF addresses these concerns by allowing receivers to distinguish between opt-in and non-opt-in transactions. The opt-in Full-RBF pull request was created in response to feedback from users who wanted more control over the fees they paid for transactions. With this feature, users can increase the fee on a transaction that is taking longer than expected to confirm, without having to worry about the transaction being rejected by nodes that don't support RBF. Overall, the opt-in Full-RBF feature provides users with greater flexibility and control over their transactions, while also addressing security concerns associated with the original RBF implementation.</summary>
