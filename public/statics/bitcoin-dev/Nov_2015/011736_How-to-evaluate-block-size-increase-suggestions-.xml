    <summary>The block size debate within the Bitcoin community has sparked a multitude of proposals for future block size increases, with countless alternative functions being suggested. However, instead of discussing specific block size increase functions, the author suggests enunciating what grand goals a truly perfect function would achieve. This meta-question asks what criteria we should look for when evaluating a good proposal, rather than judging individual proposals themselves. Possible meta-goals include increasing block size while ensuring large miners never have an advantage over small miners, increasing block size subject to a constraint on node synchronization, or not increasing block size until a certain date. Defining these meta-criteria before evaluating proposals will help prevent unnecessary proliferation of block size increase proposals. Ultimately, even with meta-criteria in hand, there may be room for disagreement due to uncertainty about the future evolution of network access technologies and node placement.</summary>
