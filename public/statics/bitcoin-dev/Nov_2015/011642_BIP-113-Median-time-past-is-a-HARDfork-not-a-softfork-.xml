    <summary>A proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP 113) is causing controversy as it makes any transaction with a locktime between the median time past and the block nTime valid, thereby necessitating a hardfork. Despite this, the BIP is currently being described and deployed as a softfork. Recently, Bitcoin Core merged #6566, which added BIP 113 logic to the mempool and block creation, but this may produce invalid blocks and should be reverted until an appropriate solution is determined. Rusty suggested adding N hours to the median time past for comparison, and to be a proper hardfork, this must be max()'d with the block nTime. However, if a hardfork is planned for the next year or so, it may be best to wait and deploy BIP 113 as part of that. Further thoughts and input are welcome.</summary>
