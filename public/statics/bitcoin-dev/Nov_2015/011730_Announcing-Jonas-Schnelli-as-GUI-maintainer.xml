    <summary>Bitcoin Core, the software that underpins the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has a new maintainer of its GUI (Graphical User Interface) in Jonas Schnelli. The senior software developer from Switzerland will handle GUI related issues and assist on merging GUI-related pull requests, according to a recent announcement. Schnelli has been active in this area for the last year, redesigning all the icons for 0.11.0, visualising various network statistics and continuously improving user experience. Bitcoin Core creator Wladimir Van Der Laan said he had been giving unofficial direction on GUI matters for some time; his appointment just makes it official.</summary>
