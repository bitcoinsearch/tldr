    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion on November 15, 2015, Peter R mentioned that a group had been exploring the idea of "meta-cognition" with Bitcoin Unlimited. The group was trying to address issues related to determining the validity of a block and processing its results correctly, as this could lead to problems in updating the UTXO set, which is necessary for validating subsequent blocks or transactions. Luke Dashjr agreed that such situations cannot be ignored and pointed out that the program's ability to continue after a Type 1 consensus mismatch depends on the specifics of the situation and how the code was written. However, if the program can't continue, it would halt and require manual intervention to fix but would avoid potential double-spends during the fork event, which would be preferable to causing a fork knowingly.</summary>
