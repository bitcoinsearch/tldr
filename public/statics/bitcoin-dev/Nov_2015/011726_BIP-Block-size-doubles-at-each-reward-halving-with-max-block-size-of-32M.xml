    <summary>In this context, the author is revising a specification regarding block size. The revised spec incorporates suggestions from Chun Wang and proposes increasing the maximum block size to 2MB in the shorter term, with further increases at each subsidy halving until reaching a maximum block size of 32MB, which allows peak usage of approximately 100 transactions per second by the year 2031. The proposal aims to gradually restore block size to the default 32MB setting originally implemented by Satoshi and provide a long-term solution that doesn't make enthusiastic assumptions about future bandwidth and storage availability estimates. The schedule for the hard fork is set to occur no earlier than the subsidy halving in 2016 to allow for necessary preparations. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed, as older clients are not compatible with this change.</summary>
