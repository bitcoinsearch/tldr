    <summary>The topic of discussion is whether libconsensus should rely on a particular database or not. Currently, libbitcoinconsensus is stateless and has no storage, but some people disagree with this approach. The verification of consensus rules that requires storage has not been separated out to libbitcoinconsensus yet, and changing the database at this point is considered unnecessarily risky. Even when the consensus rules are encapsulated, Bitcoin Core cannot be guaranteed to follow the longest valid chain if used with untested databases. Overall, the discussion revolves around the best approach for ensuring the reliability and security of libconsensus.</summary>
