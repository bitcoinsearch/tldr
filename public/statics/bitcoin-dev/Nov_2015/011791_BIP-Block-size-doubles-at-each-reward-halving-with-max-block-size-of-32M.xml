    <summary>In an email conversation, Jorge Timón and Shuning Hong discussed the time threshold for upgrading a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and what would happen if miners did not upgrade. The majority of miners not upgrading could cause a hardfork to timeout, indicating that either the minimum activation threshold was too short or the hardfork was actually controversial. If some still wanted to deploy it as a schism hardfork, BIP99 recommends using only a mediantime threshold without versionbits nor miner upgrade confirmation. It would be nice to have an equivalent mechanism to wait for the rest of the users, but unfortunately there's none.</summary>
