    <summary>On November 14, 2015, Jorge Timón, via bitcoin-dev, discussed the use of bip99 for hardforks in Bitcoin. The current bip99 recommends a 95% miner upgrade confirmation with version bits for uncontroversial hardforks, which is the same for softforks. However, Timón suggested that miners don't decide in the case of hardforks and it's the whole economy that has to upgrade before activation. Nonetheless, the present miner community doesn't significantly overlap with economic activity, and miners also tend to upgrade at a different rate than the economy. Timón argued that if an option is enabled by default, the BIP should specify that miners must not enable it until they perceive complete economic adoption of the change. On the other hand, Luke Dashjr suggested incorporating a miner-trigger only if the flag is enabled in nodes by an option disabled by default. By doing so, miners would have to wait until there is complete economic adoption of the change before enabling it. Therefore, this could prevent problems arising from miners upgrading at a different rate than the economy.</summary>
