    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, gladoscc pointed out that a 25% saving in bandwidth is significant for those running full nodes in countries with limited internet bandwidth and data caps, such as Australia. This led to the idea that trade-off decisions should be made locally and negotiated between peers, rather than being a required feature of the network P2P. Johnathan Corgan, from Corgan Labs, also participated in the discussion.</summary>
