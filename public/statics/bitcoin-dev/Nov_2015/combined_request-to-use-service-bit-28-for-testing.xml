    <summary>On November 14, 2015, Peter Tschipper reached out to the bitcoin-dev community to request permission to use service bit 28 for testing the block compression prototype. The author was looking for confirmation that no one objected or had already claimed the service bit. A user responded to the post with no objections and shared that service bit 26 was currently being used to indicate full-RBF support by their replace-by-fee branch. The user also suggested that the preferential peering code in their replace-by-fee branch may be useful for testing.Overall, the author's request appeared to be a polite inquiry, as they ended the message by thanking the recipients in advance. It is unclear if the author ultimately ended up using service bit 28 for their testing purposes.</summary>
