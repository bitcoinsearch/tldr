    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Tschipper and Johnathan Corgan regarding a pull request designed to save bandwidth, Tschipper notes that while there may be better ways of sending new blocks, the PR is particularly useful for historical blocks and sending transactions. Corgan suggests that trade-off decisions should be negotiated between peers rather than being required as a network P2P feature. In terms of improving the efficiency of block and transaction transfer, Tschipper suggests defining a "cblocks" message to handle multiple blocks and combining transactions together and compressing them into "ctxs." Additionally, a message holder could be defined for compressed messages, but this would likely be too complex to be worth the effort. The aim of these suggestions is to optimize compression and reduce network buffer requirements. Tschipper notes that small blocks do not compress well, therefore it is important to combine blocks so that each cblock is compressing at least 10kB of block data. The inv messages could also be modified so that groups of 10-20 transactions can be requested, depending on how much improvement compressed transactions would represent.</summary>
