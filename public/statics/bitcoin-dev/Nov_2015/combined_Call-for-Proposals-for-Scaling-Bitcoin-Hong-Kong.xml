    <summary>The second Scaling Bitcoin Workshop is scheduled to take place on December 6th-7th in Hong Kong. Technical proposals for improving Bitcoin performance are being accepted until November 9th, which include designs, experimental results, and comparisons against other proposals. The workshop is aimed at presenting potential solutions to scalability challenges while identifying key areas for further research. Researchers, developers, and miners can communicate about Bitcoin development at the event. Two types of proposals will be accepted; one where authors can give a 20-30 minute presentation and another where they can run an hour-long interactive workshop.Accepted authors will have an opportunity to present their ideas at the workshop and connect with other professionals in the field. Topics of interest include improving Bitcoin throughput, layer 2 ideas, security and privacy, incentives and fee structures, testing, simulation, and modeling, network resilience, anti-spam measures, block size proposals, mining concerns, and community coordination. Proposals may be submitted as a BIP or as a 1-2 page extended abstract describing ideas, designs, and expected experimental results. All talks will be livestreamed and published online, including slide decks.The last day for submissions has been extended by two days, with proposals due by November 11th at 23:59 UTC. This is an excellent opportunity for professionals to showcase their innovative ideas and contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin industry. The event also provides a platform for networking with other experts and discussing the latest trends and developments in the field.</summary>
