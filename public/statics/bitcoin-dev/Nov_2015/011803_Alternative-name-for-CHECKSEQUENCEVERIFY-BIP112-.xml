    <summary>During a discussion about the design of pegged sidechains, the op_maturity opcode was suggested as an op with equivalent functionality. However, the naming pattern check_x_verify was disliked by one of the participants due to its redundancy. The participant hopes that this pattern will not have to be repeated forever and suggests the name CMV for new operands that return if whatever they're checking/verifying fails. They believe that this change will make documentation and code comments clearer.</summary>
