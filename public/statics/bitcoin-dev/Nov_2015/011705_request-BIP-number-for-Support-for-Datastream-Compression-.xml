    <summary>The conversation between Peter Tschipper and Tier Nolan via Bitcoin-dev mailing list on November 10, 2015, discusses the ways of sending new and historical blocks and transactions. The PR is designed to save bandwidth and not intended to be a huge performance improvement in terms of time spent sending. Small blocks are rare these days but still get 10% compression, which is worthwhile. It is worth specifying a maximum size for network buffer reasons (either 1MB or 1 block maximum). Transactions could be combined together and compressed "ctxs". Additionally, it is suggested to define a message that is a compressed message holder. This reinforces the idea that such trade-off decisions should be local and negotiated between peers, not a required feature of the network P2P.</summary>
