    <summary>The context discusses the safety concerns associated with Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transactions and suggests the opt-in RBF as a solution. The author believes that if CPFP consensus is made critical for all Full-RBF transactions, RBF would be safer to use. However, it is difficult to differentiate between legitimate and malicious RBF transactions, and a way needs to be developed to mark which output is a change address and which is a payment. The author also mentions that opt-in RBF eliminates the trust required with miners, and allowing Full-RBF up to the point where a recipient creates a CPFP transaction can become a consensus rule rather than local policy thanks to the opt-in flags inside transactions. CPFP is needed so that merchants can bear the burden of fees, and this makes RBF much safer to use by combining the two.</summary>
