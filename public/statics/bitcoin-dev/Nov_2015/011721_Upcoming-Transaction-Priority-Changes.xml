    <summary>In a conversation between Alex Morcos and Luke, they discussed the complications of maintaining mining policy while also preserving the ability for priority-based transactions in a limited mempool world. They referred to issue #6992, which recently closed, as an example. Additionally, they discussed the potential issues with logic breaking in future changes with issue #6357 and the importance of updating things in the right order when blocks are connected or disconnected. Luke suggested using unit tests to address this concern. Lastly, they debated the usefulness of added complexity if it's not easy to place free transactions and rebroadcasting won't work if they're still in memory pools.</summary>
