    <summary>In an email thread discussing the creation of a hardfork, Rusty Russell has warned the developers that they are straying from the subject line and requested that they redirect to bitcoin-discuss. He has set the moderation bits on three contributors, so their next post will go to moderation. Meanwhile, Jorge Timón and Peter R have been debating whether consensus rules can be broken and how users would potentially react to a change in ownership. In response to Corey Haddad’s comment about the market being able to decide to stop enforcing ownership of certain coins, Timón argues that all users (including miners) have direct control over the rules that software they run validates. No majority can force you to move to the new non-ownership rules, just like no majority can force you to move to any different set of rules.</summary>
