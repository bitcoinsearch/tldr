    <summary>In this email thread, Gavin Andresen expresses disappointment over the lack of mention of the key-holder versus validator decentralization balance tradeoff at "the other end of the bathtub." Bryan asks for clarification around the definition and meaning of "key-holder decentralization," questioning whether it refers to the number of key-holders or the number of transactions made by key-holders. The email also discusses the use of Lightning Network payment channels and BTC-pegged merge-mined chains to handle excess transaction demand. The Poon file is referenced regarding concerns about "only 10 key holders," but clarification is sought on how this scenario would work. The email concludes with a request for help in understanding these issues.</summary>
