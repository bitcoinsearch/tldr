    <summary>A user named alicexbt has expressed their appreciation for the implementation of silent payments in Bitcoin Core by woltx. They have successfully tried the steps shared in the tutorial and updated the silent payment address (signet) as a TXT record for domain alice.silentbitco.in. The user has also added basic information about the silent payments proposal, implementation, and tutorial on https://silentbitco.in. In response to a suggestion by Pavol Rusnak, they mentioned that a new address/descriptor format may be a better approach than using a flag. On the other hand, Woltx has created a short and simple tutorial on how to make silent payments on signet. In this tutorial, the user generates an address, publishes it, receives and spends coins from it, and still no transactions are shown from this address in a blockchain explorer. The user seems to prefer a strict mandate on address reuse prevention, as it is easier to loosen later if needed, but harder to tighten later due to backward compatibility with addresses in use. The message was sent securely via ProtonMail, and the email thread was part of the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by lists.linuxfoundation.org.</summary>
