    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Timón shared a link to an article by Russell O'Connor about the origins and design of Speedy Trial (ST). ST is a protocol that allows for faster activation of soft forks on the Bitcoin network. Timón asked if O'Connor had really designed ST to make everyone unhappy, to which O'Connor's article did not provide any evidence. The article discusses the consensus process and how ST was developed, but does not mention any intention to make anyone unhappy. In fact, O'Connor states that ST's design was not based on any activation philosophy related to failing fast.</summary>
