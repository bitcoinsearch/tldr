    <summary>In an email exchange between Chris Belcher and ZmnSCPxj, Chris discusses the intended feature of using the same fidelity bond to run a JoinMarket maker as well as a Teleport (Coinswap) maker. He believes that this is not abusable as long as the same bond is not used by two makers in the same application. Chris notes that JoinMarket takers are already coded to check for this, and Teleport takers will soon follow suit. Using the same bond across different applications is perfectly fine. ZmnSCPxj compliments Chris on his BIP and asks whether the use of the same fidelity bond across multiple applications is potentially abusable or not.</summary>
