    <summary>A user has thanked woltx for implementing silent payments in Bitcoin Core and confirmed that the steps provided in the tutorial work as expected. The user has updated the silent payment address for their domain alice.silentbitco.in using a TXT record. They have also added basic information about the silent payments proposal, implementation, and tutorial on their website silentbitco.in. The user did not face any issues with the performance of the UTXO Set and block scan, but suggests that a new address/descriptor format would be a better approach instead of using flags. They have shared suggestions by Pavol Rusnak that make sense regarding this matter. The email was sent using ProtonMail secure email. Woltx had created a tutorial on making silent payments on signet which involves generating an address, publishing it, receiving and spending coins from it without transactions being shown in a blockchain explorer.</summary>
