    <summary>The context of the conversation is about Bitcoin. The sender is asking questions about Bitcoin, but feels that their messages are being censored on the mailing list. They ask who moderates the mailing list and if their censored messages can be seen. They express concern about censorship and want to know if they were censored in previous discussions about bip8 and who else was censored, when, why and by whom. The recipient of the email cannot remember who moderates the mailing list, but provides a link to where the censored messages can be viewed. They also suggest that sometimes the moderator may be busy with other things, causing a delay in message moderation.</summary>
