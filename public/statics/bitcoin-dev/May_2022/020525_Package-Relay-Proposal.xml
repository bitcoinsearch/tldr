    <summary>The conversation between Gloria Zhao and Anthony Towns on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses various scenarios related to package announcement and censorship vectors. The discussion includes the possibility of peers providing false information, thereby censoring requests to other peers. To prevent this, they suggest storing all announcements and requesting from every peer. They also discuss adding more information upfront, such as fee and weight when announcing packages, rather than only being asked for its info. However, Gloria argues that it may not sufficiently resolve censorship issues. They also discuss encoding parent txs as short wtxid hashes and including them in inv announcements to avoid round trips while deduping parents. They also consider the possibility of using a bit field instead of sending a message for each version in "sendpackages".</summary>
