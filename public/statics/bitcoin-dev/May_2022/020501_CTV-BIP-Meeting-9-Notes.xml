    <summary>The recent CTV meeting discussed several topics, including OP_TX, OP_CAT/CSFS/General Covenants, and Script Interpreter Flags. Jeremy Rubin suggested that if OP_TX is seen as a superior upgrading path, he would be willing to shift focus, but prefers a more thorough evaluation of CTV/NOP upgradability versus the multibyte op-success. Anthony Towns doesn't find OP_TX interesting if it only does CTV from the start. Harding considers OP_TX==OP_CTV only somewhat more interesting than just OP_CTV because it provides a clear upgrade path, but would be more interested if it came with a few more initial features.Regarding General Covenants, Harding believes concerns are unfounded and thinks CAT+CSFS add the smallest amount of consensus complexity to enable the greatest amount of experimentation with covenants and other features. The discussion also covered some issues being discussed on mailing lists and social media related to general bitcoin covenants, such as scripts being harder to analyze, MEV &amp; consensus stability, and whitelist/blacklist. Some users think covenants can be imposed on their coins without consent or everyone will accept covenants so unable to pay them. Some Bitcoin users in Iran are afraid that a generalized form of the covenants would enable some kind of censorship.MEV could be one of the issues associated with general covenants. The covenants are "self-executing" and can be sandwiched, similar to Eth's MEV. Anthony Towns likes the idea of documenting exactly what rules the flags are meant to enforce (associated BIPs). The test flags infrastructure relies on some particular features of validity/invalidity and flagging, which has previously been avoided surfacing because upgrades were at the output type level. The way the flagging works is not quite the right thing for testability and simple consensus code, so it's worth re-evaluating. The discussion ended with some thoughts on how to do script enforcement in light of wanting to keep doing things the way we did for taproot, and whether we need to re-evaluate how we do it.</summary>
