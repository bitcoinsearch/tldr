    <summary>Taproot is a forthcoming upgrade for Bitcoin that will enable users to safeguard their public keys with passwords. In an email exchange, LL and vjudeu explored the possibility of using Taproot to protect individual public keys with passwords. The proposed method involves creating a normal, Taproot-based public key in a secure and random way, then creating another public key by taking a password from the user and executing a proper password hash on it to use as a private key. The two keys are combined in a Schnorr signature to form a 2-of-2 multisig, where the first key is totally random and the second key is a brainwallet that takes a password chosen by the user. By default, all keys within a wallet can be protected with the same password, but users can choose different passwords for different addresses if necessary. Descriptors can handle this feature in the same way they handle any other 2-of-2 multisig. LL suggests that instead of using a hardware device that protects a secret key via pin, a pinless device could be used with a strong password and proper password hash. It is important not to use sha256 to hash the password, as there are proper password hash options available. While bip39 passwords do something similar, they involve entering them into a potentially malicious hardware device. This new functionality provides an added layer of security for Bitcoin users, as it allows them to protect their funds with both a randomly generated key and a password-derived key. Overall, the combination of a random key and a password-derived key using Taproot's 2-of-2 multisig scheme offers a flexible and secure solution to safeguarding public keys with passwords.</summary>
