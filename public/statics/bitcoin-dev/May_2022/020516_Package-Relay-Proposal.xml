    <summary>In a discussion about transaction packages, Gloria Zhao suggests providing information on fees and sizes of each transaction in the package. However, she concludes that this information does not provide additional meaning unless the exact topology is known, including dependency relationships between parents. To illustrate, in a package with transactions {A, B, D}, even if the information is listed, the decision should be different depending on whether B spends from A. However, another participant disagrees and argues that if D is above the fee floor, then all transactions (A, B, D) should be included, and also if B isn't above the floor but all of them combined are. The participant raises concerns about having a problem when there is a combination such as (A,B,C,X), where B spends A and X spends A, B, and C, and X+C is below the fee floor while A+B and A+B+C+X are above the fee floor. Finally, they suggest adding a graph to make it more plausible.</summary>
