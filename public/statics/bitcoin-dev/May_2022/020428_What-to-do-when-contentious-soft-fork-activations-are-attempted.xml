    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Timón questioned a claim made by Russell O'Connor that speedy trial was designed to make everyone unhappy. Timón found the claim strange and stated that the grace period for slower activation after lock-in was added to address concerns raised by people who disliked the proposal. However, he still believed that speedy trial was a bad proposal due to incorrect analysis. O'Connor responded by quoting his own blog post where he stated that the design of speedy trial was not based on any activation philosophy about failing fast. The discussion did not seem to be an attack against O'Connor, but rather a critique of one of his ideas.</summary>
