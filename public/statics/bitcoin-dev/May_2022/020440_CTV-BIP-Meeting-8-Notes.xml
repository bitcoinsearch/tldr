    <summary>In a BitcoinTalk thread, concerns were raised about potential attacks based on covenants, with visacoin being considered the most scary. The idea of recursive covenants was discussed in the thread, with no distinction made between recursive and non-recursive covenants at the time. However, `OP_CTV` has enabled non-recursive covenant opcodes, which can provide covenants without recursion. It is not possible to use `OP_CTV` to implement visacoin as it requires a recursive covenant.</summary>
