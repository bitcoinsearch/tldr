    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a blockchain developer, has suggested a new scheme in which transaction fees from the sidechain or ecash server are divided among the fidelity bonds in proportion to their value. This scheme is similar to his old idea of "mainstake," where funds are locked up on the mainchain for constructing new sidechain blocks. The share of the sideblocks will be proportional to the value of the mainstake that was locked up. It is worth noting that this scheme can be used for anything that requires a federation as well. For example, statechains are effectively federation-guarded CoinPools and could use a similar scheme for selecting federation members. Users can also be guided by fidelity bonds to select federation members for smart contracts that are unchained.</summary>
