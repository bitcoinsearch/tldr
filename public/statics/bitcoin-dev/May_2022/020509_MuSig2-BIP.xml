    <summary>The BIP draft attempts to address the issue of identical public keys in a multi-signature scheme. If signers were to simply abort when faced with identical public keys, then a malicious actor could disrupt a session by copying another signer's key. To prevent this, the BIP proposes a solution that allows for the handling of identical public keys. However, implementing this solution requires added complexity due to the MuSig2* optimization. Nonetheless, this added complexity ultimately allows for the identification and removal of disruptive signers, reducing complexity for MuSig2 users. The full details can be found in the BIP-MuSig2 draft.</summary>
