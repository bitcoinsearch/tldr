    <summary>In a conversation, Jorge expressed his confusion regarding the naming of non-recursive covenants. He failed to understand why they are called covenants at all. However, ZmnSCPxj explained that a covenant is simply a promise of something happening in the future. On the other hand, a recursive covenant guarantees that the same thing will happen again in the future. ZmnSCPxj further elaborated that non-recursive covenants can also be useful. For instance, `OP_EVICT` is designed for a specific use-case and avoids recursion. This indicates that non-recursive covenants can serve their purpose efficiently without any need for recursion. In conclusion, ZmnSCPxj clarified the difference between recursive and non-recursive covenants, highlighting the importance of both types in different situations.</summary>
