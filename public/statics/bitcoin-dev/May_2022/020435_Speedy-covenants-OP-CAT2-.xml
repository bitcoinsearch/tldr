    <summary>The email conversation discusses the possibility of re-enabling OP_CAT, which would require a hardfork. However, it is suggested that creating a new OP_CAT2 would be a softfork and could be achieved through TapScript. Currently, OP_CAT in TapScript simply means "anyone can move those coins," so adding restrictions would allow for the re-enabling of this opcode. The idea of introducing OP_CAT2 is deemed unnecessary unless it will be significantly different from OP_CAT and should not be named as such. Finally, it is proposed that modifying OP_SUCCESS may make more sense than creating a new opcode altogether.</summary>
