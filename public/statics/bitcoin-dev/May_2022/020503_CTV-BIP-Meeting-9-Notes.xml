    <summary>In the provided context, ZmnSCPxj discusses the vulnerability of covenant mechanisms to MEV. When asked about which specific covenant mechanisms require large witness data, ZmnSCPxj refers to `OP_CSFS` and `OP_CAT`. These mechanisms require copying parts of the transaction into the witness data to use for covenants, with `OP_CSFS` needing large scripts if used for covenants. However, ZmnSCPxj notes that `OP_CSFS` is not designed for covenants but instead enables them when enough data is thrown at it. To better support recursive covenants, ZmnSCPxj suggests creating an opcode that explicitly supports recursion rather than one that happens to enable it as this would likely require less data to be pushed on the witness stack. The goal is to avoid repetition in the code.</summary>
