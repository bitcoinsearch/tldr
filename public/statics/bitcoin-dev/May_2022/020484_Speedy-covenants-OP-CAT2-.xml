    <summary>In an email exchange on May 13, 2022, Anthony Towns discussed the factors to consider when proposing a specific opcode. These factors include how much can be done with it, how efficient it is to validate, how easy it is to make it do what is intended, how helpful it is at preventing bugs, and how clean and maintainable the validation code is. Towns then provided his opinion on various proposals, stating that CTV and APO are weakest in terms of what can be done with them, while CAT/CSFS fails in ease of use and bug prevention. On the other hand, OP_TX may not be as good as desired in terms of clean and maintainable validation code. In regards to the proposal for CAT+CSFS, Towns suggested that its primary purpose would be to validate oracle messages and pubkey delegation, with covenants serving as a secondary function to gather data on user preferences.</summary>
