    <summary>In a discussion about lending, ZmnSCPxj questions the idea that the net present value of a loan is zero when the principal return is guaranteed by covenant at maturity. ZmnSCPxj provides an alternative scenario where a landlord pays a lessor X satoshis in rent and receives use of the fidelity bond coin (value Y) for N blocks, ultimately receiving the entire fidelity bond amount (Y) back. Despite this, ZmnSCPxj does not understand why the value of this situation would be considered zero. ZmnSCPxj compares this strategy to a simple HODL strategy where Y satoshis are locked for N blocks and then returned, suggesting that the HODL strategy may have some value due to the ability to spend funds freely during the N blocks.</summary>
