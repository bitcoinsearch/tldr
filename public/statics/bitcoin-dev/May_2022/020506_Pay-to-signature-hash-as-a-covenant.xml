    <summary>The email is a discussion on the use of covenants in P2PK scripts and if it is possible to use them without consensus changes. The sender suggests experimenting with P2PK and legacy signatures, but notes that using Schnorr signatures may be more flexible and allow for more use cases. They also propose a "pay to signature" script that they acknowledge is insecure and should be handled carefully. The email continues with a technical discussion on the circular reference problem for covenants and how pubkey recovery is not possible in BIP340 schnorr.</summary>
