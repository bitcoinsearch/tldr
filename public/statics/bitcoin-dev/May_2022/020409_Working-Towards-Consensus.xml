    <summary>The author argues that the path to consensus is proposing things that everyone needs. However, the author's statement that Bitcoin users aren't using practically all features is questionable since not everyone needs Taproot. The author contends that it is easier to get everyone to agree when everyone has something to gain. The designers solve problems with designs, but when they speculate and lead the process, they create problems instead. While companies that have implemented features that users directly ask for end up with awful bloated confusing products, users do not know how to design products. In terms of CTV, the author argues that adding complication to Bitcoin's base layer is not a means of valuing simplicity. The author posits that there is no urgency or problem that any of the proposed soft fork features are trying to address, and demand is necessary. Finally, the author argues that personal attacks are antithetical to consensus and asserts that Jeremy's incentives are external to consensus.</summary>
