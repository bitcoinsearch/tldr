    <summary>A Bitcoin developer named Michael Folkson expressed his thoughts on the recent attempt to activate a contentious soft fork in an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He mentioned that some users identified what was going on, and Bitcoin educators like Andreas Antonopoulos and Jimmy Song brought more attention to the dangers. A URSF movement also started to gain momentum, and those attempting a contentious soft fork activation backed off. Folkson criticized Bitcoin Optech for not covering the dangers highlighted in previous posts to the mailing list. He also mentioned that some users have been misled, and spreading information on social media is not helpful. The email thread also contained a response from a user named alicexbt, who accused Andreas Antonopoulos of spreading misinformation about BIP 119 and other covenant proposals. They also questioned whether accusing someone of spreading misinformation without proof could be considered a personal attack.Folkson mentioned that it is totally unacceptable for one individual to bring the entire Bitcoin network to the brink of a chain split and suggested that there should be a personal cost to dissuade them from trying it again. He expressed uncertainty about whether the personal cost of the community's reaction to the individual trying it again is sufficient. He also stated that if an individual can go directly to miners to get soft forks activated while bypassing technical concerns from many developers, bypassing Bitcoin Core and bypassing users, then Bitcoin is fundamentally broken. Overall, the email thread discussed the recent attempt to activate a contentious soft fork and the potential dangers associated with it. It also touched upon the role of Bitcoin educators and the importance of addressing misinformation.</summary>
