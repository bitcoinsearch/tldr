    <summary>During the last CTV meeting, several topics were discussed including the APO version of the simple vault and how it is vulnerable to the half-spend problem. Fixing this requires amending APOAS to cover the current input index. The unvault transaction is also third-party malleable, which can have more inputs added to it, making it less privacy-preserving. The current APO is unusable as a CTV alternative, but revised APO seems to be as useful as CTV is. Fiatjaf's CTV spacechain demo was also highlighted during the meeting, and the link to the demo was provided. Comparisons between CTV with other covenant proposals were made, and Billy Tetrud sent an email expressing his preference for CTV due to its simplicity, documentation, code, tools, review, and testing. The discussion also touched on recursive covenants and the aversion to infinite recursion. Finally, the group discussed responding to FUD, showing a way to do blacklists in the bug bounty offer, and clarifying potential concerns about recursive covenants so that they can be properly examined.</summary>
