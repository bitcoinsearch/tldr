    <title>Improving BIP 8 soft fork activation</title>

    <summary>A proposal has been made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding BIP8 and LOT (Lock-in-on-timeout). The proposal aims to address disagreements with speedy trial activation methods and remove LOT from BIP8. The proposal also calculates MUST_SIGNAL state based on threshold reached and removes the lockinontimeout flag. If miners signaling does not reach the threshold, the MUST_SIGNAL phase will be longer. The proposal provides a draft of the BIP with no code and some changes in BIP8, as well as a state transitions diagram. The author of the email gives a minor improvement suggestion to specify "minimum_activation_height" as "minimum_activation_blocks". The email concludes with the author's preference for future soft forks to use a previously specified activation mechanism rather than rolling out a rushed unspeced thing as part of the soft fork implementation.</summary>
