    <title>Package Relay Proposal</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the feasibility of making ancestor/descendant limits configurable in package relay. It is debated whether these constraints should be specified in a standard protocol or if Core's default mempool policy should be adhered to. The thread also considers the possibility of using batch transactions more generally, and highlights that getpckgtxns is a general way to request a batch of transactions. The sender does not necessarily know if the recipient will be interested in the package based on their feefilter. In addition, a counterexample is given to show why using an ancestor feerate would not be better for sending PCKG INV when a transaction's feerate is above the fee filter. Finally, the sender should send package announcements only when they know the recipient will be interested in the package, based on their feefilter.</summary>
