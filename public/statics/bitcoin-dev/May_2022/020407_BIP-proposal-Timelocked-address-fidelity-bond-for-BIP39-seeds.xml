    <summary>The possibility of renting out fidelity bonds has been discussed, where hodlers can generate yield without running a full node and yield generator. However, the downside is that income from the yield generator is random while the rent paid is a fixed cost, which may not cover the rent. The idea of renting suggests the potential for a market of lessors, where a surveillor could create multiple identities to rent from multiple lessors to obtain privacy data. Defiads had a similar system, where ads were propagated with larger bonded values and timeframes. However, defiads was not intended for privacy-sensitive applications like JoinMarket/Teleport.</summary>
