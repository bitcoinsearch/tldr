    <summary>A proposal has been made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding BIP8 and LOT (Lock-in-on-timeout). The proposal aims to address disagreements with speedy trial activation methods and remove LOT from BIP8. The proposal also calculates MUST_SIGNAL state based on threshold reached and removes the lockinontimeout flag. If miners signaling does not reach the threshold, the MUST_SIGNAL phase will be longer. The proposal suggests using tri-state version signaling that can encode both active support as well as active opposition to an active soft fork. The meaning for each ternary value is 0 for no signal, 1 for ready for new consensus rules, and 2 for not ready for new consensus rules. Miners should not consider signaling as voting. The proposal also mentions the intriguing concept of minimum and maximum threshold, and the author is interested to read what other developers have to say about it.Russell O'Connor agrees with using orphaning to alert miners to the fact that a fork has already locked in but suggests there are better design choices available that do not risk taking mining hardware offline for a protracted period of time. He proposed using an anti-fork signal that only needs to be on a single block and could be almost anything to prepare an "anti-fork". Russell further stated that using version bits and signaling over multiple blocks is quite bad as it risks losing mining power if miners don't conform or are unable to conform to the version bits signal. Billy Tetrud acknowledges the proposal's usefulness and agrees that there are things about BIP 9 that BIP 8 fixes. He suggests a minor improvement to specify "minimum_activation_blocks" instead of "minimum_activation_height" as it is easier to reason about and change when necessary. He gives a concept ACK and would like future soft forks to use a previously specified activation mechanism rather than rolling out a rushed unspeced thing as part of the (very orthogonal) soft fork implementation.The email thread discusses the implementation of BIP8 and the necessity of a MUST_SIGNAL state. The purpose of the mandatory signaling was to ensure all existing clients waiting for segwit signaling would be activated together with any BIP8 clients. However, if there are no other clients, the MUST_SIGNAL state no longer accomplishes its purpose. Some people would like some signal on the chain that indicates a soft-fork activation in order to allow people who object to the fork to make an "anti-fork" that rejects blocks containing the soft-fork signal.A Bitcoin developer has proposed a solution to recent disagreements surrounding BIP 8 and LOT. The developer has removed LOT from BIP 8 and created a new proposal that calculates the MUST_SIGNAL state based on the threshold reached. They have shared a BIP draft with no code and some changes to BIP 8 on GitHub, along with a state transitions diagram. This proposal removes lockinontimeout flag and allows for a longer period for MUST_SIGNAL state if LOCKED_IN was not reached.In conclusion, solutions are suggested to these problems such as developers plan and ship the binaries with activation code in time and mining pools pay attention, participate in soft fork discussions, hire competent developers and reach out to developers in community if require help.</summary>
