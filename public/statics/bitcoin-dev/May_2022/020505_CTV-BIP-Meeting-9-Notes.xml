    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named alicexbt raised concerns about MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) and its association with general covenants. For those interested in learning more about MEV, alicexbt recommended checking out resources available on mev.day. To address MEV, one proposed solution is to ensure all transactions in a block occur simultaneously. This could be achieved by limiting price oracles to only report one price per block, preventing manipulation of both high and low prices. However, this would require a new signature opcode as current signatures sign the entire transaction. In Bitcoin, ordering is strictly enforced but there is a loophole that allows things happening in the same transaction to occur simultaneously. Future extensions could allow for signing only the necessary parts and aggregating transactions together.</summary>
