    <summary>The email is a discussion about a Bitcoin proposal. The author agrees with concerns about the `\**` syntax, which they believe is not crucial to the proposal. They explain that it makes the code more readable on a small screen and is easier to parse for users. However, they are not attached to this feature as it is probably not very useful in taptrees. The author suggests that descriptors may be outgrowing their original scope and proposes that the language of descriptors should only represent either a single output or a list of outputs with the `/*` syntax. The author also discusses key aliasing and suggests it can be better built on top of wallet policies rather than within the language itself. They propose keeping restrictions and extensions separated rather than changing descriptors. In response to an unrelated question, the author believes there are no technical blockers for musig2 for hardware wallets.</summary>
