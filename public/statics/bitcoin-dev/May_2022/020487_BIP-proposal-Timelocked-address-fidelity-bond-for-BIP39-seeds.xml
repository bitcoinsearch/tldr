    <summary>In an email to Chris, ZmnSCPxj discusses the potential privacy trade-offs between linking two identities: JoinMarket maker and Teleport maker. While acknowledging that linking the two identities can slightly degrade privacy, ZmnSCPxj argues that this must be balanced against the risk of sybil attacks on both systems. Without fidelity bonds, both systems are vulnerable to such attacks with just a small amount of money, which could result in lost coins. However, ZmnSCPxj suggests disallowing a fidelity bond used in JoinMarket from being used in Teleport, or vice versa, rather than eliminating them altogether.</summary>
