    <summary>In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, John Carvalho, CEO of Synonym.to, emphasized the importance of proposing things that everyone needs in order to reach consensus. He argued that Bitcoin is not a place for speculative feature additions and cannot afford a culture of additive features no one is asking for. Instead, Bitcoin thrives in a culture of "NO" and rejection of change is its primary feature. Furthermore, Carvalho stated that there is no hope of ever getting the majority of Bitcoin users to grasp, audit, and meaningfully consent to complicated new features. Carvalho criticized the developers who succumb to selfish egomania and focus on their personal biases instead of what everyone wants. He also warned against leaning too heavily on the trust that the public already places in Core devs. According to Carvalho, until designers focus on what everyone wants, they will not reach consensus on anything.In another email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Billy Tetrud echoed Carvalho's emphasis on the importance of consensus and education in the decision-making process. He argued that any thoughts from ignorance, whether self-aware or not, should be given small weight, and that it is important to give time for understanding to those who have not participated in previous rounds of discussion on a proposal. Tetrud also emphasized the need to avoid personal attacks and look at the technical details and code when commenting on proposals.Tetrud acknowledged that there may be some natural skepticism-from-ignorance but cautioned against interpreting it as opposition or a strong signal of any kind. He urged people to respect the consensus process and care about consensus, even if it is not their preferred outcome. Tetrud also expressed concern over the recent attempt to activate a contentious soft fork and emphasized the need for personal cost to dissuade individuals from attempting such actions in the future.Overall, both Carvalho and Tetrud stressed the importance of seeking consensus and education in the decision-making process, focusing on what everyone wants, and avoiding selfish biases and personal attacks.In an email to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Jeremy Rubin addresses the recent drama surrounding his post titled "7 Theses on a next step for BIP-119". He apologizes for any confusion or fear that may have been caused by disinformation spread about his post. Moving forward, Rubin believes that efforts should be made to better document how Bitcoin's technical consensus process works, address concerns about covenants and their potential negative impact, renew conversations about activation and release mechanisms, and systematize knowledge around covenant technologies. Despite expecting messy discourse, Rubin believes this work is critical to the future of Bitcoin and invites feedback from the community.</summary>
