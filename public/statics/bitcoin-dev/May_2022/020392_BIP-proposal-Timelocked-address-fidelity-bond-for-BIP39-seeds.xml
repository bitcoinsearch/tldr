    <summary>The email discusses the possibility of renting a fidelity bond for different applications using a pay-for-signature protocol now that Taproot is available. The author wonders whether this would be considered an abuse or economic sensibility. They speculate that in the future, people may offer fidelity bonds for lease without caring about the actual applications it's being used for. The cost of paying for the fidelity bond could be done either by renting it or acquiring Bitcoins and foregoing the ability to utilize it for some time. The author asks how JoinMarket clients check for fidelity bonds not being used across multiple makers and suggests including the technique in the BIP.</summary>
