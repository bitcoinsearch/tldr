    <summary>The discussed topic is regarding the implementation of CAT+CSFS to validate oracle messages and pubkey delegation. The ability to covenants would be secondary, and it could help to get real user data about the type of covenants users find valuable. The development of new opcodes will not happen without validating the current ones. The safety of covenants depends on how addresses are generated, and fears of forced forward-encumbrance are not any worse than what can be done today. It is suggested that ctv+apo, cat+csfs are fine. However, ones that everyone thinks are "good enough for everyone who cares about them" should be chosen. It is necessary to prove that they are not an undue burden on nodes in terms of validate-cpu-cycles-per-byte, and they won't introduce DDOS attack vectors. The game theory underlying selfish miner support of the chain will not be affected by causing widespread use of on-chain leveraging instruments, and shorting bitcoin on-chain would be dangerous.</summary>
