    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, has provided an explanation of his actions and response to the Bitcoin community's reaction. In a blog post, he encouraged review on the viability of having a Speedy Trial (ST) with signaling beginning around 3.5 weeks, followed by a regularly scheduled meeting to discuss the viability of an activation attempt. He made it clear that CTV activation was "not a must," and all actors must decide if it's in their own rational self-interest to have the soft-fork proceed. Since he posted his blog, there have been inaccurate claims made about him trying to route around consensus, force miners to do a ST, force users to accept a patch they don't want, calls for him to face various repercussions, attacks on his character, and more. He accepts responsibility that ultimately he may not have communicated these things clearly enough. However, he has kept his word to listen to feedback on parameters before any release. He has not released binaries for a ST CTV client in May and won't be. He has kept his promise not to run a UASF process.Rubin thanked the majority of individuals who understand this and have provided overwhelming amounts of personal support to him through these last weeks. He also encourages Bitcoin contributors to trace how the response to his proposal was instigated so that they harden their own defenses against disinformation campaigns in the future. He invites anyone who does not think that his actions lived up with his perception of them to give him, either publicly or privately, any feedback on how he can do better going forward.</summary>
