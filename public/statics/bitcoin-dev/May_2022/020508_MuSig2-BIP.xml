    <summary>A user named Waxwing/AdamISZ contacted Jonas Nick via email thanking him for the BIP draft and requesting some clarification about identical pubkeys and its relation to MuSig2* optimization. The user questioned the purpose of allowing identical pubkeys and whether it was wise to do so since it can complicate certain aspects of the algorithm. The user also expressed concerns that this feature may lead to errors as it is more likely to come from an error in implementation rather than an attacker. In response, Jonas Nick shared that he and two others are working on a MuSig2 BIP that supports tweaking and allows deriving child keys from aggregate keys. He also provided a link to the BIP draft on Github and mentioned that the draft is in a state where it should be possible to write an implementation based on the BIP that passes basic test vectors. Overall, the email exchange between Waxwing/AdamISZ and Jonas Nick centered around the technical details of the BIP draft and how it relates to MuSig2* optimization.</summary>
