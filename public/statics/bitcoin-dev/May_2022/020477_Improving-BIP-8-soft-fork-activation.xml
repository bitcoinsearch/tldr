    <summary>Russell O'Connor responded to a proposal made by alicexbt regarding the use of MUST_SIGNAL state in BIP8. Russell stated that the notion of a MUST_SIGNAL state is misguided today and not necessary as it no longer accomplishes its purpose. He suggested that if everyone uses a BIP8 deployment, there are no other clients to activate. He also proposed using an anti-fork signal that only needs to be on a single block and could be almost anything to prepare an "anti-fork". Russell further stated that using version bits and signaling over multiple blocks is quite bad as it risks losing mining power if miners don't conform or are unable to conform to the version bits signal. Solutions to this problem include developers planning and shipping the binaries with activation code in time, mining pools paying attention, participating in soft fork discussions, hiring competent developers and reaching out to developers in the community if they require help, and mining pools upgrading during the first month of signaling. If some mining pools still mine invalid blocks, Bitcoin should still work normally as it did during May-June 2021 when 50% hashrate went down due to some issues in China.</summary>
