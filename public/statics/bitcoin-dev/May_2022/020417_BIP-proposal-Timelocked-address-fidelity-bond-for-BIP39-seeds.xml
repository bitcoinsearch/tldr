    <summary>The conversation between Chris Belcher and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the idea of renting out fidelity bonds for generating yield. Chris suggests publicly advertising such a system to make retail hodlers aware of this possibility. However, ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about the privacy implications of rental services and possible surveillance. The defiads project is discussed as an example of a similar system which prioritized advertisements with larger bonded values. Chris proposes a solution to remove intermediate certificate keypair and sign the endpoint directly using fidelity bond UTXO key to remove the possibility of fidelity bonds in cold storage. Currently, JoinMarket has 600 bitcoins locked up and advertised, but there is no cold storage solution for fidelity bonds yet. Overall, the discussion revolves around the potential benefits and drawbacks of renting out fidelity bonds and the need to address privacy concerns associated with it.</summary>
