    <summary>The writer proposes a model for correct timestamping service, stating that any such service must follow the model. They suggest that if an OTS does not conform to the model, it is unreliable and potentially incorrect, even when all parties involved are honest. The writer offers to detail the types of unreliability issues that can arise if the model is not followed, and notes that there are other ways to address these issues beyond linearizability. The writer then asks if there is any formal proof of the guarantees that OTS provides against different threat models, acknowledging that this may be difficult without a formal model of what OTS is.</summary>
