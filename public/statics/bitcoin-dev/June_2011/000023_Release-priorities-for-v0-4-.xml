    <summary>Mark Visser suggested in an email on June 15, 2011 that the location of wallet.dat should be included in preferences. He proposed this feature so users could easily disconnect their wallet by unplugging a USB key. However, Jeff Garzik, the founder of exMULTI, explained that -datadir already served this purpose. The problem is that all databases must be in the datadir because wallet.dat is a berkeley db and requires a transactional environment. Consequently, it makes it difficult to move just one file.</summary>
