    <summary>In an email exchange from 2011, Jeff Garzik proposed several mini-proposals for the Satoshi Client - the original Bitcoin client - to better prepare the Bitcoin protocol for the long term. The issue of alternative implementations of a protocol has been discussed on forums and agreed upon by many. The current scheme was preferred by Satoshi who discouraged alternative client efforts. However, since protocol development has slowed down and there is at least one major alternative client in the works, it is time to revisit those assumptions and preferences.The mini-proposals include avoiding creating four-component version numbers (W.X.Y.Z) and using pszSubVer as a client identification string; removing IP transactions in v0.4; creating constants for protocol version and auditing code to split client version from protocol version; splitting protocol and client versions in v0.4 and using a single bit inside 'nServices' to indicate the presence of an optional "capabilities" message. All these proposals are aimed at better preparing the bitcoin protocol for the long term, enabling minor protocol changes without having to change the protocol version, and supporting more mature protocols that use features rather than simply "I support all features &gt;= version X".Jeff Garzik and Chris Moore propose several mini-proposals to better prepare the Bitcoin protocol for the long term. They agree that alternative implementations of a protocol are beneficial to the ecosystem and that tying together protocol and client version is sub-optimal and undesirable long-term. The current coarse-grained scheme was preferred by Satoshi Nakamoto, who actively discouraged alternative client efforts. Protocol development has clearly slowed, and we have at least one major alternative client in the works (bitcoinj), so it seems fair to revisit those assumptions and preferences.Jeff Garzik suggested that the client needed a better nickname and called it "Mainline client" as a reference to the original Bittorrent client. Christian Decker suggested calling it the "Reference client" since it is the original reference implementation. Douglas Huff agreed with this proposal.</summary>
