    <summary>In 2011, a hacker known as "georgeclooney" quietly disclosed dozens of MTGOX hashed passwords on a hash cracking forum on June 17th. Most of the hashes matched the MTGOX database that was posted on various websites and forums after the major event. Many users claimed that their accounts were robbed prior to the big event on Sunday, indicating that this post may have been generated from an earlier dump than was officially disclosed.On June 20th, Doug Huff wrote an email mentioning two independent sources claiming known SQL injection vulnerabilities in MtGox. One vulnerability was confirmed to be patched, but the other was not at the time of the market crash and database leak. The investigation also revealed that MtGox exposed its admin user interface even if a user did not have the admin flag set on their account. Although most actions attempted to be used will throw permission errors, it cannot be confirmed whether or not the issue still exists.The details for the referenced xss+csrf are provided, but it is unknown whether or not it is still an issue as the site is inaccessible. MagicalTux's official response at the time of writing is attached in the email.</summary>
