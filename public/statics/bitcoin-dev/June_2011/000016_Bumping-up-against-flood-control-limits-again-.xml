    <summary>A bitcoin developer named Mike Hearn expressed his frustration over the 10mb flood control limit which disconnected him while testing chain download. He suggested that block sizes have started to get quite large once again and at 500 blocks an average of 20kb per block will cause this issue. The average is probably quite close to that as seen from the block explorer. Flood control seems like a serious scalability limitation. He proposed two solutions, one is to raise the limit again and another is to raise the limit and simultaneously lower the batch size. Chain download in high latency environments would be hurt quite a bit in case of downsizing to 100 or even 50. However, chain download is already considered a serious bottleneck.</summary>
