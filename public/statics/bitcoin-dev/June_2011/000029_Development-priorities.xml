    <summary>In this email conversation, Gavin Andresen has identified two important issues that need to be addressed in the Bitcoin system: scaling-up issues and wallet security. However, it is argued that the wallet crypto mainly eliminates bad PR rather than being a major crime deterrent. To address this issue, a suggestion is made for introducing a built-in facility for air-gapped wallets so that loss of an everyday transactional wallet does not result in the loss of everything, which would benefit people who do not know about crypto and simply download and run the client without thinking much about security.The email conversation also highlights the importance of testing. While autotools provides minimal testing frameworks built into it, comprehensive automated tests are quite useful as well. It is suggested that stress tests and other comprehensive, automated tests should be included in the suite of test cases. However, it is emphasized that the v0.4 release should not be held for this purpose. The best testing is always in the field, and it always finds more problems than unit testing ever does.</summary>
