    <summary>A discussion arose on the bitcoin-development platform regarding the relevancy of Mt Gox related discussions. One user requested that such discussions be kept off the platform, stating that it is not related to the core software. However, another user argued that MtGox's code is just as relevant as BitcoinJ or any other Bitcoin software. The argument was made that Mt Gox's code is closed source, so no one on the platform can do anything about it unlike other software discussed there.</summary>
