    <summary>In an email chain from June 27, 2011, Doug Huff contacted Laszlo to inquire about including his Info.plist and BitcoinAppIcon.icns into the upstream source repository. Huff wanted to ensure that it was okay to include these files so that the osx build could be automated without needing external source requirements. Huff asked if the files were licensed under MIT or similar and if not, would Laszlo be willing to put them in the Public Domain or other compatible license. In response, Laszlo expressed that he wasn't sure where the files belonged but that there wasn't a license and they were just public domain.</summary>
