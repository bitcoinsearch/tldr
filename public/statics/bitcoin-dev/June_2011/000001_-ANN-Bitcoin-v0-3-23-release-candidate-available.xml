    <summary>Bitcoin v0.3.23rc1 has been released for Win32, Linux and source, with updates focused on dealing with the influx of new bitcoin users. The P2P connect-to-node logic has been changed to reduce timeout, allowing for quicker hunting of useful P2P connections. Transaction fees have also been reduced to 0.0005 for new transactions, while fees as low as 0.0001 BTC will still be supported. The release includes a number of other minor bugfixes and updates, including updated translations for Chinese Simplified and Swedish, ignoring non-internet-routable hosts, adding common temp files to .gitignore, fixing CPU usage bugs and creating keypool in LoadWallet().</summary>
