    <summary>On June 22, 2011, Mike Hearn sent an email suggesting the start of experimentation with MULTISIG transactions on testnet. In response to this, a question was posed to Mike about whether or not Satoshi had ever shared his thoughts on the best way to implement MULTISIG transactions. Additionally, there was a proposal to hard-code new standard script templates in script.cpp Solver(). The proposed output script for MULTISIG transactions was "2 3 CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY".</summary>
