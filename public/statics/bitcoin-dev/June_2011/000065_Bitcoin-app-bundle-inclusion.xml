    <summary>In this email conversation, Doug Huff is seeking permission from Laszlo to include his Info.plist and BitcoinAppIcon.icns into the upstream source repository. This inclusion would allow for automation of the osx build without any external source requirements apart from lib deps. Doug inquires about the license under which the mentioned files are currently available. He asks if they are licensed under MIT or a similar license or if Laszlo is willing to put them under the Public Domain or other compatible license.The email ends with the attachments of two digital signature messages, smime.p7s and PGP.sig.</summary>
