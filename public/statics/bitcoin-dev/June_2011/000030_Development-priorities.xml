    <summary>Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin Core developer, agreed that wallet security is an important issue. However, he pointed out that the wallet crypto mainly eliminates bad PR rather than being a major crime deterrent. Zooko, a software developer, suggested introducing a built-in facility for air-gapped wallets to prevent loss of everything if an everyday transactional wallet is lost. Despite this suggestion, a cracker could still send an encrypted wallet to themselves, delete the local one, kill the client, and demand that the password be published if some coins are wanted back. Garzik was unsure if there was any defense for an insecure PC and speculated that Bitcoin might force people to reconsider their priorities when it comes to security.</summary>
