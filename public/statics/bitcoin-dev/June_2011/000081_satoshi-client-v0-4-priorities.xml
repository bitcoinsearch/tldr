    <summary>In a conversation from 2011, Jeff Garzik stated that wallet encryption and import/export features were crucial for version 0.4 of Bitcoin. He believed that wallet encryption was necessary for security reasons, while the import/export feature would be useful for storing private keys in a bank's safety deposit box. Doug Huff added to the conversation by saying that Sipa had already rebased his showwallet tree, although it was missing a segfault fix. While he wasn't entirely sure if it was ready for pulling, Doug confirmed that it was functional. The email also contained information about Splunk, which is a tool used to make sense of IT infrastructure data.</summary>
