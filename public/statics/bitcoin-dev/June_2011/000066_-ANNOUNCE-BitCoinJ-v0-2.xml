    <summary>BitCoinJ v0.2 has been released with over 100 commits since the first release in March. The new version offers full support for block chain re-orgs, including recognition of dead transactions. Persistence of the block chain using multiple, pluggable stores is available and a BoundedOverheadBlockStore is provided that is suitable for mobile devices where low memory usage and instant startup time are requirements. Additionally, there is a larger test suite, IRC, DNS and seed list peer discovery, ASN.1 key export, bugfixes and minor API improvements. Several people contributed to this release, including Andreas Schildbach, Miron Cuperman, Gary Rowe, Thilo Planz, Micheal Swiggs, Noa Resare, John Sample, and Xiaofeng Guo.</summary>
