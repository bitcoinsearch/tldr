    <summary>Pieter Wuille posted a message saying that the consensus is to merge autotools and qtgui, but autotools has not been tested enough on native windows and osx platforms. He asked if anyone on the list had either development environment and was willing to test it. Jaromil re-based his autotools branch against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. People are requested to test this by compiling and working on several systems such as ubuntu, fedora(?), mingw cross compile, osx. The link for jaromil's autotools branch can be found at https://github.com/jaromil/bitcoin/commits/autotools3. For Pieter, it worked on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui.</summary>
