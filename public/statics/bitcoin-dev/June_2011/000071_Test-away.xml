    <summary>The speaker has successfully compiled and run Steve-from-the-Forum's boost unit test skeleton code. They have created a src/test directory and users can use 'make -f makefile.unix test_bitcoin' to access it. The speaker welcomes more tests, including higher-level tests apart from the code unit tests. The speaker is also looking for a good QA test manager who is interested in bitcoin. They believe that funding can be arranged for someone to create a team to test bitcoin and pull requests. The speaker considers the lack of testing resources for core bitcoin a major weakness at present.</summary>
