    <summary>The author suggests that the DNS bootstrapping process for Bitcoin could be improved by publishing build instructions for a simple DNS server and a script to feed it with node data. This would allow anyone to host their own DNS server using something like djbdns or a similar zerigo API script. The author proposes hardcoding a number of these DNS seeds into the client to simplify the process. The author also suggests adding this code to Bitcoin in a contrib/dns folder as a way to further improve the process. Finally, the author expresses a willingness to run a DNS seed themselves.</summary>
