    <summary>Gavin Andresen, who was a former lead developer of Bitcoin, has recently shared his thoughts on what he thinks the short-term development priorities should be. Scaling-up issues, such as disconnections when downloading the block chain, is at the top of his list, followed by wallet security. Andresen also emphasized the need for a unit testing framework, stating that a good suite of test cases is critical and a PULL that had the start of boost unit tests is needed. Anything that slows these down will be ignored, even if it means leaving out new features like escrow transactions. Andresen asked if everyone agrees that these are the critical priorities, but discouraged discussion on HOW to do stuff, just WHAT the priorities should be.</summary>
