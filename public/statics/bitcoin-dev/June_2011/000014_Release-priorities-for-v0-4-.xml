    <summary>The issue of stolen wallets has been a growing concern, prompting calls for wallet crypto to be made a top priority in the next version. A proposal has been submitted on GitHub, with the suggestion that measures should be taken to improve wallet security. The author, Jeff Garzik of exMULTI, Inc., urges developers to begin implementing these changes. It remains to be seen how this issue will be addressed, but it is clear that it is an important one that needs to be tackled.</summary>
