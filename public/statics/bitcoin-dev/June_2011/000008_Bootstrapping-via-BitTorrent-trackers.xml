    <summary>In an email conversation, Christian Decker suggests the advantages of using HTTP requests for a tracker over keeping an IRC connection open at all times. One advantage is avoiding virus/botnet like behavior that automatically joins IRC channels with cryptic names, which can bother network admins. Another advantage is faster adaptation than DNS Seeds, which requires configuration changes on seed should the nodes become unreachable. However, Jeff Garzik points out that this is false, as a proper DNS seed actively samples the Bitcoin network for live nodes. While HTTP requests may provide better load balancing than DNS seeds, this is an invalid assumption based on overly simplistic sampling. Additionally, using HTTP requests would require additional code and do not have any advantage over DNS.</summary>
