    <summary>The discussion is about merging qt to improve the GUI of Bitcoin. It is mentioned that merging qt will enable real GUI improvements to be made sooner. While discussing the disadvantages, it is pointed out that another GUI would require cleanup of RPC/GUI code changes in three places instead of two, but since there are more people willing to work on qt code than on wx code, it should not be an issue. Luke-Jr notes that the Wallet protocol implementation does not need to touch the GUI code at all except when porting the GUI to use it and hence merging qt should not cause any harm if the code is already written. The email ends with a promotion for EditLive Enterprise - a content authoring tool.</summary>
