    <summary>In this context, the author announces the BitCoinSharp project by Nathan Baulch. The project is a complete port of BitCoinJ into C#, which opens up the world of Bitcoin to .NET developers. The code can be browsed on Google Code and Visual Studio SLN files are provided to help get started. The PingService example is suggested as a good starting point for reading. The author expresses hope that nearly all languages and platforms have been covered, allowing developers from various backgrounds and toolchains to write interesting Bitcoin apps.</summary>
