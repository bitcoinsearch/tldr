    <summary>John Smith, a member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list, is seeking information on including the autotools build system in his Qt GUI code. He believes that his code is ready for merging and has been using it for some time. Smith is curious about the current roadmap for including the build system to support multiple GUIs, and whether it will be included in version 0.4.0. Brendan Molloy, who responded to Smith's post, provides a link to EditLive Enterprise, which is a content authoring tool. Molloy also includes his contact information, which includes his phone number, Twitter handle, website, and email address.</summary>
