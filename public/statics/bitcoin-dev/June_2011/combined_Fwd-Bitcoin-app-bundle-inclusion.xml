    <summary>On June 27, 2011, Doug Huff reached out to Laszlo via email to inquire about the inclusion of his Info.plist and BitcoinAppIcon.icns files into the upstream source repository. The aim was to automate the osx build without the need for external source requirements. Huff sought clarity on whether the files were licensed under the MIT or any similar license. He also asked if it was possible for Laszlo to put them in the Public Domain or any other compatible license.Laszlo replied to the email expressing uncertainty about where the files belonged. He also stated that there wasn't a license attached to the files and that they were public domain.</summary>
