    <summary>Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn has raised concerns about the growing block sizes which could lead to scalability issues in flood control. During testing, he was disconnected due to surpassing the 10mb flood control limit, caused by an average of 20kb per block at 500 blocks. He suggests two solutions; increase the flood control limit or raise the limit and decrease the batch size. However, lowering the batch size to 100 or even 50 could slow chain download speed in high latency environments, which is already a bottleneck. Mike Hearn proposes using a pointer into the block chain file as an alternative to prevent an internal buffer memory explosion. But the current P2P code is not equipped to handle huge amounts of streaming data and needs further development to resolve this issue. The P2P code was not initially written to handle large downloads, according to Jeff Garzik, who agreed with Hearn's concerns. The author requests input on how to best address this issue with the growing block sizes and flood control limitations.</summary>
