    <summary>Bitcoin v0.3.23 has been released for Win32, Linux, and source, with MacOSX soon to follow. The update includes minor changes to the released files. The Linux tarball has been regenerated with a properly named directory inside, and a Win32 .zip archive has been added. Additionally, PGP-signed SHA1SUM.asc has also been added to SF. The updated checksums have been listed in the message, including the hash value of each file. Jeff Garzik, from exMULTI Inc., has signed off the message.The release is a quick bugfix to deal with the influx of new bitcoin users. The main changes include reduced timeout in the connect-to-node logic and a reduction in the minimum transaction fee for new transactions to 0.0005 BTC. The client will now relay transactions with fees as low as 0.0001 BTC. The network saw a huge influx of new users who do not permit incoming connections, so the P2P connect-to-node logic has been changed to more quickly hunt for useful P2P connections.Full git changelog includes updates to translation, adding common temp files to .gitignore and fixing CPU usage bugs. The priority for the next version is wallet encryption.</summary>
