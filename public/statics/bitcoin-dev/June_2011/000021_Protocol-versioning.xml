    <summary>In an email exchange on June 15, 2011, Jeff Garzik proposed several mini-proposals for the Satoshi Client - the original Bitcoin client - to better prepare the Bitcoin protocol for the long term. He suggested that the client needed a better nickname and called it "Mainline client" as a reference to the original Bittorrent client. However, Christian Decker suggested calling it the "Reference client" since it is the original reference implementation. Douglas Huff agreed with this proposal.</summary>
