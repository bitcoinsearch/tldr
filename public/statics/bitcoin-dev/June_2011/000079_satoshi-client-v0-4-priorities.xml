    <summary>In a conversation on IRC, Jeff Garzik opines that wallet crypto and wallet import/export are the two essential features that must be present in version 0.4 of a cryptocurrency wallet. He explains that wallet crypto is necessary for obvious reasons, while wallet import/export can aid further wallet security by allowing users to print out and store private keys in a bank's safety deposit box. Garzik notes that although autotools and other features may be important, they can wait if they hold up the release of wallet crypto.</summary>
