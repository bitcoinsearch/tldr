    <summary>In a discussion, Gavin presented a potential solution to reduce address length involving 3DUP ADD ADD HASH160 ...hash(pubkey1+2+3)... EQUALVERIFY 2 3 ROLL CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY. However, upon further consideration, he realized that this approach may not be feasible as it would require distributing each party's pubkey ahead of time. Failure to do so could result in the loss of pubkeys and an inability to provide hash(pubkey1+2+3) EQUALVERIFY. Gavin suggested that either the pubkeys or the hash160(pubkey)'s should be distributed ahead of time, rendering the reduction in address length moot. Bobby Groff was part of this discussion.</summary>
