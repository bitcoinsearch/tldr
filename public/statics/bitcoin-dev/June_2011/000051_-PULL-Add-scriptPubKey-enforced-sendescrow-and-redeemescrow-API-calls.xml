    <summary>A developer proposed a simpler contracts protocol than the one previously suggested and updated the Contracts wiki page to reflect this change. However, another developer pointed out that the implementation was too complicated and suggested using an output script of "2 3 CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY" instead. The proposed protocol allows for multiple parties to control Bitcoin escrow coins and reduces the trust required in many transaction use cases. Use cases include escrow without trusting the escrow agent with the coins, immediate payment, and funds locked with multi-party signatures. The pull request is open for feedback on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
