    <summary>A recent update has been made to the Bitcoin codebase, as it has been rebased onto a wallet class. This development has been recorded on GitHub through a pull request numbered 352. The author of the post, Matt, seems to be anticipating some criticism for this change, as he ends his message with a humorous prediction of "wtf is this crap" messages. The context does not provide any further details or explanations regarding the reasons behind the rebasing and what implications it might have for the Bitcoin network.</summary>
