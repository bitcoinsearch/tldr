    <summary>Christian Decker suggests using BitTorrent tracker bootstrapping as an alternative to IRC bootstrapping and hardcoded nodes. He believes that using trackers such as OpenBittorrent would provide the same advantages as using an IRC channel, making it harder for attackers to get bootstrapping clients to connect exclusively to their compromised clients. Jeff Garzik, on the other hand, argues that BitTorrent tracker bootstrapping offers few benefits over DNS seeding and could potentially create a vulnerable hot spot in the DHT due to Sybil attacks.</summary>
