    <summary>The speaker has recently compiled and executed Steve-from-the-Forum's boost unit test skeleton code successfully. They have established a src/test directory, which allows users to access the code by executing 'make -f makefile.unix test_bitcoin'. The speaker encourages the inclusion of additional tests, including higher-level ones in addition to the present code unit tests.Additionally, the speaker is seeking a skilled QA test manager who is interested in bitcoin. They believe that funding could be secured to establish a team for testing bitcoin and pull requests. At present, the speaker considers the lack of testing resources for core bitcoin to be a significant weakness.</summary>
