    <summary>The issue of stolen wallets has been a growing concern in cryptocurrency transactions, prompting calls for wallet crypto to be made a top priority in the next version. A proposal has been submitted on GitHub, with the suggestion that measures should be taken to improve wallet security. Jeff Garzik of exMULTI, Inc. has urged developers to begin implementing these changes. The email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Mark Visser discussed the possibility of allowing the wallet.dat location to be specified in preferences so that users could easily physically disconnect a wallet by unplugging a USB key. However, all databases must be in the datadir since wallet.dat is a Berkley db, which requires a transactional environment, making it difficult to move just one file. Ted suggested using a symlink instead. Additionally, he proposed the idea of allowing users to open more than one wallet to develop an intuition for the system. Currently, transferring coins from one wallet to another on the same installation is very awkward.Mark Visser suggested in an email on June 15, 2011, that the location of wallet.dat should be included in preferences. He proposed this feature so users could easily disconnect their wallet by unplugging a USB key. However, Jeff Garzik, the founder of exMULTI, explained that -datadir already served this purpose. The problem is that all databases must be in the datadir because wallet.dat is a berkeley db and requires a transactional environment. Consequently, it makes it difficult to move just one file. In a forum post, Mark suggests the inclusion of the option to specify the location of wallet.dat in preferences. He argues that it would be beneficial to easily disconnect a wallet by unplugging a USB key. The suggestion highlights the importance of security in cryptocurrency transactions. It is important for users to have control over their wallet and its location to prevent unauthorized access. Including such an option would allow users to take proactive measures towards securing their assets.</summary>
