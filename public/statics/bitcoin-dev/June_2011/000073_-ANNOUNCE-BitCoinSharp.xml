    <summary>On June 28, 2011, Laszlo Hanyecz requested the inclusion of a recent fix to join a random #bitcoinXX channel on IRC instead of #bitcoin. Mike Hearn announced the BitCoinSharp project by Nathan Baulch in an email on June 27, 2011. Nathan has done a complete port of BitCoinJ into C#, making it possible for .NET developers to create Bitcoin apps using their preferred toolchain. The code can be browsed on Google Code and Visual Studio SLN files are provided to help get started. Hearn hopes that this will enable everyone to write interesting Bitcoin apps regardless of background or platform. Additionally, the email includes a link to Splunk, which helps make sense of the valuable data generated in IT infrastructure.</summary>
