    <summary>The email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Mark Visser discussed the possibility of allowing the wallet.dat location to be specified in preferences, so that users could easily physically disconnect a wallet by unplugging a USB key. However, all databases must be in the datadir since wallet.dat is a Berkley db, which requires a transactional environment, making it difficult to move just one file. Ted suggested using a symlink instead. Additionally, he proposed the idea of allowing users to open more than one wallet to develop an intuition for the system. Currently, transferring coins from one wallet to another on the same installation is very awkward.</summary>
