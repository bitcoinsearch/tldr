    <summary>In June 2011, Pieter Wuille raised a concern about the disadvantage of adding another GUI in terms of the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code. He noted that it would require changes in three places instead of two and suggested that there were more people willing to work on Qt code than wx code. However, he acknowledged that the Wallet protocol implementation might not need to touch the GUI code at all unless porting the GUI to use it. Therefore, he saw no harm in merging the code if it was already written.</summary>
