    <summary>In a 2011 email from Gavin Andresen, he listed the short-term development priorities for Bitcoin. The first issue was scaling-up problems, such as disconnections when downloading the block chain. Second, he prioritized wallet security, which could be compromised by complex code that steals funds if the target is infected. Third, he identified the need for a unit testing framework and a suite of test cases. He stated that anything that slowed down these priorities would be ignored, including new features like escrow transactions.</summary>
