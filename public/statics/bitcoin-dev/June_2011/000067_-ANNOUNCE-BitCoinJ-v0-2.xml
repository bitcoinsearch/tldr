    <summary>On June 27, 2011, Mike Hearn announced BitCoinJ v0.2, which had over 100 commits since the first release in March. The new version includes full support for block chain re-orgs and recognition of dead transactions that will never be included in the chain. It also has persistence of the block chain using multiple pluggable stores, with a BoundedOverheadBlockStore suitable for mobile devices. Additionally, there is a much larger test suite, IRC, DNS, and seed list peer discovery, ASN.1 key export, many bugfixes, and minor API improvements. The release represents the work of many people, including Andreas Schildbach, Miron Cuperman, Gary Rowe, Thilo Planz, Micheal Swiggs, Noa Resare, John Sample, and Xiaofeng Guo. Google Switzerland GmbH sent the announcement through the Bitcoin development mailing list.</summary>
