    <summary>Bitcoin v0.3.23 has been released for Win32, Linux and source, with MacOSX soon to follow. The release is a quick bugfix to deal with the influx of new bitcoin users. The main changes include reduced timeout in the connect-to-node logic and a reduction in the minimum transaction fee for new transactions to 0.0005 BTC. The client will now relay transactions with fees as low as 0.0001 BTC. The network saw a huge influx of new users who do not permit incoming connections, so the P2P connect-to-node logic has been changed to more quickly hunt for useful P2P connections. Full git changelog includes updates to translation, adding common temp files to .gitignore and fixing CPU usage bugs. The priority for the next version is wallet encryption.</summary>
