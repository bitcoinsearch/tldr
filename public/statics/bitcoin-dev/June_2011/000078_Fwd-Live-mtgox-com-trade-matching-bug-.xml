    <summary>The Bitcoin-development mailing list is not for the discussion of Mt.Gox or other sites or software that uses bitcoin, according to Gavin Andresen in an email from Doug Huff. In response, Mike Hearn requested that Mt Gox-related content be kept off the development list as it was unrelated to core Bitcoin software. Doug Huff then forwarded an email detailing a live mtgox.com trading bug, which could be used to influence market conditions if it is only a display bug. He suggested either taking the site down until corrected, or publicly showing how the order would not execute.</summary>
