    <summary>In a discussion about using BitTorrent trackers to scale the handling of requests in bitcoin, Christian Decker suggested that HTTP based trackers would be sufficient for this purpose. He also noted that each bitcoin client contacting the tracker would make it difficult for an attacker to get bootstrapping clients to exclusively connect to compromised clients. Jeff Garzik questioned how clients would discover these HTTP trackers, noting that hardcoding them into the client or adding an additional bootstrap step would have the same problems as other current methods. He referred to the history and experience of gnutella's web caches versus UDP host caches as relevant to the discussion.</summary>
