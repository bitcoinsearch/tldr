    <summary>In a forum post, Mark suggests the inclusion of the option to specify the location of wallet.dat in preferences. He argues that it would be beneficial to easily disconnect a wallet by unplugging a USB key. The suggestion highlights the importance of security in cryptocurrency transactions. It is important for users to have control over their wallet and its location to prevent unauthorized access. Including such an option would allow users to take proactive measures towards securing their assets.</summary>
