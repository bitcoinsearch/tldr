    <summary>Mark, a developer, spent some time with the bitcoin-qt client and autotools on Mac. He made small changes in the qt client which builds and runs fine. However, he needs more time to work on Autotools + qt. Mark will push his changes to Github for others to take a look at it. Pieter Wuille, another developer, mentions on Bitcoin-development mailing list about merging autotools and qtgui. But he adds that autotools is not tested enough on native windows and OSX platforms. He requests anyone with these development environments and willingness to test it, to come forward. In conclusion, discussions were held between developers regarding bitcoin-qt client and autotools on different platforms. They aim to merge autotools and qtgui but need more testing before doing so.</summary>
