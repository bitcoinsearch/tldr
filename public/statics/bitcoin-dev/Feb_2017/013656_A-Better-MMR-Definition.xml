    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, G. Andrew Stone asked about the efficiency of lookups in an insertion-ordered TXO tree, since transactions' prevouts are not specified by block height, tx index, output index or TXO index. Bram Cohen replied that a lookup table from prevouts to TXO index is required, and that looking up things in a hashtable is relatively fast compared to a tree. However, Pieter Wuille clarified that the table need only be maintained by wallets or service providers for their own coins, rather than every full node and miner individually. In a committed TXO model, full nodes would maintain the TXO root hash, while every transaction/block would come with a proof that its inputs are in the TXO tree, as well as the necessary information to update the root after spending the inputs and adding the outputs.</summary>
