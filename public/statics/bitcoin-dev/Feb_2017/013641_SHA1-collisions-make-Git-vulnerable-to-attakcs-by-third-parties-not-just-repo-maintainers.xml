    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev discussion thread, Pieter Wuille has suggested that Bitcoin should move from 80-bit collision resistance (RIPEMD-160) to 128-bit collision resistance (SHA-256). In response to a query about alternatives to segwit, Pieter outlined the requirements for any alternative proposal. These include drafting a softfork proposal, implementation, testing, review of new address format, miner acceptance of new consensus rules, and wallets adopting the new address format. Pieter noted that most of these requirements are already done for segwit and any alternative would only apply to wallets that adopt it.</summary>
