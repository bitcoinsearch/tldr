    <summary>The failure to validate a softfork with majority hashrate could result in a single invalid block splitting the chain. This would cause the majority to continue building on that invalid block, which makes it similar to a hardfork. However, the default behavior of old nodes will be to follow the pre-softfork rules, thus making a softfork behave as if it were a hardfork if a malicious block is mined. Therefore, a minority-hashrate softfork requires more social support than the widespread agreement typical of softforks. Once it gets over 50% hashrate enforcement, however, the situation improves a lot more. A malicious block may split obsolete miners off the valid chain, but it will eventually resolve on its own given enough time. Due to natural fluctuations in block finding, automatic measurement may need to look for &gt;75%. The proposal suggests changing the flag day from 95% to 75% to reduce the hashrate requirement and improve the situation. If &gt;50% of miners are hostile to the network, there may be other problems.</summary>
