    <title>A Modified Version of Luke-jr's Block Size BIP</title>

    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a developer, stated that his BIP draft proposal did not make progress because the community opposes any block size increase hardfork ever. He also pointed out that another version of the proposal did not address the current block size issues, which he believes are too large. Andrew C, another developer, modified the proposal to begin the increase steps at the current 1000000 byte limit and calculated off of the MTP of the activation block instead of a fixed schedule from a fixed point in time. While there were still some issues with the modified proposal, it was hoped to be less controversial and allow for scaling Bitcoin. The full text of the proposal and implementation can be found on GitHub.</summary>
