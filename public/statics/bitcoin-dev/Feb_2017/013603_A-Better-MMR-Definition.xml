    <summary>In an email conversation, G. Andrew Stone asked if an insertion ordered MMR could allow for efficient nonexistence proof. When asked why he needed a non-existence proof, it was explained that an efficient spentness proof is already in place and sufficient for Bitcoin's needs. This solution is also more scalable. The conversation took place via email on February 23, 2017 and included a signature attachment.</summary>
