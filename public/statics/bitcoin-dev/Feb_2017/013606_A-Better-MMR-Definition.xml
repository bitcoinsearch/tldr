    <summary>The message thread is about the benefits of UTXO commitments, which enables actual proofs of non-fraud and lets users prove the validity of a block based on just the previous block. The major challenge for getting UTXO commitments in blocks is performance as the txo set is vastly larger and more unwieldy. However, Bram Cohen argues that with appropriate format and implementation tricks, it is possible to get performance good enough to no longer be a gating factor to deployment. Additionally, there is some discussion about whether or not a UTXO set commitment is the right approach to begin with. Furthermore, there is a discussion about Merkle Mountain Ranges (MMRs) and their redundancy with the actual blockchain history. However, there is no feedback about Peter Todd's implementation yet.</summary>
