    <summary>Proof-of-loss is a new consensus algorithm that aims to address the drawbacks of both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. According to the website, it resolves the issue of organic block size limit, risks of mining centralization, and the "nothing at stake" problem. The algorithm is explained in detail on the proof-of-loss.money website.</summary>
