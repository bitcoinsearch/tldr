    <summary>In an email conversation, Pieter Wuille explains to a participant that collision attacks are typical hash function breaks, while a preimage attack is required to reduce single-key address security. The participant thanks Pieter for the explanation and admits to having mistaken the type of attack needed, leading to a miscalculation in the unit operation. The correct number of times the operation would need to be performed is 2.9*10^42, not their original estimate of 2.4*10^18.</summary>
