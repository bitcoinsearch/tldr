    <summary>A recent poll showed that 10% of the Bitcoin community are never okay with a hardfork, which could be seen as a significant disenfranchisement and lack of consensus. However, if we split the poll into two groups: those who are okay with a hardfork at some point in the future and those who are not, there is 90% agreement that a hardfork is acceptable in the future. The question then becomes what threshold defines consensus - 98% or 100%? The author suggests that pursuing paths that maximize net social benefit in terms of cost surplus/burden is the best way to go since consensus is such an impossible thing to define, variable, case-by-case, and doesn't always lead to the best choice.</summary>
