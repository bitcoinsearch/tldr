    <summary>The proposed changes in the Bitcoin Cash network include relaxing the size limit of Header 2 and Header 3, which will allow expansion without a hardfork. However, firmware upgrades for all existing miners and light wallet upgrades will be required, but they are not expected to happen until at least two years after the initial activation of the hardfork. An experimental implementation of these proposals is available on GitHub, but it is still untested and not independently reviewed. It should not be used in production, although it may work fine on testnet. Some aspects of the proposals are still under development, such as automated testing, post-hardfork support for old light wallets, and wallet support for anti-tx-replay.Furthermore, a new transaction weight formula has been introduced to encourage responsible use of UTXO. The block size will grow linearly until a certain limit, and there is Sighash O(n^2) protection for legacy (non-segwit) outputs. It should be noted that there is no new p2p message to transmit secondary header and no full mining or mempool support yet. While the proposal may work fine on testnet, it should not be used in production until it has been fully tested and independently reviewed.</summary>
