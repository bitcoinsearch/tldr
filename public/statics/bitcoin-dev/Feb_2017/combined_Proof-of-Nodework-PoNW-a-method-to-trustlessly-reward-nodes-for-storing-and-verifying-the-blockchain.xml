    <summary>John Hardy proposed Proof of Nodework (PoNW) to incentivize individual nodes for keeping a full copy of and verifying the blockchain. The PoNW process requires a new separate area of block space called nodeblock, which is committed to a block like SegWit. To participate in PoNW, a node must register a Bitcoin address by submitting an addNode transaction along with a security deposit to prevent cheating. Nodes are punished if they broadcast more than one signed transaction per block. The PoNW runs in epochs of 2016 blocks, allowing extended windows for PoNW transactions to be added to nodeblocks to limit minor censorship. The share of reward that the node gets will be multiplied based on the number of blocks within an epoch that the node performs PoNW on. If a nodeWorkComplete transaction contains incorrect information, a challenge transaction can be created, and other nodes vote whether it is upheld or not. At the end of an epoch, the reward each node is due can be paid in a regular block, and the data involved in PoNW becomes obsolete and need not be retained forever.The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing the PoNW method mentions measures to prevent Sybil attacks. A registered address will be hashed with the block header of the block the node wants to work on, which determines precisely where within the blockchain to begin the PoNW. The losing node is punished by losing their accrued PoNW for that epoch and a percentage of their security deposit if a challenge transaction is upheld. The reward for nodes participating could come from the existing miner reward or a special new tx donation fee for nodes.Sergio Demian Lerner responded to John's proposal stating RSK platform, a Bitcoin sidechain, already prepared to do something similar to this. They set apart 1% of the block reward to automatically reward full nodes. They have two systems being evaluated: PoUBS (Proof of Unique Blockchain Storage) and traditional proof of retrievability, but it requires some ASIC-resistance assumptions. They designed a new type of transaction payload called Ephemeral Payload, to prevent blockchain bloat. The Lumino Network was also built using the same idea (Ephemeral Data).In addition to cryptocurrency development and security discussions, the context provides links to repositories for simplified Zcash and Bitcoin wallets, a dynamic blocklist for torrent downloads, a password list checker, anti-spy and private torrent resources, and information about node-Tor and GitHub. Peersm, mentioned twice in the context, appears to offer various resources related to privacy and security in the digital world.During each epoch of 2016 blocks, there will be an extended window for PoNW transactions to be added to nodeblocks to limit minor censorship. To prevent nodes from having multiple keys registered, the share of reward that the node gets will be multiplied based on the number of blocks within an epoch that the node performs PoNW on. Sergio Demian Lerner responded to John's proposal stating RSK platform (a Bitcoin sidechain) is already prepared to do something similar to this, although very efficiently. They set apart 1% of the block reward to automatically reward full nodes.They have two systems being evaluated: the first is based on PoUBS (Proof of Unique Blockchain Storage) which uses asymmetric-time operations to encode the blockchain based on each user public key such that decoding is fast, but encoding is slow. The second is more traditional proof of retrievability, but it requires some ASIC-resistance assumptions. They designed a very cool new type of transaction payload called Ephemeral Payload, to prevent blockchain bloat. The Lumino Network was also built using the same idea (Ephemeral Data).</summary>
