    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Pieter Wuille and Eric Voskuil debated whether or not a proposal was backward compatible. Voskuil argued that sending content that existing nodes do not expect is an incompatibility, whereas Wuille argued that using ignored messages for determining optional features is elegant and preferable to continued increments of the protocol version. Voskuil also raised concerns about potential denial-of-service attacks if a node is required to allow any message it cannot understand. He suggested that if the network were to abandon the version handshake and/or promote changes that break it, it should be written up as a BIP and solicited community feedback.</summary>
