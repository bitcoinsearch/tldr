    <title>A Modified Version of Luke-jr's Block Size BIP</title>

    <summary>During a discussion in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr claimed that the Bitcoin community opposes any block size increase hardfork ever. However, t. khan responded to this statement by pointing out that a poll conducted on strawpoll.me indicated that 63% of votes wanted a larger than 1 MB block by this summer, which shows the opposite of what Luke had claimed. Regarding the issue of blocks being too large, Luke argued that the full node count is far below the safe minimum of 85% of economic activity. On the other hand, t. khan said that the reason people stop running nodes is because there's no incentive to counteract the resource costs and that attempting to solve this by making blocks smaller would be like curing a disease by killing the patient.</summary>
