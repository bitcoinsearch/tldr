    <summary>On February 14th, 2017, Jonas Schnelli posted a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list highlighting a potential security vulnerability with Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients. According to Schnelli, using an SPV client could reveal a user's complete wallet content to any network observer between the user and the node they have connected to. This means that anyone from a coffee shop owner to ISPs could potentially correlate a user's wallet with their other internet behavior. The same is true for cellphone providers if cellular data is being used.Tom Zander responded to Schnelli's post, suggesting that trusted users be allowed to connect on a different, encrypted connection similar to RPC. However, this would be a different use case and connection than what is currently used for SPV clients. Zander has a blog and vlog where he discusses cryptocurrency and related topics.</summary>
