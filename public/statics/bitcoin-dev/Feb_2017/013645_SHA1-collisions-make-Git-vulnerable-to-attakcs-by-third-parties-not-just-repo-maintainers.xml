    <summary>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and an unknown sender, the topic of moving away from RIPEMD160 was discussed. The unknown sender suggested an alternative to using RIPEMD160 in Bitcoin transactions by reverting to OP_CHECKSIG or later versions. They expressed concerns about introducing new issues while getting away from the original problem. The use of RIPEMD160 was justified for its convenience and compactness.</summary>
