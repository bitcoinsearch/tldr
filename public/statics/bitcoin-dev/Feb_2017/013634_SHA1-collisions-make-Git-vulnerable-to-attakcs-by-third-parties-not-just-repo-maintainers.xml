    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, members debated whether or not 160-bit security was sufficient for collision resistance in Bitcoin. While some argued that RIPEMD-160 has 160-bit security against preimage attacks, others pointed out that it is not enough for more complex contracts like P2SH 2-of-2 multisig. In this scenario, one party could generate a collision between their second key and another 2-of-2 multisig where they control both keys. Despite these concerns, some argued that pay-to-pubkey-hash remains perfectly secure. Peter Todd, a contributor to the mailing list, reminded members that he was aware of the issue and had even posted a commit-reveal mitigation in the past.</summary>
