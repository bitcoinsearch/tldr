    <summary>In an email conversation between two individuals, Peter Todd corrects a misunderstanding of TXO commitments. He explains that committing to the state of all transaction outputs can provide a method of compactly proving the current state of an output. However, he notes that the proposal on the page requires random access updates and positions entries in the order they were added instead of sorting by their hash. This results in the same issues of TXO size and cache coherence on updates as with a basic data structure.</summary>
