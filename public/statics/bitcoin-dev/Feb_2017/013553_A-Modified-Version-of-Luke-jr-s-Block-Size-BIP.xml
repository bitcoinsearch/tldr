    <summary>The bitcoin community is divided on the issue of block size increase. A poll conducted shows that 63% of votes want a larger than 1 MB block by this summer. However, Luke Dashjr believes that full node count is far below the safe minimum of 85% of economic activity due to high resource requirements caused by large block sizes. T. Khan suggests that incentivizing full node operation would fix the problem instead of making blocks smaller. On the other hand, Alp Alp argues that by stifling the network to please a tiny minority is daft and 10% who say never to block size increase seems like a significant disenfranchisement and lack of consensus. The debate continues in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
