    <summary>Peter Todd has released a full-RBF patched branch of Bitcoin Core v0.14.0rc1 which is available on his GitHub account. This version uses the nRelevantServices machinery to do preferential peering, and it requires only a few lines of code changes between it and Bitcoin Core v0.14.0rc1. The relevant services machinery is less aggressive at connecting to full-RBF peers than the earlier custom code used in previous versions. It works well enough to keep RBF peers connected to each other, making maintaining the patched branch easy each time a new upstream version is released.</summary>
