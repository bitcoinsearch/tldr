    <summary>The strength of SHA1 algorithm is not enough for collision resistance, according to a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. However, the algorithm is not considered insecure because it uses 160 bits; rather, its vulnerabilities are due to other factors. Despite the concerns raised in this discussion, pay-to-pubkey-hash remains secure. Even if someone generates two pubkeys with the same RIPEMD160(SHA256()) digest, the Bitcoin network itself will not be affected. Multisig use-cases, however, may require more than 160-bit security level. Segwit, which provides a 128-bit security level against collision attacks, will introduce a 256-bit native P2WSH.</summary>
