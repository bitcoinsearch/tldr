    <summary>On February 23, 2017, Peter Todd and another individual discussed the potential to extract a compact proof from a Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MMR) that a given output is unspent. The other individual agreed with Todd's logic on how updates are done, but also pointed out that compact proofs can also be performed in a UTXO commitment. Additionally, the individual stated that there isn't any performance advantage to using MMRs over UTXO commitments, as MMRs add complexity without added benefits.</summary>
