    <summary>The bitcoin-dev community is discussing the possibility of implementing a cryptographic data structure that improves on delayed TXO commitments by using lazy hashing. The proposed data structure would substitute commitments for pointers, allowing for the combination of a cryptographic data structure and a standard pointer-based data structure. The main challenge lies in how to handle the proofs, as the level of verification possible depends on what digests a given node has calculated. This approach only works for data structures where the overall structure of the tree does not change as nodes are added and updated.</summary>
