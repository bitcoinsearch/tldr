    <summary>In a discussion about contentious changes in the Bitcoin voting system, Staf Verhaegen brought up the issue of DRM as an example. Chris Priest had suggested that once blocksize arguments were solved, there would be no more contentious issues for the system to deal with. However, Verhaegen pointed out that the DRM debate was also a political disagreement rather than a technical one. The W3C has been embroiled in a heated argument over whether to include DRM in web standards, with some arguing that it would undermine user privacy and security. This highlights the fact that not all disagreements in tech are purely technical, and that political factors can play a significant role in shaping industry standards.</summary>
