    <summary>In an email conversation between Steve Davis and Pieter Wuille on February 25, 2017, they discussed alternatives to RIPEMD160. Pieter mentioned the need for any alternative to avoid the use of the 160-bit hash function. Steve then suggested reverting to [, OP_CHECKSIG] as an alternative. However, Pieter clarified that this alternative would not address the issue in multisig P2SH addresses, where the 80-bit collision attack applies. He stated that for single-key addresses, preimage security is relied upon, and RIPEMD160 provides 160 bit security, which is more than what ECDSA signatures offer.</summary>
