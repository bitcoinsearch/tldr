    <summary>Bitcoin Knots has made their Release candidate 1 of a new major release, version 0.14.0 available for download. This new version includes new features, bugfixes and performance improvements. The preliminary release notes for the release are available on GitHub under the signed tag, where users can also find source code. Users should take care to verify the PGP signature of all downloads, which can be found on the official website. Release candidates are test versions for releases and if no critical problems are found, this release candidate will be tagged as 0.14.0 final, otherwise a new rc will be made available after these are solved.
