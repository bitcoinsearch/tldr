    <title>A Modified Version of Luke-jr's Block Size BIP</title>

    <summary>A proposed block size BIP by Luke-jr has been met with opposition from the bitcoin community, leading to a modified proposal from Andrew C. The main issue with Luke-jr's proposal was the decrease in size that would occur if it were activated before 2024. Andrew's modified proposal instead begins the increase steps at the current 1,000,000 byte limit and changes the deployment schedule to be calculated off of the MTP of the activation block. However, Luke-jr has expressed discontent with Andrew's version, stating that it does not address the current block size issues and that it is exclusively a hardfork, making no sense to keep the BIP 9 deployment at all. Despite these concerns, Andrew hopes that his proposal will be less controversial and allow for progress towards scaling Bitcoin. Both the full text of the proposal and its implementation can be found on Github.</summary>
