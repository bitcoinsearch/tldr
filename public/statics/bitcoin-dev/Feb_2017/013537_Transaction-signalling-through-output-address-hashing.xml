    <summary>In a recent post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, John Hardy proposed a possible solution to the issue of only miners being able to signal support for changes to Bitcoin through BIP9. He noted that the rest of the community is not able to participate in consensus and other methods of assessing community support are easily manipulated through Sybil. Hardy suggested that community support could be signaled through transactions without requiring a hard fork or increasing the size of transactions at all. His solution was inspired by hashcash and vanity addresses. However, he acknowledged that existing and normal transactions could collide with these schemes, and most wallets have no straightforward way of supporting it. Censorship by miners was also identified as a problem.</summary>
