    <summary>This thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has gone off-topic and is being redirected to another forum/list, such as bitcoin-discuss. The bitcoin-dev posting guidelines are reposted, which state that posts must concern development of the bitcoin protocol, be technical or academic in nature, and generally encouraged topics include patches, notification of pull requests, BIP proposals, academic paper announcements, and discussions that follow. Generally discouraged topics include shower thoughts, wild speculation, jokes, non-technical bitcoin issues, rehashing settled topics without new data, and moderation concerns. Detailed patch discussions are generally better on a GitHub PR, and meta-discussion is better on bitcoin-discuss.The conversation on the thread is regarding whether a small dissenting minority can block forward progress for bitcoin. One user argues that if this were the case, then bitcoin would no longer be interesting and that a small minority should not be able to hold back progress. Another user states that bitcoin relies on a strictly held consensus mechanism and should not change on the whims of the majority. They argue that participation in the system is voluntary, and individuals are free to leave at any time.The conversation also touches on the 1MB cap implemented in bitcoin and whether it was stated specifically that it could be increased when needed. One user argues that when the 1MB cap was implemented, it was stated that it could be increased when needed, and the white paper talks about scaling to huge capacity. Another user responds that the community has not agreed that an increase is needed at this time and that the unstable state without a backlog or subsidy has been learned since the publication of the initial white paper. Finally, the discussion mentions a poll showing that 63% of votes want a larger than 1 MB block by this summer and questions how the community can oppose any block increase ever when the majority supports increasing the block size.</summary>
