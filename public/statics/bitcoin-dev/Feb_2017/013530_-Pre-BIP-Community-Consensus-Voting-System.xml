    <summary>A proposal for a Community Consensus Voting System (CCVS) has been put forward in order to measure support for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. The CCVS would allow the general public, miners, companies using Bitcoin and developers to vote for their preferred BIP in a way that's public and relatively difficult (expensive) to manipulate. Each competing BIP will be assigned a unique bitcoin address which is added to each header. Anyone who wanted to vote would cast their ballot by sending a small amount (0.0001 btc) to their preferred BIP's address. Each transaction counts as 1 vote. Confirmed Vote Multiplier allows mining pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10,000x a regular vote. In addition to this, the proposed voting system answers several questions such as how does a company make its vote? Someone at the company sends a very small transaction to the BIP's vote address. Someone at the company then posts what the vote was and its transaction ID on the company's blog/twitter, etc., and then emails the URL to the administrator. They post it on their company blog.</summary>
