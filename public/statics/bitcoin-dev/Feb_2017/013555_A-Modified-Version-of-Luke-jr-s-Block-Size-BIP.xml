    <summary>The context of the conversation is about making a choice, and how doing nothing is still considered a choice. In this case, 10% of people supported increasing the 21M coin cap, but 63% were against it. This sparked a discussion about whether or not to please a small minority without reaching 100% agreement, and whether or not this lack of consensus was significant. The conversation also touched on the issue of block size, with one person stating that the reason people stop running nodes is due to the high resource requirements caused by the block size. However, another person argued that attempting to solve this by making blocks smaller is like curing a disease by killing the patient, and instead suggested incentivizing full node operation as a solution. Ultimately, the conversation shows a debate between different viewpoints and solutions regarding issues within the bitcoin community.</summary>
