    <summary>Peter Todd and Eric Lombrozo discussed the usefulness of communicating the UTXO, with Praxeology suggesting the use of commitments to get miners to verify the UTXO. Praxeology wrote a detailed write-up called "Synchronization Checkpoints" on Github, which outlines his idea. He proposes that miners put a commitment at the current Checkpoint Block that would be a hash of the full state of the UTXO at the previous Checkpoint Block. He notes that blocks are like "incremental diffs" to the UTXO state. To make this work with high performance, he suggests maintaining a DB table for sorting the UTXO, waiting for no forks blocks after a CheckPoint Block is made, populating a new UTXO Checkpoint File, and Merkle tree or bittorrent style hashing the UTXO Checkpoint File.</summary>
