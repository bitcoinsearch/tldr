    <title>A Modified Version of Luke-jr's Block Size BIP</title>

    <summary>On February 6, 2017, Luke Dashjr received an email asking how he knew the community opposed any block size increase hard fork ever. He replied with a link to a strawpoll which showed that 63% of voters want larger than 1 MB blocks by summer. The original emailer questioned how he could conclude that the community opposes such an increase when the poll indicates the opposite. When asked why he thinks blocks are too large, Luke cited that the full node count is below the safe minimum of 85% of economic activity. When people don't use full nodes, it's typically due to high resource requirements caused by the block size. He believes that attempting to solve this problem by making blocks smaller is like killing the patient to cure a disease.</summary>
