    <summary>In an email exchange between Bram Cohen and Peter Todd, the two discussed extracting a compact proof from a MMR that a given output is unspent. After some back and forth, they agreed that it was possible to do this in a UTXO commitment as well. However, Todd questioned whether Cohen's UTXO commitments scheme requires random access, and asked about the ordering of the values in the set. Todd specifically asked what exact values Cohen proposed to be in the set.</summary>
