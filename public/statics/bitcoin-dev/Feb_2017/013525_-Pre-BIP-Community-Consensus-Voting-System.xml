    <summary>The Community Consensus Voting System (CCVS) is a proposed process for measuring support for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) prior to implementation. Currently, there is no way of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol which leads to many proposed solutions but no clear direction. The CCVS aims to allow the general public, miners, companies using Bitcoin, and developers to vote for their preferred BIP in a way thatâ€™s public and relatively difficult to manipulate. Each competing BIP will be assigned a unique bitcoin address which is added to each header; anyone wanting to vote would cast their ballot by sending a small amount (0.0001 btc) to their preferred BIP's address. Confirmed Vote Multiplier is also introduced to give a larger voice to organizations and people who will have to implement whatever BIP the community prefers. It will also negate the effect of anyone trying to skew the results by voting repeatedly. Mining Pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each. A confirmed vote is worth 10,000x a regular vote. Confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. Voting would run for a pre-defined period, ending when a particular block number is mined. The CCVS will allow developers to measure support for BIPs before implementing them and will provide a means of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. However, the issue of node voting has not been resolved yet. Although it would be desirable for any full node running an up-to-date blockchain to be able to vote with a multiplier (e.g. 100x), it is outside the scope of this BIP.</summary>
