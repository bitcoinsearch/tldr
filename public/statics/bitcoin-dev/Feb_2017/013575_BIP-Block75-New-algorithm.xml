    <summary>The context discusses the control of miners over the limit, which can be increased by making blocks of any size. The proposal to raise the limit further can be triggered with this feature. However, increasing the blocksize might lead to centralization of the network and loss of transaction fees. Although there might be a long-term incentive to increase the blocksize, it comes with a cost. Miners have to plan for the short term as well, which makes it irrational for them to spam their blocks with their own transactions or low fee transactions to increase the blocksize limit.</summary>
