    <summary>The paper on block-chaining odds formula had an error on page 5, which made the formula confusing. The error was in the text, not in the formula, and assumed the affected route as always being the rewarded one, which is false. A corrected version of the paper is available at the same URL as before. However, downloading it will require clearing the browser's cache. The new file was updated on 02/07/2017. The author requests feedback on the corrected version through email to avoid overloading the list with something not directly related to Bitcoin.</summary>
