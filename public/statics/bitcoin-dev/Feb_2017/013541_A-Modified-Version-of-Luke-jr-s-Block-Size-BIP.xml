    <summary>Luke Dashjr's BIP draft that proposed a decrease in block size faced opposition from the community, as people are more opposed to a hard fork when there is a comparable soft fork available. However, many users feel that the block size is too small and would favor an increase over 1 MB sooner or if it never even decreased in the first place. The decrease was intended to slow down blockchain growth, but the blockchain is already over 100 GB, and decreasing the block size will not make it any smaller or easier to run a full node. ISPs are also implementing data and bandwidth caps, making it unlikely for users to start up new full nodes regardless of changes made. Andrew C modified Luke-jr's proposal to begin the increase steps at the current 1000000 byte limit and calculate increases off of the MTP of the activation block instead of a fixed schedule from a fixed point in time. This proposal aims to be less controversial and to allow Bitcoin to move forward with scaling.</summary>
