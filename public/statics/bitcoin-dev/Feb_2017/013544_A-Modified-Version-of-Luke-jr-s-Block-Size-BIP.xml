    <title>A Modified Version of Luke-jr's Block Size BIP</title>

    <summary>After looking at discussions on Reddit and Bitcointalk, it appears that the majority of users favor SegWit as a block size increase. Many users disagreed with Luke-Jr's proposal to decrease the block size and ridiculed that aspect of the proposal. Some users argue that the block size is too small and decreasing it will not facilitate full node creation since users are still unlikely to start new nodes due to data and bandwidth caps implemented by ISPs. Andrew C modified Luke-Jr's proposal to begin the increase steps at the current 1 MB limit instead of 300,000 bytes and calculate increases off the MTP of the activation block. While this proposal shares many of the same issues with the original proposal, he hopes it will be slightly less controversial and allow for scaling Bitcoin.</summary>
