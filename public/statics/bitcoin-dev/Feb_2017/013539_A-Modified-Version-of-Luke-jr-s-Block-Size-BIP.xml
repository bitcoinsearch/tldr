    <title>A Modified Version of Luke-jr's Block Size BIP</title>

    <summary>There have been objections raised against Luke-jr's proposed block size BIP due to the decrease in size that would occur prior to 2024. To address this, Andrew has modified the proposal to begin the increase steps at the current 1000000 byte limit instead of 300000 bytes. The time span of each increase remains the same and will be calculated off of the MTP of the activation block, rather than a fixed schedule from a fixed point in time. While this proposal shares some issues with the previous one, Andrew hopes that it will be less controversial and allow for progress in scaling Bitcoin. The full text of the proposal can be found at the provided GitHub link, along with Andrew's implementation of it.</summary>
