    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and another individual, they discuss the technical details of UTXO commitments, a scheme that requires random access. The ordering of the merkelized set is by the bits in the hash, which technically refers to a Patricia Trie. The values in the set are unspecified in the implementation, but take a 256 bit value that is presumably a hash of something. The intention is to nail down a simple format and demonstrate good performance while leaving the semantics to a higher layer. The simplest thing would be to hash together the txid and output number.</summary>
