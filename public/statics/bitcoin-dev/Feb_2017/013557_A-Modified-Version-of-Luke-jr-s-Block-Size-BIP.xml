    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrew Johnson argued that it is impossible to reach 100% consensus and only the majority needs to consent, depending on the context. Alp alp pointed out that rules were agreed upon and would require nearly everyone's consent to change. Andrew countered that doing nothing is also a choice, and asked if one would seriously consider increasing the 21M coin cap if only 10% supported it while 63% were against. Alp alp disagreed, saying that 10% is not a tiny minority. Luke Dashjr had previously posted a poll where 63% voted in favor of larger than 1 MB blocks by the summer. However, t. khan questioned how this translated into the community opposing any block increase ever. The discussion also touched on the issue of full node count being below the safe minimum of 85% of economic activity due to high resource requirements caused by the block size, with some suggesting incentivizing full node operation instead of making blocks smaller.</summary>
