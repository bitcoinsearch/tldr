    <summary>In a message to Pieter Wuille via Bitcoin-dev, Steve Davis expressed his concerns about the less appealing aspects of segwit, stating that it would take too long to reach critical mass. He then suggested that there might be alternative approaches worth exploring. However, Wuille pointed out that any alternative approach would require significant work, including drafting a softfork proposal, implementation, testing, review, and adoption by miners and wallets. This process would be similar to what has already been done for segwit, which is why it remains the most viable option.</summary>
