    <summary>Bitcoin developer Peter Todd has proposed the implementation of a TXO commitment scheme that would allow full nodes with limited storage space to keep track of a TXO commitment and prune older UTXOs from it that are unlikely to be spent. The scheme could solve the UTXO bloat problem by allowing a data set to be securely provided by an untrusted third party, which would enable the data itself to be discarded. Todd argues that a snapshot with an attestation from known individuals that you trust is a better security model than having miners attest to validity.Todd suggests that TXO commitments do not necessarily need to be implemented as a consensus protocol change, and can be useful without miners committing to the TXO commitment itself. He proposes a deployment plan for implementing a TXO commitment scheme, which includes adding P2P support for advertising to peers what parts of the TXO set have been pruned, and producing, consuming, and updating TXO unspentness proofs as part of transaction and block relaying.The bitcoin-dev community is discussing the possibility of implementing a cryptographic data structure that improves on delayed TXO commitments by using lazy hashing. The proposed data structure would substitute commitments for pointers, allowing for the combination of a cryptographic data structure and a standard pointer-based data structure. However, the main challenge lies in how to handle the proofs, as the level of verification possible depends on what digests a given node has calculated. This approach only works for data structures where the overall structure of the tree does not change as nodes are added and updated.In addition, someone in the discussion pointed out that TXO commitments can be useful without the need for a consensus protocol change. The link to a forum thread from 2013 was provided as evidence. Furthermore, Alex Mizrahi emphasized the importance of clear explanations and analogies when proposing complex ideas. Todd had previously discussed the idea of a distributed file system in 2013 but his explanation may have missed some people due to its reference to a DHT. This highlights the significance of clear explanations and analogies in discussions regarding blockchain technology.Overall, these discussions have potential implications for the implementation of TXO commitments in blockchain technology. A TXO commitment scheme could solve the UTXO bloat problem and enable full nodes with limited storage space to keep track of a TXO commitment. The proposed cryptographic data structure that improves on delayed TXO commitments by using lazy hashing could also provide a better solution. However, challenges remain in how to handle the proofs, and clear explanations and analogies are crucial in proposing complex ideas.</summary>
