    <summary>A proposed Community Consensus Voting System (CCVS) will allow developers to measure support for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) prior to implementation. The system assigns a unique bitcoin address to each competing BIP that is added to each header, with anyone who wanted to vote casting their ballot by sending 0.0001 BTC to their preferred BIP's address, with each transaction counting as one vote. Mining pools, companies using Bitcoin and Core maintainers/contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each, worth 10,000 times a regular vote. In the final tally, confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. The voting would run for a pre-defined period, ending when a particular block number is mined. There have been no other contentious issues in the past three years not related to blocksize/scaling, with other protocols like TCP/IP and HTTP having developers arguing over issues that no one can agree on. Questions were raised about CCVS, including who decides which companies are eligible, if there is some kind of centralized database to register, who administers it, what stops someone from creating a million fake companies to sway the voting, how does a company make its vote and how to verify that the person voting on behalf of a company is actually the correct person. It was noted that confirmed votes give a larger voice to organisations and the people who will have to implement whatever BIP the community prefers, while negating the effect of anyone trying to skew the results by voting repeatedly.</summary>
