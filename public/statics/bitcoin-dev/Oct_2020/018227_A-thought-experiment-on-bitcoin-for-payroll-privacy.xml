    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a contributor on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, responded to Mr. Lee's comment about not being able to front up funds for inbound balance without consuming all of his treasury. ZmnSCPxj explained that it is essential to have enough funds available to pay employees' salaries because if you don't, your business will fail. In terms of topology, even with just one employee, it is possible to make Lightning Network work. ZmnSCPxj provided an example of a company with only one big channel with the network and showed how to use offchain-to-onchain swap services like Boltz or Loop to put money on-chain and create a new channel to pay the salary promised to the employee. He further explained that as the business operates, more money will be received in the to-network big channel, which can be used to pay employees. Therefore, it is unnecessary to lock up all your funds since you only need to keep enough in your channels to cover continuous operational expenses, including employee salaries. Finally, he stated that this method would work regardless of whether the company has one employee or one million.</summary>
