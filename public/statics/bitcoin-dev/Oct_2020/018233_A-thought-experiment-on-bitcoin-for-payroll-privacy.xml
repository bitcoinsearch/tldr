    <summary>The proposal of always publishing all channels is argued against by ZmnSCPxj as it could reveal the size of channel between a cut-throat company and an employee, leading to disclosure of the bi-weekly salary of that employee. However, there are proposals that obscure the short-channel-ids in routehints which can be used for both published and unpublished channels. The destination node ID is never explicitly put in the onion, and is only implied by the short-channel-id to save space. The feerate settings in the invoice remain identifiable even if the company node gives different feerates per channel. To obscure which channel is actually referred to in the invoice, the receiver node can give a small random increase in feerate which overpays the company node but obscures the channel in the invoice.</summary>
