    <summary>The email conversation between Chris and ZmnSCPxj discusses the incentives against post-coinswap-theft-attempt, which still work even if K=0. The extra miner fee paid by Bob could act as a disincentive for theft. A difference in the v2 protocol is that each CoinSwap party knows a different version of the contract transactions, so the taker Alice always knows which maker broadcasted certain set of contract transactions. This gives Alice the ability to ban the correct fidelity bond. ZmnSCPxj appreciates this observation and will think more about it.</summary>
