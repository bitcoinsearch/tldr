    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, David A. Harding expressed his preference for using the backwards compatible proposal from BIPs PR#945 instead of going through the process of creating a new proposal. He suggests that if they want to maximize safety, consensus should restrict v1 witness program size by rejecting transactions with scriptPubKeys paying v1 witness programs that aren't exactly 32 bytes. Harding acknowledges that adding some kind of relay policy rule would be easier than a consensus rule and may be effective enough. However, he does not endorse any one proposal over another. Looking ahead to the implementation of segwit v2, Harding hopes that most software will have implemented length limits by then, thus eliminating the need for additional consensus restrictions.</summary>
