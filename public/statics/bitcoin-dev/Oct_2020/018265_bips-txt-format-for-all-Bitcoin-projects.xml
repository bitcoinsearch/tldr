    <summary>A request has been made to all Bitcoin projects to create a file 'bips.txt' that describes all the BIPs used in the project. The file can be uploaded to the root of the website used for the project and should have a specified format. This will make it easier for users, developers, journalists, researchers, and crawlers to understand all BIPs used in different Bitcoin projects, their implementation, and importance. Although all BIPs with details are already mentioned on GitHub, not all developers or users may understand their importance and usage. Therefore, an attempt is being made to create a BIPs gallery which has basic images for each BIP right now and later will include a page to have video links, usage, issues, history, other helpful links, etc. A discussion regarding this was initiated on stackexchange and the website where this work is being carried out is https://bips.gallery/. The Github repository for it is https://github.com/prayank23/BIPsGallery.</summary>
