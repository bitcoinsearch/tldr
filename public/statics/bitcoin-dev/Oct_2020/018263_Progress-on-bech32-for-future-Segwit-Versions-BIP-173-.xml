    <summary>In a recent post on bitcoin-dev, Mike Schmidt expressed his willingness to re-test services listed by Harding for v1 send support. He also invited suggestions for testing additional services that would be valuable. However, he expressed disappointment at not being able to ask Bitcoin Twitter to send tips to Pieter. Rusty, on the other hand, wants to hear from services that currently support v1+ and whether they prefer option 1 or 2. The post ends with Rusty signing off with cheers.</summary>
