    <summary>In an email exchange on October 20, 2020 at 3:29 AM, David A. Harding and Pieter discussed the possibility that previously failed or stuck Bitcoin transactions might have been successful if the backend infrastructure had upgraded to Bitcoin Core version 0.19 or higher. They both agreed that it would be beneficial to retest these transactions, given that over a year had passed since the release of version 0.19. The exact context and background of their discussion is unknown.</summary>
