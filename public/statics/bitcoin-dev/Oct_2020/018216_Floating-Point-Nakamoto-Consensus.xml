    <summary>The context of the conversation is a discussion about an exploit condition in Bitcoin's network. The person referred to as Mike had previously insulted the speaker, but this time, he presented his argument without being unnecessarily inflammatory. The speaker also strongly prefers discussing the matter openly on the mailing list. Mike discussed a threat model where nodes are unable to form new connections unless allowed by the attacker. The speaker argues that Mike's solution fails because it is based on too many conditions that are highly unlikely to occur. The topic of the discussion is an exploitable condition, and Mike's three-block plan does not add up. He claimed that he wrote the exploit before writing the paper, and it was reported ethically. Argument screens authority, so even if Mike claims to have more CVEs, argument must still be weighed more highly. Overall, leaving things alone is generally more important in Bitcoin since change is always a risk.</summary>
