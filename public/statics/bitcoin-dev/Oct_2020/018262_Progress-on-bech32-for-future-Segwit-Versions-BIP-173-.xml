    <summary>In a discussion about the original intent of code related to the `param` system, ZmnSCPxj claims that he believes the code in question was actually his and later refactored by John Barboza. The code was intended as a precaution against creating non-standard transaction and not as an assumption that future versions should be invalid. The idea behind the code was that further `else if` branches would be added for newer witness versions and whatever length restrictions they may have. The author notes that this was mentioned due to it being a common misconception. The intention behind the code was that application's segwit code would not have to be reworked for future upgrades, but this information failed to propagate properly. Despite this, the lack of forward compatibility is now seen as a feature given the overly strict standardness rules, the overflow bug, and proposed validation changes. Rusty thanks the author for the clarification.</summary>
