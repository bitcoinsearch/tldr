    <summary>In an email exchange, Larry Ruane introduced his open-source POW network mining simulator which simulates Bitcoin's existing POW and could be modified to correspond to variations. Mike then suggests a mechanism to eradicate dissent by actively pinging nodes that are running a weaker block to inform them of the new block. Larry's project received praise from Mike who plans to provide a PR. The GitHub link for Larry's project is provided in the email.</summary>
