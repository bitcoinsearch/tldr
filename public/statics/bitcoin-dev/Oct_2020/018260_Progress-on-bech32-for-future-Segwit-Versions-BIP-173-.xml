    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, David A. Harding suggested re-testing services listed by Mike for v1 send support next week. Pieter Wuille agreed that it would be good to re-test them since a year has passed since the 0.19.0 release. Wuille also welcomed suggestions of additional services that would be valuable to test. The discussion revolved around potential upgrades to the backend infrastructure and how they might affect previously failed or stuck transactions. The email thread included links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and the linuxfoundation.org website, as well as an HTML attachment that was scrubbed.</summary>
