    <summary>In an email sent on October 7, 2020, Mike Brooks revealed that the idea for FPNC came about after a conversation with ZmnSCPxj regarding re-org stability. The proposed blockchain pointers with the PubRef opcode raised concerns around re-orgs, prompting ZmnSCPxj to explain the issue in detail. After discussing with ZmnSCPxj and Greg Maxwell, it was agreed that the current problems facing the network outweigh any theoretical ones. However, Pieter Wuille chimed in to clarify that the discussion was mostly centered around a DoS attack report that turned out to be a mistake.</summary>
