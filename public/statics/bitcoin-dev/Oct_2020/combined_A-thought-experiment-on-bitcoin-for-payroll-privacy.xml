    <summary>Cut Throat Industries is a box cutter testing company that pays its 120 employees biweekly Fridays using a single transaction with the company's treasury as input and each employee payroll as output. The company wants to use Bitcoin with privacy to eliminate transparency, but the Lightning Network is not an option due to insufficient inbound liquidity of employees.ZmnSCPxj discusses the issue of inbound liquidity on the Lightning Network and suggests that companies can open a channel with each employee who has insufficient inbound liquidity or use offchain-to-onchain swaps to create a fresh channel to the new hire. Employees' occasional bonus and permanent raises can be accommodated by increasing the size of the channel or using alternative methods to free up capacity. ZmnSCPxj warns against permanently increasing the size of the channel with an employee in exchange for a permanent raise as it could lead to disclosure of the bi-weekly salary of that employee. He argues that as an employee gets promoted and pulls a larger salary, the channel with the company becomes less of an indicator of their actual salary. Additionally, he suggests that the size of all channels is not an accurate indicator of an employee's salary, as they may have other sources of income or share a family node with their spouse(s).In terms of topology, ZmnSCPxj explains that even with just one employee, it is possible to make Lightning Network work. He provides an example of how to use offchain-to-onchain swap services to put money on-chain and create a new channel to pay the salary promised to the employee. Therefore, it is unnecessary to lock up all your funds since you only need to keep enough in your channels to cover continuous operational expenses, including employee salaries. As the business operates, more money will be received in the to-network big channel, which can be used to pay employees.The proposal of always publishing all channels is argued against by ZmnSCPxj as it could reveal the size of channel between a cut-throat company and an employee, leading to disclosure of the bi-weekly salary of that employee. However, there are proposals that obscure the short-channel-ids in routehints which can be used for both published and unpublished channels. The feerate settings in the invoice remain identifiable even if the company node gives different feerates per channel. To obscure which channel is actually referred to in the invoice, the receiver node can give a small random increase in feerate which overpays the company node but obscures the channel in the invoice.ZmnSCPxj also emphasized that it is essential to have enough funds available to pay employees' salaries because if a company doesn't, the business will fail. If a company wants to hire another employee, it would only do that if business is booming or if it has accumulated enough money in its treasury to justify hiring another employee. This scenario would work regardless of whether a company has one employee or one million.</summary>
