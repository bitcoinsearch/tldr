    <summary>The proposer of a minor change to BIP-0002 has suggested changing the current 3-year-rule to allow anyone to change the status of a BIP to "Deferred" instead of "Rejected". The current rule already has ambiguous meaning with "hard" and "soft" rejects. The proposal aims to disambiguate the second option into "deferred" or add a new status of "Inactive". The BIP editor will not unreasonably reject a BIP and can reject it for reasons such as duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility, or not in keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy. A BIP may be changed from Draft or Proposed status to Rejected status upon request by any person if they have not made progress in three years. However, such a BIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph.</summary>
