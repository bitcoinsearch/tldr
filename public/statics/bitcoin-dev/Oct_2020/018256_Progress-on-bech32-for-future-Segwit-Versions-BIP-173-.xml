    <summary>Rusty Russell, in a recent post, provided the correct addresses for transactions that were initially posted incorrectly. PEBKAC errors resulted in wrong addresses being pasted in the first instance. The corrected addresses show that c-lightning could not parse the destination address, Phoenix returned an invalid data message, and blockchain.info showed a failed Bitcoin transaction. However, Green accepted the address ef1662fd2eb736612afb1b60e3efabfdf700b1c4822733d9dbe1bfee607a5b9b. Rusty also noted that 9e4ab6617a2983439181a304f0b4647b63f51af08fdd84b0676221beb71a8f21 was accepted as well.</summary>
