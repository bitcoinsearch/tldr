    <summary>Cut Throat Industries is a box cutter testing company that pays its 120 employees biweekly Fridays using a single transaction with the company's treasury as input and each employee payroll as output. However, this exposes the company's worth and amount in their treasury account, as well as how many employees they have and an idea of the average payroll. One employee's pay raise can also be observed by others. To address these concerns, the company wants to use Bitcoin with privacy to eliminate transparency. The Lightning Network is not an option because employees do not have inbound balance to get paid. Paying on-chain seems to be the only solution. However, fronting up funds of his own for inbound balance would consume all of the company's treasury to lock up funds.</summary>
