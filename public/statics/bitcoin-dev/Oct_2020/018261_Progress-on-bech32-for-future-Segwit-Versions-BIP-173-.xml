    <summary>The c-lightning contributor John Barboza assumed that future versions should be invalid because c-lightning doesn't allow withdraw to segwit &gt; 0. This code was later refactored by John Barboza when they were standardizing the `param` system, which was intended only as a simple precaution against creating non-standard transaction and not an assumption that future versions should be invalid. The intent is that further `else if` branches would be added for newer witness versions and whatever length restrictions they may have, as the `/* Insert other witness versions here. */` comment implies.</summary>
