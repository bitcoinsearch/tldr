    <summary>The author has added a Python reference implementation of BIP32 path templates that is compatible with micropython. The FSM formal spec has undergone some small corrections and the reference implementations, including C and the new python implementation, have been thoroughly tested. The author has submitted a PR to the bips repo and welcomes any comments. A non-text attachment was included but not described in the context.</summary>
