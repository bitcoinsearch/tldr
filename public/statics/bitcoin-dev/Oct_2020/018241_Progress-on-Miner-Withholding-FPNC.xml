    <summary>The discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list highlights two proposed changes to address the issue of miner withholding attacks and improve network decentralization. Currently, miners have an incentive to hold onto blocks in order to gain an advantage in calculating the next block, leading to a centralized network and delays in transactions. The proposed solution involves rebalancing the selfish-mining incentives with faster block creation times and floating-point Nakamoto Consensus (FPNC). However, ZmnSCPxj warns that implementing FPNC may reintroduce the selfish mining attack, and therefore is a hard NAK. The original solution presented in a paper many years prior raised the needed threshold to 33%, not 25%. Despite the risks, proponents argue that the proposed changes will ultimately benefit the network and users.</summary>
