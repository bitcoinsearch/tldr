    <summary>In an email exchange between Johnson Lau and Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, they discussed various issues related to the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) on the Bitcoin network. Lau responded to some of Todd's concerns, including the difficulty of adding new commitments with soft forks, the validity of transactions that spend witness outputs with unknown versions, and the use of a 160-bit commitment in pay-to-witness-pubkey-hash transactions. They also discussed the maximum size of serialized witness scripts and the need to ensure that signatures for the new signature hash cannot be reused for the old signature hash.</summary>
