    <summary>The writer is unsure of the purpose of a thread, but it appears to be similar to the reinvention of HKDF. They suggest reading a paper on HKDF which justifies its design decisions, as it stands out among crypto papers. The use of a standard algorithm is recommended to reduce risk of errors. Although there may be a slight cost in using a standard algorithm, it is deemed a cheap price to pay.</summary>
