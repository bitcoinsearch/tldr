    <summary>The writer is requesting feedback on Hash Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) transactions in Bitcoin. HTLC transactions allow payment for the preimage of a hash and can be recovered using CSV/CLTV if the other party is uncooperative. These scripts have a specific form and can be useful for both the Lightning network and in zero-knowledge contingent payments. The author's 'pay-to-sudoku' ZKCP demo earlier this year used the same script which was implemented using CLTV and SHA256. Members of the community have expressed interest in submitting a BIP for these transactions to be supported in the wallet with changes to Bitcoin Core. The author has shared his draft BIP on GitHub and an implementation is being worked on.</summary>
