    <summary>Daniel Cousens proposed that BIP 9 should move to the Accepted stage, but there is confusion about its classification. It's unclear whether it falls under Draft/Accepted/Final or Draft/Active proposals. Reviewing the criteria for status changes, it was determined that BIPs 68, 112, 113, and 141 are implementations of BIP 9, making it part of the Draft/Accepted/Final class. Additionally, BIPs 68, 112, and 113 have been successfully deployed to the network, satisfying both Accepted and Final status requirements. Therefore, all four BIPs should be promoted to Final status. Pieter Wuille, Peter Todd, Greg Maxwell, Rusty Russell, Mark Friedenbach, BtcDrak, Nicolas Dorier, kinoshitajona, Eric Lombrozo, Thomas Kerin must sign-off before the promotion. The discussion took place on the Github BIPs repo, but it is recommended to discuss it via email.</summary>
