    <summary>The proposal suggests allowing transaction authors to restrict execution to fewer than all blockchain forks where the transaction would otherwise be valid. Node implementations can select a bit from among the upper 8 bits of the transaction version space to enforce as a hard fork opt-out bit. To specify that a transaction NOT be mined by nodes that enforce a particular bit, authors set that bit in the transaction version. Opt-out is enforced by consensus among nodes enforcing each bit. An implementation will relay, process and mine transactions that opt out of other blockchain forks; just not those that opt out of its own fork. For example, via soft fork, all implementations may begin enforcing hard fork opt-out bit 30. Post-soft fork, setting this bit would make a transaction invalid, unless a fork emerges that has stopped enforcing bit 30. BIP109 implementations may stop enforcing bit 30 and begin enforcing bit 28 when the BIP109 hard fork is activated for a chain they are tracking. Enforcing more than one hard fork opt-out bit would imply that an implementation is actively participating in building more than one blockchain fork, and therefore providing a way to opt out of each.</summary>
