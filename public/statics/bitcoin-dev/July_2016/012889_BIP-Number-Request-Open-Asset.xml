    <summary>The conversation started with a curiosity to know about the answers of previous questions asked by Luke. There was also a concern that the documentation provided for the project wasn't convincing enough to build something on top of it, but still it can be taken as a work in progress. The writer hoped that the project would continue to get worked on, as there was no response or discussion about it and there were chances of it becoming an abandoned project. Later on, in the email conversation, Peter Todd enquired about the status of the BIP and if it will be assigned. In response, Luke Dashjr mentioned that he was waiting for clarification on the author thing, but since there seemed to be no objections and he was unaware of any reason not to assign it, letâ€™s call it BIP 160.</summary>
