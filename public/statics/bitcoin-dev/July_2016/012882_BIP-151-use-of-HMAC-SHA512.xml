    <summary>The email thread shared in this context is a discussion on the importance of using well-studied open standards over custom constructions in the domain of cryptography. Zooko Wilcox, via bitcoin-dev mailing list, recommends reading the paper about HKDF and reusing widely-understood crypto algorithms to reduce the risk of errors. He points out that although it may result in computing something slightly more complicated or inefficient than a custom algorithm for the current use case, it is a cheap price to pay. Xuesong (Arthur) Chen, Senior Principle Engineer and Blockchain Technologist at BTCC, shared the email thread.</summary>
