    <summary>The impact of the 75% Segregated Witness subsidy on CoinJoin transactions and similar ones has been questioned. The subsidy makes signature data, which does not affect the UTXO set size, 75% less expensive than data that does impact the UTXO set size. This is expected to encourage users to prefer transactions that minimize the impact on the UTXO set in order to reduce fees and encourage developers to design new features that also minimize the impact on the UTXO set. While this could act as a disincentive against CoinJoin transactions, it is unclear if there is any evidence to support this claim.A sample of 16 transaction IDs posted on a BitcoinTalk thread showed an average ratio of 1.38 outputs to inputs. It is worth noting that traditional CoinJoin transactions usually create roughly two UTXOs for every one it consumes, unless address reuse comes into play. The author notes that they do not want Schnorr signatures to be brought up in any replies since they are not on any immediate roadmap.</summary>
