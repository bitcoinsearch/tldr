    <summary>http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013996.html Timo Hanke, a mathematician from Germany, has announced the release of a white paper describing an algorithmic improvement to the Bitcoin mining process which has never been discussed publicly before. The white paper can be found on the website of RWTH Aachen University. The new algorithm, known as AsicBoost, improves the efficiency of Bitcoin mining chips while requiring no changes to the Bitcoin protocol. The new technology is expected to significantly reduce the cost of mining Bitcoin and improve profit margins for miners. The announcement was made on the Bitcoin development mailing list.</summary>
