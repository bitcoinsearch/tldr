    <summary>The author of the message has submitted a draft of two BIPs, which can be found on their Github account. They have updated the PR with changes that include removing AES256-GCM as cipher suite and focusing on Chacha20-Poly1305 instead. Additionally, two symmetric cipher keys must be calculated by HMAC_SHA512 from the ecdh secret, and a session-ID must be calculated for linking an identity authentication with encryption. Re-keying can be announced by the responding peer after a certain duration, and AEAD tag is now the last element in the new message format. The encrypted message format is expected to perform better than the current format, removing the SHA256 checksum. Feedback is welcomed, as the work is still under heavy review and subject to change.</summary>
