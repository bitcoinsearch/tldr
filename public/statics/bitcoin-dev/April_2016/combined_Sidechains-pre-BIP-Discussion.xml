    <summary>The email discusses a proposed new OP Code for pegged sidechains, specifically the Two Way Peg. The proposed OP Code is called "OP_CheckVotesVerify" and can be deployed by a soft fork. The author notes that this has several benefits, including the ability to allow for optional hard forks, test complex updates in a realistic environment, direct blockchain resources to Bitcoin, and reduce time spent debating controversial features.However, the author also acknowledges that the feature has complex effects on the Bitcoin ecosystem and intends to release short presentations on the overall design justification, enforcing limits on shared resources, and governance of sidechains. The purpose of the email is to begin the conversation and receive feedback from the community.Links to relevant resources are provided, including a blog post on Drivechain, a technical paper by Sergio Demian Lerner, and the original message introducing pegged sidechains. Overall, the email serves as an introduction to a potential new feature for Bitcoin and aims to gather input from the development community.</summary>
