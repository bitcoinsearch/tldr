    <summary>A developer named Rune has created a protocol for working with payment channels over the past few months. He has written a specification to standardize the operations of opening, paying and closing payment channels. The specification is derived from a mostly-working implementation that will be open sourced after being cleaned up. The implementation is written in Haskell. Rune is sharing the specification now to have everything documented, especially since he chose to write the implementation in Haskell. The purpose of sharing the specification is for people to point out any errors or anything he may have missed. The link to the specification can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runeksvendsen/simple-bitcoin-payment-channel-protocol/master/simple-bitcoin-payment-channel-protocol-v0.1.txt.</summary>
