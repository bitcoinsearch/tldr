    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.12.1 has been released with several new features and bug fixes, including the BIP9, BIP68 and BIP112 softforks, which restrict execution pathways of a script based on the age of the output being spent. The BIP68 soft fork introduces relative lock-time consensus-enforced semantics of the sequence number field for signed transaction inputs to remain invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding outpoint. The BIP112 soft fork redefines the existing OP_NOP3 as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV) for a new opcode in the Bitcoin scripting system that allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based on the age of the output being spent. Additionally, BIP113 specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that weakens the incentive for individual miners to use a future time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast() greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block. Other changes include the addition of abandoned status to listtransactions, reduced block timeout to 10 minutes, improved calculation of balances and available coins, and more. Users are encouraged to report bugs using the issue tracker at Github and subscribe to receive security and update notifications. Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool. This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions, so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will no longer be accepted into the mempool. A full list of changes and contributors can be found in the release notes.</summary>
