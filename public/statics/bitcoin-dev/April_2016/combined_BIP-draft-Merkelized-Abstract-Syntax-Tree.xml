    <summary>The proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aims to introduce a new witness program type that uses a Merkle tree to encode mutually exclusive branches in a script. This new program type allows for complicated redemption conditions, enhances privacy by hiding unexecuted scripts and enables inclusion of non-consensus enforced data at low or no additional cost. The reference implementation is a small patch on top of BIP141 (segwit), but the author does not intend to push it until segwit is enforced. The author hopes that MAST will come with many new op codes, particularly Schnorr signature. This new proposal provides a significant enhancement to the existing Bitcoin protocol, making it more secure, efficient and flexible.The use of Merkle trees in encoding mutually exclusive branches makes it easier to create complex smart contracts, which can be used for various purposes in the blockchain industry. This new feature improves privacy and enables users to include additional data in their transactions at no extra cost, making it an excellent choice for developers who want to build innovative applications on top of the Bitcoin network.Links to the BIP draft and the reference implementation are provided for those who want to learn more about this proposed improvement. Overall, the proposed BIP is an exciting development that has the potential to revolutionize the way we use Bitcoin, making it more accessible, efficient and secure.</summary>
