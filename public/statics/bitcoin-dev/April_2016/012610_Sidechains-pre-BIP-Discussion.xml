    <summary>In this email to a Bitcoin development mailing list, the author discusses the introduction of a new OP Code for pegged sidechains, specifically the Two Way Peg. The proposed OP Code, called "OP_CheckVotesVerify," can be deployed by a soft fork and has several benefits, including allowing for optional hard forks, testing complex updates in a realistic environment, directing blockchain resources to Bitcoin, and reducing time spent debating controversial features. The author acknowledges that the feature has complex effects on the Bitcoin ecosystem and intends to release short presentations on the overall design justification, enforcing limits on shared resources, and governance of sidechains. The purpose of the email is to begin the conversation and receive feedback from the community. The author also provides links to relevant resources, including a blog post on Drivechain, a technical paper by Sergio Demian Lerner, and the original message introducing pegged sidechains.</summary>
