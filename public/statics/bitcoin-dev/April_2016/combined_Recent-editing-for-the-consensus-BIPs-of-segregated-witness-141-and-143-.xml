    <summary>Over the past month, revisions have been made to BIP141 and BIP143. The only change in consensus behavior of the reference implementation was the use of BIP9 for deployment. Other changes were made for clarifications and corrections to match the reference implementation. It's important to note that the consensus specification has not changed since early February 2016, except for the use of BIP9. The history of BIP141 and revision proposals can be found on Github, along with the history of BIP143.</summary>
