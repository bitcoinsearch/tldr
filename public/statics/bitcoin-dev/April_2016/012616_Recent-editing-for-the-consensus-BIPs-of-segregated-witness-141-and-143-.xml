    <summary>In the past month, there have been a number of revisions to BIP141 and 143. The use of BIP9 for deployment is the only edit that resulted from a change in consensus behavior of the reference implementation. Other edits were made for clarifications or corrections to match the reference implementation. It's worth noting that the consensus specification (except the use of BIP9) has not changed since early February 2016, if not earlier. Links to the history of BIP141 and revision proposals can be found on Github, along with the history of BIP143.</summary>
