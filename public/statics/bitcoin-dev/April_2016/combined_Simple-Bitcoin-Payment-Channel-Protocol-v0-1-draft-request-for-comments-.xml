    <summary>A developer named Rune has created a protocol for working with payment channels over the past few months. This protocol involves standardizing the operations of opening, paying and closing payment channels. Rune has written a specification for this protocol which is derived from a mostly-working implementation that will be open sourced after being cleaned up. The implementation is written in Haskell. Rune is sharing the specification now to document everything and get feedback from others. The purpose of sharing the specification is to have people point out any errors or anything he may have missed. The link to the specification can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runeksvendsen/simple-bitcoin-payment-channel-protocol/master/simple-bitcoin-payment-channel-protocol-v0.1.txt.</summary>
