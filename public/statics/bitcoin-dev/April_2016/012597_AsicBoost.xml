    <summary>On March 31, 2016, Timo Hanke announced a white paper that describes an algorithmic improvement to the Bitcoin mining process which has never been discussed in public before. The white paper can be found at http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Timo.Hanke/AsicBoostWhitepaperrev5.pdf. However, there are concerns regarding centralization as this improvement is patented. People are worried that a licensing model that gives one manufacturer exclusive rights might arise. Peter Todd asked what steps would be taken to ensure that this improvement would be available to all ASIC designers/mfgs on an equal opportunity basis.</summary>
