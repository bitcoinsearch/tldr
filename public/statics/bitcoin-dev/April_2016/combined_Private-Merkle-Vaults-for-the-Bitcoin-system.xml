    <summary>At the 3rd Bitcoin Workshop held in Barbados, a proposal was presented to improve Bitcoin wallet security and deter thefts. The proposal suggests creating vaults that function as special accounts whose keys can be neutralized if they fall into the hands of attackers, rendering their transactions null and void. Vaults are Bitcoin's decentralized version of calling a bank to report a stolen credit card. Anyone can create a vault address with a vault key and recovery key. Spending money from the vault address requires waiting for a predefined unvaulting period established at the time of creating the vault. This demotivates key theft, as an attacker who knows they will not get away with theft is less likely to attack. Vaults enable important use-cases for Bitcoin as a store of value, particularly for successions (heritages). A paper describing the details of the proposal is available at the link provided. Another feature called CheckOutputVerify could also greatly deter Bitcoin thefts. This feature enables users to recover stolen funds by using a recovery key within 24 hours of a transaction issued by a hacker with the user's vault key. This "undo" facility is similar to what modern banking relies on, but for Bitcoin. The implementation of these new features in Bitcoin's programming highlights the challenges faced by clients and keys when it comes to securing Bitcoin wallets. Comments and suggestions from the community are welcome to further improve Bitcoin security.</summary>
