    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing changes to the BIP 340 standard for more secure nonce generation. The proposed changes aim to integrate actual signing-time randomness into the nonce generation process to protect against fault injection attacks. However, there are concerns about standardizing on a non-deterministic nonce generation scheme, which could lead to increased private key exfiltration concerns for hardware signing devices. A deterministic nonce scheme can be checked to ensure that hardware devices produce signatures in accordance with their specified nonce scheme. To address this issue, the BIP proposes using Nonce exfiltration protection, but there are no references on how to implement it.To avoid a world where hardware signing devices have a hard-to-detect underhanded communications channel, the suggestion is to introduce a new section in the BIP addressing this problem in the future or provide references to more information about the Nonce exfiltration protection mentioned. It is essential to maintain security while integrating actual signing-time randomness into the nonce generation process. The proposed changes need to be thoroughly evaluated to ensure they do not pose any security risks.</summary>
