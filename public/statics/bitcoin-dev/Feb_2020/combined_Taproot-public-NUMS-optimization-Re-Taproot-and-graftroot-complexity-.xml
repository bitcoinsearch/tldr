    <title>Combined summary - Taproot public NUMS optimization (Re: Taproot (and graftroot) complexity)</title>

    <summary>A group of anonymous developers have proposed a modification to the Taproot specification in BIP-341 to reduce some of its overhead. The proposal aims to optimize Taproot's public NUMS by removing the need for it and introducing bare MAST to prevent the use of different public NUMS from leaking metadata. If greater anonymity is required, a NUMS point can still be used in Taproot at the expense of additional data, but the proposal suggests it should only be used when a single-use nonce can be sent. Private NUMS provide more privacy benefits and a small hit to the likelihood of losing funds.The proposal has received both support and alternative responses, such as adding a discounting rule for the Public NUMS that discounts the extra weight somehow or taking a bit out of the leaf version portion of C[0] to denote Public NUMS and then elide having to include the point. The email is the third of a collection of sentiments from the anonymous group of developers who discuss the merits of Taproot's design versus simpler alternatives, suggest an alternative path to deploying the technologies described in BIP-340, BIP-341, and BIP-342, and propose a modification to Taproot to reduce some of the overhead.The group proposes to modify Taproot's specification in BIP-341 by adding a rule that if there is one element on the witness stack, attempt hashing it to see if it's equal to the witness program. If it's not the witness program, and it's 65 bytes, try signature validation. If there is more than one element on the witness stack, treat it as a non-Taproot MAST and get the leaf version as the last byte of the script. If greater anonymity is required, a NUMS point can still be used in Taproot, at the expense of additional data. However, using well-known constant NUMS points could decrease privacy as they could differ from application to application, fingerprinting wallets. Instead, the NUMS point should only be used when a single-use nonce can be sent so that NUMS cannot be distinguished from a normal Taproot to a third party who doesn't know the setup (e.g., that the NUMS is H(X) for known X).</summary>
