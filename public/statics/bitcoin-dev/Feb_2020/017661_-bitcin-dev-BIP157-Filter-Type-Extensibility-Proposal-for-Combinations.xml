    <summary>BIP157, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, defines the "Filter Types" section which allows for future extensibility and reduction of filter sizes. Full nodes generate one filter per block per filter type supported. Each type is identified by a one byte code and specifies the contents and serialization format of the filter. While it provides a way to extend to multiple filter types, it does not provide a way to extend to filter type combinations. However, this is possible if the filter types were defined with powers of two. The idea was originally detailed in this GitHub issue and can be proposed to the mailing list for consensus before an update to the BIP is made.</summary>
