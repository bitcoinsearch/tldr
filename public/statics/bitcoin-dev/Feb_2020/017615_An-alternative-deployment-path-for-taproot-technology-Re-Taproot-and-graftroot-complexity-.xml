    <summary>This email is the second in a collection of anonymous messages from developers discussing the technical issues surrounding Taproot. They aim to keep the focus on the merits of the design rather than personal politics. The group proposes an alternative path forward for the Taproot family of changes, which includes separate soft-forks for Merkle Branch Witnesses and Schnorr Signatures, followed by a soft-fork enabling Taproot and Graftroot. The first two forks can be offered simultaneously or one at a time, with Taproot enabled as a soft-fork on the existing semantics requiring a new witness version. The Public NUMS Optimization will allow wallets to upgrade by changing just one version byte. The group believes that this deployment plan is more conservative, and waiting on the third change allows for real-world protocol engineering experience to see if the Taproot frequency of use assumption holds and if it is worth doing.</summary>
