    <summary>The focus of the discussion is on orphan transactions in the Bitcoin network and their impact on network throughput. Orphan transactions are those whose parental income-sources are missing at the time they are processed, and thus, they end up remaining in a local buffer until evicted or until their parents are found. The paper discussed in the email characterizes orphan transactions and shows that increasing the size of the orphan pool reduces network overhead with almost no additional performance overhead. The paper's findings show that orphan transactions tend to have fewer parents with lower fees and larger sizes than their non-orphan counterparts, resulting in a lower transaction fee per byte. Additionally, the network overhead incurred by these orphan transactions can be significant, exceeding 17% when using the default orphan memory pool size (100 transactions). However, it is noted that this overhead can be made negligible without significant computational or memory demands if the pool size is merely increased to 1000 transactions.While the email raises an interesting topic for discussion, the author suggests that the software-level discussion of Bitcoin Core is better suited for Github rather than the current forum. In conclusion, the discussion sheds light on the importance of understanding the properties of orphan transactions and reducing their impact on network throughput.</summary>
