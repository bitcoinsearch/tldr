    <summary>In a post on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj discussed the use of `nLocktime` and a weird watermark on unilateral closes. They noted that HTLCs only exist on unilateral closes, while mutual closes wait for HTLCs to settle before closing. ZmnSCPxj also explored some of the difficulties with unilateral closes and provided links for further reading. On mutual closes, it is recommended to set `nLockTime` to the current block height + 1. The post also addressed questions about protocol-specific semantic incompatibility between Coinjoin and cooperative LN txn, RBF-by-default, and artificially increasing the number of outputs to mimic Coinjoin txn.</summary>
