    <summary>Pieter Wuille, the co-founder of Blockstream and a Bitcoin Core developer, has announced minor changes to the BIP 340-342 proposals. The updated proposals include changes like changing the Y-coordinate of 32-byte public keys from implicitly square to even, improving non-generation security, and modifying tagged hash tags in BIP 340. While most changes are around more secure nonce generation, only one change affects validation rules. The Y coordinate of the internal R point in the signature remains implicitly square. Implementers are being urged to use precomputed values for public key data, including it in the nonce generation to mitigate trivial leakage of private keys. Moreover, to protect against differential power analysis, a different way of mixing randomness is used. Finally, the tags used in the tagged hashes in BIP 340 are changed to ensure that any code written for the earlier BIP text fails consistently.</summary>
