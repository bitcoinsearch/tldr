    <summary>A group of anonymous developers has proposed an alternative plan for the Taproot family of changes. In a series of anonymous messages, the developers discussed technical issues surrounding the design and focused on its merits rather than personal politics. The proposed plan includes separate soft-forks for Merkle Branch Witnesses and Schnorr Signatures, followed by a soft-fork enabling Taproot and Graftroot. The first two forks can be offered simultaneously or one at a time, with Taproot enabled as a soft-fork on the existing semantics requiring a new witness version. The Public NUMS Optimization will allow wallets to upgrade by changing just one version byte. The group believes that this deployment plan is more conservative and waiting on the third change will allow for real-world protocol engineering experience to see if the Taproot frequency of use assumption holds and if it is worth doing. The proposal aims to keep the focus on technical issues and avoid personal politics.</summary>
