    <summary>In a recent discussion between Antoine and ZmnSCPxj, the topic of splicing as a form of merged closing plus funding was brought up. They discussed how a spliced channel would have to change its short channel ID and channel ID for compatibility with the existing system. The conversation then moved onto analyzing the frequency of liquidity reasons in LN nodes and its impact on CoinJoin spending delta vs. LN ones. ZmnSCPxj proposed timelocking PTG transactions to mimic actively-spliced LN channels to address this issue. The conversation then shifted to the use of RBF, where ZmnSCPxj suggested that it should always be turned on even if there is no facility to re-interact to bump fees higher. This would force surveillors to record information themselves, though merchants who refuse RBF transactions may complain. An issue arises when not all participants contribute equally to fees, leading some to only broadcast the highest-fee version and ignore mempool analysis. Finally, they agreed to nail down the details of the format of this proposal, which could be of interest to other protocols such as submarine swaps and lightning loops.</summary>
