    <summary>The conversation between ZmnSCPxj and M discusses the potential consequences of nodes rejecting announced blocks that include transactions in conflict with any in their mempool or contest pool. ZmnSCPxj warns that violating the principle of Blockchain Self-Containment can cause persistent chainsplits, even with innocent miners who find blocks at nearly the same time. M argues that the aim is not to prevent empty blocks but to discourage miners from including conflicting transactions. The conversation also touches upon Purge attacks, which are a form of sabotage that can damage the network's future ability to offer settlement assurances. ZmnSCPxj advises that the only winning move is not to play and to wait for more than a small number of confirmations. Finally, the conversation shifts to a discussion about how G20 states that have seized major mining operations could destroy value and confidence in Bitcoin. M suggests that getting rid of RBF would limit their options and force them to resort to DoS mode.</summary>
