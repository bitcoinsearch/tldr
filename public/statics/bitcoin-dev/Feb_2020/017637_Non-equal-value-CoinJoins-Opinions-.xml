    <summary>In a recent email conversation between Ádám Ficsór and ZmnSCPxj, the topic of whether non-equal value CoinJoins can be relied on for privacy was discussed. The conversation revolves around a paragraph from the CashFusion specification that claims that with 10^92 possibilities, there is essentially no linkage and extends this obfuscation even further. However, ZmnSCPxj argues that most users will not have nearly the same output of "around 1 BTC" if deployed on a real live mainnet, and if the math requires that you have "around 1 BTC" outputs per user, one might as well use equal-valued CoinJoins. He further explains how change outputs of an equal-valued CoinJoin would have similar analyses to CashFusion, since the same analysis "around 1 BTC" can be performed with the CoinJoin change outputs "around 0 BTC". Additionally, he explains that the change outputs of an equal-valued CoinJoin have the same linkability as the outputs of the equivalent CashFusion transaction.</summary>
