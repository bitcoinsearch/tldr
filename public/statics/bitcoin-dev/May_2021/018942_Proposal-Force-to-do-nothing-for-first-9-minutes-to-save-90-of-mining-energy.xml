    <summary>Eric Voskuil shared two links on the bitcoin-dev forum regarding the efficiency paradox and the proof-of-memory fallacy. According to Voskuil, the proposal would reduce chain security by 10%. While this proposal may seem to violate the efficiency paradox, it simply reduces the real cost of confirming a transaction by reducing security. This reduction in security leads to lower Bitcoin prices and less electricity being purchased with block rewards.</summary>
