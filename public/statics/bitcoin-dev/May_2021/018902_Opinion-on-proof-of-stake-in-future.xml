    <summary>The concept of Bitcoin mining introducing the first free-market demand for the cheapest energy source is being discussed. However, it is argued that access to technologically advanced hardware is a stronger component than energy in this case. Open community chip fabs could potentially change this by allowing anyone to get involved. Currently, the hardware barrier is keeping the average person out. It is suggested that if someone can build a chip fab, they may also be able to build a power plant, which would eliminate competition. The energy economy still has more supply than competition. If renewable energy were to become cheaper, it would quickly outcompete nonrenewable energy sources.</summary>
