    <summary>In a conversation between Luke Dashjr and Billy Tetrud via bitcoin-dev on May 21, 2021, the topic of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) was discussed. Tetrud expressed his opinion that the BIPs seemed unrelated to changing how Bitcoin operates at its base layer, despite being well put together. In response, Dashjr clarified that BIPs are not limited to the base layer and can be used for anything that coordinates between Bitcoin software at any layer.</summary>
