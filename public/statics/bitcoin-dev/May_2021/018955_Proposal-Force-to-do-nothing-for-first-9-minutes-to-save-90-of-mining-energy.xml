    <summary>The proposal to encourage the use of 'green miners' to address energy consumption issues in Bitcoin has been met with concerns about centralization. However, the author argues that this is not centralization as different miners can use different standards for 'green' status and it does not affect the network's stability. The proposal aims to create small incentives for miners to move to green sources of energy or buy carbon credits and get certified. The author believes that more renewable energy sources will be cheaper in the long run, making them economically viable. The goal is to spread knowledge about places where energy prices have bottomed due to oversupply caused by technological improvements. The author emphasizes that introducing an authority to filter miners works against the goal of avoiding authorities that may be bribeable or hackable single points-of-failure.</summary>
