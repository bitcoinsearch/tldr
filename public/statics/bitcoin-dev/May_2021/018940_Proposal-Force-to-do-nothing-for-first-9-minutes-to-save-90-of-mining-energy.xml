    <summary>There are concerns about the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining, particularly during the "cool-down" period when mining rigs are not actively mining. However, it may not be technically possible to completely power down mining rigs during this time. Data centers typically charge for maximum electricity consumption, meaning miners have no economic incentive not to draw power when idling. While environmental concerns could push the price of Bitcoin lower, making it less attractive to miners and reducing power consumption, history shows that money tends to outcompete other factors. However, the attractiveness of mining will decrease over time due to halving events. One counter-proposal to address energy consumption is to encourage users to support "green miners" with their transactions. This would not necessarily reduce energy usage, as large miners with access to free energy may use their block-reward sized budget on equipment and operational expenses. However, the coinbase reward halves every four years, which significantly lowers the miner budget in terms of BTC. Adjusting this could be another approach to influencing chain properties.</summary>
