    <title>Proposal: Low Energy Bitcoin PoW</title>

    <summary>In a recent email exchange, ZmnSCPxj proposed phasing in oPoW slowly to address the issue of ASICBOOST. However, Michael brought up concerns about hidden optimizations that may exist when combining linear matrix multiplication and SHA3 with the Bitcoin block header format. While there are currently no incentives to find such optimizations until Bitcoin moves to this new method, changes to PoW are highly discouraged. It is important to note that ASICBOOST was not an optimization of SHA256 or SHA256d specifically, but rather an optimization of SHA256d-on-a-Bitcoin-block-header.</summary>
