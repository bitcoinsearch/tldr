    <summary>Luke Dashjr responded to a query on how to reduce block time in Bitcoin while maintaining security on 17th May 2021. He stated that increasing security is inevitable and cannot be avoided. However, the person questioning him proposed using dRNG, a universal clock, and cryptographic measures to ensure safe mining of blocks. The proposal aimed to start the run for the next coinbase at zero seconds and end it after 600 seconds with no significant changes if started 540 seconds later, but must finish in 60 seconds. The idle time would be nine minutes, which wouldn't affect the 60-second block time. Luke Dashjr appreciated the suggestion and stated that it was ten times harder than ten times softer. Finally, he clarified that his previous response was not pointing fingers at Musk and that they were trying hard to make Bitcoin more efficient than any other system, even though they are still working on it.</summary>
