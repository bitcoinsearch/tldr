    <summary>The privacy concerns in the Core wallet have been a source of worry for many, but a recent discovery has revealed that it is possible to identify if someone is using Bitcoin Core with just the bitcoin address and a couple of transactions. Although some users may have given up on privacy in the Core wallet, this information can still be useful for others who are unaware of this specific issue and developers who use Bitcoin Core in their projects. The issue was discovered while reviewing PR and discussed recently in a 'Core Review PR club' meeting. If Alice wants to confirm whether Bob is using Bitcoin Core wallet, she can send 2 small amounts to one of the addresses in different transactions, and one transaction should have such a low fee rate that it doesn't get confirmed.There are two things that help identify the wallet using the address, including not being able to spend unconfirmed UTXO and OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES. The latter was set at 10 earlier but increased to 100 after PR #18418 got merged. This will help in confirming if someone is using the latest Bitcoin Core once it is available in the next release. For instance, Carol sends small amounts to the same address in 11 transactions to both Alice and Bob and confirms that Bob is using the latest Bitcoin Core wallet, while Alice is using an older version. The author plans to fix both issues, which may take a few days or might never get merged. In his opinion, he suggests locking all UTXOs associated with a scriptpubkey until all are confirmed, which will help fix issue 1. As for issue 2, it can be fixed by using an approach similar to Electrum (All or None). Overall, the issue highlights the importance of privacy concerns in the Core wallet and developers' responsibility to address them.</summary>
