    <summary>A lurker on a bitcoin mining mailing list expressed concern about the energy usage of bitcoin mining and asked for opinions on implementing proof of stake (PoS) for bitcoin mining in the future. While some mining occurs with renewable resources, the impact is still high. PoS is currently untested but may be implemented in smaller networks first. The possibilities are that PoS isn't a good enough security mechanism or it works as intended. If PoS is proven effective, there would likely be controversy and a hard fork to implement it for Bitcoin, but it is important to consider.</summary>
