    <summary>Blockchain Commons has been collaborating with the Airgapped Wallet Community for the past few years to create interoperability specifications intended to enhance Bitcoin wallet usage, with a view to expanding these to other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum wallets and cryptography applications such as chat systems and key-management programs. The goal is to improve the independence, security, and resilience of cryptographic systems. A recent introductory video outlines the initiatives, including work on encoding methods, sharding methods, user interfaces, partitioned architectures, multisig patterns, and more.The company has also begun developing new documentation for developers, starting with Uniform References (URs), which is a typed method for encoding binary data in plain-text strings suitable for QR that are also well-formed URIs. Further documentation will cover using URs interactively and for animated PSBTs and shamir seed shares.Blockchain Commons is keen to discuss these specifications and associated technologies with interested parties and encourages developers to get involved in using them, joining the likes of Fully Noded, AirGap Vault, BlueWallet, Cobo Wallet, and Sparrow Wallet. Links to relevant sites are provided, along with information on security architectures and methods, education, and related libraries and applications.</summary>
