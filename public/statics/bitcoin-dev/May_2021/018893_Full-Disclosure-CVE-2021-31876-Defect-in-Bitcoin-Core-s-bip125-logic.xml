    <summary>A defect has been found in the Bitcoin Core bip125 logic which affects nodes 0.12.0 and above, however it does not have any impact on base layer safety. The Bip 125 specification outlines a signalling mechanism for transactions to indicate that they are replaceable. This can be done either through explicit signalling or inherited signalling from an unconfirmed ancestor. The defect occurs when an unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff spends an unconfirmed parent with nSequence. This causes the child transaction to be non-replaceable even if it had opted in for replacement. The defect has minor security and operational implications for downstream projects using Bitcoin Core.</summary>
