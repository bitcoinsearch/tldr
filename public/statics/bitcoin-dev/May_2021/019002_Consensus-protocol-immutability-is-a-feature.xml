    <summary>In a recent bitcoin-dev discussion, the possibility and limitations of implementing softforks were explored. ZmnSCPxj brought up an example of maaku7's proposed softfork that could potentially change the block discovery rate. The discussion also looked at the potential for massive changes to the transaction and block formats with softforks, such as changing the Merkle Tree to use SHA3 instead. However, it was noted that there are limitations in what can be changed with softforks. For instance, the block header format and how proof-of-work is computed from the block header cannot be changed without a hardfork. Additionally, the discussion warned of the hurdles that any hardfork would have to go through, as seen with SegWit and Taproot. Any hardforks would require more engineering-manpower than softforks and must be prepared to work on it for several years before being accepted. The discussion concluded with the suggestion that we should either work with the existing system or start working on future solutions today.</summary>
