    <summary>A discussion on Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) has taken place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The discussion began with a comment from Billy Tetrud, who stated that while the documents looked well put together, they appeared to be unrelated to changing the operation of Bitcoin at its base layer. However, it was pointed out that BIPs are not limited to the base layer and can be used for anything that coordinates between Bitcoin software at any layer. This suggests that BIPs can be used to build protocols on top of the Bitcoin platform.</summary>
