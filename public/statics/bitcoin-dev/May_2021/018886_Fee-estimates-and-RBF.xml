    <summary>The author of the message believes that a "true" full-RBF wallet should be the goal for every on-chain wallet, but achieving this requires significant engineering efforts. They explain how some wallets currently handle unconfirmed inputs and the simplification of database design by deleting inputs after spending. However, to achieve a "true" full-RBF wallet, the wallet must keep track of "pending spends" and correlate them with actual transactions. The author notes a race condition that can occur when bumping up fees on a transaction while a miner finds a new block with the old transaction. Additionally, it is important to consider that while it is convenient to spend money while it is unconfirmed, the original spender may keep fee-bumping the transaction over time, changing the output. The author admits they have not been thinking of these factors as well as they should have.</summary>
