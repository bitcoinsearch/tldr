    <summary>The email discusses the issue of increasing CPU usage and code complexity when adding a field or opcode to transactions. It proposes a solution where a "hidden" field is defined in a transaction with a default value that is compatible with pre-softfork rules, along with an opcode that manipulates this field. The proposal also suggests implementing a maximum block height on transactions using a new field and opcode. The advantage of this functionality is that it allows users to be safely offline at the time of timeout in any complicated timeout-based contract. However, it also increases risk for the contractor holding lien on the hashlock branch in a two-participant contract. Therefore, the proposal is not considered significant improvement to Bitcoin.</summary>
