    <summary>On May 15, 2021, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a statement made by vjudeu about Taproot's ability to produce a signature matching the sum of public keys used in Taproot. However, Tim clarified that this statement was not true and that Taproot does not enable any form of "cross-input aggregation", which is spending multiple UTXOs with a single signature.</summary>
