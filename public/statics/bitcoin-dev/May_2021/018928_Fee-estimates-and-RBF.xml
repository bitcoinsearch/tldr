    <summary>In response to a question on Bitcoin Stack Exchange regarding fee estimation, Jeremy and ZmnSCPxj shared their thoughts. Additionally, the recent CVE related to Replace-By-Fee (RBF) by Antoine Riard and the implementation of RBF in Bitcoin Core compared to btcd were discussed. However, the reasoning behind why inherited signalling is not implemented in Bitcoin Core was unclear. The combination of RBF, Child-Pays-for-Parent (CPFP), and their potential use cases have yet to be fully explored, with one such example being the maker-taker model where the receiver pays for the transaction instead of the sender. Though this approach would require careful exception handling.</summary>
