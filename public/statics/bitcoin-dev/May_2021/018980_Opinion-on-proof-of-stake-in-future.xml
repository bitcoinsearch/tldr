    <summary>The debate around energy usage in relation to global warming and proof of stake (PoS) continues. While some argue that energy usage is not inherently bad, others point out that excess energy can contribute to global warming. In the context of PoS, there are concerns about oligopolistic control and security risks. However, some proponents believe that a PoS consensus protocol could be developed that is more secure and less resource-intensive than traditional PoW systems. There is also debate around the security thresholds of PoS versus PoW, with some arguing that PoS can exceed the 1/3 rule while others disagree. Additionally, there are discussions around the use of burned coins and VDFs as potential alternatives to PoW. Ultimately, the goal remains the same: to create a trustless digital currency that is secure and efficient.</summary>
