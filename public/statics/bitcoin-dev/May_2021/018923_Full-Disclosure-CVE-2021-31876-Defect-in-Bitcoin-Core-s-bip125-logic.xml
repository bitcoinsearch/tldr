    <summary>The conversation is between Antoine and Ruben, where Ruben discusses the impact of a bug on spacechains/BMM caused by RBF policy. Spacechains are impacted by the bug as it uses fee-bidding Blind Merged Mining to create one transaction for each block, to which anyone can attach a block hash. The preferred mechanism utilizes sighash_anyprevout and is not affected, but there is also a practical variant that could be used without requiring the anyprevout soft fork, which unfortunately does seem to be impacted. Each pre-signed TX is RBF enabled, so each CPFP transaction inherits RBF as well. But if inherited signalling does not function, the first person who makes a CPFP transaction can simply disable RBF and win the auction, thus breaking the intended fee-bidding mechanism. Ruben suggests that deploying full-RBF would help in such cases. Darosior via bitcoin-dev thanks Antoine for bringing up the disclosure and mentions that Revault isn't vulnerable as all transactions signal RBF.</summary>
