    <summary>The Bitcoin consensus protocol is resistant to changes unless they are absolutely necessary. Any attempt to make changes without a clear demonstration that Bitcoin will die without them is a waste of time. The resistance to changes in the consensus protocol is a feature that makes Bitcoin resistant to being coopted or corrupted. Developers are advised to focus on making improvements that do not involve changing the consensus protocol, as otherwise, they would be working on an altcoin which is not relevant to the topic at hand.</summary>
