    <summary>The author of this email has been working on a literature review for Bitcoin privacy for the past few weeks. This literature review aims to cover all privacy issues in Bitcoin, including the Lightning Network, and provides examples to demonstrate how these concepts work in practice. The literature review can be found on the Bitcoin wiki page dedicated to privacy. In addition to the literature review, the author has created a new wiki category specifically for smaller articles related to Bitcoin privacy. This category can also be found on the Bitcoin wiki page. The email is signed off with the initials "CB."</summary>
