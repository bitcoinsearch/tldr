    <summary>The writer suggests that SHA512 alone is not enough to create a secure method for generating a master key, as it may result in an invalid key if certain conditions are not met. Additionally, they question how this method could be used to seed a hardware wallet that requires a BIP39 seed. Instead, they propose creating a scheme that takes cards and generates entropy, which can then be used to generate BIP39 or non-BIP39 seeds. The writer notes that Ian Coleman's BIP39 site already supports card-based entropy generation and provides a link to the source code. They also correct a previous calculation of entropy, stating that log2(52!) is actually 225.58 bits, not 219. A suggestion is made to use 50+ 6-sided dice rolls to ensure sufficient entropy. Finally, a tip is given on how to prevent someone from mixing up the order of shuffled cards by drawing a diagonal line on the side of the deck with a permanent marker.</summary>
