    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has come up with a new proposal for creating a wallet seed from the numbers on fortunes found in fortune cookies. The idea is that each number has around 6.6 bits of entropy, so that about seven fortunes would be enough to create a "very secure" wallet seed. It is also suggested that the information can be split between something physical and something remembered, making it harder to compromise. Furthermore, the scheme allows for easy deniability by creating decoy wallets using other fortunes. Although a Python script has been written to demonstrate the concept, the idea is still in its early stages and there are concerns about weaknesses such as people throwing away their fortunes.</summary>
