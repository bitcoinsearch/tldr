    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ryan Havar talked about the convenience of using a shuffled deck of cards as a physical backup for important information. He noted that such a backup can be easily hidden in plain sight with great plausible deniability. However, it is important to ensure that no one plays with the cards and mixes up the order. To address this issue, he suggested drawing a diagonal line on the side of the deck from corner to corner using a permanent marker. This way, if the cards ever get mixed up, one can put them back in order by making sure the diagonal line matches up.</summary>
