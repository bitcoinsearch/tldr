    <summary>A developer named Pavol Rusnak has praised the use of Protocol Buffers in Trezor, despite the risk of adding an exotic dependency to a software project. He argues that Protocol Buffers are easy to work with and have many interoperable implementations in various languages. However, some argue that people are moving away from Protocol Buffers in favor of FlatBuffers. Another developer, Will suggests providing custom format to protobuf conversion tools so that users who prefer not to include large dependencies can convert it into their preferred format. On 15/02/2019, Luke Dashjr discussed the proposed proof-file format which provides a standard way to combine multiple proofs and associated metadata. The specification of the format is in Protocol Buffers. However, Pavol "stick" Rusnak expressed his opinion that using Protocol Buffers in software projects is not risky because it has many interoperable implementations in all possible languages and is easy to work with. He compared it to the PSBT format which was almost as complex as protobuf, but proprietary to Bitcoin, hindering adoption. He believes that had PB been used since the beginning, there would have been much more PSBT usage already. Overall, while there are debates about the pros and cons of using Protocol Buffers, it has proven to be a successful choice for Trezor.</summary>
