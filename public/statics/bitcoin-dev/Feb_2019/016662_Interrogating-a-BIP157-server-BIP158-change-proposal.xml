    <summary>In an email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Gregory Maxwell, Tamas expressed his skepticism about the commitment of a filter into Core anytime soon. He also stated that a committed filter would make light clients more reliable and attractive. Gregory accused Tamas of repeating a smear and urged him to read the previous discussions where there was significant interest from bitcoin developers to eventually commit an output filter with a significant investment of effort in improving the proposal to that end. Tamas responded by asking if there was anything technically wrong in what he had written and whether an actual action defied his observation that a commitment is not yet in sight. He also pointed out that he had written code, gathered and shared data, and showed understanding of non-technical issues.</summary>
