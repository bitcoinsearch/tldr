    <summary>Christopher Gilliard has written a proposal for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) regarding signature formats when using Bitcoin private keys. The proposal is inline with the implementation that Trezor implemented in a previous issue on Github. However, a person commenting on the proposal suggests that a more precise description of the signing/verification process should be added as it is currently not documented anywhere. They also question the use of speech regarding keys instead of focusing on signatures, which are summarized in a vague sentence inspired by reference [2]. The commenter notes that the rule for s,r being 32 bytes and the whole thing being 65 bytes with a header of 1 byte is probably the rule but is unsure where it is specified and for what purpose. The header seems completely useless, especially when extending to segwit/bech32 since compressed keys can be checked instead.</summary>
