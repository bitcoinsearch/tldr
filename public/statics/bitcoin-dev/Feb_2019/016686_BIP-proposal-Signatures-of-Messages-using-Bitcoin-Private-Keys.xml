    <summary>The Wasabi wallet is almost finished with the development of an encryption manager. The developer has requested the OP to review a proposed BIP regarding signature formats when using Bitcoin Private keys. The BIP can be found on Github here: https://github.com/cgilliard/BIP/blob/master/README.md and was written in response to this Github issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10542. The proposal is similar to what Trezor implemented in the above-mentioned issue. Feedback on the proposal is welcome, and the author is seeking guidance on how to get a BIP number assigned or any other process steps required. Additionally, the developer invites others to review/test their PR at https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/1127.</summary>
