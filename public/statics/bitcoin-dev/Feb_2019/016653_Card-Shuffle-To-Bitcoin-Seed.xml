    <summary>One suggestion for generating entropy is to roll 50+ six-sided dice, which provides about 128 bits of entropy. This method offers more certainty that the desired amount of entropy has been achieved, even if the dice are slightly biased. A shuffled deck of cards can also be used as a physical backup with good plausible deniability. To prevent others from mixing up the order of the cards, draw a diagonal line on the side of the deck using a permanent marker, from corner to corner. If the cards become mixed up, they can be put back in order by matching up the diagonal line.</summary>
