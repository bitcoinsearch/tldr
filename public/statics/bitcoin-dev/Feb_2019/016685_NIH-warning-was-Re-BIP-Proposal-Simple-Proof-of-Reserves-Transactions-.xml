    <summary>A developer named Pavol Rusnak has praised the use of Protocol Buffers in Trezor, stating that it has been a great choice despite the risk of adding an exotic dependency to a software project. He argues that Protocol Buffers are easy to work with and have many interoperable implementations in various languages. However, some argue that people are moving away from Protocol Buffers in favor of FlatBuffers. Will, another developer, suggests providing custom format to protobuf conversion tools so that users who prefer not to include large dependencies can convert it into their preferred format. Overall, while there are debates about the pros and cons of using Protocol Buffers, it has proven to be a successful choice for Trezor.</summary>
