    <summary>In a Bitcoin development thread, Jim Posen proposed a solution to prevent "input script malleability" and restrict what an attacker can do. This involves introducing a new P2P message to retrieve all prev-outputs for a given block, and verifying the scripts against the block by executing them. However, Olaoluwa Osuntokun stated that it is too late in the current deployment of the BIPs to change things around yet again. Instead, he suggests that the BIP already has measures in place for adding new filter types in the future, which may be worthwhile additions. Matt expressed confusion regarding this proposal and its potential effectiveness.</summary>
