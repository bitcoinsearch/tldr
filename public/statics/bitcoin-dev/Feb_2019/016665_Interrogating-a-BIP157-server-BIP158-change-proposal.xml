    <summary>Tamas Blummer initiated a discussion on implementing the current proposal and mentioned that he had not seen any sign to assume commitment was imminent. In response, Pieter Wuille clarified that changes in consensus rules take time and adoption of BIP157 in a limited setting where offered by trusted nodes is necessary before seeing a big push for it. According to him, BIP157 as a public network-facing service offered by untrusted full nodes is fair uninteresting. Unless changes benefit the end goal, the current BIP157 filter definition should be kept. However, there is no problem in optionally supporting other filters made by semi-trusted nodes. Wuille emphasized keeping those discussions separate from the to-be-committed-filter.</summary>
