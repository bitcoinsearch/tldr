    <summary>On 13th December 2018, Johnson Lau, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, raised a question regarding the compatibility of some proposals with NOINPUT and whether tagging would affect them. Luke-Jr, another member of the community, responded saying that this may break the situation where a wallet wants to use NOINPUT for everything, including normal L1 payments. He gave an example of a scenario where address reuse is rejected by the recipient unconditionally and the payee is considered to have burned their bitcoins by attempting it. It appears that this issue pertains to eltoo, a proposal designed to replace the current Lightning Network implementation. This proposal involves NOINPUT, which allows for multiple transactions to spend the same output without requiring additional signatures. However, Luke-Jr suggests that other proposals may also be adversely affected by tagging in a similar manner. This discussion highlights the importance of ensuring compatibility between various proposals and avoiding unintended consequences. The bitcoin-dev community plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing potential issues such as these in order to maintain the stability and security of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
