    <summary>In a discussion regarding input script malleability, Laolu suggested the introduction of a new P2P message to retrieve all prev-outputs for a given block and verify the scripts against the block by executing them. However, Matt questioned the effectiveness of this proposal in scenarios where an attacker is trying to blind you from some output by giving "undo data" where scriptPubKeys are OP_TRUE instead of the real script. Laolu responded that using input scripts can be more flexible as light clients can use them as set up or triggers for multi-party protocols such as atomic swaps. Additionally, the current filter also lends better to an eventual commitment as one cannot remove anything from it and still have it be useful for the traditional wallet use case. Laolu suggests adding the new filter type as an additional filter type and leaving it up to full node implementations that have deployed the base protocol to integrate it or not. Olaoluwa Osuntokun believes it's too late into the current deployment of the BIPs to change things around yet again, but suggests that new filter types may be worthwhile additions in the future, along with a few other filter types. Many developers are familiar with neutrino as a project and several projects in the wild have already deployed applications built on lnd+neutrino live on mainnet. Lnd+neutrino is also the only project (as far as Laolu is aware) that has fully integrated the p2p BIP 157+158 into a wallet and uses the filters for higher level applications.</summary>
