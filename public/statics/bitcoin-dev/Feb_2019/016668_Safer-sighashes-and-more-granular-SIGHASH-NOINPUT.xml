    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, has expressed his concern about the reuse of OP_MASK and SIGHASH_NOINPUT. He stated that while the danger of OP_MASK is limited to reuse-on-the-same-script, the danger of SIGHASH_NOINPUT extends further. He also mentioned that he thinks there are realistic risks associated with NOINPUT, but output tagging could be a better alternative to address those risks. This comes after discussions about alternatives to these solutions had taken place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
