    <summary>Chris has written a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) related to the signature formats used with Bitcoin private keys. The proposal can be found on GitHub and was suggested in a GitHub issue. It is worth noting that the proposal is in line with the implementation Trezor used in the same issue. Chris is seeking feedback on the proposal and is also curious about the steps needed to assign a BIP number or any other process requirements.</summary>
