    <summary>In a discussion about the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for message types, it was suggested that MSG_TX is fine and sending an "inv" to the other node at startup would work, but it's better to request it explicitly. This would allow the connecting peer to configure a bloom filter before requesting mempool contents. It was noted that it is already too heavy for mobile clients to download the entire mempool contents at startup, so support for this on the bitcoinj side would not be implemented/activated until bloom filtering is done. If this were to happen, the BIP would have to be updated to reflect that the response from mempool is filtered.Jeff Garzik commented on the proposal, stating that the current version has a much higher Just Works value. He also discussed the idea of an empty "inv", noting that it is generally better to do something unconditionally than have a response generated only under certain conditions. While unknown messages are intentionally ignored for expansion purposes, unconditionally returning a response simply provides a clear, deterministic indication that processing is complete for each invocation. Overall, the discussion focused on the most efficient ways to handle message types and requests for mempool contents, taking into account the limitations of mobile clients and the need for clear and reliable responses.</summary>
