    <summary>The author of an email to the Bitcoin development list proposes creating a starter suite of tests for the blockchain and incorporating them into Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). They suggest using Bettermeans platform for creating, reviewing, and updating tests, although they have had issues with it losing work. The author provides links to their work so far, including general acceptance tests and installation and wallet tests, as well as a wiki space they have been using. They express an interest in keeping tests informal but acknowledge that this goes against their purpose. The author suggests moving away from Bettermeans and using Mantis Bug Tracker instead for testing, citing its versatility and industry-standard status. They want to retain the voting and sub workstream style of working and already have experience with Mantis and other open source testing software. The author sees the testing of Bitcoin as similar to the testing process in the games industry. They want to take the voting/hierarchy style from Bettermeans and apply it to Mantis and test workflow. They also mention that they have a full MSDN and Technet license, as well as a vast array of machines they can use to automate testing and to test different setups.Lastly, the author discloses that they suffer from fast cycling type two bipolar disorder, but their mental health problems are being managed very well by medication. Overall, the author is advocating for a more structured and efficient testing process for Bitcoin that involves community input and collaboration.</summary>
