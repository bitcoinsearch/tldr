    <title>Warning to rawtx creators: bug in SIGHASH_SINGLE</title>

    <summary>It has been reported that the rawtx API contains a vulnerability when using SIGHASH_SINGLE. If an invalid transaction is created with this signature, any future outputs to the public key associated with the signature would be immediately steal-able by anyone. The issue could be fixed by blocking such transactions in the rawtx API rather than risking a hardfork or further complicating transaction verification. The vulnerability occurs when parsing a transaction input and the given input's index is greater than or equal to the total number of outputs in the current transaction. Bitcoind will sign the constant 1 instead of anything useful. This issue was identified in the code under SIGHASH_SINGLE in script.cpp:SignatureHash. It is important for those using the rawtx API to exercise caution when working with SIGHASH_SINGLE to avoid falling victim to this vulnerability.</summary>
