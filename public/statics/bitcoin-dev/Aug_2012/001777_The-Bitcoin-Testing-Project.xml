    <summary>In this message, Steve proposes the creation of a small starter suite of tests that can be shown to the community and incorporated into Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). He suggests using the Bettermeans platform to create the process for creating, reviewing, and updating tests, although he has had issues with it losing work. Steve provides links to his work so far, including general acceptance tests and installation and wallet tests, as well as a wiki space he has been using. He notes that the terminology he used is a bit off and that he intends to tidy it up. Steve also expresses an interest in keeping tests informal but acknowledges that this goes against their purpose. Finally, he suggests emulating Bettermeans' BIP and voting mechanism to reduce the need for vetting of tests.</summary>
