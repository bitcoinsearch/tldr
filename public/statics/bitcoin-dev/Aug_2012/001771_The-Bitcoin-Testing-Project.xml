    <summary>In this email to the Bitcoin development list, the author suggests moving away from Bettermeans and using Mantis Bug Tracker instead for testing. They want to retain the voting and sub workstream style of working. The author has experience with Mantis and other open source testing software. They see the testing of Bitcoin as similar to the testing process in the games industry.The author wants to take the voting/hierarchy style from Bettermeans and apply it to Mantis and test workflow. They already have a full MSDN and Technet license, as well as a vast array of machines they can use to automate testing and to test different setups. The author also mentions that they suffer from fast cycling type two bipolar disorder, but their mental health problems are being managed very well by medication.</summary>
