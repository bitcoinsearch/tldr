    <summary>At a pool where Wladimir works, the most common support request is from users who have withdrawn coins but can't see them in their wallets because they are not up-to-date with the block chain. To mitigate this issue, a red "(out of sync)" warning has been added to the balances for version 0.7 of bitcoin-qt GUI. However, due to the protocol's design, there is a large variance in block timings which makes it impossible to determine the up-to-date status with certainty. Therefore, a safety margin of 90 minutes is used, and the warning is shown when the last received block was generated more than 90 minutes ago.</summary>
