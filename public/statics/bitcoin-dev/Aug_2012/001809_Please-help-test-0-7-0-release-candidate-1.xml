    <summary>Bitcoin version 0.7.0 release candidate 1 binaries are now available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.7.0/test/. Users are requested to report bugs using the issue tracker at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues. Notable changes include additions to the Qt GUI, implementation of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, JSON-RPC API support, P2P networking, internal codebase and miscellaneous improvements. The UI RPC console/debug window has been added along with safety checks and tray-notifications. Two labels have also been added to the overview page that displays wallet and transaction status (obsolete or current). The options dialog has been extended and re-worked to a tabbed UI. Sign/verify message has been merged into a single window with tabbed UI. Error reporting during start-up has been improved. UI updates have been fine-grained for smoother UI during block downloads. Tray icon menu has been reorganized into a more logical order. Polling for balance change is now persistent when the number of blocks changed. The translations have been significantly improved. An 'immature balance' display has also been added on the overview page. On Windows only, ASLR and DEP for bitcoin-qt.exe have been enabled along with addition of metadata to bitcoin-qt.exe. Bitcoin Improvement Proposals implemented include BIP 22 - 'getblocktemplate' and 'submitblock' RPCs. In the JSON-RPC API, the internal HTTP server now supports HTTP/1.1, pipelined requests, and connection keep-alive. It also supports JSON-RPC 2.0 batches to encapsulate multiple JSON-RPC requests within a single HTTP request. IPv6 support and raw transaction API have been added. 'getrawmempool' has also been added to list contents of TX memory pool. In P2P networking, IPv6 support, Tor hidden service support, and attempts to fix "stuck blockchain download" problems have been added. BDB database "addr.dat" has been replaced with internally-managed "peers.dat" file containing peer address data. Lower default send buffer from 10MB to 1MB and proxy SOCKS5 is now the default. Support connecting by hostnames passed to proxy (-proxydns), -seednode connections, and use this for -dnsseed + -proxydns have all been added. Additional unit tests have been included while compile warning fixes have also been made. Debug.log upon SIGHUP has been reopened. Bash programmable completion for bitcoind(1) has been added. On supported OS's, each thread is given a useful name.
