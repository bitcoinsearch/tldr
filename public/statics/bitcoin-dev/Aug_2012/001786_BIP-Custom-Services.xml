    <summary>In an email dated August 13, 2012, Jeff Garzik discussed the inevitability of someone implementing their own P2P commands for their own client subset. He suggested making some basic rules about how to extend the P2P command set. While not opposed to this logic, there are cases where an introduction mechanism will be needed, and it would be useful to have one. Garzik believes that simple services negotiation will not work for cases where a separate P2P network is needed and that there is harm in making people think it will suffice.</summary>
