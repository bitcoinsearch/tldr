    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Jeff Garzik are discussing the issues with returning an empty "inv" in Bitcoin P2P system. Jeff had suggested that it is generally better to do something unconditionally than have a response generated only under certain conditions. However, Pieter disagrees and thinks that returning an empty "inv" is a strange way of replying "empty mempool" as Bitcoin P2P is not a request-response protocol and "inv" messages are sent where there are inventory items to send. Jeff then updates 'mempool' branch to not return "inv" if mempool is empty. In response to confirming the transmission of the mempool is complete, Pieter suggests using MSG_MEMTX instead of returning an empty "inv". But Jeff disagrees and suggests sending a ping(nonce) instead. Jeff also explains that Bitcoin P2P processes requests in-order and responds accordingly. The remote end may insert asynchronous messages into the response stream, but responses to queries are processed and returned in-order.</summary>
