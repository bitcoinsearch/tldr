    <summary>On August 2, 2012, Jeff Garzik called for a todo list for version 0.7 of the bitcoin software. Based on comments from pull-capable devs, several branches were accepted for inclusion in this version, including addnode optimization and access via RPC, transitioning to requiring block height in block coinbases, making IPv6 support optional again, and getblocktemplate. Additionally, other features such as adding a 'mempool' P2P command, extending 'getdata' behavior, and adding prioritisetransaction JSON-RPC method were deemed appropriate. Testing was still needed for certain features such as "Child-pays-for-parent / Add transaction fee later" and relaying blocks as a preview before checking transactions. Finally, the author expressed concern that the Bitcoin-Qt client should have a distinct name to avoid confusion with the overall Bitcoin software.</summary>
