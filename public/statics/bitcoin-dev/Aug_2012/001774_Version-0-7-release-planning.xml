    <summary>On August 2, 2012, Jeff Garzik suggested that the development team proceed with a release before implementing any major changes. He noted that there were no significant features to be added, but rather a collection of useful small changes. The suggestion was made in the interest of "Release Early, Release Often" and to create a checkpoint release. However, due to Gavin's vacation, the release would not occur for at least a couple of weeks. If Gavin were to appear on email or IRC, Garzik intended to try and convince him to let the team proceed with version 0.7-rc1, provided the other developers agreed.</summary>
