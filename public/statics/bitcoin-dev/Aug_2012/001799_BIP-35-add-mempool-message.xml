    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Pieter Wuille, they discuss the usefulness of nodes getting a memory pool refill at startup and the importance of returning an "inv" message even if empty. They also discuss the problem of sending unrecognized messages to nodes and suggest creating a new message type specifically asking for memory pool transactions. However, it is noted that this may not be necessary as a ping can identify whether the node is still connected and should have responded. The utility of definitively identifying whether a node supports this functionality is also debated, with some feeling it is not critical.</summary>
