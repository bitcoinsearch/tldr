    <summary>In a conversation between Wladimir and Geir on August 11th, 2012, Wladimir explains that duplicate strings are not problematic in translations because some strings are used multiple times in the program, but they may be translated differently based on context. Wladimir suggests that Qt translator fills duplicates automatically, while Transifex requires copy and paste. A discussion about using UPnP to map the listening port in bitcoin-qt follows, and Wladimir forgets about a compiler flag for this feature. Finally, Geir reports that the most common support request he receives at his pool is from users who withdraw coins but cannot see them in their wallet because it is not up-to-date with the block chain. Wladimir adds a red warning in the balances when the block chain is out of date in version 0.7 of bitcoin-qt to prevent confusion.</summary>
