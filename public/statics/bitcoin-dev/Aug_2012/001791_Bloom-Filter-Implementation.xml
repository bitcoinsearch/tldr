    <summary>The context is a message in which the writer expresses gratitude while also providing feedback. The writer suggests that updating the filter after every block download would cause a round-trip and negatively affect performance gains. They propose a solution to this issue by suggesting a way to do bulk getblocks on hundreds/thousands of blocks at a time, allowing data to stream in. The writer also suggests saving bandwidth and network round-trips by providing transactions immediately in the block using a class called CLiteMerkleTx and a class called CMerkleBlock. The latter class includes variables such as nVersion, hashPrevBlock, hashMerkleRoot, nTime, nBits, nNonce, and vMatchedTxns.</summary>
