    <summary>The Bitcoin developers are planning to release a new version of the software soon. The changes are not very significant, but they want to do an "Early Release, Early Often" for the checkpoint release. A draft of the release notes can be found on GitHub. Developers have suggested several improvements that could be included in the 0.7 release, including updates to translations, adding address groupings RPC, and extending 'getdata' behavior. Other suggestions include adding node optimization, parallelization opportunities, and optional IPv6 support. Some changes may not make it to the final release. Developers are encouraged to contribute directly to the release notes if they feel there is missing information.</summary>
