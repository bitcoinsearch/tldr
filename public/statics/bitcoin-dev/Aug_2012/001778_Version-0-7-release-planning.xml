    <summary>On August 2, 2012, Jeff Garzik wrote to announce the consensus that the team should release a new version of Bitcoin before any major landmarks features, such as leveldb or ultraprune, were implemented. Despite the lack of any significant changes, the new release contained several small modifications that would make it useful. Garzik noted that this was an excellent opportunity for the team to "Release Early, Release Often," and create a checkpoint release. In his response, Geir H. Hansen inquired about two possible new features: options to limit block sizes and prioritize paid versus free transactions. He also suggested that the bitcoin-qt GUI could be updated to make it more obvious to users why they might not see new transactions in their wallets. Hansen then reported that he had just updated the Norwegian translation on Transifex and cautioned the team that many of the languages were only approximately 50% translated. He also listed a few odd duplicated strings, including one referencing UPnP mapping the listening port with default values of 0 and 1 when listening.</summary>
