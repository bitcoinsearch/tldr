    <summary>In a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, Yuri S VB has introduced a password format that improves upon BIP39. The proposed format allows for meaningful and themed sentences with a regular grammatical structure, while maintaining the same entropy/checksum and total bits/non-repeating leading digits ratios as BIP39. The proposal can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/Yuri-SVB/formosa. Anecdotal experiments suggest that less than one hour of moderate concentration is enough for long-term memorization of 128 + 4 bits (equivalent to the 12 words standard of BIP39) if a theme of interest is employed. Yuri S VB offers the proposal to colleagues for scrutiny and invites any questions or concerns.</summary>
