    <summary>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ali Sherief expressed concern over the recent congestion in the Bitcoin mempool caused by high volume side projects such as BRC-20. He argued that worthless tokens like these threaten the normal use of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency. If the volume does not die down in the next few weeks, he suggested taking action through BIPs and/or commits into the Bitcoin Core codebase to curtail the loophole in BIP 342 which has allowed unintended consequences. An alternative would be to enforce censorship at the node level and introduce a run-time option to instantly prune all non-standard Taproot transactions. Sherief acknowledged that some may have criticisms about this solution but emphasized the responsibility to find a solution that fits everyone's common ground.</summary>
