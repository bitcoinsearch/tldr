    <title>Coinjoin with less steps using ALL|ANYONECANPAY</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the use of ALL|ANYONECANPAY sighash flag in a coinjoin implementation to reduce some steps in the process. However, using this flag can lead to potential problems such as banned inputs and DoS attacks in later stages of the coinjoin round. The code used in ln-vortex for verifying PSBT on the client side is shared in the email thread for reference. The proposer plans to use this approach in joinstr if there are no major drawbacks and it can be implemented by other coinjoin implementations. The email also highlights some issues with using the ALL|ANYONECANPAY flag, such as the possibility of coordinator adding its own inputs, input types or amount being added causing a lack of uniformity, and the risk of getting "tainted" coins.</summary>
