    <summary>In a recent email thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Murch proposed the creation of a shared terminology document to avoid confusion during discussions about transactions. He noted that conversations often get sidetracked by establishing a shared vocabulary, and that there are many competing terms for transaction components. Murch has drafted an informational BIP which proposes terminology for various components and aspects of transactions. The proposal does not aim for perfect consistency, but rather to establish a shared vocabulary. The draft can be found on GitHub. Establishing a shared terminology will help in minimizing miscommunication and speeding up the process of coming to social consensus on issues.</summary>
