    <summary>The Bitcoin mempool has been experiencing massive congestion due to high volume side projects like BRC-20, causing real Bitcoin transactions to be priced out. This threatens the smooth and normal use of the network as a peer-to-peer digital currency. Some are calling for action to be taken, either through BIPs and/or commits into the Bitcoin Core codebase, or by introducing a run-time option to instantly prune all non-standard Taproot transactions. Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since day 1, but the existing filters weren't extended to Taproot transactions. Luke suggests addressing this bugfix, which doesn't need to wait for a major release, or trying a more narrow approach like OP_RETURN (ie, what "Ordisrespector" does). Pruning is not an alternative to spam filtering. The community indirectly allowed this to happen, so there is a responsibility to find a solution that fits everyone's common ground to ensure that this kind of congestion can never happen again using Taproot.</summary>
