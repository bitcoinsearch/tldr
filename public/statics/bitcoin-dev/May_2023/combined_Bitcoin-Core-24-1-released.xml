    <summary>The release of Bitcoin Core version 24.1 has been announced by Michael Ford on May 19, 2023 via bitcoin-dev mailing list. The new version can be downloaded from the official website or through BitTorrent, which includes several trackers with one containing a typo in its subdomain that was later corrected by Sjors. This version of Bitcoin Core comes with various bug fixes and performance improvements along with updated translations. Users can report any bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub and subscribe to receive security and update notifications.For upgrading, users should shut down an older version and then run the installer on Windows or copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` on macOS or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` on Linux. However, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems, as it is supported and tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. Bitcoin Core 24.1 includes several improvements related to P2P, RPC, and other APIs, Build System, Wallet, and GUI changes. For instance, wallet users can migrate their wallet by specifying a wallet name and passphrase, reuse change dest when re-creating TX with avoidpartialspends, and properly handle "unknown" Address Type. In addition, GUI changes include loading PSBTs using istreambuf_iterator rather than istream_iterator and correctly limiting the overview transaction list.Lastly, the release credits everyone who contributed directly or indirectly towards the release including Andrew Chow, Anthony Towns, Hennadii Stepanov, John Moffett, Jon Atack, Marco Falke, Martin Zumsande, Matthew Zipkin, Michael Ford, pablomartin4btc, Sebastian Falbesoner, Suhas Daftuar, Thomas Nguyen, Vasil Dimov, and those who helped with translations on Transifex.</summary>
