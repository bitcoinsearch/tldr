    <summary>In an email exchange between AdamISZ and Lloyd Fournier via bitcoin-dev, they discuss the usefulness of single signer adaptors. Fournier argues that if a secret key is held for X and a signature adaptor is created with encryption key Y for message m, any signature on m published reveals the secret on Y to the holder of the secret key for X, making it a useful property in theory and practice. AdamISZ initially struggles to understand this concept but eventually acknowledges his error and admits to having a misconception about adaptors for years. They also discuss the framing of s' = k - t +H(R|P|m)x vs s' = k + H(R+T|P|m)x and a potential variant of the canonical adaptor based swap. Fournier clarifies that he was not referencing the DLC oracle attestation protocol, but rather pointing out that DLC client implementations have been using single signer adaptor signatures as signature encryption in practice for years for transaction signatures, making them a pretty useful thing. The conversation ends on a cordial note with cheers exchanged.</summary>
