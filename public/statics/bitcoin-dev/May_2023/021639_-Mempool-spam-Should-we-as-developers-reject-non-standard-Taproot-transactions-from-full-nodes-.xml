    <summary>In an email exchange between Ali and Peter Todd, Ali expressed his opinion that if the format of spam transactions is addressed, it will cause the mempool to relax and give time to regroup and work on Layer 2 before the next onslaught of spam transactions using a slightly different format begins. On the other hand, Peter Todd stated that miners are making millions of dollars from these inscription transactions, and many people like him will continue to run nodes that do not attempt to block inscriptions. He added that the flood of BRC-20 transactions embeds very little data in the chain per transaction and could easily be adapted to use OP_RETURN or any number of other data embedding schemes. In response to Luke Dashjr's suggestion of trying a more narrow approach like OP_RETURN, Peter Todd pointed out that it doesn't really even need to wait for a major release since it's a bugfix.</summary>
