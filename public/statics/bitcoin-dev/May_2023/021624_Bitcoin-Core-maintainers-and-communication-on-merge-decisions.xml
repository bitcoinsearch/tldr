    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson expressed concern over Bitcoin Core maintainers' authority to decide on adding or blocking new maintainers. In response, David A. Harding explained that it is common for organizations to have its current members choose new members of the board or governance group. However, Bryan Kanzure argued that Bitcoin Core is a volunteer project where independent contributors merge different pull requests or patches. Github controls are in place because that is how Github works. Furthermore, there is a secondary issue of people confusing Bitcoin Core with the bitcoin protocol in general. To understand Bitcoin governance better, one can refer to articles such as those by Jameson Lopp and Alex B. and a primer on Bitcoin governance by Bitcoin Magazine.</summary>
