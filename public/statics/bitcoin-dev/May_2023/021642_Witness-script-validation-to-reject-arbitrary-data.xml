    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, a user named Moth expressed concern about inscriptions being inserted between two specific flags. However, Peter Todd explained that this is just an artificial limitation of the current inscription protocol and there are endless ways to embed arbitrary data in Bitcoin transactions. He also mentioned that the flood of BRC-20 inscriptions currently happening are very small and could have easily used OP_RETURN outputs or any number of other data encoding techniques. Therefore, blocking such use cases is hopeless. The purpose of the current flood of BRC-20 inscriptions is to create a new set of assets via an auction, which doesn't require any data to be embedded in the chain at all. Todd believes that blocking these types of transactions is truly hopeless.</summary>
