    <summary>In the Lightning network, payments are routed through ASPs, which may fail to forward HTLC(s) after double-spending their pool transaction. However, if they forward HTLC(s) before double-spending, it becomes a footgun. Ark stands out because users can pay Lightning invoices with their zero-conf vTXOs in a collaborative manner, without waiting for on-chain confirmations. This is different from swap-ins, where users should wait for on-chain confirmations before revealing their preimage of the HODL invoice to avoid the risk of having the swap service provider steal their sats by double-spending their zero-conf HTLC.</summary>
