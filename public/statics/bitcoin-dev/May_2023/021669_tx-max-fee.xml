    <summary>The email conversation between Bitcoin developers discusses the use case of paying more fees than outputs to incentivize honest mining during state-level censorship attacks. One developer proposes changing the "max fee" rule to output amounts, but another argues that it is not a viable solution and could be easily bypassed by creating multiple transactions with small fees instead of one large fee. The second developer suggests preparing all transactions upfront, signing them, and broadcasting them all at once to avoid maintaining balances and using change addresses. They also mention the possibility of using HD wallets and algorithms to deterministically recreate the whole transaction tree. The conversation includes an example of how someone could move 1 BTC and pay 2 BTC as fees by creating multiple transactions and distributing the fees between them. Finally, the discussion touches on op_ctv, which allows many users to pool fees and share a single UTXO.</summary>
