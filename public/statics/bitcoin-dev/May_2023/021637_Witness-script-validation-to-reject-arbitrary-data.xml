    <summary>There is a concern that banning the storage of arbitrary/non-functional data could lead to people abusing useful data, causing more harm than good. A prime example of this is Stamps, which stores Inscription-like data in fake outputs, using the Counterparty spec, and consuming UTXO set storage. The issue of the UTXO set getting too big is a more significant problem than the chain getting bigger at closer to 4MB/10mins than the expected ~1MB/10mins. Regarding whether it was an oversight to lift the size limit for witness scripts as part of Taproot, there is no clear-cut answer. If Taproot is to enable large useful scripts, it's hard/impossible to have an undefeatable definition of "not useful" to filter out. It might be wise not to incentivize people to do something worse by attempting to censor what they're currently doing, given that it could be even worse. The fear is that if we start banning things, people will just find other ways to work around the ban.</summary>
