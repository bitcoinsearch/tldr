    <summary>On May 12, 2023, Robin Linus published a research paper titled "ZeroSync: Introducing Validity Proofs to Bitcoin" that introduces ZeroSync as a proof system that addresses scalability challenges with Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARKs). The technology compresses the entire Bitcoin blockchain into a compact proof of validity, enabling instant verification and unlocking various innovative applications. The prototype implementation of a chain state proof utilizes the Cairo language, Utreexo, and recursive STARKs. Chain state proofs require no consensus changes, which is crucial as forks in Bitcoin are challenging to implement and achieve consensus for. Additionally, zkCoins, a client-side validation protocol combined with zero-knowledge SNARKs, was introduced, drastically improving privacy and throughput of token transactions.The groundbreaking compression capabilities of SNARKs initiated a paradigm shift in cryptocurrency design, and ZeroSync pioneers their application to Bitcoin. However, there are two serious issues with this proposal; firstly, it creates an alternative implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, which may fail to implement an exact copy of the consensus rules, leading to potential forks. Secondly, if the tech advances to the point where proof-generation is fast enough to happen in real-time, Bitcoin miners adopting it along with other widespread adoption may cause Bitcoin to lose its decentralization. Weiji emailed Robin to enquire about his plans to implement a SNARK verifier on Bitcoin's base layer. Robin responded by sharing his research on ZeroSync, which enables diverse applications, including quick bootstrapping of full nodes, trustless light clients, enhanced Lightning Network privacy, and secure cross-chain bridges. He also introduced zkCoins, which drastically improves privacy and throughput of token transactions. Robin welcomes comments and questions from the Bitcoin dev community about the paper. In a conversation between Weiji and Robin, the latter explains his plans to implement a SNARK verifier on Bitcoin's base layer in the long-term, while they plan to experiment with Simplicity on the Liquid sidechain when it gets activated. Robin acknowledges Weiji's proposal for a new opcode OP_ZKP to enable the Bitcoin network to verify zkp proofs, but mentions that there are many competing proof systems with different trade-offs making it hard to establish consensus over a particular kind of op_snark_verify opcode. Finally, Robin invites Weiji to join their Telegram group if he would like to chat about SNARKs on Bitcoin.</summary>
