    <summary>In a thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson expressed his concern that current maintainers of Bitcoin Core will have the power to block proposed new maintainers for unknown and potentially inconsistent reasons. The discussion arose in response to a pull request on GitHub, with Steve Lee suggesting that anyone can express their views on the matter. However, Michael argued that the rationale for blocking one maintainer does not necessarily apply to future potential maintainers, and that there is no discussion around this point. Bryan Bishop added that Bitcoin Core is a volunteer project of independent contributors, and that the current maintainers should not have absolute power over who becomes a new maintainer. He also provided links to articles that explain the decentralized nature of Bitcoin governance. Michael's concern highlights the need for transparent and consistent criteria for selecting new maintainers of Bitcoin Core, in order to maintain the decentralized nature of the project and prevent any undue influence or power consolidation among existing maintainers. It remains to be seen how this issue will be addressed moving forward.</summary>
