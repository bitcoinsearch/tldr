    <summary>Michael Folkson raised a concern regarding the decision-making process for adding or blocking proposed new maintainers by the current maintainers of Bitcoin Core. He suggested that democratic institutions may not be a good fit for highly technical software projects. It is up to individuals to decide if they believe the current maintainers are capable of moving Bitcoin Core in the desired direction. However, several initiatives championed by the current maintainers received positive support from contributors which is a healthy sign. AJ Towns has already answered the question on what to do if it is concluded that the current maintainers are ill-suited or malicious. Dave believes that internal project decisions such as the addition of merge access and communication in PRs should be discussed in dedicated communication channels instead of the mailing list.</summary>
