    <summary>The lack of Lightning wallets for desktop is a major issue in the Bitcoin ecosystem. While mobile wallets are not a problem, there are only two desktop builds that support Lightning: Electrum and Zap Wallet. Interacting with the LN node directly is an alternative, but it would be better if GUI wallets were available. Michael Folkson suggests rejecting any transaction where the fee is higher than the sum of the outputs, but Ali Sherief disagrees as this may impinge on valid use cases. Despite criticisms from absolutists/libertarians/maximum-freedom advocates, a solution needs to be found to prevent congestion caused by side projects such as BRC-20. One option is to introduce a run-time option to instantly prune all non-standard Taproot transactions.</summary>
