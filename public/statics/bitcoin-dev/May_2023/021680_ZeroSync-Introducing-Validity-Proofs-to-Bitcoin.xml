    <summary>Weiji emailed Robin to enquire about his plans to implement a SNARK verifier on Bitcoin's base layer. Weiji had earlier proposed a new opcode OP_ZKP to enable the Bitcoin network to verify zkp proofs, which requires a soft fork. Robin responded by sharing his research on ZeroSync, the first-ever proof system addressing Bitcoinâ€™s scalability challenges with Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARKs). ZeroSync compresses the entire Bitcoin blockchain into a compact proof of validity, enabling instant verification and unlocking various innovative applications. The prototype implementation of a chain state proof was done using the Cairo language, Utreexo, and recursive STARKs. Robin's work enables diverse applications, including quick bootstrapping of full nodes, trustless light clients, enhanced Lightning Network privacy, and secure cross-chain bridges. Chain state proofs require no consensus changes, which is crucial as forks in Bitcoin are challenging to implement and achieve consensus for. He also introduced zkCoins, a client-side validation protocol combined with zeroknowledge SNARKs, drastically improving privacy and throughput of token transactions. In combination with future Bitcoin features, such as Simplicity, zkCoins also enables private and more scalable BTC transactions.The groundbreaking compression capabilities of SNARKs initiated a paradigm shift in cryptocurrency design, and ZeroSync is pioneering their application to Bitcoin. The full paper can be found at https://zerosync.org/zerosync.pdf. Robin welcomes comments and questions from the bitcoin dev community about the paper.</summary>
