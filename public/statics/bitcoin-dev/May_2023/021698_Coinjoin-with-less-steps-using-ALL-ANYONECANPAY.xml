    <summary>The possibility of reducing some steps in CoinJoin by using ALL|ANYONECANPAY sighash flag has been discussed on the Bitcoin Developer mailing list. While this method can reduce steps, it poses some risks. One such risk is that there is no way to verify beforehand if the other inputs are the desired inputs added to the transaction. This leaves the possibility for bad things to happen, including the coordinator adding its own inputs, causing the user to pay fees for no privacy gain. Additionally, lower fee rates could lead to longer transaction times, and different input types or amounts could cause a loss of uniformity across inputs. The code in ln-vortex verifies the PSBT on the client side, and a proof of concept has been provided. The sender plans to implement this in joinstr and encourages others to use it as well.</summary>
