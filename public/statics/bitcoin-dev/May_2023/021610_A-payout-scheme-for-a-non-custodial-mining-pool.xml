    <summary>In recent discussions about covenants and payment pools, there has been a lack of agreement on their precise definitions. One potential approach to understanding these concepts is to examine use-cases and identify common properties in order to create clear definitions. One particular focus is on non-custodial payment pools which allow miners to share ownership of the coinbase reward, making the pool non-custodial and less centralized. The authors propose a scheme for payment trees using ANYPREVOUT signatures that can be used for future payment pools, allowing for safe creation, merging, and withdrawal of funds. This scheme is unique for all miners and may be generalized to decentralized pools, although the authors assume a centralized pool in their work. The results show promise in terms of occupied space on the blockchain, especially if the pool is KYC. The authors present their work as an RFC and invite comments and feedback from the community.</summary>
