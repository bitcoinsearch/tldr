    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has shared their discovery that ALL|ANYONECANPAY sighash flag could be used to reduce some steps in coinjoin. The process involves registering outputs, where one user creates a signed PSBT with 1 input, all registered outputs and the aforementioned sighash flag. Other participants then add their inputs to the PSBT before finalizing and broadcasting the transaction. A proof of concept has been shared on GitLab, and the developer plans to use this method in joinstr if there are no major drawbacks. The technique could also be implemented by other coinjoin implementations.</summary>
