    <summary>The use of 0-conf transactions is considered unsafe due to the risk of double-spending, which can invalidate the transaction. However, a future extension of Ark may utilize data manipulation opcodes to disincentivize this behavior by constraining the ASP's nonce in their signatures. In the event of a double-spend in a pool transaction, users can forge an ASP's signature to claim their previously redeemed vTXOs, resulting in an inbound liquidity-like tradeoff without compromising the protocol design. Currently, waiting for on-chain confirmations is necessary to consider a payment 'final'. Despite this, it is still possible to pay lightning invoices with zero-conf coins. Ark offers immediate availability with delayed finality.</summary>
