    <summary>In an email sent on May 9, 2023, Erik Aronesty proposed a new idea to prevent spam transactions on the Bitcoin network. He suggested that non-economic users should be required to pad their change outputs with extra bitcoin and send it back to themselves in order to make it more difficult for them to broadcast non-economic transactions. However, this idea was met with criticism as users could easily evade it by holding enough bitcoin and sending it back to themselves, rendering it useless. Additionally, padding the change would require holding extra BTC in a hot wallet, which comes with a cost. Spendthrifts could also pay miners off-network to bypass the rule but having to do so would serve as a suitable penalty for broadcasting a non-economic transaction.</summary>
