    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty asked if it's possible to change the transaction "max fee" to output amounts. He believes that this would help prevent spam/DOS attacks. However, Peter Todd responded by saying that with CPFP (child-pays-for-parent) transactions, it often makes sense for the fee to be larger than the output amounts. Todd also mentioned that this proposal could harm applications like his OpenTimestamps service.</summary>
