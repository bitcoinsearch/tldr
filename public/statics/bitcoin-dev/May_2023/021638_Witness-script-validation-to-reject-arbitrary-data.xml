    <summary>In a message sent on May 8, 2023, Moth proposed the idea of having a validation check to reject witness scripts that have arbitrary data between OP_FALSE and OP_IF flags. The purpose of this check would be to prevent people from overloading the network with transactions geared solely for ordinals and brc-20 tokens, while still allowing all the benefits of taproot. However, there are many other ways to "inscribe" data into the blockchain, which could make this validation check ineffective.Some individuals had hoped for a slightly larger OP_RETURN to store a tagged root of a hash-tree (~128-512 bytes) for various use cases such as open timestamps, ION, and Gordian Envelope. The latter consolidates large sets of proofs into a hash used for L2 proofs-of-inclusion. All of these techniques were held off for years due to objections to putting anything on-chain. However, now there are concerns about the inscription technique that freeloads on the network mempool, the validation network, and volunteer unpruned full nodes. Christopher Allen, who hosts an alternative explora instance, is frustrated with the free-rider problem as inscriptions combined with DOS attacks on Tor is making it more expensive for him to host and maintain his free privacy service. He suggests finding a solution to this problem, but is unsure what it might be. Relevant threads on raising the limit on OP_RETURN were shared in the message, but it is unclear whether this would be a viable solution.</summary>
