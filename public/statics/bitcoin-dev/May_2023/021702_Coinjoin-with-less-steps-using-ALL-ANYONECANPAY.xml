    <summary>In a recent post to the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion, a user named AliceXBt suggested using ALL|ANYONECANPAY sighash flag in order to reduce some steps in CoinJoin. This method involves registering outputs and creating a signed PSBT with one input, all registered outputs, and the ALL|ANYONECANPAY sighash flag. Other participants then add their inputs to the PSBT before finalizing and broadcasting the transaction. While this approach could potentially reduce some CoinJoin steps, there are concerns about security. Specifically, adding inputs from a coordinator or lower fee rates could compromise CoinJoin's privacy benefits. However, these issues can be managed through client-side validation and by disallowing certain types of inputs. In addition, Joinstr will use NIP38/48 channels for CoinJoin rounds to ensure only participants in a CoinJoin round are aware of details. Overall, while ALL|ANYONECANPAY may offer some benefits, it remains important to consider potential drawbacks and take steps to mitigate risks.</summary>
