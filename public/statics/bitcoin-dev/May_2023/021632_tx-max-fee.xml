    <summary>On May 7th, 2023, Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev proposed changing the maximum fee for transactions to output amounts. He suggests that this would help with certain spam and denial-of-service attacks that Satoshi warned about. However, Peter Todd argues against this proposal, stating that it would negatively impact applications such as his OpenTimestamps service. Additionally, Todd notes that with Child Pays for Parent (CPFP), a transaction may need to have a larger fee than the output amounts. The proposal to change the maximum fee for transactions continues to be a topic of debate within the bitcoin-dev community.</summary>
