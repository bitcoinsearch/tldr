    <summary>There are two possible options for allocating space in the block for non-standard transactions if backward compatibility and other types of transactions are not considered. The first option is to allocate only up to 10% of the space in the block for non-standard transactions, which means that all senders of non-standard transactions will have to compete with each other, and it's only 10% of the space allocated for other types of transactions. In the absence of non-standard transactions, all space of the block will be given to standard ones, and in the absence of standard transactions - all space of the block will be given to non-standard ones. This model will have to be supported by the majority if bitcoin-chain was created primarily for standard transactions.The second option is to change the architecture in such a way that the onchain ordinals transaction became much more expensive, which would force them to go to their own type of the Lightning Network (LN). This would be a kind of justice, like the displacement of small transactions from the onchain to the LN, which is already happening now. Aleksandr Kwaskoff is the President of NGO FinTechAssociation and believes that success is possible with these options.</summary>
