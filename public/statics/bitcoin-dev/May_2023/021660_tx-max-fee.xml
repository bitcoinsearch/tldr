    <summary>The discussion revolves around changing the "max fee" rule to output amounts in a Bitcoin transaction. The current rule states that a fee cannot be greater than the sum of outputs with consideration of CPFP in the mempool. The proposal is met with skepticism as it may lead to more transactions and higher fees overall. The argument is that one can always replace a single transaction moving one BTC as fees with multiple transactions, each paying one satoshi per virtual byte. This would consume more block space and result in higher fees. The proposed change may only be useful for spam/DOS type attacks but not for general use.</summary>
