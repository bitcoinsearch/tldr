    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list revolves around the concern that current maintainers will have the power to decide which proposed new maintainers to add and which to block. A contributor points out that this is not how Bitcoin Core should function, as it is a volunteer project of independent contributors merging different pull requests or patches. The controls on GitHub are merely because that is how GitHub works. Additionally, there is a secondary issue of people tending to confuse Bitcoin Core with the bitcoin protocol in general. Multiple links are provided to articles discussing this issue, including one on who controls Bitcoin Core and another on the Tao of Bitcoin development. Overall, the discussion highlights the need for clear governance structures in open-source projects like Bitcoin Core.</summary>
