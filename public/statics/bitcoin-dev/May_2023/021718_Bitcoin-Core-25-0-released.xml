    <summary>Bitcoin Core version v25.0 is now available for upgrading, which includes new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. The release is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. Compatibility with other Unix-like systems is not guaranteed.Notable changes include allowing transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above by mempool and relay policy, a new RPC called scanblocks that returns relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors, and updated JSON-RPC methods that accept a new named parameter called args that can contain positional parameter values. In addition, the verifychain RPC will now return false if the checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, sendrawtransaction has a new optional argument, maxburnamount, any transaction containing an unspendable output with a value greater than maxburnamount will not be submitted, and the testmempoolaccept RPC now returns two additional results within the "fees" result.Wallet updates include the minconf option that allows a user to specify the minimum number of confirmations a UTXO being spent has, and the maxconf option, which allows specifying the maximum number of confirmations. Rescans for descriptor wallets are now significantly faster if compact block filters (BIP158) are available, and wallet passphrases may now contain null characters. Address purpose strings are now also restricted to the currently known values of "send", "receive", and "refund". In the createwallet, loadwallet, unloadwallet, and restorewallet RPCs, the warning string field is deprecated in favor of a warnings field that returns a JSON.To upgrade, users running an older version should shut it down, wait until it has completely shut down, then run the installer on Windows or copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt on macOS or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt on Linux.This release of Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1 includes a number of changes and improvements, including the removal of the "warning" field from RPCs in v26, GUI changes, a new REST endpoint for fetching state info regarding deployments of consensus changes, updates to the binary verification script, and various low-level changes to the RPC server.Descriptor wallets can now spend coins sent to P2WSH Miniscript descriptors. Additionally, the JSON-RPC server now rejects requests where a parameter is specified multiple times with the same name, instead of silently overwriting earlier parameter values with later ones, and RPC `listsinceblock` now accepts an optional `label` argument to fetch incoming transactions having the specified label.The contributors to this release include individuals such as Amiti Uttarwar, Andrew Chow, Antoine Poinsot, Aurèle Oulès, Ethan Heilman, Jonas Schnelli, Pieter Wuille, and many others. The full list of contributors is available in the credits section. This release demonstrates the ongoing commitment of the Bitcoin community to improving and evolving the technology.</summary>
