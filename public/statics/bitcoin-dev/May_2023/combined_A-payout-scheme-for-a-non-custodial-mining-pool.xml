    <summary>The Bitcoin community has been discussing payment pools and covenants, but there is no clear definition for these concepts. To clarify this issue, authors have proposed a non-custodial payment pool scheme that allows miners to share the ownership of the coinbase reward. This scheme uses payment trees which are trees of transactions redistributing funds to participants using their addresses as leaves. The root contains the payment pool's funds on an n-of-n multisig. The scheme uses ANYPREVOUT signatures, allowing miners to collectively construct a payment tree that "waits" for rewards when miners find a block. The proposed scheme allows for safe creation, merging, and withdrawal of funds, and it is unique for all miners. It can be generalized to decentralized pools, although the authors assume a centralized pool in their work. The scheme shows promise in terms of occupied space on the blockchain, especially if the pool is KYC. The lack of cooperation among pool participants to enable cooperative withdrawal can be a huge denial-of-service factor, but this can be fought with fees to enter the pool. A deterrence is the timelocking of the balance in case of non-cooperative closure. The use of replay security ensures that a pool participant cannot replay its withdrawal, partially or in whole, after withdrawing all their balances. While most payment pool structures use precompiled transactions for safe withdrawal, this isn't feasible if every extranonce tried by every miner requires a set of precompiled transactions. The average space occupied on the blockchain is compared with P2Pool, and the results show promise. Past force-closure of pools can be consumed as proof of good conduct by future co-participants in a payment pool. The authors present their work as an RFC and invite comments and feedback from the community.</summary>
