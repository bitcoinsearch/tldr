    <title>Full-RBF Peering Bitcoin Core v24.1 Released</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 24.1 is now available with Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code, along with some additional minor updates. This version advertises a FULL_RBF service bit when mempoolfullrbf=1 is set and connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. The aim is to ensure that a core group of nodes reliably propagates full-rbf replacements, not everyone needs to run it but more people running it would be helpful. For those wondering why they should run full-rbf, there is a blog post by Peter Todd explaining the reasons. Additionally, there are even hats available related to this update.</summary>
