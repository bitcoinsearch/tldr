    <summary>In Lightning, there is a risk associated with opening a zero-conf channel to receive payments over Lightning. The risk arises as one has to wait for the channel to confirm before revealing the preimage for payment. If not done, the LSP takes sender's money but double-spends on the channel. On the other hand, Ark ensures "absolute atomicity" by using ATLCs instead of HTLCs. With the use of ATLCs, users can receive and forward payments without waiting for on-chain confirmations. In case of double-spend attempts, the entire atomicity breaks and the ASP cannot redeem senders' vTXO(s) if they double-spend recipients' vTXO(s).</summary>
