    <summary>The email conversations revolve around the Ark protocol and its various mechanics. The protocol allows for instant atomic swaps between service providers and customers, with users being able to pay lightning invoices using their zero-conf vTXOs collaboratively without waiting for on-chain confirmations. The use of 0-conf transactions is generally considered unsafe due to the risk of double-spending, but a future extension of Ark may disincentivize this behavior by constraining the ASP's nonce in their signatures.The Ark protocol involves Alice, a service provider, broadcasting an unconfirmed transaction that pays three outputs every five seconds: a change output, a connector output, and a commitment output. Bob can deposit 1 BTC with Alice using an unsigned Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) and collaborate with her to withdraw his funds in one of several ways. The protocol also allows for making conditioned and unconditioned payments, with the former involving a secret being revealed by Carol, which would allow her to claim the funds, or allowing Bob to claim them after a timeout.There are risks associated with relying on 0-conf transactions, both in Lightning and in the case of swap-ins, as ASPs can double-spend their pool transaction and prevent recipients from actually being able to rely on any received funds existing until the next pool transaction is confirmed. However, in Ark, users can receive and forward payments without waiting for on-chain confirmations using ATLCs instead of HTLCs. In case of double-spend attempts, the entire atomicity breaks, and the ASP cannot redeem senders' vTXO(s) if they double-spend recipients' vTXO(s).A new second-layer protocol design called Ark has been released, which is an alternative approach to the Lightning network. Ark enables users to send and receive funds without introducing liquidity constraints. The protocol consumes significantly less on-chain footprint than Lightning as there is no concept of opening and closing channels. Instead, it uses virtual UTXOs (vTXOs) that live off-chain and must be spent within four weeks of being received.When a payment is made on the protocol, existing vTXOs are redeemed and new ones are created. To improve anonymity, vTXO values are restricted to a set range of sats. Users can acquire vTXOs from someone who already owns them or use a process called lifting, which allows users to lift their on-chain UTXOs off the chain for a 1:1 virtual UTXO. Ark's anonymous, off-chain payments are enabled through an untrusted intermediary called the Ark Service Provider (ASP). ASPs provide liquidity to the network and charge liquidity fees, similar to how Lightning service providers work. ASPs create rapid, blinded coinjoin sessions every five seconds known as pools. A user joins a pool session to make a payment by registering their vTXOs to spend and vTXOs for intended recipients. Ark can interoperate with Lightning by attaching HTLCs and PTLCs to a pool transaction, just like ATLCs and connectors. Payments are credited every five seconds but settled every ten minutes. Payments are credited immediately because users donâ€™t have to wait for on-chain confirmations to spend their zero-conf vTXOs further.In terms of utilizing Ark for depositing BTC, Bob wants to deposit 1 BTC with Alice, so he asks his friend Charlie to send 1 BTC to an on-chain Bitcoin address. There are three things Bob can do: unilaterally withdraw, collaboratively withdraw, or collaboratively trade commitments. Collaboratively trading commitments involves crafting transactions containing commitment outputs, connector outputs, and change outputs.Dave discusses the capital requirements and costs associated with using Bitcoin as a base layer for internal transfers. Dave suggests that Alice, who has one million customers, would need to keep several billion dollars worth of BTC in a hot wallet to serve all her customers as commitment outputs can't be spent by Alice for four weeks. He asserts that Alice needs to have enough capital on hand to pay out all amounts involved in mixing coins, paying lightning invoices, and making internal transfers.Ark can be used for three purposes: mixing coins, paying Lightning invoices, and making internal transfers. It is interoperable with Lightning, which means it can be used to pay Lightning invoices without waiting for on-chain confirmations as well. Users can make internal money transfers using Ark funds without introducing inbound liquidity assumptions. However, the recipient-end has to wait for several on-chain confirmations to consider their payment final. Alice may prove to users that no funds they receive in a payment derive from any deposit less than safe_confirmation_depth blocks.There is also discussion around the risks involved in designing a non-custodial L2 payment system, and the importance of testing code for footguns before deploying it in production. There are concerns about what happens when pool transactions are created by ASPs every five seconds and what prevents the ASP from taking all the money before it can turn into a real UTXO.
