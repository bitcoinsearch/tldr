    <summary>A proposed alternative approach to Bitcoin transaction relay, called Nostr, aims to address limitations in the current P2P system that can negatively impact applications such as Lightning. One limitation is the inability to relay transaction packages, which can result in expiring HTLCs and fund losses. The solution allows miners to listen for broadcasted transaction packages and insert them into their local mempool, delegating responsibility of dealing with DoS threats to the relays themselves. Implementing Nostr as a relay mechanism also has potential to democratize access to miner mempools, leveling the playing field in the Bitcoin network. There are paid Nostr relays already in operation that would result in a clear separation between the Bitcoin transaction layer and DoS protection. It is suggested that transactions could be encrypted while publishing them as Nostr events to maintain user privacy. However, there are concerns that encrypted transactions could be fake and distort the view clients have on the mempool. Incentives for mining pools to include these transactions in their blocks are discussed, particularly if they use a higher fee rate compared to transactions in the normal mempool used by bitcoin nodes. Out-of-band payment is suggested as an option in case the fee included in the transaction itself is insufficient and CPFP/RBF is impossible or impractical. The conversation also discusses the concept of weak blocks and block templates, and how they could be used to improve the efficiency and profitability of miners. A weak block is a block whose header doesn't hash to a low enough value to be included in the chain. Miners could relay weak blocks through Nostr to full nodes and other miners to compensate for the reduced effectiveness of BIP152 compact block relay caused by custom transactions not seen by typical relay nodes. It is proposed that Nostr could provide an interesting playground for experimenting with various relay and mining ideas.</summary>
