    <summary>On Bitcoin-dev, Christopher Allen initiated a discussion on raising the limit on OP_RETURN. However, it was concluded that there are no reasons to impose limits as people will find workarounds and fees will regulate this. The question of how to control the value of what is stored was also raised. It was suggested that instead of storing something directly, one should store a reference to it using hashes and/or signatures which cannot be done with OP_RETURN today. The issue of freeriders was also discussed, with suggestions to avoid them impacting the whole network and increasing decentralization among miners. Finally, the idea of the market self-regulating when ordinal meme stuff/BRC20 proves to have zero value was mentioned.</summary>
