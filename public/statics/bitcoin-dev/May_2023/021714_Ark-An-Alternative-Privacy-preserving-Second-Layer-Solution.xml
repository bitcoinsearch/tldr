    <summary>The email thread discusses the Ark protocol and its mechanics. The Ark protocol allows instant atomic swaps between service providers and customers, with various options for payment methods. Alice, a service provider, broadcasts an unconfirmed transaction that pays three outputs every five seconds: a change output, a connector output, and a commitment output. Bob can deposit 1 BTC with Alice using an unsigned Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) and collaborate with her to withdraw his funds in one of several ways, including unilaterally withdrawing or collaboratively trading commitments. The protocol also allows for making conditioned and unconditioned payments, with the former involving a secret being revealed by Carol, which would allow her to claim the funds, or allowing Bob to claim them after a timeout. If a user does nothing for four weeks, Alice can claim the funds from the commitment output. The connector outputs ensure atomicity, but users are not as well-protected during reorganizations. Alice may prove to users that no funds they receive in a payment derive from any deposit less than safe_confirmation_depth blocks.</summary>
