    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community has implemented OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY in a different way from the Elements sidechain. This method involves directly putting the 32-byte hash to the stack, rather than hashing the data on stack, which should provide more flexibility as not all systems use double-SHA256. Meanwhile, Russell O'Connor has detailed how it is possible to implement covenants using two script extensions, OP_CAT and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY, both of which are already available in the Elements Alpha sidechain. It is therefore possible to construct covenants in Elements Alpha today. O'Connor is interested in collecting and implementing other useful covenants and is open to suggestions from the community.</summary>
