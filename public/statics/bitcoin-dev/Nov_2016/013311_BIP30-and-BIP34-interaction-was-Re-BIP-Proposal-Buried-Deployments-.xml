    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of hash collisions in Bitcoin and its impact on consensus. The writer argues that hash collisions are a consensus failure, which could result in a chain split or hard fork. However, the implementation of BIP30 in Core until November 2015 prevented transactions with colliding hashes from being accepted. The writer also explains that even if a collision were to occur, it would not be a hard fork but rather a reorg. The writer suggests fixing the problem rather than introducing an alternative hash algorithm.</summary>
