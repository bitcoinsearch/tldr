    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Timón responded to Thomas Kerin's comparison of BIP30 and BIP34. Kerin had suggested that BIP30 was given similar treatment after a reasonable amount of time had passed. However, Timón disagreed, stating that BIP30 is not validated after BIP34 is active because blocks complying with BIP34 will always necessarily comply with BIP30. He also noted that duplicate transaction hashes can and will happen in Bitcoin, and that BIP34 does not prevent this.</summary>
