    <summary>Bitcoin Core has merged a simplification to the consensus rules for BIPs 34, 66, and 65. The change is minor, but it was documented in a BIP for posterity. Prior soft forks were activated via miner signaling in block version numbers. Since the chain has long since passed the blocks at which those consensus rules have triggered, the trigger mechanism can be replaced by caching the block heights at which those consensus rules became enforced. The full draft of the BIP can be found on Github.</summary>
