    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil corrected a misinterpretation of BIP30, stating that duplicate transaction hashes can and will happen in Bitcoin even with the activation of BIP34. He explained that BIP30 was given similar treatment after a reasonable amount of time had passed and provided a link to the relevant code in Github. Another member of the discussion, Jorge Tim√≥n, clarified that blocks complying with BIP34 will always necessarily comply with BIP30 because coinbases cannot be duplicated after they include the block height.</summary>
