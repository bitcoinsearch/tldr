    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil explains why banning duplicate transaction hashes outright is not feasible. Doing so would require spent transaction hashes to be retained forever, which goes against the concept of pruning nodes. Additionally, implementing such a ban would result in a chain split and a hard fork. It is noted that while BIP34 precludes exact duplicate transactions, different transactions can still have the same hash if their parents are identical. However, as long as the hash function remains secure, future transactions are guaranteed to have unique transaction IDs.</summary>
