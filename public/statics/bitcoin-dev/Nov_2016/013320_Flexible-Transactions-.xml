    <summary>Tom Zander from the bitcoin-dev mailing list responded to an email from Russell, thanking him for his review. However, Tom mentioned that the issue Russell had raised was fixed quite some time ago and he had waited six weeks before sending the email. Russell expressed his happiness regarding the solution and looked forward to seeing BIP 134 updated with it.</summary>
