    <summary>In an email correspondence on November 16th, 2016, Pieter Wuille and e were discussing the similarities between buried softforks and checkpoints. e argued that checkpoints should be eliminated because they are often misunderstood as a security feature rather than an optimization. Pieter Wuille suggested that control of the "true chain" may fall into the hands of those selecting the checkpoints, which could lead to a central authority. He recommended that users validate the full chain without checkpoints and select their own checkpoints to place in the config file. When e referred to "buried softforks," Pieter Wuille questioned the terminology, as he understood it to refer to the 3 softforks being "buried" or the proposal itself, but not the burial process. Despite this, he did not see a problem with the proposal for buried softforks as it is neither a security feature nor an optimization.</summary>
