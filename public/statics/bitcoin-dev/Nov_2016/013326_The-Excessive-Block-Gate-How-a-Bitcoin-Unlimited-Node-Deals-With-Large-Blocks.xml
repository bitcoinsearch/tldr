    <summary>On November 25, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner wrote an email discussing the false premise of his reasoning and conclusions about BU block size policies for miners. He believes that all miners need to follow the same block size policy to prevent short forks as they are not in the best interest of the honest miner majority. Although it is impossible to guarantee that short forks won't happen, it is possible to minimize them. However, there are no block-size-negotiations on-chain. The blockchain is used to state the position of individual miners, and it can be used as a time-stamped way to hold them accountable. If they lie, everyone will be able to verify that fact, and their credibility will be affected. This will not help their case next time any block size negotiations happen.</summary>
