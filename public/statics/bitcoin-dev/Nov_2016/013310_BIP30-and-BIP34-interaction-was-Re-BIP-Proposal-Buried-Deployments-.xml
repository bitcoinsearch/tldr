    <summary>The email discussion on bitcoin-dev starts with a statement that hash collisions are possible. The author of the email argues that such an occurrence would result in a consensus failure or hardfork which would break the Bitcoin protocol. There is no room for such a failure, and thus the Bitcoin Core should assume SHA256 collision is impossible. If someone disagrees, they should introduce an alternative hash algorithm to prevent any consensus failure.</summary>
