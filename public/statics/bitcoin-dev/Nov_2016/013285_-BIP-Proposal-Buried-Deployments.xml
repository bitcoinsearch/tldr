    <summary>The BIP process pertains to changes made in the Bitcoin protocol, and this specific BIP has been accepted. The blockchain recorded this event of acceptance. Before a certain block, the rules were one way, but after they got changed. However, the complexity of the code can be reduced by making a checkpoint registration of past events. This is due to the fact that it makes software less complex, while still having the ability to check the entire blockchain from genesis. As for the change, the writer sees no harm and believes it is a sound practice in software engineering. However, Eric Voskuil via bitcoin-dev expressed his disapproval of the change, stating that it sets a bad precedent, as well as poor processes. He also mentioned that there would not even be any material performance optimization. Tom Zander's blog and vlog links are provided at the end of the context.</summary>
