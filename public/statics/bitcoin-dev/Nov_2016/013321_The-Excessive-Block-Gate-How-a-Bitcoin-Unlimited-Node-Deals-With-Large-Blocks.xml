    <summary>Bitcoin Unlimited, a solution to the block-size limit, is gaining support from node operators and miners. As more people inquire about its workings, a detailed explanation of how it works has been provided in an article by Peter R. The article explains how Bitcoin Unlimited's excessive-block logic operates from the perspective of a single node. Peter R aims to provide a follow-up article that describes how this "node-scale" behavior facilitates the emergence of a fluid and organic block size limit at the network scale. The link to the article is attached in the email.</summary>
