    <summary>Bitcoin Unlimited, a solution to the block-size limit, is gaining support from node operators and miners. A detailed explanation of how it works has been provided in an article by Peter R. The article explains how Bitcoin Unlimited's excessive-block logic operates from the perspective of a single node. Peter R aims to provide a follow-up article that describes how this "node-scale" behavior facilitates the emergence of a fluid and organic block size limit at the network scale.Sergio Demian Lerner expressed concern about the riskiness of unlimited block size in Bitcoin, but according to Tom Zander's response, there would be no change to the concept of proof-of-work, and only chains with more proof of work will win. Additionally, protecting from reorgs by expecting more confirmations would remain the same, such as the standard 6 confirmations for exchange-deposits. The conversation between Sergio and Tom discusses how miners setting their block size limits (BSL) above or below the "effective BSL" can disadvantage them, so it is in their best interest to all set the same block size limit and signal it reliably in their coinbase TX, which Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) miners do. Empirical evidence supports this behavior, as no major miner has ever set their block size limit less than 1 MB, even those who think it's too big like Luke-Jr.On November 25, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner wrote an email discussing the false premise of his reasoning and conclusions about BU block size policies for miners. He believes that all miners need to follow the same block size policy to prevent short forks as they are not in the best interest of the honest miner majority. Although it is impossible to guarantee that short forks won't happen, it is possible to minimize them. However, there are no block-size-negotiations on-chain. The blockchain is used to state the position of individual miners, and it can be used as a time-stamped way to hold them accountable. If they lie, everyone will be able to verify that fact, and their credibility will be affected. This will not help their case next time any block size negotiations happen.Tom Zander mentioned that the surprise may come from the difference in cost versus expected earnings of creating a block. The conversation also suggests that there may be improvements to be made to the policy that BU uses, such as estimating the accepted block size for the majority of the miners and only counting block confirmations for wallet transactions taking into account only blocks whose size is lower or equal to S. Overall, the email conversations and discussions highlight the importance of miners following the same block size policy to prevent short forks and maximize revenue. There are ongoing debates and improvements being made to Bitcoin Unlimited's excessive-block logic, but its market-based solution is gaining support from node operators and miners. However, the risks associated with unlimited block size are still being discussed, and game-theoretic analysis of confirmation blocks and their probabilities in BU is needed before considering it as a safe change for Bitcoin.</summary>
