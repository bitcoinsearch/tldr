    <summary>A recent consensus rule change in Bitcoin Core has been met with criticism, with some arguing that it sets a "horrible precedent" and is not a significant performance optimization. The change involves simplifying and optimizing the trigger mechanism for prior soft forks (BIP 34, BIP 65, and BIP 66) by caching the block heights at which those consensus rules became enforced. The proposal suggests that the change would be unlikely to result in a consensus split, but critics argue that such a split could have catastrophic effects on the security of Bitcoin. Despite the debate, the change has already been merged into Bitcoin Core.</summary>
