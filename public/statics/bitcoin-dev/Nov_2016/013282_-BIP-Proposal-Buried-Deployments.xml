    <summary>On November 16, 2016, Eric Voskuil asked whether checkpoints and hard forks were now good. In response to this, it was suggested that at least one checkpoint should be included to directly check the assumption that no 50k re-orgs will happen. Checkpointing only needs to happen during the headers-first part of the download. If the block at the BIP-65 height is checkpointed, then the comparisons for the other ones are automatically correct. However, many people would like to verify the legacy chain. This makes the change a soft-fork rather than a hard fork, as chains that do not go through the checkpoint are rejected, but no new chains are allowed.</summary>
