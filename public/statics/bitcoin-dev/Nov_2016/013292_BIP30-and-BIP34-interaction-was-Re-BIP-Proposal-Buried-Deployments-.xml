    <summary>BIP30 prevents duplicate transaction hashes only in the case where a new transaction hash duplicates that of a preceding transaction with unspent outputs. However, BIP34 does not prevent duplicate transaction hashes from different transactions. Two cases of duplicate transaction hashes have already occurred; one was exempted from validation because it had become buried in the chain, while the other complied with the BIP30 rule because its predecessor was spent. Both cases resulted from exact duplicate transactions, which BIP34 now precludes. The collision of regular transactions is extremely unlikely as they take inputs, but coinbase transactions do not have an input to take entropy from, which makes them a worrying case. BIP30 prevents collisions on coinbase transactions by introducing committed height.</summary>
