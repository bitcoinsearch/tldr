    <summary>A discussion was held on the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion list which raised concerns about Bitcoin Core's reliance on the impossibility of hash collision for maintaining consensus. This happens in multiple places in the code, and a protocol change that was suggested by a member was actually implemented by Alex Morcos a year ago, constituting a hard fork. The block hash check is performed against the full chain, making it insufficient to guard against a block hash collision causing a chain split. The author questions whether there will be a retroactive BIP for this issue.</summary>
