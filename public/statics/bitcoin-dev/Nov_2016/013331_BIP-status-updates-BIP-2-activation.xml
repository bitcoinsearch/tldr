    <summary>Luke has opened a pull request to implement BIP 2, which implies the activation and implementation of BIP 123 as well. He plans to merge this on December 14th but asks people to bring up any hard objections before then. He also invites further reviews of the implementation in the meantime. However, he requests people to refrain from requesting further changes to the BIPs themselves unless it is a blocker/show-stopper or trivial (not changing the meaning).In the process of implementing BIP 2, Luke came across a number of BIPs without a proper license that managed to get into the repository. Therefore, he requests the authors of these BIPs to open a pull request adding the necessary Copyright section and License header(s). He also mentions that if there are other contributors to the document in the BIP git logs, he will try to reach out to them to get permission. In case anyone accepted contributions from someone not documented in git as an Author, they should mention this explicitly in the PR.Luke provides a list of all the BIPs that need a license, which includes BIP 001, 010, 011, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 021, 030, 031, 032, 033, 034, 035, 039, 043, 044, 045, 047, 061, 062, 064, 066, 067, 068, 070, 071, 072, 073, 075, 101, 102, 103, 106, 120, 121, and 123.</summary>
