    <summary>A recent simplification to the consensus rules surrounding deployment of BIPs 34, 66, and 65 has been merged into Bitcoin Core. This change will replace the trigger mechanism by caching the block heights at which those consensus rules became enforced. The change has not yet appeared in any released software but is expected to be in the next release, 0.14.0. Despite concerns raised regarding the performance optimization and the process followed for this change, the developer responsible has agreed to modify the BIP draft to de-emphasize the performance aspect. The full draft of the BIP can be found on GitHub.</summary>
