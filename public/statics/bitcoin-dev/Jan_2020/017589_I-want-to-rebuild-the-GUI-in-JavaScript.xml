    <summary>The email thread starts with a response from the original sender, who thanks Jonas for his feedback and takes the topic off the list since it is not the right place for it. However, for those who emailed him asking about how to follow the progress, he has been working on a proof-of-concept over the last month and published it on GitHub. He encourages contributions towards growing this by checking out the bottom of the README for ways to get involved.Jonas responds to the original sender's initial email, stating that the topic is probably not appropriate for discussion on the Bitcoin Core Github issue. He suggests that if the original sender wants to rebuild Bitcoin Core GUI using the JavaScript Electron framework, they should work on a third party project and let their Electron UI connect to Bitcoin Core over RPC. Jonas also mentions that adding an Electron/JavaScript UI to the Bitcoin Core repository is unlikely to happen because many Bitcoin Core contributors and users don't like the idea of having a browser and JavaScript to achieve a UI with relatively simple user-stories. He provides links to two relevant Github issues for further reference.Overall, the email thread discusses the appropriateness of discussing the rebuilding of Bitcoin Core GUI using the JavaScript Electron framework on the Bitcoin Core Github issue. Jonas suggests that the original sender should work on a third party project and provides links to relevant Github issues for further reference.</summary>
