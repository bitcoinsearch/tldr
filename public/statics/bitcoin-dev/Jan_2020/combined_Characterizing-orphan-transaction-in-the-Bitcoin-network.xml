    <summary>This email discusses a paper that focuses on orphan transactions in the Bitcoin network and their impact on network throughput. Orphan transactions are those whose parental income sources are missing at the time they are processed, causing them to remain in a local buffer until their missing parents are found. The study aims to characterize the nature and impact of such orphans through a measurement campaign of orphan transactions on live Bitcoin nodes. Surprisingly, orphan transactions tend to have fewer parents on average than non-orphan transactions. Their missing parents are characterized by lower fees and larger sizes, resulting in a lower transaction fee per byte. The network overhead incurred by these orphan transactions can be significant, exceeding 17% when using the default orphan memory pool size of 100 transactions. However, the paper shows that increasing the size of the orphan pool to 1000 transactions can make this overhead negligible without significant computational or memory demands.While the email raises an interesting topic for discussion, the author suggests that the software-level discussion of Bitcoin Core is better suited for Github rather than the current forum. In conclusion, the discussion sheds light on the importance of understanding the properties of orphan transactions and reducing their impact on network throughput.</summary>
