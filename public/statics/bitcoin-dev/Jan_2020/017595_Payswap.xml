    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a contributor on the lightning-dev forum, has proposed using a circular self-payment mechanism to hide the direction of payment from third-party nodes. This mechanism involves having the source pay a larger-than-amount payment to the destination and the destination returning the difference instead. This can be implemented directly on the blockchain using CoinSwap to mislead onchain analysis. Transactions and transaction outputs can be considered nodes and edges of a transaction graph, respectively, and the categorical dual of such a graph can be used to implement the Payswap payment flow. This involves more transactions than Payjoin, thus is more expensive in blockspace, and the protocol can be aborted by one participant leading to spending onchain fees to back out of the protocol. However, it is an active misleading of chain analysis. The proposal is currently under consideration by the community.</summary>
