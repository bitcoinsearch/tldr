    <summary>The conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Robin revolves around the scalability and security of Bitcoin and its potential solutions. While it is ideal for users to run their own nodes, it is not necessary for most end-users. Bitcoin-backed PoS sidechains are suggested as a solution that offers better security, public auditability, and decentralized data storage while meeting the simplicity requirements of billions of average users. However, the reliance on a limited number of sophisticated actors who are willing to run full nodes for risk-sharing purposes raises concerns about the fragmentation of the community within a sidechain. Ultimately, a free market of sidechains must use its resources efficiently to ensure security and efficiency.</summary>
