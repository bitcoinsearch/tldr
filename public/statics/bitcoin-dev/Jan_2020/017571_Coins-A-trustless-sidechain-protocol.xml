    <summary>The link provided leads to a discussion on the use of non-interactive channels in solving the problem of one-sided opens. This refers to situations where one party is passive or offline. The suggestion is made to use channel factories instead of sidechains, but it is unclear if this would provide an offline-like participation user experience without registration with any gateway provider. The question is raised if it is possible to join the network online, generate an address or invoice and put it somewhere for others to use later while being offline for long periods of time without relying on third-party providers to secure channels. The discussion ends with the query if using sidechains can be equally replaced with LN/CF constructions.</summary>
