    <summary>In an email exchange between Billy and Jeremy Rubin, the two discuss the necessity of restricting the number of inputs to preclude TXID malleability. Committing to all required information necessitates committing to the number of inputs in a transaction. This allows for non-interactive layer 2 protocols which depend on TXID non-malleability. Billy raises the point that allowing any number of inputs could be useful. However, Jeremy suggests that the flexibility is better left outside of the OP directly. If one wants an any number of inputs template, they can use something like OP_CAT and pass in the # of inputs and sequences hash as arguments to the function. Jeremy also offers to respond separately to Billy's post on bitcointalk.org as it asks a different set of questions.</summary>
