Feedback on the new tool is appreciated, encouraging users to share their thoughts and opinions on the experimental branch. The taproot protocol update is aimed at improving the privacy, fungibility, and smart contract flexibility of Bitcoin transactions. It is currently being reviewed by the Bitcoin community and if approved, it will be implemented in a future Bitcoin Core release. Overall, the introduction of the "tap" command line tool by btcdeb is a step towards simplifying the process of composing taproot and/or tapscript outputs for funding and spending. With its potential to enhance privacy and smart contract capabilities, the taproot protocol update is an exciting development in the world of Bitcoin.</summary>
