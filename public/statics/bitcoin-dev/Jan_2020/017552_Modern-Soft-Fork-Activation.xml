    <summary>Jeremy Rubin proposed a spork protocol upgrade model that has some interesting properties around the five mentioned properties. The first property is to avoid activating in the face of significant, reasonable, and directed objection. It is up to miners to orphan spork-activating blocks. The second property is to avoid activating within a timeframe which does not make high node-level-adoption likely. There is a mandatory minimum flag day for Spork initiation that statistically makes it improbable/impossible for even earlier adoption. The third property is to not needlessly lose hashpower to un-upgraded miners. Difficulty adjustments make the missing spork'd block "go away" over time, and the additional difficulty of *not activating* a rejected spork fills in as an additional PoW. The fourth property is to use hashpower enforcement to de-risk the upgrade process wherever possible. Miners choose to activate or build on activating blocks. The fifth property is to follow the will of the community, irrespective of individuals or unreasoned objection, but without ever overruling any reasonable objection. Honest signalling makes people be forced to "put their money where their mouth is" on what the community wants.</summary>
