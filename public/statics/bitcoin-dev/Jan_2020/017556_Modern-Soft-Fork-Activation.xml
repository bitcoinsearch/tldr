    <summary>On January 11, 2020, Anthony Towns expressed concerns about the UASF approach and its potential technical problems, including long reorgs and p2p network splits that were not resolved before its activation. However, it was clarified that long reorgs were only a possibility for old nodes and not necessarily a problem. The p2p network split issues were resolved well before activation, as Bitcoin Knots still ships with general p2p fixes. Neither BIP-148 nor BIP-91 gained enough consensus to be supported in bitcoin core. However, there was no significant difference in community support between BIP148 and Segwit itself months before BIP148's activation. Only opinions of developers differed, and basing the decision to exclude BIP148 as an option on this basis was deemed improper. The community's readiness to switch to another fork/build for UASFs is valuable but should not be necessary.</summary>
