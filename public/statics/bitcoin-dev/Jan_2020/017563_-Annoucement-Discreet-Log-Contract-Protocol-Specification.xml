    <summary>Suredbits and Crypto Garage are collaborating to develop a specification for using discreet log contracts (DLCs) in a safe, private, and interoperable manner. They aim to establish a common standard to use Bitcoin oracles by producing documents similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLTs). The goal is to enable others to easily integrate the technology into the protocol and remain compatible with standards used by other Bitcoin-related protocols like Lightning. They hope to create a toolbox of agreed-upon standards for future Bitcoin-related protocols to avoid duplication and facilitate library developers to reuse software for many Bitcoin-related protocols. The specification repository can be found on GitHub. For more information on DLCs, links to relevant resources have been provided.</summary>
