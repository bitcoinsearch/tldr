    <summary>A client on an old p4 has been working on building and verifying the initial chain for about a week now. This seems impractical for new users, so proposals have been made for distributing a weekly precomputed bootstrap chain via methods such as rsync or db_dump &gt; git &gt; db_load. Additionally, there is over 50% compression available in the index and chain. While there are future issues to consider, such as the raw transaction rate and scaling the client count, the issue of building and verifying the initial chain is already present.</summary>
