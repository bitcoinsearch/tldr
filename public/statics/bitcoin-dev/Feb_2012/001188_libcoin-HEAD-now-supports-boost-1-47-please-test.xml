    <summary>In an email conversation on February 2nd, 2012, Michael Gr√∏nager mentioned that enabling dynamic libraries was on his to-do list. However, for Redmond_OS_not_to_be_mentioned, class definitions need to be prepended with __declspec(dllexport) when the dll is compiled and __declspec(dllimport) when it's used. He expressed his frustration with how the OS spoils its developers. The conversation shifted to the problem of using static libraries, specifically boost. The user had libboost*.so files but was missing libboost*.a files.</summary>
