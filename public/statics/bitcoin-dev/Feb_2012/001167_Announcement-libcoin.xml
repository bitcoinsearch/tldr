    <summary>Michael Gronager sent an email to Luke-Jr regarding his CMake not finding Boost. He suggested using ccmake or cmake-gui to help locate the Boost files. Additionally, Michael asked about the platform that Luke is using. In response, Luke-Jr mentioned that libcoin does not configure for him and linked to a paste of the error message he received. Luke-Jr also asked if there were any plans to merge up to 0.5.x since libcoin is forked from bitcoind 0.4.x. Michael Gronager's email signature includes his contact information for Ceptacle, a company he directs.</summary>
