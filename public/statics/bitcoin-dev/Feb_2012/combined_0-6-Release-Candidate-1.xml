    <summary>The Bitcoin community has been asked to test and review the latest version 0.6 of the software which includes a range of new features. The code changes can be reviewed on GitHub using the compare feature, and bugs should be reported via the issue tracker. Users can download release candidate 1 from SourceForge. The new features in version 0.6 include the ability for Bitcoin-Qt to display and save QR codes for sending and receiving addresses, a new context menu on addresses to copy/edit/delete them, a new Sign Message dialog to create a digital signature, and wallets created with this version will use 33-byte 'compressed' public keys instead of 65-byte public keys. There are also new JSON-RPC API commands for dumping/importing private keys from the wallet (dumprivkey, importprivkey), getting information about blocks (getblock, getblockhash), and getting extra information related to mining (getmininginfo).Moreover, the release notes mention preliminary support for multisignature transactions. It is imperative that the Bitcoin community tests and reviews these new features extensively to ensure their smooth functioning.</summary>
