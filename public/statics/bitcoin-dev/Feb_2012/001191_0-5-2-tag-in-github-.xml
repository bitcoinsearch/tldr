    <summary>Michael Gr√∏nager was trying to redo the performance test of the libcoin client against the 0.5.2 Satoshi client, which had received some improvements in speed since 0.4.0. However, he couldn't find any tag with v0.5.2 in Github. It seems that tag is in https://gitorious.org/+bitcoin-stable-developers/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable. There appears to be some developer politics involved and v0.5.2 may not have been pushed to the official Github repository.</summary>
