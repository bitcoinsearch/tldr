    <summary>The writer has been experimenting with tools in db 4.8.30 and Bitcoin stable, and their blockchain is up to date but Bitcoin is not running. They have found that using the command "strings database/*" will sometimes yield wallet addresses, which goes against the idea that only the wallet file matters. The writer also notes that Bitcoin always leaves behind at least one database/log.nnn file and a .lock file, both of which should be deleted upon exit. To save space, the writer suggests vacuuming addr, blkindex, and wallet with "db_dump | db_load", although they do not yet know how to view or validate blk0001.dat. When cleaning out files, the writer recommends keeping addr.dat (node addresses), bitcoin.conf (config), blk0001.dat (blocks), blkindex.dat (index to blocks), and wallet.dat (wallet).</summary>
