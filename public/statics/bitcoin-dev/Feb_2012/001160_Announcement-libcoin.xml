    <summary>In an email exchange, Michael Gr√∏nager has informed that the libcoin/bitcoind client can download the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. The reason for this speedup is not entirely clear, as it is unusual to see such significant improvements without changes in data structures or similar factors. However, there is some speculation that disabling fsync, which has been commented out in the code, may be responsible for the performance boost.</summary>
