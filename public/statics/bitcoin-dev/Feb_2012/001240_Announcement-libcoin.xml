    <summary>A user emailed Michael Gronager, Ph.D., Director of Ceptacle to thank him for developing libcoin, a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The user said he was unable to compile libcoin under his Ubuntu 11.04, unlike Bitcoin (from sources), Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin and I0coin, which he all compiled and ran from sources. Michael announced the release of the first version of libcoin, which also maintains a version of bitcoind that is a 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client. In addition, the libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. It took less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for e.g. thin clients.</summary>
