    <summary>On February 1, 2012, Pieter Wuille and Dr. Andy Parkins were discussing changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Pieter noted that non-standard transactions are verified without issue when they are in the blockchain, but IsStandard() is used for accepting transactions into the memory pool. Dr. Andy had a misunderstanding about this, which Pieter corrected. Pieter went on to explain that if a breaking change is made to the protocol, such as adding a new transaction type, all users must upgrade to avoid seeing a fork of the chain from before the first new-style transaction. This was not the case at the time of their discussion.</summary>
