    <summary>The discussion among Bitcoin users in February 2012 centered around the possibility of distributing a weekly precomputed bootstrap chain for Bitcoin. One user suggested using rsync or db_dump &gt; git &gt; db_load methods to achieve over 50% compression in the index and chain. However, some users were concerned that this approach goes against the distributed nature of Bitcoin.Another proposal suggested using Git repos backed by strong hashes, with each commit representing a single block dump. Trusted entities such as pools could sign at checkpoints/heights. Blockchain tools would need to be developed to take blk* and export single blocks, process/export up to a certain block, and quit. Everyone would compare and sign a commit hash, and everyone else would do git pulls.Wladimir, believed to be Bitcoin's lead developer, acknowledged that he had proposed packaging part of the block chain but noted that it could run contrary to the distributed approach of Bitcoin. He explained that, if the imported chain was not validated, users would have to rely on the packager to provide accurate information. On the other hand, if it had to be validated, the user's computer would still need to crunch data for days. Wladimir suggested that the original poster use one of the thin clients on their old computer.However, if not validating the chain means not caring about the history, it may not be appropriate to only make new transactions with a new key post-installation time and validate new transactions as they come in. Further investigation is required. Torrents are also suggested as a possible distribution method, as they are strongly hashed and can be signed. The development of blockchain tools is crucial for any approach taken.The issue of artificial slowdown linked to database file locking and flushing has not been tracked down. To track this down, one can try building their own libs and comparing different operating systems on the same hardware. It seems that on some operating systems, it caches the writes and flies through it at thousands of blocks per second, while on others, it slows down to the point where it will never catch up.The problem may have something to do with the default settings of the db lib, which seems to default to different things on different version/operating systems/filesystems. When flushed to disk every block like Bitcoin does, it is impossible to get more than 50-60 blocks per second due to rotational latency. On some systems, the block chain gets fully done in 10-20 minutes, while on others, it takes much longer. It is unclear if all the data in blkindex and blk0001 should be the same across instances given a certain height. The system below is not zippy and is buried in crypto at 8MB/sec. Comparing the format of blk0001.dat would help with the pursuit of comparison.</summary>
