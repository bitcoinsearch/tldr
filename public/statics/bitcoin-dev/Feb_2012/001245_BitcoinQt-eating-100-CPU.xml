    <summary>In a conversation on February 23, 2012, Gavin Andresen suggested a fix for the Mac Bitcoin-Qt that did not register itself as a bitcoin: URL handler. He proposed to never launch the ipcThread #ifdef Q_WS_MAC in order to solve this issue. However, there was a concern raised whether this would prevent the user from registering it. No further information was provided regarding the outcome of this discussion.</summary>
