    <summary>Michael Grønager, a developer and director at Ceptacle, was attempting to redo the performance test of the libcoin client against the 0.5.2 Satoshi client that had received significant speed improvements since 0.4.0 by not verifying signatures on early blocks. However, he could not find any tag with v0.5.2 in Github's repository. He was specifically looking for the number "140700," which is the last block not verified and can be found in checkpoints.cpp. Michael wondered if he was missing something or if the release was not tagged.In an email conversation from 2012, Aidan Thornton expressed uncertainty about the location of a certain tag for the stable version of Bitcoin's codebase. He speculated that "a certain amount of developer politics" may have been involved and suggested that v0.5.2 may not have been pushed to the official Github repository. However, it was later clarified that no such politics were at play, and the cuts to stable versions were always made from Luke's repository since he maintained it.Aidan Thornton suggested that the tag might be in a different repository and some developer politics might have been involved. Michael also asked about adding new checkpoints and wondered if there was any policy or logic behind it. He mentioned that the number could easily be bumped to 160000 by now.</summary>
