    <summary>A user is having trouble compiling libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04 and has tried to compile Bitcoin, Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin and I0coin from sources successfully. They have run the ./configure command which returns a list of Boost libraries found and that OpenSSL was found at /usr/lib/libssl.so;/usr/lib/libcrypto.so. The make command results in an undefined reference to `BN_init' error. Michael Gronager announces the release of the first version of the crypto currency library "libcoin" based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3.</summary>
