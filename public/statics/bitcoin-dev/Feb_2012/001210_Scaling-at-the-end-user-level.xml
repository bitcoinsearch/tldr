    <summary>In an email thread from February 8, 2012, a user named "grarpamp" reported that a freshly deployed client on an old P4 computer had been idly working on building and verifying the initial chain for about a week. They questioned whether this was untenable for new users and asked if any groups had published proposals for distributing a precomputed bootstrap chain. The user suggested using rsync or db_dump &gt; git &gt; db_load methods and noted that there was 50% or more compression available in the index and chain.In response to this proposal, Wladimir, who is believed to be Bitcoin's lead developer, acknowledged that he had proposed packaging part of the block chain but noted that it could run contrary to the distributed approach of Bitcoin. He explained that, if the imported chain was not validated, users would have to rely on the packager to provide accurate information. On the other hand, if it had to be validated, the user's computer would still need to crunch data for days. In addition, Wladimir advised the original poster to use one of the thin clients on their old computer.</summary>
