    <summary>Pieter Wuille supports BIP 30 as he thinks it is the best way to resolve the duplicate transaction vulnerability. On February 28, 2012, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn asked Pieter Wuille to spell out the attack explicitly and share the explanation privately if it is realistically dangerous to post it publicly. In response, Pieter Wuille mentioned that Russell O'Connor described the attack on his blog. The email concludes with a virtualization and cloud management advertisement.</summary>
