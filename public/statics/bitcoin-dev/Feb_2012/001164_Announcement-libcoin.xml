    <summary>In an email conversation between Michael Gronager and Gregory Maxwell, Michael stated that he tried to play with database sync for further speedups, but it only resulted in about a 1% increase. Michael also mentioned that the Satoshi client had sleeps and mutexes put in place to make threads run smoother and avoid deadlock. However, he believes moving from the threading based setup to the async based setup was the big change in speed. Additionally, he pointed out that 50% of the time is consumed in verify, leaving little room for optimization. Michael notes that Berkeley DB does a decent job caching reads, so even adding a cache wouldn't help much. Gregory responded by saying it's interesting, and asked if Michael knew where the speedup came from. He suggested Michael may have disabled fsync since he gets big speedups from doing similar things. The email signature includes Michael's contact information as Director of Ceptacle, a technology company based in Copenhagen.</summary>
