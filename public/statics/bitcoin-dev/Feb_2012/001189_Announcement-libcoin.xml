    <summary>The RPC server in libcoin is faster than the Satoshi client due to its query methods accessing the blockChain as a const object, allowing for safe querying without interfering with the Node thread. The exception are the SendTo methods which first query if a transaction can take place, then pushes it to the work-queue of the Node thread and exits immediately. While Michael's refactorings are impressive, Pieter is concerned about the safety of concurrent threads modifying the blockchain structure during queries. Pieter suggests read-write locks that allow multiple threads to read the data structure simultaneously, rather than removing locking altogether.</summary>
