    <summary>Ceptacle has released the first version of its crypto currency library, "libcoin," which is based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The library maintains a version of bitcoind that is a 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client. It can be used on the same computer and files, and it can be called with similar scripts. Extending libcoin without touching basic bitcoin source files is also easy. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. The Satoshi client code has been completely refactored in libcoin, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, and moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for thin clients. All chain specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain), making libcoin chain agnostic. Chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies can be easily experimented with for research and educational purposes. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3, meaning it can be used in open source as well as commercial projects, but improvements should go back into the libcoin library. More information about libcoin can be found on their GitHub page or Twitter account.</summary>
