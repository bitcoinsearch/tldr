    <summary>On February 6, 2012, Luke-Jr made a proposal to make transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard. He expressed concern that this change could harm the ability to replace the current spammy "green address" scheme with a sensible extra signature system. He also noted that it could significantly harm the adoption of such a system on the miner end. Luke-Jr questioned why the possibility of moving to non-blockchain-spam 0-confirmation via an extra signature was being ignored. MtGox was reportedly okay with this plan. He asked if there was an alternative solution to the problem of green addresses spamming the blockchain. In his pull request, he suggested that stripping extra data would have no negative impact on normal transactions and that clients creating these can be written to expect the txnid to change or not care what the txnid is.</summary>
