    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed a solution on February 28, 2012, to prevent an attack on the Bitcoin protocol by adding an extra protocol rule. This rule would not allow blocks to include a transaction that has the same hash as an earlier transaction that hasn't been fully spent yet. He suggested this solution in BIP30 and provided a patch for the reference client which has been tested and verified to make the attack impossible. Wuille requested support from the community to add this rule to the protocol rules. He hoped that pools and miners would agree to update their nodes without any delay-causing coinbase-flagging procedure if consensus was reached on this solution. A user named Gavin Andresen suggested doing this in two steps: first, preferring blocks that don't break the rule, and once 55% or more confirm they have upgraded, treating it as a hard rule. It is unclear whether Wuille's solution would also make RoccoNora's complicated transaction-based version of the attack impossible.</summary>
