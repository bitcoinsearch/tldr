    <summary>A user created a GoogleGroup mailing list called bitcoin-discussion which has very low activity and is similar to the dead mailing list on sourceforge. The user suggests that a real mailing list for users needs to exist as it tends to house a more technical crowd than forums. Furthermore, there are many clients adherent to the same bitcoin specification and the sourceforge list browsing interface is not up to par. Hence, the user suggests searching for an existing busy list, chartering it as bitcoin protocol client agnostic, finding an impartial administrative home with browsable, searchable, and downloadable archives, announcing it to other known client lists/forums, closing any relevant old lists, and promoting it periodically. The user questions if the charter is sufficient and if the creator/maintainer is known as impartial while also pondering what happens to ongoing list operations when said people vanish.</summary>
