    <summary>The writer downloaded the latest version of bitcoin-qt (0.6 rc1) and built it on MacOSX 10.7.3 using qt-creator, although they had to change BDB version to 5.1. However, after running it, the application uses 100% CPU, despite there being no issues with debug.log activity. The majority of time in each thread is spent between several processes. One line in qtipcserver.cpp appears to be the only strange occurrence. The writer asks if anyone has seen this issue before.</summary>
