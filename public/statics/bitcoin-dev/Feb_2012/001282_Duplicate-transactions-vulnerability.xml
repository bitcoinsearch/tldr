    <summary>In a conversation between Ben Reeves and Gavin Andresen on Feb 29, 2012, they discussed the possibility of a malicious miner producing a duplicate coinbase. The majority of clients would accept it, but the majority of hashing power wouldn't. However, this couldn't happen until the coinbase matures, which takes 100 blocks. Additionally, it won't mature because a majority of hashing power is rejecting it. This implies that there are measures in place to prevent such malicious activities from succeeding in the Bitcoin network.</summary>
