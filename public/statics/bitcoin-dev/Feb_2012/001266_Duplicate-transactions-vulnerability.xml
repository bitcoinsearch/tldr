    <summary>On February 28, 2012, Pieter Wuille informed the Bitcoin community about a vulnerability found in how the Bitcoin reference client deals with duplicate transactions. Although exploiting it requires hash power and has no financial benefit for attackers, it is still a security hole that needed to be fixed as soon as possible. To fix this issue, an additional protocol rule was proposed: do not allow blocks to contain a transaction whose hash is equal to that of a former transaction which has not yet been completely spent. However, some members of the community like Robert were concerned about the proposed solution. They believed that there should be no duplicate transaction hashes at all, so the rule should be modified to prevent transaction hashes that are already present in the branch. Additionally, they suggested that if a transaction has the same hash as another transaction in the chain, it should be "tweaked" in some way to avoid collision. Overall, the Bitcoin community was working to find a solution to the security vulnerability and ensure the safety of the network.</summary>
