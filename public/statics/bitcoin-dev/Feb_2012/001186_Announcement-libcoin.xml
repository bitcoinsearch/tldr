    <summary>In this email exchange, Gregory Maxwell discusses the progress of libcoin in syncing with the Bitcoin blockchain. He notes that libcoin only made it to height 138k and estimates that it will take roughly 3x-4x longer for it to fully sync. Later, he adds that it ended up taking almost exactly twice as long. Additionally, he apologizes for typing "libbitcoin" instead of "libcoin" due to an issue with autocompletion.</summary>
