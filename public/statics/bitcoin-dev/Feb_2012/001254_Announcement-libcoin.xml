    <summary>The user has successfully connected to RPC on port 10332 using curl and copied the `bitcoin.conf` file to their system. They have not tested it on Linux yet, but they believe it should work similarly to Amazon where they had it running for weeks on port 9332. However, the "port" parameter is not functioning correctly as it connects to 8333 for the bitcoin protocol. The user has not implemented "port" but can do so over the weekend if needed.In a different conversation, Michael Grønager explains that the 401 error code means permission is denied, and username/password must be set up in the command line or `bitcoin.conf` file to access those commands. He also discusses the difference between authenticated and non-authenticated methods and how `auth` is defined. Additionally, Martinx - ジェームズ thanks Michael for libcoin, which is an evolution for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However, they are unable to compile libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04. Michael suggests upgrading to the 1.46.1 library of Boost since boost 1.42 and openssl 1.0 have a conflict. Martinx - ジェームズ receives undefined reference errors when trying to make, and they ask for help.On February 1st, 2012, Ceptacle announced the release of the crypto currency library "libcoin," based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin/bitcoind client can download the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than its predecessor and is a drop-in replacement for the bitcoin/bitcoind client. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code is refactored, encapsulating classes, removing all globals, and moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. The functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for thin clients. Libcoin maintains a version of bitcoind that is 100% compatible with the bitcoin/bitcoind client that can be easily extended without touching basic bitcoin source files. It is chain agnostic, and all chain (bitcoin, testnet, namecoin, litecoin, etc.) specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain), making it accessible for experiments with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes.The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3 allowing the use of open source as well as in commercial projects, but improvements should go back into the libcoin library.
