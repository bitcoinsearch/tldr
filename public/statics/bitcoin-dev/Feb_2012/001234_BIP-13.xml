    <summary>In a conversation between Gavin Andresen and an individual, they discuss how the code will distinguish between a new and old scheme. The old scheme consists of a one-byte-version, 20-byte-hash, and 4-byte-checksum. If a 1 in 256 old address has a first-byte-of-checksum that matches the new address class, the code would compare the 4-byte checksum and assume it is a singlesig address. However, 1 in 2^32 multisig addresses will also match incorrectly, which could be exploited as a major flaw. The individual suggests implementing their idea to solve this issue, but admits that there may already be "version"-collisions since the bitfield interpretation is not well known. They suggest extensions for the next byte if xx10xxxx or xxxx111x, and y=0/1 depending on aesthetics.</summary>
