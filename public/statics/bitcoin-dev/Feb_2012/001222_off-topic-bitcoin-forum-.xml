    <summary>In an email conversation, Michael Gronager mentions that he needs to post 5 times in 4 hours, but he cannot post due to not being whitelisted. He plans to apply for whitelisting and notes that it is a strange policy. Harald Schilly responds to Michael's email suggesting that he may need to be whitelisted, and provides a link to the Bitcointalk forums on whitelisting. The conversation ends with Michael's signature, which includes his position as Director of Ceptacle, his contact information, and the company's website.</summary>
