    <summary>There is a discussion about updating the BIP0021 Wiki entry for "req:" to "req-". It is up to Genjix (Amir) to do that. The Github link https://github.com/genjix/bips/pull/2 has been provided for reference. Gary Rowe asked BlueMatt if the Wiki entry had been updated, but it appears to still be at "req:". There is also information about an online learning library for Microsoft developers available for $99.99, which includes Visual Studio, SharePoint, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, MVC3, and Metro Style Apps. Future releases are free when subscribing. This information was shared on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
