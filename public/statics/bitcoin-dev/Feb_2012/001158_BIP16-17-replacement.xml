    <summary>On January 31, 2012, Andy Parkins suggested changes to the version number and transaction structure. The "scriptPubKey" field would be replaced with a new "hashOfClaimingScript" field and an "unsignedParameters" array would be added. However, upon further consideration, Parkins realized that his proposal was essentially BIP16 without the backward compatibility work. He suggested renaming the scriptPubKey field to "hashOfClaimingScript" and no longer running it as a script. Detection of this format of scriptPubKey would activate "version2" processing of the transaction. A new definition of scriptSig would have two fields: unsignedInitialStackBlock and scriptClaim. Parkins concluded that he now supported BIP16 as it moves towards having a literal claimScriptHash field instead of scriptPubKey and never running scriptPubKey. Additionally, OP_CHECKSIG could potentially be simplified because anything that is not the serialized script in scriptSig would not be signed. In the future, when the network is all BIP16 compliant, scriptPubKey may no longer be allowed to run as a script at all.</summary>
