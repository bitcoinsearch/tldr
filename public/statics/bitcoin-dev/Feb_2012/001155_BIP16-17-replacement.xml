    <summary>On January 31st, 2012, a user named Luke-Jr claimed that both BIP 16 and 17 were backward compatible enough for users to continue using old clients with each other. However, another user named Andy Parkins expressed doubt in this claim, stating that the new transaction types would be rejected by old clients because they do not pass IsStandard(). The conversation took place on a public forum and was signed off by Dr. Andy Parkins, who provided his email for contact purposes.</summary>
