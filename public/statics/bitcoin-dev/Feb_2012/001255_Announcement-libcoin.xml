    <summary>Thiago was having trouble starting libcoin's bitcoind on high ports. He had set the port to 10333 in his bitcoin.conf file but the error message showed that it was trying to listen at 8332. When he tried to start the bitcoind using the rpcport option or other options, it did not work. In response, Michael suggested that Thiago needs to set up a username/password either on the command line or in the bitcoin.conf file to access those commands.In a different email, Martinx wrote to Michael about libcoin and how he was unable to compile it under his Ubuntu 11.04 machine. Michael suggested doing an upgrade of the libboost-dev-all library to get version 1.46.1. Martinx also mentioned that he was able to compile Bitcoin (from sources), Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin and I0coin, all from sources.On February 1, 2012, Ceptacle announced the first version release of its crypto currency library 'libcoin' based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin/bitcoind client can be used on the same computer and files as the bitcoin/bitcoind client without touching the basic bitcoin source files. The Satoshi client code has been completely refactored in libcoin, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach.The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client in less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. The functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for e.g. thin clients. Libcoin is chain agnostic, all chain (bitcoin, testnet, namecoin, litecoin, ...) specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain). Hence experiments with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes are easily accessible. Libcoin supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows based on CMake build system. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3, meaning that it can be used in open-source as well as in commercial projects, but improvements should go back into the libcoin library.Michael Gronager, PhD, Director at Ceptacle, provided information regarding the release of the first version of the crypto currency library "libcoin." He also shared the links for more information about libcoin on GitHub and joining libcoin on Twitter.</summary>
