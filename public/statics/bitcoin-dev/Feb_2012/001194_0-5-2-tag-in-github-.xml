    <summary>In an email conversation from 2012, Aidan Thornton expressed uncertainty about the location of a certain tag for the stable version of Bitcoin's codebase. He speculated that "a certain amount of developer politics" may have been involved and suggested that v0.5.2 may not have been pushed to the official Github repository. However, in response to his email, it was clarified that no such politics were at play. The cuts to stable versions were always made from Luke's repository since he maintained it.</summary>
