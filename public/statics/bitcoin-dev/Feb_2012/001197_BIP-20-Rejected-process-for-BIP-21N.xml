    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 21 (BIP21), a participant named Matt stated that he made a change to the description of the message parameter to make it more descriptive. However, he did not want to change the name of the parameter as some clients had already implemented it. He preferred to make only minor changes to the draft. Gary Rowe responded, saying that Matt's decision seemed reasonable. A question was raised about the description of the "message" parameter on the BIP21 wiki. The current description reads, "message that shown to the user after scanning the QR code." The participant believed that the purpose of this parameter was to contain a description of the transaction that goes beyond QR codes. Thus, naming it "message" is misleading. Instead, they suggested that the parameter be called "description".</summary>
