    <title>BIP 16 status update</title>

    <summary>Mining support for BIP 16 is still under 50%, and won't possibly be over 50% by March 1. Therefore, a new evaluation/switchover date has been proposed. The re-evaluation of support will take place on March 15th, and the target switchover date will be April 1st.For those already supporting BIP16, it is advised to restart bitcoind with the argument '-paytoscripthashtime=1333238400' to delay switchover until April 1st.Tycho has informed Gavin Andresen that deepbit will support BIP16 as soon as he's able to merge and test the changes. This will increase support to well over 55%. Hopefully, this will be the last delay in switchover.</summary>
