    <summary>The writer suggests that the bitcoin project should be divided into a library, with a prototype client and actual clients separated. The writer would like to see wallet operations independent of background chain operations to allow separate management of wallets in parallel. A library would allow for quality focus on different functions, letting applications and user interfaces use them as desired. Currently, running bitcoind only allows dealing with one wallet at a time, causing state issues and having to stop it. When the chain is processed hard by the daemon CPU-wise, Bitcoin RPC takes minutes to respond or errors out. If wallet operations or statistical queries on the chain need integrity or reading, a database checkpoint/lock/logroll could be implemented into the chain daemon processes with a client lib API to trigger it as needed. The writer also mentions that boost 1.48 and db 4.8.30 work fine with versions 0.5.2, 0.5.x, and master, and they need to be compiled and included manually if package managers do not have them.</summary>
