    <summary>Michael Gronager, the Director of Ceptacle, has created a new application called "coinexplorer" and uploaded it to libcoin. This application allows users to perform queries similar to those on blockexplorer.com, but locally on their own chain. Coinexplorer uses the HTTP GET feature of the coinHTTP/Server class to enable a simple search webpage for block searches. It builds on a new library addition called coinStat which is a collection of classes used for gathering and querying the block chain for other information than the ones used directly by the Node.Users can conduct block searches either by command line or by pointing their browsers at http://localhost:8332. However, Michael admits that the interface is rudimentary as he is not proficient in javascript/html5. He encourages those who are knowledgeable in these areas to create a more modern interface for the application. Coinexplorer can be found in the latest git at https://github.com/ceptacle/libcoin.</summary>
