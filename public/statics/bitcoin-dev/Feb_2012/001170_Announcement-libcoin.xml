    <summary>In an email conversation between Michael Grønager and Luke-Jr on February 1, 2012, Grønager shared that libcoin was in a state ready for its first release. However, Luke-Jr faced issues with configuring it. Grønager informed him that the version of Boost he used wasn't compatible with what Luke-Jr required and that he would change it. He also mentioned that he was working on creating an alternative scheme for signal_sets. When Luke-Jr asked if Grønager planned to merge up to 0.5.x since libcoin was forked from bitcoind 0.4.x, Grønager responded that he had tried to follow the changes related to the integration of the qt client, but would go over everything again. Grønager is the Director of Ceptacle and can be reached at gronager@ceptacle.com.</summary>
