    <summary>The email conversation between Martinx, Thiago and Michael Grønager was regarding the compilation of libcoin. Martinx had compiled various other sources such as Bitcoin, Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin and I0coin but was unable to compile libcoin on his Ubuntu 11.04 system. Michael provided Martinx with some tips to install libcoin on his machine. He advised Martinx to upgrade the libboost-dev-all library to version 1.46.1 as boost 1.42 and openssl 1.0 conflict.Michael also helped Thiago to resolve an issue related to using high ports but still trying to listen at port 8332. To fix the issue, Michael suggested Thiago set up a username/password either on the command line or in the bitcoin.conf file to access those commands that require authentication.In addition, Michael informed them both that support for "port" is now available on Github which requires only two lines of code. This would make it easier for anyone to work with "port".On February 1st, 2012, Ceptacle announced the release of its crypto currency library "libcoin" based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for e.g. thin clients. Libcoin is chain agnostic, all chain (bitcoin, testnet, namecoin, litecoin, ...) specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain) and hence experiments with chain settings, mining, security and digital currencies for research and educational purposes are easily accessible. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3. Michael Gronager, PhD, Director at Ceptacle announced the release and provided his contact details including email and mobile number along with the company's website. Links to the libcoin wiki page, twitter account, and download page were also provided.</summary>
