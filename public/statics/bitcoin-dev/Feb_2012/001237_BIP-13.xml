    <summary>The context describes the definitions of various addresses in base58.h, including PUBKEY_ADDRESS, SCRIPT_ADDRESS, PUBKEY_ADDRESS_TEST, and SCRIPT_ADDRESS_TEST. The author notes that there seems to be no logic behind the values assigned to these addresses. They also mention that PUBKEY_ADDRESS_TEST was intended to change, but the necessary updates have not been made due to higher priority tasks. The author invites others to lead the effort if they wish, but notes that it is more complicated than simply changing the definition. Gavin Andresen responds to the post, explaining that he does not remember why SCRIPT_ADDRESS_TEST is 196 and suggesting that Luke could provide an explanation.</summary>
