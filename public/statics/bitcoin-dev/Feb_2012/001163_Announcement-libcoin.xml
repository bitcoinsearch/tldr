    <summary>Michael Gr√∏nager announced the first release of libcoin on February 1, 2012. However, Luke reported that it wasn't configuring for him. He shared a link to the error message he was receiving. The library was forked from bitcoind 0.4.x, so Luke asked if there were any plans to merge up to 0.5.x.</summary>
