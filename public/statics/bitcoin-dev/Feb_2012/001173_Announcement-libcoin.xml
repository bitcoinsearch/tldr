    <summary>In an email exchange between Luke-Jr and Michael Gr√∏nager on February 1, 2012 at 4:15 PM, Michael suggested to Luke-Jr that his CMake couldn't find boost. However, Luke-Jr argued that it was a red herring and the problem was with Qt instead of boost. He provided a link to a pastebin and confirmed that he was using Gentoo as his platform. Furthermore, he advised that BDB_INCLUDE_PATH should be set manually or else db.h wouldn't be found.</summary>
