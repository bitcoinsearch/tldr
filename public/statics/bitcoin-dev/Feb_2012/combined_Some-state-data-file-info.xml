    <summary>The writer has been conducting experiments with tools in db 4.8.30 and Bitcoin stable software. Although their blockchain is up to date, they have found that Bitcoin is not running. The writer discovered that sometimes using the command "strings database/*" can reveal wallet addresses, which contradicts the belief that only the wallet file holds this information.Additionally, the writer notes that Bitcoin leaves behind a database/log.nnn file and a .lock file, both of which should be deleted upon exit. To save space, the writer suggests vacuuming addr, blkindex, and wallet with "db_dump | db_load". However, the writer admits that they do not yet know how to view or validate blk0001.dat.When cleaning out files, the writer recommends keeping addr.dat (node addresses), bitcoin.conf (config), blk0001.dat (blocks), blkindex.dat (index to blocks), and wallet.dat (wallet). Overall, the writer's experimentation with db 4.8.30 and Bitcoin stable software provides useful insights for those seeking to optimize their usage of these tools.</summary>
