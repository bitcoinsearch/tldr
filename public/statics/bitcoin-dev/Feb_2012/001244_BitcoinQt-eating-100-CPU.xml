    <summary>It seems that the culprit for Bitcoin-Qt using too much CPU was line 31, which has been identified. Others have reported similar issues and one user was able to reproduce the problem on their Mac. The Mac version of Bitcoin-Qt does not register itself as a bitcoin URL handler, so a possible solution would be to not launch the ipcThread in the 0.6 release, according to Gavin Andresen.</summary>
