    <summary>A conflict between boost 1.42 and openssl 1.0 has been detected in the coinHTTP compilation process. A solution to this problem involves upgrading to the 1.46.1 library through a sudo apt-get command. The email thread also includes an inquiry from Martinx on how to compile libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04, which he was unable to do. He received an error message during the make process, but the exact cause of the error is unclear from the email. Additionally, Michael Gronager announced the release of libcoin, a cryptocurrency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The library includes a version of bitcoind that can be used as a 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the original client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the original client. The Satoshi client code has been refactored in libcoin, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries minimizing dependencies for thin clients. Finally, the build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.</summary>
