    <summary>In an email exchange on February 6th, 2012, Gavin Andresen suggests two potential solutions to address issues with multisig addresses. He argues that the second option would lead to more testing of multisig and fewer bug reports. Wladimir agrees with this approach and suggests changing the maximum address length and validation, which is a simple change. The set of allowed characters for BitcoinAddressValidator remains the same. Advanced dialogs for constructing the addresses/adding them to the address book can wait until version 0.7.0.</summary>
