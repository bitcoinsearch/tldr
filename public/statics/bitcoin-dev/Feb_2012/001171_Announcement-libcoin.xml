    <summary>In an email exchange, Michael Grønager informed Luke-Jr that he needs version 1.48 or 1.47 of the boost. Luke-Jr was having trouble finding boost and was advised to use ccmake or cmake-gui to help locate it. However, after using ccmake, Luke-Jr did not find anything useful. He mentioned that boost is in the standard locations (/usr/include/boost/ and /usr/lib/libboost*). The platform being used is Gentoo. Michael Grønager, PhD, is the Director of Ceptacle and can be contacted at gronager@ceptacle.com.</summary>
