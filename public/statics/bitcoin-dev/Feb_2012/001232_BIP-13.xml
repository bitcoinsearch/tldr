    <summary>In a recent discussion about Bitcoin addresses, the "version" portion of the address was referred to as the "network id", indicating which network and chain the address can be used for. However, it has always been known as the "version" as per Satoshi's reference implementation. The technical background of Bitcoin addresses can be found on the Bitcoin Wiki page with attached graphics defining it as a network byte and network id. Although some bit level subdivision into network id and address class may be acceptable, it is important to note that the original intention was for it to be referred to as the version.</summary>
