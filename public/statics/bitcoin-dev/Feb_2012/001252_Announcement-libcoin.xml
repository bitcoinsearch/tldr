    <summary>A new cryptocurrency library called libcoin, based on the Bitcoin client, has been released by Ceptacle. The libcoin/bitcoind client can be used on the same files and scripts as the bitcoin/bitcoind client without modification, offering a 100% compatible drop-in replacement. Additionally, the libcoin/bitcoind downloads the entire blockchain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop.The Satoshi client code in libcoin has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes and removing all globals, with functionalities divided into logical units and libraries. The build system is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Libcoin is chain agnostic, meaning that all chain specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain). It supports various chains, including Bitcoin, Testnet, Namecoin, Litecoin etc. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3, meaning it can be used under both commercial and open-source licenses with improvements required to be fed back into the libcoin library. Ceptacle, the company behind libcoin, is a technology company based in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company is headed by Michael Gronager who serves as the Director. Ceptacle's official website is http://www.ceptacle.com/, but the focus area of the company is not mentioned in the context.The email announcing the release of libcoin was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted on lists.sourceforge.net. The email also includes an advertisement for LearnDevNow, an online learning library for Microsoft developers. The subscription fee for LearnDevNow is $99.99 and it covers a range of technologies like Visual Studio, SharePoint, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, MVC3, and Metro Style Apps. The subscription also includes free future releases.</summary>
