    <summary>The problem of green addresses spamming the blockchain can be solved through a REST-ful API provided by green address providers. This API offers functionality that allows users to declare transactions as "green" by providing their transaction ID and credentials. Additionally, users can check whether a transaction has been declared green by providing its ID and receiving a boolean response. Gavin Andresen believes that any design relying on clients recognizing two variations of a transaction is a bad idea.</summary>
