    <summary>Luke-Jr raised an objection on making transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard on February 6, 2012. He expressed his concern that if this affects relaying, it will harm the ability to replace the current spammy "green address" scheme with a sensible extra signature system. Also, he stated that it could significantly harm adoption of such a system on the miner end. However, gmaxwell explained to him why this is no longer needed on IRC, and Luke-Jr withdrew his objection on February 7, 2012.</summary>
