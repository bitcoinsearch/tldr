    <summary>The context is regarding a CMakeLists.txt file in the root of libcoin. In the file, there are lines related to Boost version which needs to be changed from 1.48 to 1.47, as suggested by Michael Grønager. Before trying again, it is recommended to remove the CMakeCache.txt file. The Qt stuff is unlikely to be the reason for the error. Luke-Jr replied to Michael Grønager's earlier query about Boost version and stated that upgrading to 1.47 did not bring any change to the error. Michael Gronager is the Director at Ceptacle, located in Copenhagen E. His contact details are provided in the context.</summary>
