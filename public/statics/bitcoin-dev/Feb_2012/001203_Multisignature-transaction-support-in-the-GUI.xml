    <summary>On Feb 6, 2012, Gavin Andresen suggested two options for multisig address implementation, with the second option being more preferable as it would lead to more testing and fewer bug reports. However, he believed that creating multisig addresses via the GUI should wait until the next release, while allowing send-to-multisig-address through GUI was a simple change. Wladimir agreed to go with the second option, which involved changing the maximum address length and validation, but questioned whether WalletModel::sendCoins had to be changed as well.</summary>
