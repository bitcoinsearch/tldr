    <summary>A question has been raised regarding the BIP21 protocol. The "message" parameter in the protocol, according to the wiki, is described as "a message that is shown to the user after scanning the QR code". However, it is believed that the purpose of this parameter goes beyond just QR codes and can be used to contain a description of the transaction. The suggestion has been made to rename the parameter from "message" to "description" to avoid confusion as the current name suggests that a message will be sent to someone. There is also a promotional link at the end of the context for recommending GMX DSL to friends and family.</summary>
