    <summary>In a conversation between Ben Reeves and Gavin Andresen on February 29, 2012, Reeves expressed concern about malicious miners using a coinbase of a block that has already matured. Reeves explained that these miners could produce a duplicate coinbase which most clients would accept, but the majority of hashing power would not. Andresen responded by pointing out that this scenario could only occur after the coinbase matures, which takes 100 blocks. Additionally, Andresen said that it was unlikely to happen because the majority of hashing power would reject it.</summary>
