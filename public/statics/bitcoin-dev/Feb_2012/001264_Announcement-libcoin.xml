    <summary>Michael, a developer, fixed a bug that was reported by a user. The bug was caused by an implicit string constructor for the ChainAddress which resulted in creation of a not fully initialized ChainAddress. To fix this, Michael advised using chain::getAddress(string) as the ChainAddress is chain specific. A git pull will fix this bug.The user found a new problem where the default account was not listed in the "listaccounts" output. They tried running '/usr/local/bin/bitcoind getaccountaddress ""' and '/usr/local/bin/bitcoind listaccounts' but received 'HTTP error code: 401' and 'Error: couldn't parse reply from server'. Michael explained that 401 means permission denied and that the user needs to set up a username/password either on the command line or in the bicoin.conf file to access those commands. The commands that contain "auth" require authentication, which can be set up using rpc_user and rpc_pass.The user encountered an issue with reference to `BN_copy' and undefined references to `BN_clear_free', `BN_cmp', and `SHA256' while trying to compile libcoin under their Ubuntu 11.04. Despite this, the release of the libcoin library is expected to be useful for both open source as well as commercial projects, with improvements going back into the library. The libcoin library, a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client, has been released by Ceptacle. The Satoshi client code has been completely refactored to encapsulate classes, remove all globals, and move from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, in less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3. Libcoin is chain agnostic, with all chain (bitcoin, testnet, namecoin, litecoin, ...) specific settings maintained from a single class (Chain) and hence experiments with chain settings, mining, security and digital currencies for research and educational purposes are easily accessible. The ponzicoin example shows how to define your own chain.More information about libcoin can be found on their website and Twitter page, where the "libcoin Satoshi release" can also be downloaded.</summary>
