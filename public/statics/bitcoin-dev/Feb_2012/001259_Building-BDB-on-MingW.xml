    <title>Building BDB on MingW</title>

    <summary>The sender was seeking advice on building Berkeley DB (BDB) on MingW. The recipient provided a link to an Oracle forum thread which suggests a solution for the issue. However, the sender followed instructions from build-msw.txt but encountered the same problem as the one mentioned in a Bitcointalk thread. The sender managed to compile it using --disable-thread_api --disable-replication flags, but when running bitcoind, it threw a DbRunRecoveryException over the DB_RUNRECOVERY flag. It appears that many people don't use MingW to compile bitcoind on Windows due to the lack of pthreads and missing functions such as strncasecmp, _strlwr, _fileno and swprintf.</summary>
