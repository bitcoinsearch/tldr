    <summary>The email conversation revolves around the implementation of libcoin, a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. Martinx mentions using the JSON RPC 2.0 system.description standard command but got sidetracked while implementing it. Thiago asks for help with the compilation of libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04. Michael suggests upgrading the boost library to version 1.46.1 to avoid conflicts with OpenSSL 1.0.Michael announces the release of the first version of libcoin, which is a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The library maintains a version of bitcoind that is a 100% compatible drop-in replacement for the bitcoin/bitcoind client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. It also refactors the Satoshi client code entirely, encapsulating classes, removing all globals, and moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. It supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Finally, the libcoin license is LGPL v. 3, which means that it can be used in open source as well as commercial projects.Martinx expresses his gratitude towards Michael for libcoin and seeks help in compiling it. He reports an error during the make command, which seems to be related to undefined references to certain functions within the script file. Martinx has successfully compiled and run other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin, and I0coin from sources. However, he is facing issues while compiling libcoin.Michael Gronager, Director of Ceptacle, has requested that any improvements made to the libcoin library should be contributed back to the library. Libcoin is a C++ library for working with Bitcoin. The library can be downloaded from GitHub, along with the Satoshi release. The libcoin Twitter account is also available for those who wish to follow it. In addition, Michael Gronager's contact information is provided in case of further inquiries.</summary>
