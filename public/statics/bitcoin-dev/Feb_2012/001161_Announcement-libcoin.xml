    <summary>Ceptacle, a Danish company, announced the release of its first version of the crypto currency library "libcoin" on February 1st, 2012. Libcoin is based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client and is a chain-agnostic, compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3. Libcoin is available for open source as well as commercial projects, but improvements should go back into the libcoin library.</summary>
