    <summary>On February 2, 2012, a conversation took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the update of the BIP0021 Wiki entry for "req:" to "req-". Matt Corallo stated that it was up to genjix (Amir) to make the update and provided a link to the relevant pull request. Gary Rowe asked if the update had been made yet, noting that the Wiki entry still appeared to be at "req:". The conversation ended with an advertisement for LearnDevNow, an online learning library for Microsoft developers.</summary>
