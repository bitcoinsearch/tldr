    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, a user raised a question regarding the BIP21 protocol. The user was specifically concerned about the "message" parameter in the protocol which is described on the wiki as "message that shown to the user after scanning the QR code". The user felt that this description was misleading as the purpose of the parameter goes beyond just QR codes and should be named as "description" instead. The user also pointed out that the term "message" suggests that a message will be sent to someone, which is not the case with this parameter. The email also included information about a promotion by GMX DSL where users could recommend the service to their friends and earn up to 50 euros as a reward. Additionally, there was information about an online learning library for Microsoft developers available for $99.99, which includes Visual Studio, SharePoint, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, MVC3, Metro Style Apps, and more. The subscription also includes free future releases.</summary>
