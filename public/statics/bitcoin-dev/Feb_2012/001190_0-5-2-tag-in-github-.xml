    <summary>Michael, a developer, is attempting to redo the performance test of libcoin client against the 0.5.2 Satoshi client, which has received significant speed improvements since 0.4.0 by not verifying signatures on early blocks. However, Michael cannot find any tag with v0.5.2 in Github's repository. He wonders if he is missing something or if the release was not tagged. Michael is specifically looking for the number "140700," which is the last block not verified. This can be found in checkpoints.cpp. Nevertheless, he wants to confirm that this is also the number used in version 0.5.2.</summary>
