    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev forum, concerns were raised about the risks of halving to the system. There was apprehension about how profit margins could lead to significant hashing power being shut down and fees increasing dramatically, leading to chaos. The proposal presented by Alfie John did not address this issue. A conservative approach suggests accepting a drop in hashrate without executing any halving and waiting for the hashrate to recover, even if it takes 20 years, landing at the lowest possible annual inflation set by a free market.The security of Bitcoin is currently ensured by ~1.8% inflation and fees paid to miners, but if fees alone cannot maintain security, there are options to adjust the subsidy or block size to attract more or fewer miners. Deflation in Bitcoin is not as straightforward as in gold, and a drop in network security could have complex repercussions. The difficulty-security relationship becomes less predictable over time, making it challenging to program code that detects violations of security targets.One proposal suggests periodically adjusting the subsidy up or down through a soft or hard fork, using an algorithm that calculates the average difficulty of the last 100 retargets every 210,000 blocks and compares it with the maximum of all previous values. This system waits for the recovery of network security in the case of a destructive halving and cannot be manipulated. However, this proposal does not address the immediate danger of halvings where profit margins tend towards marginal costs rather than total costs, resulting in a significant amount of hashing power shutting down immediately and fees increasing dramatically.The topic of security and fees was also discussed, noting that around 13% of miner revenue comes from fees, with the majority of security coming from coinbase rewards. The question was posed as to what size of threat would be unrealistic enough to not require additional security measures. One estimate placed an upper bound of $350 billion per year in seigniorage extraction that would be at risk if governments were to view bitcoin as a threat to their currencies. If fees alone are not enough to support sufficient security, there is still time to address the issue. The importance of avoiding long-term global hashrate regression for store of value feature was also discussed.The security of Bitcoin currency is currently ensured by fees and coinbase rewards, with fees making up about 13% of miner revenue. However, there has been discussion around the amount of security provided by these methods, with some proposing a mechanism that self-regulates the level of taxation to prevent global hashrate regression. The worst-case scenario would be the first global hashrate regression taking place in 2028. The size of the motivation of an attacker has been considered, with an upper bound on how much anyone would expect to bring to bear being approximately $350 billion. It has been suggested that if this level of security is necessary, things may need to be rethought.The issue of deflation in Bitcoin has also been discussed, with monetary inflation operating differently compared to gold or other things. The current total reward per transaction is $63, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the current fees. However, it's important not to exaggerate the difference. Despite the possibility of hoarding due to an appealing long-term risk/reward, it may still exist because of global adoption ahead, which may increase the price and market cap of Bitcoin by an order of magnitude. As the network of people who accept and use bitcoin grows, the fee market may grow superlinearly in comparison to market cap, which would make high levels of security more realistic.Bitcoin network's security proposal suggests using a chainwork parameter instead of the existing method to ensure that all users participate in securing the network and prevent free riders. The proposal aims to achieve equilibrium between the costs of security for two parties with opposing interests by calculating the necessary difficulty level to attract more or fewer miners. It proposes to execute halvings if mining activity is growing, delay or end halving in case of miner exodus, and use a chainwork parameter to ensure security. There is no consensus on which approach is best, but periodic changes may be implemented every 10-30 years to keep the system secure.The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list also involves finding a solution to ensure that sudden drops in mining difficulty do not cause catastrophic miner exodus. Some suggest using downward differences to calculate the difference and delay or end halving, while others propose using a chainwork parameter. The proposed approach considers the cost in Bitcoin of the security target and the cost in Bitcoin of acquiring a unit of hashrate to calculate the necessary difficulty level to attract more or fewer miners. The system could automatically adjust the subsidy up or down or adjust the block size to change the fee market and attract more or fewer miners.There is a proposal to plan a robust model in case of necessity that suggests calculating the average difficulty of 100 last retargets and comparing it with the maximum of all such values calculated before every</summary>
