    <summary>On December 29, 2022, Aymeric Vitte expressed his disapproval of the current design and use of NFTs. He pointed out that they are centralized, insecure, duplicable, virtual, stealable, not signed, and expensive. However, he acknowledged that if NFTs were considered to be anything that can be bought or stored in the real world, web, or metaverse, then they would become interesting.Vitte noted that NFTs are mostly used on Ethereum and described them as a "mess." In response, he shared a link to his proposal for a decentralized and secure Bitcoin NFT system that is not expensive. Unfortunately, the link provided by Vitte is either gone or private.Vincent signed off on the email with a cheerful note.</summary>
