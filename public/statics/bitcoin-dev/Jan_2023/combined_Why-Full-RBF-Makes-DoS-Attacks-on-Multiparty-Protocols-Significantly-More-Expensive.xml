    <summary>The email thread discusses the benefits of Full-RBF in mitigating double-spend DoS attacks, especially for multi-party protocols. It also mentions using various implementations of coinjoin such as Wasabi, Samourai, Joinmarket, and Whirlpool. However, the opinion of Wasabi is considered irrelevant due to their privacy issues and their decision to work with chain analysis firms that assist governments in censorship.In a recent conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, David A. Harding expressed confusion regarding the necessity of full-RBF, which allows for double-spending with increased fees in order to prioritize a transaction. Peter Todd responded by stating that without full-RBF, people can intentionally and unintentionally cause DoS attacks by double-spending their inputs with low-fee transactions, holding up progress until the low-fee transaction gets mined. Todd then discussed the issue of transaction pinning and highlighted the significant cost difference ($0.05 versus $17) between using full-RBF and not using it for protocols vulnerable to such attacks. He emphasized that the use of full-RBF significantly improves the success rate of automated coinjoin processes and similar protocols.In a discussion about decentralized coinjoin implementations like Joinmarket, Peter Todd raised the question of how to implement "conflict monitoring," with two suggested methods. Both methods can be used to evade the $17.00 attack and the $0.05 attack without the need for full-RBF. The email conversations between Peter Todd and David A. Harding also highlight the importance of conflict monitoring systems to detect double-spend attacks and ensure the success of multi-party transactions. There were also discussions about the reputations of different coinjoin implementations like Samourai Wallet and Wasabi.In a discussion on Twitter, a user named alicexbt asked how to get extra sats to increase fees for Coinjoin transactions. However, Peter Todd clarified that there is no need for extra sats as Coinjoin transactions already have fees set at a level at which they would expect to be mined in a reasonable amount of time. Todd dismissed the mention of Whirlpool, stating that Samourai has made some rather insane technical decisions and their opinion isn't relevant. The tweet claiming that Full-RBF provides well-connected mining pools with an added advantage is proven to be false. Attackers can already perform DoS attacks by double-spending their inputs in Coinjoin so this is not an effective attack, according to Todd. He also said that the tweet mentioned in the discussion was simply false. The email thread also touched on concerns regarding privacy and censorship in the Bitcoin community.</summary>
