    <summary>In an email conversation, Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, stated that there is no sensible way to prevent people from storing arbitrary data in witnesses without incentivizing even worse behavior and/or breaking legitimate use cases. He argues that although the market is willing to bear the cost of scarce blockspace, storing NFTs and other "crap" on the chain could entangle the Bitcoin fee market with pump and dump markets, undermining legitimate use cases and potentially preventing new technology like Lightning Network from gaining a strong foothold.Despite this view, there is no principled way to stop this kind of data from being stored on the network. The solution, according to an unnamed correspondent, may lie in continuously educating people on the morals of the matter. They suggest using ordinal inscriptions for enduring, practical, and universally beneficial purposes such as domain name inscription to solve the DNS centralization problem.</summary>
