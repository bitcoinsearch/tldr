    <summary>Michael Folkson, a Bitcoin developer, floated the idea of creating a bare bones Knots-style Bitcoin implementation integrated with Core Lightning in one codebase. He expressed his concerns about the way the Bitcoin Core project is being managed and the accumulation of cruft over time in the codebase. He also mentioned the dysfunction on the project and how decisions are increasingly made behind closed doors or private IRC channels. In contrast, Core Lightning is managed effectively in the open but lacks the usage that Bitcoin Core has. The libbitcoinkernel project was an attempt to extract the consensus engine out of Core, but consensus is too slippery a concept, making Knots style consensus-compatible codebase forks of Bitcoin Core still the model. Michael raised questions about whether it makes sense to mix C and C++ code that people have different views on and suggested that it would be better if Core Lightning were written in the same language as Bitcoin Core. He acknowledged that the proposed integration would be an ambitious long-term project but urged people who are more familiar with the entirety of the Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases to provide feedback. In conclusion, Michael sought input from developers on his idea, hoping to focus on ambitious projects during a lull in soft fork activation chaos.</summary>
