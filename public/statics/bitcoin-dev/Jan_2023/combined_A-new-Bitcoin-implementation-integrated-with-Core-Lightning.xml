    <summary>The email thread discussed the potential benefits of integrating full nodes and Lightning nodes in Bitcoin's network. Some argued for tighter coupling between the two, while others believed that strong incentives would be necessary to counter complexity. The dysfunction in the Bitcoin Core project was also criticized, with decisions seemingly made behind closed doors or private IRC channels.The idea of creating Knots-style consensus-compatible forks of Core with limited additional functionality was suggested as a better option than integrating full nodes and Lightning nodes. However, concerns were raised about safely removing cruft from the codebase while maintaining a less crufty fork of Bitcoin Core. There were also questions around mixing C and C++ code, and it was suggested that Core Lightning should be written in the same language as Bitcoin Core.In response to Michael's email, alicexbt suggested forking Bitcoin Core and maintaining an implementation without integrating any Lightning implementation. They also shared a link to a branch with interesting commits if Michael is looking to remove things from Bitcoin Core and maintain an implementation with no GUI, wallet, less RPCs, etc.The lack of public discussion and decision-making behind closed doors in the Bitcoin Core project was criticized, while the effective management of Core Lightning was praised. There was also mention of the decoupling of CLN from the block source and the opportunity to "comingle" the peering of LN gossip and block data networks. The importance of fee calculation and a uniform approach to it was also noted.The idea of creating Knots-style consensus-compatible forks of Bitcoin Core was mentioned as an alternative to integrating full nodes and Lightning nodes. Its feasibility was questioned due to the difficulty of achieving consensus across different implementations. The author of the email discussed their long-term idea of a bare bones Knots-style Bitcoin implementation integrated with Core Lightning, which has become more appealing due to dysfunction in the Bitcoin Core project and the accumulation of cruft over time in the codebase. In November 2022, Michael Folkson tweeted about bugs in btcd and the analysis paralysis on an RBF policy option in Core. He suggested that the future might lie in consensus-compatible forks of Core such as Bitcoin Knots. He also proposed integrating a bare bones Knots style Bitcoin implementation with Core Lightning. Although he feels that Bitcoin Core is not being managed effectively as an open-source project, he believes that Core Lightning seems to manage its project effectively in the open. However, it lacks the usage that Bitcoin Core does. Michael acknowledges that it would be an ambitious long-term project to merge Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning into one codebase. Therefore, he is floating the idea to hear from people who are much more familiar with Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases. Knots-style consensus compatible codebase forks of Bitcoin Core seem to be the model, as they limit additional functionality and focus on consensus. Michael proposes focusing on some ambitious projects given there seems to be a lull in soft fork activation chaos. The libbitcoinkernel project was an attempt to extract the consensus engine out of Core but it seems like it won't achieve that as consensus is just too slippery a concept.</summary>
