    <summary>In an email conversation between Greg Sanders and David, the topic of sending funds to future segwit versions was discussed. Greg suggested that most exchanges would not enable sends to future segwit versions due to the risk involved in doing so. However, David argued that wallets should spend to any valid bech32m address and that the more restrictive approach of only sending to secured outputs seemed unnecessary. He explained that withdrawing to a witness program for which there is no solution could result in bigger problems. David also suggested that testing the best practice of sending to secured outputs could benefit protocol developers in the future if they need to test other best practices that cannot be easily tested for. However, he wanted to use the address least likely to cause problems for protocol developers in the future. He sought suggestions from others on the list regarding what script to use. The email conversation references BIP350, which recommends supporting sending to v1 and higher versions.</summary>
