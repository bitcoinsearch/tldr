    <summary>An email conversation was held between Michael and another person regarding the future of bitcoin core implementation. Michael expressed his opinion on forking bitcoin core and maintaining its implementation by removing some features from it, keeping it simple and improving its privacy. He also shared a link to an example of doing so on Github. Michael mentioned that Bitcoin Core's codebase has collected a lot of cruft over time and the ultra-conservatism needed when treating consensus code seems to permeate into parts of the codebase that no one is using, definitely isn't consensus code and should probably just be removed. Michael had an idea of integrating a bare bones Knots style Bitcoin implementation (in C++/C) with Core Lightning, but he found dysfunction in the way the Bitcoin Core project is being managed and decisions are being made behind closed doors or private IRC channels. On the other hand, Core Lightning is managed effectively in the open, but it doesn't have the usage that Bitcoin Core does. He floated the idea to hear from people who are much more familiar with the entirety of the Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases. It would be an ambitious long term project, and he wanted to focus on some ambitious projects for a while.</summary>
