    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin vaults, questions were raised about the recovery path and its security measures. The idea of requiring a signature for the recovery path was suggested, and a method for implementing it was proposed. The current implementation using OP_NOP repurposing was also discussed, with the possibility of using OP_SUCCESS instead. Another suggestion was to use a CTV and template malleability approach, but this was deemed inappropriate for vaults due to its shortcomings. The benefits of batching withdrawals were also debated, with some arguing that it would be useful for large-scale custodial operations while others thought it wasn't necessary. Finally, the inability to batch Unvaults in Revault was seen as a major drawback, and the ability to batch recovery transactions was considered compelling.</summary>
