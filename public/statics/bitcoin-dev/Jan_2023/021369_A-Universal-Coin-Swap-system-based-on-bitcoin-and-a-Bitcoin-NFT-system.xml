    <summary>Aymeric Vitte, a French programmer, has proposed two systems based on the Bitcoin blockchain - a Bitcoin NFT system and a Universal Coin Swap system. The purpose of the NFT system proposal is to create a simple NFT system that can be sold/bought and can prove ownership on the blockchain. The proposal argues that Bitcoin can do what Ethereum does in a simpler manner. Unlike other solutions, the proof of deals for the NFT system is stored in OP_RETURN and can be turned into bitcoin contracts. The proposal also claims to remain decentralized and not flood the network with unnecessary data.The Universal Coin Swap system aims to create a simple, secure, decentralized, and inexpensive system that works for all blockchains/tokens based on Bitcoin. The proposal suggests using the reputation model instead of enforcing everything like Lightning. It also mentions that the trust is based on a one-time deal rather than a long-term relationship between people.Aymeric Vitte claims that his proposals have some non-usual ideas like the double hash, the third party, and others. He invites review and comments for his proposals. The proposals aim to solve the problem of selling secret NFTs and remain decentralized, unlike most existing solutions.</summary>
