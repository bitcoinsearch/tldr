    <summary>The writer is seeking opinions and actions from core developers about storing unlimited amounts of NFT content as witness data using the ordinal scheme. They question whether allowing unlimited storage for such use cases is wise due to future disk use of all unpruned nodes. The writer suggests finding a way to impose a size limit similar to OP_RETURN for such inscriptions. They propose linking a sat to a deed or other legal construct for proof of ownership in the real world, so that real property can be transferred on the blockchain using ordinals. However, they believe storing the property itself on the blockchain is nonsensical.</summary>
