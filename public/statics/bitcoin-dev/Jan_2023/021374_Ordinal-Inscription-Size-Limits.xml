    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev list, Andrew Poelstra expressed his concerns about the implications of storing NFTs and other non-currency data on the Bitcoin chain. He argued that it would entangle the Bitcoin fee market with random pump&amp;dump markets. However, Aymeric Vitte believes that Bitcoin cannot be left out of the future of NFTs, Metaverse, and "web3." Vitte proposed a bitcoin-based NFT system that does not require minting NFTs using third-party networks like Ethereum or super sidechains. Instead, millions of low-value NFTs (such as loyalty programs and discount coupons) can be referenced in one transaction. Vitte's system is centralized, but he believes it is a good solution compared to existing ones. Links to Vitte's proposals and other projects are available in his email signature.</summary>
