    <summary>The author of the email proposes a "local bitcoin" that is compatible with Bitcoin code but does not store anything in the main Bitcoin chain. It can be used as an alternative to Ethereum and for low-value NFTs such as loyalty programs and discount coupons. The author had initially disliked NFTs, but has changed his mind and provides proposals for a Bitcoin-based NFT system. There are links to the author's CV, LinkedIn profile, GitHub repositories, and various projects such as a Universal Coin Swap system, a bitcoin NFT system, Bitcoin transactions made simple, and more.</summary>
