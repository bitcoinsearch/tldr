    <summary>In an email exchange between David A. Harding and Peter Todd, the former proposed various ways to detect a double-spend attack in response to Todd's query about how participants would learn of such an attack. Harding emphasized that any protocol software that intends to defeat the $17.00 pinning attack must implement some form of conflict monitoring system. Using this system would also render the $0.05 individual conflicting input attack powerless without the need for full-RBF. However, Todd raised concerns about decentralized coinjoin implementations like Joinmarket, asking how they could implement "conflict monitoring."</summary>
