    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed Tuesday, January 17th at 18:00 UTC for the third Bitcoin contracting primitives WG meeting. The agenda includes discussing all contracting protocol use-cases and reviewing research in the contracting primitives/covenant spaces. Participants are encouraged to open a PR or contact Antoine if they have been working on a use-case that is missing from the current listing. The second part of the meeting will be dedicated to listening to everyone's blockers in their contracting primitives/covenant research. Antoine's personal goal for this year is to nurture some websites with archive material gathered in the repository. The website would present the contracting protocol research according to the best engineering/scientific standards and ensure ideas neutrality. He also intends to enable the collection of feedback, especially on dimensions like privacy or economic scaling from the Bitcoin community of stakeholders at large, with Pretty Graphics(tm).The group is looking forward to starting rotating meetings host during the year, as they're doing with BOLTs where it's rotating between Lightning implementations contributors. Communication venue is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat, and logs of previous sessions are available here [0]. If you're interested in hosting one of the monthly meetings, feel free to open an issue against the repository or bump Antoine.</summary>
