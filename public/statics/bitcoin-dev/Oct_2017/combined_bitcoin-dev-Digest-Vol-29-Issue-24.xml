    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is discussing the possibility of decreasing block time to improve scalability. The current 10-minute block time was chosen as a tradeoff between confirmation time and wasted work due to chain splits. However, with advances in technology and a lack of a rigorous formula for determining the optimal rate, it may be possible to go lower than 10 minutes without much issue. While shorter block times would result in more chain splits, proponents of faster block times suggest protocols like the Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocol to overcome these issues.However, reducing the block interval comes with a large number of downsides, including reduced security due to high stale rates, where blocks take time to propagate through the network, and centralization, where one mining pool with a large percentage of hashpower may have de facto control over the mining process. If the block interval is short enough for the stale rate to be high, this effect is compounded. Moreover, reducing the average block time would require reducing the block size accordingly to prevent bloat and maintain decentralization. It is noted that Bitcoin's goal may be to eventually have a block time of one second or less, which would enable decentralized high-frequency trading and other applications, but current technology is not developed enough for this. A script has also been written to avoid "sybil attack" from 2x, but the efficacy and ethical implications are up for debate.</summary>
