    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list is about the contingency plan in case the incumbent chain following Bitcoin Core consensus rules comes under 51% attack. The thread includes a proposal for a hard fork to implement a new difficulty algorithm that uses a simple rolling average with a much smaller window. The proposed solution is to adjust the reward based on recent solvetimes to motivate more mining if the solvetimes are too slow and keep coin issuance rate perfectly on schedule with real time. However, one of the largest technical concerns over B2X is that it is a rushed, poorly reviewed hard fork, and reframing as a hardfork wishlist research problem for the next properly planned hard fork, if one occurs, is suggested. The hardfork research group is recommended as a more accommodating venue for this discussion. There is also a mention of Luke's work on BitcoinHardfork but it is not clear whether this has actually been tested in the field by anyone or how much testing each emergency hard fork option has seen.</summary>
