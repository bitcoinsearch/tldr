    <summary>A proposed solution for the Block Withholding Attack in Bitcoin has been presented by Kevin Pan. The idea is based on a proposal by Aviv Zohar and involves changing the difficulty algorithm to use an offset value that is included in the merkle root hash calculation. The offset value must be within a specific range, which is provided to miners when they receive a job from a mining pool. By using this method, cheating miners cannot determine which share could make a valid block, preventing them from withholding blocks. However, implementing this solution would require a hard fork and render existing ASIC DSHA256 chips useless. Nevertheless, Pan believes it is a small change to make new ASIC chips based on existing technology. Other proposals exist, such as one from 2012 that may be possible to implement in existing miners. Pools today want more independence to express their opinions or standpoint, but some are unable to do so, such as pools unable to remove the NYA tag.</summary>
