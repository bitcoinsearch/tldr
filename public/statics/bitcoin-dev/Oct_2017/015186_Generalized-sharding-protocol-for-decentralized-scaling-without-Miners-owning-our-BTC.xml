    <summary>The email thread from Oct 10, 2017 on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses a proposed generic sharding protocol for blockchains including Bitcoin. The idea is to enable users to transfer their coins from one chain to another by burning them on the original chain and minting new ones on the destination chain. The proposal aims to provide scaling solutions without sacrificing security or decentralization. The idea has similarities with Interledger. However, there are technical arguments and questions raised in response to the proposal, such as whether it would change the number of Bitcoins in existence and concerns about miners being forced to issue coins twice. One participant in the discussion states that this method would not work since one cannot have a fixed rate of Bitcoin and a second way to mint coins at the same time. The discussion ends with the statement that only core developers will be responded to in further emails.</summary>
