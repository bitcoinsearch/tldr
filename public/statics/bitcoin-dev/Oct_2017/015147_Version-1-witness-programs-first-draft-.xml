    <summary>The email conversation between Bitcoin developers explored the concept of cross chain replay protection. BIP 115 was identified as a fork-independent opt-in replay protection which can work alongside the new signature condition scripts in this proposal. The discussion also touched on the topic of a flag for new altcoins to make it mandatory and test it on testnet. Furthermore, the email dives into other potential future uses such as recursive tail-call for general computation capability. Clean stack should still exist as policy for future soft-fork safety, but committing to the number of witness elements is fully sufficient. Finally, the conversation concludes discussing whether or not the code should commit to the length of serialized witness data.</summary>
