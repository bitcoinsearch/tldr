    <summary>In an email exchange between two Bitcoin developers, Paul Sztorc expressed confusion over the semantics of the term "burn" in relation to coin transfers. He was informed that the term refers to the original coins being burned and replaced with newly minted ones upon transfer. The discussion was part of a larger conversation about a proposed generic sharding protocol for all blockchains, including Bitcoin. The protocol would allow users to move their coins from one chain to another through burning and minting transactions, without sacrificing security or decentralization. The proposal is similar in spirit to Interledger.</summary>
