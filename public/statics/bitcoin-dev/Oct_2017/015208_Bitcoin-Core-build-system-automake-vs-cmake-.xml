    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Kosta Zertsekel questioned why automake is used as the build system for Bitcoin Core instead of cmake, which he considers better. Jeffrey Paul responded that automake is the standard and requires no additional installation on most systems, and asked what exact problem Zertsekel was trying to solve for bitcoin-core. Zertsekel provided quotes about CMake build tools and asked if there had been any discussion about choosing the best build system for Bitcoin Core. Thomas suggested that unless there is a specific problem that CMake can solve without causing other issues, there is no reason to change the current build system. He also encouraged Zertsekel to convert bitcoin-core to CMake and demonstrate its benefits before suggesting adoption by developers.</summary>
