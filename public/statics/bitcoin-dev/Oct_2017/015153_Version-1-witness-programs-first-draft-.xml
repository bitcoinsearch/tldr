    <summary>During a discussion on October 1, 2017 at 8:39:11 PM, Mark Friedenbach proposed the idea of incorporating an optional commitment to witness size in bytes. He suggested that the value zero should indicate that the witness size does not matter. Friedenbach argued that it should be a maximum and serialized as part of the witness. The serialization of this would be very compact with only one plus the difference between actual and maximum, where zero means not used. One possible solution he offered was to add SIGHASH_WITNESS_SIZE in addition to SIGHASH_WITNESS_DEPTH.</summary>
