    <summary>The statement made by ZmnSCPxj via bitcoin-dev that most Core developers hold vast amounts of Bitcoin and any hardfork going against Core's wishes will collapse due to their hodling capacity is not entirely true. This can be dangerous for the safety and well-being of people on the list. There is no incentive for a developer to hold more Bitcoin than anyone else in the industry, and one doesn't become a Bitcoin developer by holding Bitcoin. In fact, there are many people and organizations who are not developers but hold massive amounts of Bitcoin, with hundreds of thousands held by some and millions in aggregate. It is important to note that while Core developers may have influence over the direction of Bitcoin, they do not have complete control and cannot prevent a hardfork from occurring.</summary>
