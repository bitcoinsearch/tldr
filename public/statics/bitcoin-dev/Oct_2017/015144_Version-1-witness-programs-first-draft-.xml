    <summary>Luke Dashjr has proposed a new draft for Segwit and Bitcoin scripting which includes five key changes. The first change introduces minor versions for witnesses, inside the witness itself, with major version 1 indicating the witness commitment is SHA256d. Other changes include undefined opcodes that immediately cause the script to exit with success, a new shorter fixed-length signature format, and the ability for signatures to commit to additional conditions expressed in the form of serialized scripts. The proposal also includes code implementing the consensus side of the changes. Mark Friedenbach responded by suggesting that the CLEANSTACK rule should be eliminated, and the number of items on the stack should be incorporated into the signature hash.</summary>
