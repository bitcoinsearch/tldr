    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tao Effect brought up the topic of sidechains and their purpose. Sidechains are designed to allow for voluntary transfer of tokens out of Bitcoin to a sidechain of one's choosing while keeping Bitcoin unchanged. Tao Effect argued that changing Bitcoin to recognize a transfer from a sidechain back into Bitcoin would defeat the purpose of the sidechain. The point of sidechains is to keep Bitcoin unaltered and enable users to transfer tokens out of Bitcoin. Changing Bitcoin to implement desirable features of a sidechain would be redundant since sidechains were created for this specific purpose.</summary>
