    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed the usability and ease of identification of bitcoin addresses. Shiva Sitamraju pointed out that long addresses can create usability problems in block explorers, mobiles, and payment terminals. Ben Thompson added that checking the first few bytes of a bitcoin address should not be considered sufficient for ensuring that it is correct due to the possibility of generating a vanity address with matching initial characters. Moral Agent suggested mapping 25-byte addresses (with checksum) to a 16-word list for easier verification. Danny proposed generating images based on the bytes of an address using identicon, which produces significantly different images for small changes in text input. Overall, the discussion centered on improving the visual distinctiveness of bitcoin addresses for easier verification and use.</summary>
