    <summary>Bitcoin Core uses Automake as its build system instead of other options such as CMake, which was questioned by Kosta Zertsekel in an email. Jeffrey Paul defended the use of Automake stating that it is a standard and does not require additional installation on most systems. However, there have been discussions about replacing Automake with other advanced build systems such as Meson and Ninja, which were developed to replace Automake. Some companies and projects have already switched to these alternatives, including JetBrains and KDE Project.</summary>
