    <summary>Daryl, a developer, wrote to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list to inquire about the post related to optimizing the syncing of blockchain. He requested help and understanding on the codes that were modified, such as functions, variables, and values that could lead to better performance. Daryl is currently working on further optimizing Electrum's syncing and would appreciate any assistance.</summary>
