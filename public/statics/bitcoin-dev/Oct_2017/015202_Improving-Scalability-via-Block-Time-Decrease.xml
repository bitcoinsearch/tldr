    <summary>Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, chose the current ten-minute block time as a compromise between confirmation time and wasted work due to chain splits. However, there may be room for optimization in this number due to advances in technology and the lack of a rigorous formula used to determine the optimal rate. While 10-second block times would result in many chain splits, going lower than 10 minutes may not be an issue. Jonathan Sterling asks if this is something that should be explored further. He provides links to articles discussing the topic and asks to be directed in the right direction if he is mistaken.</summary>
