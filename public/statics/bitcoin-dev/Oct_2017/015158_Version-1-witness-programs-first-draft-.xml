    <summary>On October 2, 2017, Luke Dashjr proposed two new options for BIP114 but later changed his mind. Mark Friedenbach suggested gating new behavior based on script execution flags, which are set based on the script version. The interpreter will not try to decode the script according to old rules, so there is no need for old soft-fork compatibility tricks. Instead, the new soft-fork trick is to increment the script version number, treating unknown script versions as "return true". This suggestion breaks parallel soft-fork deployments. Sjors suggests calling them numbered script types rather than script versions.</summary>
