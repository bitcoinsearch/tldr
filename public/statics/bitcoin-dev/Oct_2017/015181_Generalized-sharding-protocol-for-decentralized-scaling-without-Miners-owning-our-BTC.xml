    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Paul Sztorc explains that a one-way peg is not as effective as a two-way peg. The drivechain protocol uses parameters that make it impossible for any side-to-main transfer to occur. However, one-way pegs have strong first-mover disadvantages. Lucas Clemente Vella argues that if the new chain is Pareto optimal and better in some aspects than the original chain, the initial resistance is just an unstable equilibrium. He compares this to a herd of buffaloes attacking a lion, where the first buffalo to attack is at a disadvantage, but if enough of the herd follows, the movement succeeds beyond turning back, benefiting both those who attacked and those who didn't.</summary>
