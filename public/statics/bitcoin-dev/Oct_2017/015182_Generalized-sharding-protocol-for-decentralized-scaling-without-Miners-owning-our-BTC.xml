    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of two sidechains and how it may lead to loss of money for users. One-way pegs are not as effective as two-way pegs in this scenario. Drivechain is an example of a one-way peg that makes it impossible for any side-to-main transfer to succeed. The author believes that if a new chain is at least as good as the original chain but better in some aspects, initial resistance is unstable and can lead to a successful movement.</summary>
