    <summary>Bitcoin script validation flags can prevent malleability issues. Policy validation flags already exist to check for non-standard-zero values, witness values being used with OP_IF, etc. These were not made consensus rules with Segwit v0 due to concerns over scope creep. Script versions and quadratic hashing fixes were the minimum necessary for safe activation of Segwit while enabling future upgrades that would have otherwise required hard forks. The EC signature scheme will later be changed to support signature aggregation. If there is any general witness malleability due to opcode semantics that is not fixed by existing policy flags, it is a bug and should be reported.One user argues that counter-parties should choose their keys before signing so that the fee rate is agreed upon beforehand. This argument is based on a preference that depends on circumstances. An optional commitment to witness size in bytes could be considered, with zero meaning "I don't care." However, it should be a maximum and serialized as part of the witness, which would be very compact.</summary>
