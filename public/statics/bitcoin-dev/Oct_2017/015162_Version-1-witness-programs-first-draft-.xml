    <summary>In an email sent by Mark Friedenbach on October 5, 2017 to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, an idea proposed by Johnson Lau was discussed. While attributing the idea to Russell O'Connor, Friedenbach suggests that it is uncontroversial. However, he clarifies that the proposal actually belongs to Lau. The email does not provide any further details about the content of the proposal or its potential implications. The email also includes an HTML attachment which has been scrubbed.</summary>
