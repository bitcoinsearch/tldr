    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Mark Friedenbach proposed using script execution flags based on script versions to gate new behavior instead of utilizing OP_RETURNTRUE or generalized NOP method. He argues that script versions not understood are treated as "return true" to begin with and suggests that the new soft-fork trick is to increment the script version number. However, this approach breaks parallel softfork deployments. In response to proposals for extra scripts in some fixed location in witness and extra-data as script in OP_CHECKSIG, Luke suggests treating these as their own script updates and utilizing script versioning to make such new features cheap. Additionally, he emphasizes the need for planning the overall design/layout to cover desired use cases in advance to avoid drastic changes from A to B to C.</summary>
