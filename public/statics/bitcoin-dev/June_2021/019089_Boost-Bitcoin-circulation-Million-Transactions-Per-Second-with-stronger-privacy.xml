    <summary>The author proposes a new protocol, called Sabu, which aims to improve Bitcoin's transaction processing speed and privacy. The Sabu protocol is designed to be complementary to Bitcoin, and does not use distributed ledger technology (DLT), but instead relies on a small set of users for consensus. The protocol includes a guaranteed transaction mechanism and a fee structure that incentivizes UTXO owners to put their money into the system. The author suggests using email as the primary communication method for transactions, although other communication methods could also be used. The author acknowledges potential privacy issues with using email, but argues that it is the most neutral, free, and accessible communication method globally. The Sabu protocol does not solve the issue of preventing fraud proofs, which is a known issue for Bitcoin in general. The author suggests using QR codes and device-to-device linking to add contacts to your contact list, rather than email. The author acknowledges that email is less secure and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, but suggests that it could be used for small values and known risks.</summary>
