    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around a paper by Raymo proposing the Sabu protocol, which aims to increase the circulation of Bitcoin and provide privacy. The scenario described in the paper involves an issuer who owns a UTXO, and creditors who exchange fiat money or goods/services for transactions that are meant to circulate within the Sabu protocol instead of being sent to the Bitcoin network. Creditors cannot sign transactions but can ask the issuer to change balances and transfer money to other creditors. ZmnSCPxj asks what prevents the creditor from signing an invalid transaction, to which Tao Effect responds that creditors cannot create such transactions as they need the issuer's private key. The complete paper is available at https://raymo-49157.medium.com/time-to-boost-bitcoin-circulation-million-transactions-per-second-and-privacy-1eef8568d180.</summary>
