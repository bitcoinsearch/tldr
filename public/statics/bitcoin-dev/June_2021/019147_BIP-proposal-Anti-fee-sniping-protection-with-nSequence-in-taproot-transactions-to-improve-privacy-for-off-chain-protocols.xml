    <summary>A recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has prompted a suggestion to amend Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 68. The proposal, which focuses on the use of nSequence in transaction inputs, currently states that if nSequence is set, it should only apply to the first input of the transaction in cases where there are multiple inputs. However, participants in the discussion noted that this could potentially cause complications with protocols such as Discreet Log Contract (DLC) and dual funded lightning, as the ordering of inputs is not known until both parties have revealed all of their inputs. In response to these concerns, it was suggested that the BIP be amended to state that “at least one of the inputs of the transaction” should have nSequence applied to it, rather than just the first input. Additionally, it was suggested that on-chain wallets randomly pick an input when applying nSequence.The discussion also highlighted how the proposed changes would apply not only to nSequence but also to CoinJoins, including both equal-output and payjoin transactions, and any other transactions involving multiple parties contributing inputs.</summary>
