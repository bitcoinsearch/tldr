    <summary>The conversation discusses the idea of adding an "annex field" to a script and how it could be used to limit the validity of transactions up to a certain block height. This indirection can make script validity cacheable because it remains a function of transaction data only. However, this approach cannot solve security problems through optional and completely voluntary transaction relay policy. The proposal suggests changing the definition for what counts as finalization to account for BBV transactions mined close to their expiration, but this is not considered an adequate solution. Instead, the conversation proposes making every transaction RBFable and removing the RBF flag from consideration.</summary>
