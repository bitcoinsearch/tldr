    <summary>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 68, which focuses on the use of nSequence in transaction inputs, has recently been discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal suggests that nSequence should be used instead of nLockTime anti-fee-sniping protection, as it provides greater anonymity for off-chain protocols that use point-time-locked contracts (PTLCs) such as CoinSwap, Lightning, and Discrete Log Contracts.However, participants in the discussion noted that this could potentially cause complications with protocols such as Discreet Log Contract (DLC) and dual funded lightning because the ordering of inputs is not known until both parties have revealed all of their inputs. To ensure compatibility with these protocols, it may be better to define nSequence as applying to "at least one of the inputs of the transaction" rather than just the first input. Additionally, it was suggested that on-chain wallets randomly pick an input when applying nSequence.The proposed changes would also apply to CoinJoins and other transactions involving multiple parties contributing inputs. Wallet teams are already working on implementing taproot for their on-chain app, and the author urges wallet developers to include BIP 68 as well, improving the privacy and fungibility of off-chain protocols and incentivizing miners in the low-inflation future of Bitcoin.</summary>
