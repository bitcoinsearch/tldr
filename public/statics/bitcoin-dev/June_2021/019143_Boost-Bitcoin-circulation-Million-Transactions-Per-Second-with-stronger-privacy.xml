    <summary>The discussion revolves around the Sabu protocol and its comparison with Lightning. In Sabu, only the issuer can sign the transaction and decide how much money goes to whom. The engaged UTXOs belong to the issuer, and the creditor never puts a UTXO in the transaction. The scenario presented by Alex involves Alice sending MT and GT over Sabu to Bob and then spending a UTXO to Charlie with a higher fee than the GT she sent to Bob, which could lead to double-spending. However, Raymo explains that Sabu is not comparable to Lightning, as it eliminates the need for open and close channels and provides privacy. Additionally, the process of issuing transactions and receiving payments in Sabu is different from that in Lightning. There are certain restrictions on accepting transactions by the creditor, such as using a UTXO worth at least 40,000 Sat as transaction input, reserving 10,000 Sat as a transaction fee, and paying at least 4,000 Sat of BTC-transaction-fee. Moreover, the GT is formed based on the MT, and Bob considers a transaction couple (MT, GT) valid only if they respect these rules. Finally, Alice's rational preference to not cheat on Bob could be achieved by tuning the kI and kC coefficients.</summary>
