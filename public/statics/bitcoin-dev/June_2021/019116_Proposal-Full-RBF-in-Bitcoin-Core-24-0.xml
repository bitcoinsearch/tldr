    <summary>The bitcoin community is currently discussing the future of 0-conf transactions. Some parties believe that 0-conf transactions can be useful in situations where there is some level of trust between interacting parties. However, others are concerned about the security risks associated with it. The proposal to deprecate opt-in RBF and replace it with full-RBF as the default replacement policy in the upcoming Bitcoin Core version 24.0 has been made. This proposal has highlighted two issues with opt-in RBF.Firstly, opt-in RBF can be used as a DoS vector against multi-party funded transactions by propagating an RBF opt-out double-spend of its contributed input before the honest transaction is broadcasted by the protocol orchester. Secondly, it can be used as a mempools partitions vector, where an attacker exploits network topology or divergence in mempools policies to partition network mempools in different subsets. Despite these concerns, some parts of the ecosystem still rely on 0-conf transactions, making it harmful to their quality of services if there were rapid changes to Core's mempool rules.Therefore, some proactive and reactive security models have been proposed to enhance 0-confs security, including double-spend monitoring/receiver-side fee-topping with package relay and economic reputation-based compensations. The discussion aims to find a balance between preserving the interests of 0-confs users and enabling the upcoming interests of fancy L2s to flourish. If there is an agreement on switching to full-RBF, but 0.24 sounds too early, it could be deferred to 0.25 or 0.26.Antoine, a developer in the Lightning Network community, has proposed a change to the Bitcoin protocol to allow for "turbo-channels." The proposal aims to speed up transactions and improve overall network efficiency. However, some are concerned about the security implications of allowing zero-confirmation transactions. Antoine points to previous discussions on the Lightning Network mailing list about scenario 3 and the need for the LN ecosystem to fix zero-confs security.The proposal has sparked discussion within the community about the potential risks and benefits of such a change. Overall, the proposal to implement turbo-channels highlights the ongoing debate within the Bitcoin community about how best to balance speed, efficiency, and security on the network.</summary>
