    <summary>In this conversation, two individuals are discussing the potential for a change to 1GB blocks and whether or not it should be implemented. One individual expresses their disagreement with the change, regardless of what others think. The conversation then turns to the topic of hard forks versus soft forks, with the first individual clarifying that they do not advocate for hard forks every time. The second individual raises concerns about the costs associated with an increased orphan rate and reorg rate if BIP8 LOT=true were to be deployed and only 60% of miners had upgraded to the new update by the time it activates. The discussion shifts to BIP99 and the use of miner voting in consensus rule change deployment. Another individual joins the conversation to question the use of the term "majority" and clarify that by "economic majority," they mean a set of users that presently accept more than 50% of the volume of payments in a given period of time. The conversation concludes with a discussion on the compatibility of soft forks without miner enforcement and the causes of chain splits.</summary>
