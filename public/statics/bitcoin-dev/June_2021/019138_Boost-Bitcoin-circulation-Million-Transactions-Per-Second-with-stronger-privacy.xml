    <summary>The conversation between Raymo and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the Sabu protocol and its comparison with Lightning. Raymo emphasizes that Sabu is a peer-to-peer network of doc-watchers, and it has nothing to do with Lightning. The Sabu protocol allows only the issuer (UTXO owner) to sign the transaction and decide the transfer of funds. Creditors cannot sign the transaction as they don't own the UTXOs used in the transaction. Raymo mentions that Gazin wallet will be an implementation of the Sabu protocol, which will support both Android and iPhone and will be open-source. He believes that Sabu will be much better than Lightning due to its unique features like not requiring open and close channels, no routing, and only the issuer and creditor knowing about the transaction. This feature can increase the distribution of nodes, improve privacy levels, and reduce transaction costs. ZmnSCPxj raises a concern about the security of the Sabu protocol. He asks what prevents the creditor from signing a transaction that is neither a valid MT nor a GT. He suggests that a 1-of-1 scheme is not secure and needs to be redesigned to use at least 2-of-2, as it is vulnerable to invalid transactions being signed by creditors. He believes that features are meaningless without basic trust-minimization security.</summary>
