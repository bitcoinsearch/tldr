    <summary>The sender of a transaction can offer a fee to take a specific transaction on the next block proposal. All unconfirmed transactions, including Main Transactions (MTs) and Guarantee Transactions (GTs), should be treated as potentially replaceable. The receiver must be a signatory to any unconfirmed transaction in an off-chain protocol. The smallest n-of-n that is still useful is 2-of-2, where one participant is a sender and the other is a receiver. Lightning Network splits Bitcoin into lots of little 2-of-2 cryptocurrency systems (channels), using HTLCs to transfer value across them. Channel Factories hosting Lightning Channels can further reduce blockchain resource consumption.</summary>
