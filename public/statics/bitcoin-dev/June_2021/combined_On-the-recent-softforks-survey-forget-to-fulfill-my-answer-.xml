    <summary>The recent survey on potential softforks for the near-future of Bitcoin has led to a surge in grassroots involvement in bitcoin protocol development. While softforks have received widespread attention and discussion, there are other areas of Bitcoin dev that require attention and care. For example, ongoing projects in Bitcoin Core require skills beyond pure coding, such as specification, simulations, extensive code coverage, and up-to-date meeting documents. The human layer of Bitcoin dev may be the most fruitful area for grassroots involvement, with increasing funding, mediatisation of protocol developers, and geographical diversification leading to a changing Bitcoin dev stage. However, it is unclear how to make things better in the short term, and concerns have been raised about a bubble around Bitcoin dev. Another issue in Bitcoin development is the ongoing challenge of communication among developers across different time zones and levels of energy. Maintaining fault-tolerant communication without sacrificing quality is crucial, and diversity in Bitcoin development is essential. The author congratulates female Bitcoin hackers for their contributions and emphasizes the need for developer education, including security-oriented individuals. The author also mentions concerns about direct pressure on developers, citing the ongoing CSW case. Throughout the text, several links are provided for further reading on related topics.</summary>
