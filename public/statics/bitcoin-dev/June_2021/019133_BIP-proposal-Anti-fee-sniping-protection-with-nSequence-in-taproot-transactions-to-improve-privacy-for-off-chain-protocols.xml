    <summary>The article discusses the potential complications that could arise if nSequence is set to only apply to the first input of a transaction when there are multiple inputs. This issue could impact protocols such as DLCs and dual funded lightning where the ordering of inputs is unknown until both parties have revealed all of their inputs, at which point nSequence is given. To ensure compatibility with these protocols, it may be better to define nSequence as applying to "at least one of the inputs of the transaction" instead of just the first input.</summary>
