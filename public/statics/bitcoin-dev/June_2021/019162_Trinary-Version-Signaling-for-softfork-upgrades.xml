    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n and the context discuss soft forks in Bitcoin. BIP141 provides a good summary of backward compatibility for soft forks. Non-upgraded nodes will not validate witness data and consider all witness programs as anyone-can-spend scripts. However, if majority hash power does not enforce the new rules, non-upgraded nodes would be on a different coin causing chain split. The causes of splits are bugs, coordination mistakes, and people wanting different rules. If users want change A, but only 60% miners want it, it will not cause a split. Majority hash power enforced soft forks are required for compatibility and avoiding chain splits.</summary>
