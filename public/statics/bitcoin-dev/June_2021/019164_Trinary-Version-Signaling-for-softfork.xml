    <summary>In a recent discussion, it was argued that a million nodes declaring a transaction invalid does not necessarily enforce that knowledge. Economic nodes are those who refuse to accept invalid money, but it is ultimately up to people to enforce and act on this decision. Non-economic nodes have long been established in the Bitcoin community. The idea that a node (software) does not enforce anything was challenged by Zac Greenwood, who believes that merchants enforce consensus rules through running a node that they believe enforces the rules of Bitcoin. He asserts that a node does indeed enforce consensus rules and defines what Bitcoin is, and is disturbed that this is even being debated.</summary>
