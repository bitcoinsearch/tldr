    <summary>A workshop on transaction relay will be held tomorrow on the #l2-onchain-support Libera chat from 19:00 UTC to 20:30 UTC. The scheduled topics include "Guidelines about L2 protocols onchain security design," "Coordinated cross-layers security disclosures," and "Full-RBF proposal." Notes and open questions for the first two topics can be found on GitHub. The "Move toward full-rbf" proposal will soon have its own thread. The workshops will foster knowledge sharing among attendees, with the aim of reaching rough consensus about expected goals. Those interested in attending include second-layer protocol designers, Lightning devs, Bitcoin Core devs contributing around mempool/p2p areas, or Bitcoin service operators with intense usage of the mempool. The workshop will take place on Libera, not Freenode.</summary>
