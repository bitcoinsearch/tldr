    <title>Taproot Fields for PSBT</title>

    <summary>In a recent email exchange within the Bitcoin community, Salvatore Ingala made a suggestion regarding the proposed Taproot Leaf Script. The control block for this leaf, as specified in BIP 341, is relatively large (up to 4129 bytes long), which goes against the desirable property of having short keydata for all defined PSBT types. Ingala suggested splitting the control block into two separate PSBT types: PSBT_IN_TAP_LEAF_SCRIPT and PSBT_IN_TAP_LEAF_CONTROL_BLOCK, both with no keydata. This would help maintain the assumption that dictionary keys are not very large.</summary>
