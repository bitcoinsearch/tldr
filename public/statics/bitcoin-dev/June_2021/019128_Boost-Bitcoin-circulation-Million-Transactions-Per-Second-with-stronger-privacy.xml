    <summary>In the given context, ZmnSCPxj questions the trustworthiness of Gazin wallet and suggests using Coinbase instead. They also inquire if Gazin is open-source, as it would allow for downloading the source code and using separate keys for transactions. Furthermore, they explain that Lightning is still superior because it can be completely open-sourced without risking the funds of the counterparty. ZmnSCPxj argues that the benefits of using Gazin are derived from trust assumptions, which are already present in custodial wallets. Instead, they suggest using Lightning which allows for non-custodiality while achieving high global TPS and low fees. Additionally, a central idea of Lightning is the requirement to use an n-of-n to form smaller sub-moneys from the global money.</summary>
