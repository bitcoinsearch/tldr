    <summary>In a discussion on the GitHub platform, Ryan Grant pointed out that there is confusion among those who are unaware of the recent updates to the BIP118 draft. The draft has undergone significant changes since May 2019, including a name change to SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The internal heading "Revisions" provides information on these changes. The version in bitcoin/bips remained unmodified since 2018, until it diverged and received a minor fix two months ago. Despite this, it still uses SIGHASH_NOINPUT terminology. Ryan suggests that with taproot activating, the preferred method to ease lightning network client state requirements will be SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. It is unclear why the updated draft for BIP118 is not being considered by a wider audience. The links provided on the GitHub platform offer further details regarding the revisions made to the draft.</summary>
