    <summary>Raymo has proposed a solution to improve Bitcoin's transaction per second (TPS) and privacy. The proposal can be found in his post on Medium and Bitcointalk.org. In his proposal, Raymo suggests increasing the block size limit and adding a new layer to the Bitcoin network called "Bitcoin Privacy Protocol" (BPP). This would allow for a higher TPS and improved privacy for Bitcoin users. Raymo believes that this proposal would help Bitcoin compete with other cryptocurrencies that have already implemented similar solutions. He asks for feedback on his proposal from the community.</summary>
