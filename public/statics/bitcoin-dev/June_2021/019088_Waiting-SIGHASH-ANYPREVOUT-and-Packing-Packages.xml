    <summary>In a recent email thread, Antoine Riard proposed two possible solutions to the pre-signed feerate issue for Lightning: package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. While it is unclear how SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT solves pinnings beyond those discussed in previous LN meetings logs, some believe that sighash_no_input may be a more elegant solution. However, there are concerns about this approach's compatibility with eltoo and its potential for misuse by attackers.Regarding the package-relay solution, even if every protocol based on pre-signed transactions can allow dynamically adding inputs and modifying outputs for fees and we have a perfect transaction replacement protocol, package relay is still useful for CPFP fee bumping very low-feerate transactions received from an external party. It is expected to be a permanent solution as long as the current protocol is used.However, Dave, another contributor to the email thread, expressed his disagreement with creating timelines that depend on the work of a large number of contributors without consulting them. He believes that things will get done when they get done.</summary>
