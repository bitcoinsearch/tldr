    <summary>The author of the message has noticed confusion among people who are not up to date with the most recent updates to the bip118 draft. The draft has undergone substantial edits through May 2019, including a name change to SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The changes can be found in the "Revisions" section of the internal heading. The version in bitcoin/bips was not modified since 2018 until it diverged by collecting a minor fix two months ago, and it still uses SIGHASH_NOINPUT terminology. With taproot activating, the preferred method to ease lightning network client state requirements will now definitely be SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The author is unsure why the updated draft of bip118 has yet to be considered by a wider audience.</summary>
