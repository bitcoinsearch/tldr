    <summary>In an email exchange between Christopher Allen and Andrew Poelstra, the former asked about any plans other than `raw` to support time locks in descriptors and closer integration with miniscript. In response, Andrew Poelstra mentioned that he expects miniscript to be a follow-up BIP that extends these descriptors and has timelock functionality. Christopher Allen also pointed out that all of Blockchain Commons libraries and tools are multisig descriptor-centric, and there are many scenarios that require describing time locks. He shared a link to a document titled "Designing Multisig for Independence &amp; Resilience" on Github.</summary>
