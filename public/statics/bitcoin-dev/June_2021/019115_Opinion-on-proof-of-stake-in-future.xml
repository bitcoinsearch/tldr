    <summary>A discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding proof of stake (PoS) and its suitability as a consensus system for Bitcoin has attracted attention. The debate focused on PoS's inability to produce global consensus, with implementation of PoS sacrificing global consensus for weak subjectivity. Comparatively, PoW is able to attain global consensus through solving the timestamp problem. However, there were arguments that PoS could still be used in conjunction with PoW to maintain consensus if all incentive problems were solved.Discussions also touched on the barrier to entry in PoS being permission from the previous owner of a token, which some consider to be an infinitely high barrier. Furthermore, links to additional resources on the topic were shared, including ones arguing against PoS. Moderators suggested finishing the conversation, and a reddit thread was created for those interested in continuing the discussion. The context mentions the importance of web connections in providing a more inclusive way of participating in Bitcoin development and mining. It seems that the conversation is related to the technical aspects of Bitcoin development and the different methods of mining it. Overall, the context is brief and lacks specific details about the ongoing discussion. However, the links provided can be useful for those interested in joining the mailing list and staying updated on the latest developments in Bitcoin technology.</summary>
