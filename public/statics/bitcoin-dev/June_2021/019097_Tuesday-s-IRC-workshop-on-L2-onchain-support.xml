    <summary>The recent workshop on L2 (Layer 2) zoology focused on strengthening the security assumption of transaction propagation and inclusion in a time-sensitive mined block. Discussions revolved around fee-sensitive timelocks, transaction relay overlay network, miners' profit incentive, and mining pools exposing public APIs to push transactions directly. Although the idea of fee-sensitive timelocks was raised, no comprehensive discussion took place. The speaker considered this idea challenging as obtaining the current network fee rate and feeding it into the script would be difficult. However, if drafted proposals with soft forks are made outside workshops, it would be great. The workshop acknowledged that there can never be perfect security guarantees on network transaction fee rates or transaction relay as they can go up to infinity and will always be inherently unpredictable. In addition, some successful attacks present an opportunity for the victim to divert their funds to miner fees, ensuring the attacker doesn't financially benefit from the attack. However, this does not present much assurance to the victim as one should assume that the attacker has greater resources than the victim.The impact of changes to Bitcoin Core on L2 protocols was also discussed. Some changes can conflict with the goal of minimizing transaction propagation times, and Chris_Stewart_5 proposed a nightly bitcoind build to give L2 developers a way to write regression tests against the latest builds of bitcoind. Next week's meeting will focus on fee bumping and package relay.</summary>
