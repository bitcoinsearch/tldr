    <summary>The context discusses the limitations and restrictions for Alice to accept transactions by creditor Bob. These include a minimum UTXO worth, a reserved transaction fee, a minimum BTC-transaction-fee, maximum outputs for creditors, and formation of a GT based on MT. The MT and GT are explained with an example, and it is discussed that Alice can earn profit from Charlie using the same UTXO if she pays a higher fee. However, the security analysis is dependent on fee instead of fee rate which may leave room for fraud. Additionally, the analysis assumes miners to be perfect rational beings of perfect rationality, whereas in reality they possess bounded knowledge, leaving room for fraudulent transactions to be included in a block. It is emphasized that 1-of-1 signers should not be used in safe offchain protocols.</summary>
