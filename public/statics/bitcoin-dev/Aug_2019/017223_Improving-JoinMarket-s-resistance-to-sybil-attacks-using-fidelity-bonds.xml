    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential pooling pressure to proof-of-work due to non-linearities caused by Proximity Premium and Variance Discount flaws, as well as fidelity bond schemes. The author suggests that deliberately increasing the non-linearity to V^2 worsens the pooling pressure rather than lessening it. They propose an alternative scheme of using V^0.999 and suggest ongoing efforts to expand ECDSA to more than two-party n-of-n "true" multisignatures. The author also mentions the possibility of using transaction malleability as a protection in bond transactions and explores the concept of "contract law" in the real world as a form of smart contracts. In addition, they discuss the risk associated with custodial solutions and point out that non-custodial renting of TXO signatures is more concerning due to its higher risk. Finally, the author compares the consolidation of makers due to renting TXOs to sybil attacks and suggests that consolidation may be a lesser evil in terms of privacy-relevant information sharing.</summary>
