    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Emil Engler suggested adding more moderators to speed up moderation and proposed that people who have contributed a certain number of emails should not need approval for future messages. Bryan Bishop responded that they will find more people to help with moderation and that it shouldn't take 24 hours to approve a message. The thread also discusses a proposed moving checkpoint to the Bitcoin protocol, which Kenshiro suggests to make the blockchain truly immutable after N blocks, even during a 51% attack. However, Ethan Heilman presents two potential attacks that could exploit this rule and make Bitcoin more vulnerable to 51% attacks. Heilman proposes a safer rule where if a node detects a fork with both sides having length greater than 144 blocks, it halts and requests user intervention to determine which chain to follow. Additionally, the group discusses how a state-sponsored netsplit lasting longer than N would be handled. There is mention of an active software vulnerability in Mailman causing missing emails that never hit the moderation queue. Linux Foundation is migrating away from or abandoning the email protocol, making them less willing to do backend infrastructure work.Chris Belcher responds to Dmitry Petukhov's proposal for improving JoinMarket's resistance to sybil attacks using fidelity bonds, stating that while TXO fidelity bonds can be rented out, it doesn't make a sybil attack cheaper. The aim of the fidelity bond scheme is to require makers to sacrifice value, and renting out their fidelity bond coins doesn't avoid that sacrifice because the rent paid by the attacker should be about the same as the cost of just buying the bitcoins and locking them. Lastly, Dmitry Petukhov responds to Andrew Chow's proposal for extending BIP 174 for future extensibility, stating that while he did not oppose the idea of having a prefix string, he argued that the set of future users of PSBT and private types is likely much larger than the current set of those who already implemented proprietary types on their own. Therefore, the overall benefit for the whole industry would likely be bigger when 'I do not want conflict avoidance' decision has to be explicit, by setting the prefix to 0x00, and the set of possible conflicting types are limited only to those entities that made this explicit decision.</summary>
