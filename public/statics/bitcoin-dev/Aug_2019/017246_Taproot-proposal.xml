    <summary>In this message, the author suggests an addition to John Newbery's proposal of using implicit even/odd only public keys and tweaked public keys in taproot. They propose moving the first byte of the control block (`c[0]`), which is currently used for the tapscript leaf version, to be the first OP_CODE of the tapscript itself (such as OP_0 or OP_1). This would allow the script to convey its meaning without needing to check the control block. The author argues that this would create a separation between the tapscript and leaf version and the control block, which is the merkle path to the script. The author signs off with their PGP key.</summary>
