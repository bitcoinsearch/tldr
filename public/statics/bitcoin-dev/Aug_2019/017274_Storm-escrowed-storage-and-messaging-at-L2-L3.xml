    <summary>In this message, ZmnSCPxj discusses the potential problem of the Deaf Bob Attack. The scenario presented involves Alice contacting Bob to retrieve lost data, and Bob having already signed the HTLC settlement transaction during protocol setup. However, if Bob has already selected the decryption key at setup time, he can ignore Alice entirely. If Alice publishes the HTLC settlement transaction without receiving the encrypted data, Bob can use the hashlock to reveal the decryption key, which is useless without the data. It seems that this situation may not be workable, as the decryption key is embedded in the HTLC and cannot be obtained without already being selected by Bob.</summary>
