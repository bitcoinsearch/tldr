    <summary>The email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Maxim Orlovsky discusses a proposed solution called Storm that uses the Lightning Network (LN) for decentralized data storage. The email addresses potential issues with this idea, including insufficient/unclear description of probabilistic proof, asymmetrical encryption, and transportability over LN channels. ZmnSCPxj suggests elegant solutions to these problems, including using EC for encryption/decryption and threshold ECDSA signatures. However, it is noted that the solution may be limited to a single LN channel, which must be dually-funded. The email mentions that an issue will be opened on GitHub to continue the discussion.</summary>
