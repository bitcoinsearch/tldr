    <summary>The email is a response to Chris Belcher's post on bitcoin-dev about the proposed JoinMarket fidelity bonds.  ZmnSCPxj discusses the potential weaknesses of the V^2 proposal, suggesting that it would only require signing two things with the wallet: the fidelity bond and the backout transaction. These can be done in a single session, with the private key erased permanently from memory afterward. The signature for the backout needs to be stored but can be safely stored without encryption by publishing to any cloud service. He suggests that `libsecp256k1` makes this easy. However, he notes that if part of the bond process requires a challenge "sign this random nonce for me," it would need to impose this on all makers.</summary>
