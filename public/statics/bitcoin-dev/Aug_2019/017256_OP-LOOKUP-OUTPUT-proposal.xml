    <summary>In a conversation between Runchao and ZmnSCPxj, they discussed a disagreement in the protocol regarding step 6 and the WJT payment channel. ZmnSCPxj clarified that there is a single funding transaction that will output to a modified HTLC where hashlock is Alice+Bob while Timelock is Bob, spending inputs from both Alice (10,000 WJT) and Bob (1,000,000 WJT). They also discussed what happens when Alice broadcasts the funding tx at the same time as Bob double-spends his 1,000,000 WJT input, and how it depends on the miners. They noted that concurrent-while-conflicting txs lead to highly unpredictable behaviours and introduced some attacks but can be prevented by deep confirmations of the transactions involved. Regarding the third concern, if Bob closes the channel, he cannot get the premium, which is not consistent with the original American Call Option. However, it does not matter because Bob doing so prevents the option. ZmnSCPxj concluded that any payment channel has the problem of non-cooperation by the other side, and adding in the possibility of various attacks makes it more likely that non-cooperation occurs. It is the main reason why Lightning is difficult to make support multiple currencies on the same network.</summary>
