    <summary>In an email exchange discussing a protocol from Fournier et al., Runchao Han and ZmnSCPxj discuss the steps involved in the protocol, specifically step 6, where Alice can publish or withhold the WJT transaction and Bob can wait or unilaterally close the WJT payment channel. Runchao raises concerns about what happens if both Alice and Bob publish transactions simultaneously, and whether this could introduce attacks or double-spending variants. Additionally, Runchao notes that if Bob were to close the channel without Alice's consent, he would not receive the premium. ZmnSCPxj clarifies the correct order of the protocol and explains that there is no need for optimism as most payment channel systems have unilateral closes. The two agree that the protocol depends on the implementation of the payment channel and the expertise of the participants, and discuss the need for a suitable payment channel implementation.</summary>
