    <summary>In an email exchange, Runchao Han expressed concerns about the security issues regarding a proposed protocol for Alice to pay Bob the premium contingent upon his participation. The protocol requires the creation of a payment channel, and mutually constructing a funding transaction. The problem is that Bob can arbitrage by broadcasting the tx after T+24, which allows him to receive 10,000WJT while Alice cannot redeem 1,000,000WJT anymore. If the premium is hash-timelocked, Alice can keep unraveling the preimage, which makes the atomic swap still premium-free. To solve this, Haoyu LIN had proposed a new opcode: OP_LOOKUP_OUTPUT. However, ZmnSCPxj disagrees with this proposal and asserts that there is no need to add `OP_LOOKUP_OUTPUT`.</summary>
