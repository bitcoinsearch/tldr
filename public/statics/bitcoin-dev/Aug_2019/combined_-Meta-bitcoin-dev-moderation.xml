    <summary>During a recent bitcoin-dev email thread, Emil Engler expressed concerns about the slow moderation process in place, with emails taking more than 24 hours to appear on the mailing list. Jonas Schnelli suggested adding more moderators to shorten the delay and reduce the burden of debates. Engler proposed that people who have previously contributed to the mailing list should not require approval for their emails anymore, where "n" is the number of previous emails. However, it is unclear whether this feature already exists. During the latest #bitcoin-core-dev IRC meeting, the topic was discussed, and it was decided that further discussion would take place via the mailing list, as it is the most appropriate platform for such discussions. The current moderation process takes over 24 hours for an email to be approved, which has been deemed inadequate. The strategy of having moderators in different time zones to cover sleep shifts or other disruptions of service has not been effective. Additionally, there is an active software vulnerability that requires moderation to be enabled, and the current version of mailman is unmaintained. The Linux Foundation is migrating away from or abandoning the email protocol, making them less willing to do backend infrastructure work, causing downtime and missing emails that never hit the moderation queue. Despite these challenges, Bryan shared his contact information for anyone who needs to get in touch.The conversation during the IRC meeting ended with greetings from Emil Engler and an attachment of pEpkey.asc, which is an application/pgp-keys file.</summary>
