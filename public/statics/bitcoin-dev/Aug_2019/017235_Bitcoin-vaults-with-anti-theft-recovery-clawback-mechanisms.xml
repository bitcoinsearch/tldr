    <summary>The emails exchanged between ZmnSCPxj and Bryan provide details about re-vaulting transactions and their limitations. The re-vaulting transaction is signed during transaction tree setup to prevent a coin withdrawal during the public observation delay period. The coins are directed back into a new identically-configured vault instead of being relinquished through the delayed-spend transaction timeout for hot wallet key signing. There seems to be a limit to the number of times a vault can be used as the number of times the vault setup function is run is the limit on the number of re-valuings possible. The total number of pre-signed transactions isn't really that high, and with exponential backoff on the relative timelock values, you can have high-resolution timelocks well into the future. Regarding using the same keys or new ones for revaulting, it depends on individual vault users. If the user doesn't want to deal with the expense of managing multiple unique keys and other data, then they might prefer using the same values and storing a small blob for a long time instead of many different blobs stored in various places to deal with.</summary>
