    <summary>Niels, a software test specialist who runs a private full Bitcoin node based on Raspberry Pi 4, is seeking guidance on the tests performed during installation/upgrade/compilation of software for the node. Niels is looking for an overview of the common approach to testing and refining test cases. He would also like to try some manual tests as part of his learning process. However, he finds the tests provided on GitHub insufficient and seeks help from someone who can join him or share information that guides him.
