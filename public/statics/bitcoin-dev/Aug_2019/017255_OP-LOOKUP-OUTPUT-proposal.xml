    <summary>In an email conversation between Runchao Han and ZmnSCPxj, the two discussed the protocol from Fournier et al. in which Bob participates in the swap with Alice following several steps. If Alice stalls by withholding the WJT tx, Bob cannot do anything except close the payment channel and quit. The issue of whether Bob can spend his money in this payment channel while it's still valid depends on how the payment channel is implemented. If Bob decides to close the channel without Alice's consent, he can get back 1,000,000 WJT but not the 10,000 WJT premium. This time frame can be made arbitrarily small by Bob through a simple threat of unilateral close, making it not an option for Alice.</summary>
