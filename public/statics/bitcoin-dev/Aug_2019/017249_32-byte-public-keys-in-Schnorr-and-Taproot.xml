    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille suggested that if changes are to be made regarding public keys, it should be done cleanly and the extra byte should be dropped. He personally prefers the simplicity and uniformity of 32 bytes over the oddness of 33. Although this might require some developers to revise their prototype implementations, the risk is always present when creating code for unfinished specs. Christopher Allen proposed considering a non-binary format for sharing public keys, such as using bech32, to provide a useable encoding format for emerging protocols that may utilize Schnorr public keys in new ways.</summary>
