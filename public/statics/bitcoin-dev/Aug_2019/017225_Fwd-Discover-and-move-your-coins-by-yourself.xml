    <summary>Aymeric Vitte has released Phase 3 of the bitcoin-transactions GitHub repository, which includes features like creating transactions, decoding transactions, verifying transactions, converting and mapping addresses, creating and mapping wallets, multisig redeem scripts, pub key and private key mapping, conversion, and formats, and signing and verifying messages. Aymeric Vitte merged former bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets nodejs modules with additional features under a MIT license. The code is open source now after removing initial dev fees. The aim of this project is to provide all necessary tools for anybody to discover and manage their coins, as well as making transactions by themselves without having to sync a full node or as an alternative to wallets. This project is not a remake of iancoleman's tool and will extend all existing tools inside one tool with no limitations. The browser version will be a secure standalone offline js webapp inside browsers. Comments/suggestions are welcome.The project is financed by NLnet via EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Search and Discovery call. The intent is to make it easier for people to move and manage their own coins without syncing a full node or using a wallet. The tool is available for any Bitcoin-based coins and is not restricted to its own wallet. It is somewhere between Bitcoin-cli outside of Bitcoin core and easy to use. It is an alternative to wallets when people don't understand where their coins are. The project includes some features that overlap with iancoleman's tool, as well as other existing tools.</summary>
