    <summary>In an email conversation between David and ZmnSCPxj, the latter states that new Bitcoin applications such as JoinMarket, Wasabi wallet, and Arwen have a problem of having novel bitcoin scripts. However, for CoinJoin (JoinMarket, Wasabi), there is no need for novelties in Bitcoin scripts as they use only P2WPKH `SIGHASH_ALL` signatures and P2WPKH outputs. ZmnSCPxj does not believe that Miniscript would benefit these specific applications. Arwen seems to be a payment-channel implementation that is exchange-specific.</summary>
