    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about the Deaf Bob Attack. In this attack scenario, Bob claims to have lost the data needed for a transaction and Alice is left with no choice but to broadcast the HTLC settlement transaction. However, if Bob had already selected the decryption key at setup time, he can ignore Alice and still receive the stake and reward. If Alice does publish the HTLC settlement transaction, Bob can reveal the decryption key, but it is useless without the encrypted data. The issue was raised on Twitter as well, where others expressed similar concerns about unclear points in the presentation and whether they can be salvaged.</summary>
