    <summary>The conversation between Maxim and ZmnSCPxj discusses possible solutions to implement Storm, a new off-chain payment channel network. The discussion revolves around the validation of probabilistically checkable proofs by Alice. It is mentioned that Alice needs to take a "shot" from the data in a form of a Merkle tree and keep its root for herself. Additionally, they discuss using asymmetric encryption using EC for atomic payments, threshold ECDSA signatures, and dual-funding channels. Dual-funding is not strictly necessary in a world where atomic cross-system swaps are already possible. Fulgurite, a project to split a channel into Lightning part and DLC (discreet log contract) part, is also mentioned as a possible solution.</summary>
