    <summary>It has been decided that Compact Size Unsigned Integers will be used for field types in an upcoming project. For proprietary types, one suggestion is to use a unique identifier, in the form of a variable length string prefixed with a compact size unsigned integer, followed by the actual type for the data as defined by the user. This will help prevent usage of proprietary types outside of private contexts. A single 0x00 byte can be used if no prefix is wanted. Public software does not need to handle these proprietary types and does not need to enforce the above rules except for the use of the proprietary type value.</summary>
