    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky has proposed a solution to the Deaf Bob Attack, which involves adding two new intermediary HTLC transactions called confirmation and fallbacks. If Alice doesn't get the data, she can sign the HTLC fallback tx and get her money back as compensation for Bob's stake. Bob can prove that he still has the data by providing a "preimage" to the secret hashed by Alice. This requires Bob to select the decryption key at setup time and ensure that the data is encrypted using EC multiplication with some factor provided by Alice. The only possibility for cheating now is if Alice no longer needs the data and avoids paying the full amount for storage, which Bob must take into account at setup time.</summary>
