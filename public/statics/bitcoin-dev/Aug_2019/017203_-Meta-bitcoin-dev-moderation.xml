    <summary>During the latest #bitcoin-core-dev IRC meeting, the slow mailing list moderation process was discussed. It was decided that further discussion on this topic would take place via the mailing list, as it is the most appropriate platform for such a discussion. Currently, the moderation process takes over 24 hours for an email to be approved. In response to this issue, Jonas Schnelli proposed adding more moderators to shorten the delay and make debates less cumbersome. Emil Engler suggested that people who have previously contributed to the mailing list should not require approval for their emails anymore, with "n" being the number of previous emails. The question was raised whether or not this already exists. The conversation ended with greetings from Emil Engler and an attachment of pEpkey.asc, which is an application/pgp-keys file.</summary>
