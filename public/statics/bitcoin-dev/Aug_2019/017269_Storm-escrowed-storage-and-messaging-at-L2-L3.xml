    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky has proposed a design for distributed storage and messaging with escrow/economic incentivization, which leverages the LNP/BP ecosystem and works at Layer 2 and 3. The proposal allows constructing a special type of payment channels that guarantee remote data storage and retrieval while mitigating counterparty risks through economic stimulus such as stakes. This idea can be combined with Lightning Network to operate entirely off-chain. The proposal came as a side-effect of joint work on RGB and single-use seals technologies, but it can be very useful for other L2/L3 technologies requiring client-stored data, like ensuring external storage of script data for Taproot, scriptless scripts or Prometheus (technology for scalable computing). Interested parties are welcome to provide comments, criticisms or discuss driving Storm development forward.</summary>
