    <summary>Niels Thijssen, a software test specialist who runs a private full bitcoin node, inquired about the tests performed during installation/upgrade/compilation of the software for the node. He asked if there is any overview on what's the (common) test approach or other stuff because the tests on GitHub don't help him much. However, he did not receive any answers from the mailing list since it is centered around the development of the Bitcoin protocol and conventions about its usage across multiple applications. Instead, he was directed to https://bitcoincore.org/en/contribute/ where he can learn about the Bitcoin Core software and its testing infrastructure.</summary>
