    <summary>The article discusses the need for a way to make renting out TXOs impossible or very difficult to stop the easy mindless renting method. Two schemes were suggested, one with shared ownership of TXOs and the other requiring fidelity bond TXOs to be held in hot wallets. However, both schemes fail because with muSig, shared ownership of TXO is possible and 2P-ECDSA is also possible. A suggestion was made to impose penalties or revoke participation of TXOs in the market by publishing special signatures to spoil an attacker's consolidation via rent. Additionally, all locked TXOs may be required to be spendable by any key that controls any TXO in the 'bond TXO package'. An off-chain contractual relationship between parties would be needed for both scenarios to work for the attacker.</summary>
