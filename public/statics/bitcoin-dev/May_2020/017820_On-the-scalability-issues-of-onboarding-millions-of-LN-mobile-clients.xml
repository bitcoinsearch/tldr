    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev email exchange, Antoine Riard suggested that the trust-minimization of Bitcoin security model may be shifted from running a full node to the Lightning Network. However, this idea was opposed by Luke Dashjr who argued that this would compromise Bitcoin's security. He mentioned that Bitcoin's future looks bleak due to severe regressions in the full node ratio, and without serious improvements, it is likely to fail. Therefore, all efforts to improve the "full node-less" experience are harmful and should be avoided. BIP 157, which improves privacy of fn-less usage, should not be merged into Core. Luke also mentioned that assuming a user adoption path where a full-node is required to benefit for LN may deprive a lot of users, especially those who are already denied a real financial infrastructure access. However, he argues that if Bitcoin can't do it securely, then Bitcoin can't solve any problem at all. In conclusion, Luke and a few others oppose the merging support for BIP 157 in Core.</summary>
