    <summary>The writer proposes that private full nodes serving headers to a handful of weak devices is a good solution against all sorts of problems in a future full of Lightning Network (LN) + Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes. However, the inconvenience of having such a server at home prevents this from being a popular choice. The UX of connecting mobile LN clients to home full nodes needs to be made extremely easy so that centralised services cannot improve much on that step, especially if a user already runs a full node. Educating users on the distinction between client and server apps is important, as is the development of apps that require "zero configuration" or have very easy in-app walkthroughs of the bare essentials of configuration. GUI style installs of server applications familiar to those who have installed desktop or mobile software are also essential. The issue with SPV is not whether it is used, but rather whether or not the node it is tethered to is actually trusted since SPV necessarily trusts some dimensions of the information supplied to it. Doing SPV against a full node you own is no more dangerous than indexing watch only addresses in Core and then asking for wallet/utxo information over RPC.</summary>
