    <summary>The email conversation is about solving the problem of spending coins after coinjoin in a secure manner. The idea proposed involves using multisig transactions with three parties involved and reviewing outputs before confirming the transaction. In case of disputes, the system can become complex by locking some amount of money in a 2 of 2 multisig or using incentive structures. The focus is on post-mix usage as it is equally important as coinjoin and some users do not follow best practices which make coinjoin less effective. The email clarifies that the description is about how JoinMarket performs spends after mixing, not how it performs mixing.</summary>
