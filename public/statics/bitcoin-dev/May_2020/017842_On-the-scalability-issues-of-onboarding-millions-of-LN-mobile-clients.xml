    <summary>Christopher Allen, founder of Blockchain Commons, expressed interest in hosting a collaboration for proposals on defining different sets of wallet functionality that could inform the future of core wallet functionality as it gets refactored. The collaboration could start with a transparent shim between bitcoin-core and remote RPC. Allen also discussed his FullyNoded2 multisig wallet on iOS and Mac, which communicates with a personal node over RPC, securing the connection using Tor over a hidden onion service and two-way client authentication using a v3 Tor Authentication key. However, he wishes that the full RPC functionality was not exposed in bitcoin-core and proposes a cryptographic capability mechanism such that the remote wallet could only mask the node functions it needs. This feature set should go both ways, from a minimum subset needed for being a watch-only transaction verification tool to things RPC canâ€™t do like deleting a wallet and changing bitcoin.conf parameters and rebooting, without requiring full ssh access to the server running the node. Refactoring in Core wallets is making good progress, and feedback and proposals on future changes with regards to usability would be greatly appreciated.</summary>
