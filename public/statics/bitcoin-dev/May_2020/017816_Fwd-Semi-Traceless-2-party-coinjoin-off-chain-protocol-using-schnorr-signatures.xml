    <summary>The discussion is about the flaws in the heuristic of Chain analysis, which presumes that 1-input-1-output transfers are self-transfers. The article also discusses how privacy is maintained via creating false positives and explains that privacy relying on false positives works by having a large number of other sets of transactions which add up to V just by chance. It further talks about how PayJoin might not buy one as much as they think and proposes that it is better to avoid small merges of a few coins and do the occasional mass merge of large numbers of coins. Moreover, the article suggests different ways to solve the problem of 1-input-1-output transactions being markers, such as for Alice to spend her UTXOs in 2-output transactions and mess with the change output detection heuristics. Finally, the article talks about Private key turnover, its benefits, and features, such as getting PayJoin at the second transaction for free, reducing the cost on Bob to merge large numbers of coins at once, letting Alice the taker cut-through for a new maker if she wants to do multi-round swaps, etc.</summary>
