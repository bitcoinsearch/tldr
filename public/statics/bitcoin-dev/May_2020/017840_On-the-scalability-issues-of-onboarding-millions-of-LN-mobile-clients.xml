    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer mailing list, Keagan McClelland expressed the need for an interface between a peer and owner interface. The FullyNoded2 multisig wallet on iOS &amp; Mac serves as an interface between a personal full node and a user, however, it exposes the full RPC functionality in bitcoin-core. Christopher Allen proposes a cryptographic capability mechanism that allows remote wallets to ask only for the node functions needed, with additional authorization required for other rarer services. The capability mechanism should work both ways and allow for different sets of wallet functionality. Blockchain Commons would be interested in hosting a collaboration to define these sets of wallet functionality, which could inform proposals for future core wallet functionality as it gets refactored.</summary>
