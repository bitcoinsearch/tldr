    <summary>The email exchange between Ruben Somsen and ZmnSCPxj discusses the proposed CoinSwap protocol. Refund #1 can only safely be used before the signed success tx is given to Bob. Refund #2 needs to be used after Bob receives the signed success tx. There is still an online requirement in case Bob does not complete the protocol. The video restates what is in the write-up, but it might be easier to understand concepts from video. The onlineness requirement doesn't expire, and is specifically how the 2 tx SAS protocol is performed. Bob never broadcasts the success transaction (unless he prefers not to have to be online, i.e. the 3 tx SAS protocol) and instead Alice and Bob swap their keys: first Bob hands over secretAlice, then Alice hands over her key. In the context of CoinSwap, a proposal is that a CoinSwap server would provide swapping service to incoming clients. Using ZmnSCPxj's counterproposal, the Bob position can be taken by the server and the Alice position taken by the client.</summary>
