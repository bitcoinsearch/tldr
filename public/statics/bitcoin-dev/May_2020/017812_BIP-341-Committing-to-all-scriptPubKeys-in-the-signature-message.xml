    <summary>In a discussion about verifying output scriptPubKeys in Bitcoin transactions, it was pointed out that not verifying these keys would limit one's ability to track where funds went. The only information that could be determined would be the fees, and even then, it may not be accurate if one of the scriptPubKeys turned out to be OP_TRUE. This scenario may make sense for a transaction accelerator trying to increase fees for someone else's transaction, but it would require not caring about the output addresses and being content with not receiving any change. However, even in cases where only some of the output destinations matter, all output ScriptPubKeys would still need to be examined. The current design of sharing the hashOutputs value with BIP-143 is seen as a valuable property to maintain.</summary>
