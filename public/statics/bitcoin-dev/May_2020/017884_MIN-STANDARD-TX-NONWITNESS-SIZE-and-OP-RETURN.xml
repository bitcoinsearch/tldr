    <summary>On May 23, 2020, Thomas Voegtlin posted a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list inquiring about why a transaction he attempted to CPFP using OP_RETURN was rejected due to its low size. The scriptPubkey of the output was OP_RETURN + OP_0 with a single p2wsh input, resulting in a 60 byte transaction without witness. However, the transaction was rejected because it did not meet the MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE requirement of 82 bytes. A member of the mailing list responded, stating that the reason for the high value of MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE was to protect against CVE-2017-12842 covertly. A link to the GitHub pull request (#16885) was provided, which updated the text to explicitly mention this fact. Thomas' inquiry highlights the need for understanding the various requirements and protections in place within the Bitcoin network. The response from the mailing list member provides valuable insight into the reasoning behind certain standards, such as MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE. It is important for developers and users alike to stay informed and up-to-date on these standards to ensure the safety and efficiency of transactions within the network.</summary>
