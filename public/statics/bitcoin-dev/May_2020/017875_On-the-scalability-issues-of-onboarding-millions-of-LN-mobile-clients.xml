    <summary>In a recent message on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos discussed the idea of private full nodes serving headers to weak devices as a solution against problems in the future with Lightning Network (LN) and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes. He noted that it should be a top priority to make the user experience (UX) of connecting mobile LN clients to home full nodes extremely easy to prevent centralized services from improving upon this step. To achieve this, he suggested using a node provider like FullyNoded or Casa and described his own personal setup at home, which includes bitcoind, clightning, zerotier (or tailscale), and sparkwallet bound to a zerotier interface. Litos believes that as long as you have a node that runs these bits of software, including assumeutxo to speed up initial block download, and a QR-code automagic setup, the UX for connecting mobile LN clients to home full nodes would be straightforward. However, he acknowledged that users would still need to deal with lightning backups and liquidity issues, which require further work on the software side to improve the experience.</summary>
