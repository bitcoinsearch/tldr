    <summary>The conversation discusses the possibility of Lightning replacing centralized custodial services, allowing for scalability and maintaining noncustodiality. It is speculated that a Lightning future with massive SPV may end up with more economic weight in SPV nodes than in a world dependent on centralized custodial services to scale. However, evaluating economic weight in Lightning is difficult due to the different chain views of both parties. The conversation then moves on to discuss the implementation of backup servers that are publicly-facing rather than privately-owned, but ensuring uniform distribution is challenging in a free market, which tends towards monopolies. An alternative solution proposed is to have everyone run a privately-owned server, similar to having a Lightning node at home with a full node accessed via a remote control mobile device. The conversation concludes with the idea that combining UX, user education, and fallback security mechanisms may be a better solution to avoid economy hijack than PoW-only SPV.</summary>
