    <summary>Keagan McClelland suggests that light clients should explicitly choose their full node tethers. He proposes a trust model where users can pick their trusted source even if they do not want to run their own node. This would allow many light clients to work off of a family node and limit peer services to some sort of “authenticated” peers. The RPC interface in Bitcoin Core exposes a lot of unnecessary functionality such as `gettxoutsetinfo`, which can start an intensive CPU and disk I/O task, and introduces risks. Electrum servers read blocks from disk instead and use the RPC interface to sync headers. However, Electrum servers have a risk of DoS with addresses that have many transactions.</summary>
