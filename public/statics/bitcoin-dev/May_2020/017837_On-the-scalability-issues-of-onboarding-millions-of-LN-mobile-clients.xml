    <summary>The author suggests that there is a demand for a peer service model between "full public" and "owner only" interfaces. This would enable low-cost ways to serve peer services to people with explicit permission, without giving them full administrative access to the node. The RPC interface in Bitcoin Core exposes functionality that isn't necessary and introduces risks, which limits its effectiveness for this purpose. There are many use cases where something "in between" a peer interface and an owner interface is needed. While the idea could potentially be incorporated into core, it is not clear whether this is the best approach. Without such a model, limiting exposure for serving bip157 filters is difficult. However, Electrum servers have their own risks of DoS with certain addresses, which highlights the need for careful consideration when implementing such solutions.</summary>
