    <summary>ZmnSCPxj explains his idea of post-mix usage using multisig and CPFP to Prayank in a Medium article. The protocol involves participants Peer 3 as the payee, Peer 2 as the payer, and Peer 1 as an enabling trusted third party. The goal is for Peer 2 to pay 0.006BTC to Peer 3. The current conditions are that Peer 2 owns 0.01BTC in a single UTXO, and Peer 1 owns 0.05BTC in a single UTXO. The protocol consists of three steps. Firstly, Peer 2 and Peer 1 compute a 2-of-3 address with their public keys and Peer 3's public key. Secondly, they both individually pay their owned funds to the 2-of-3 address. Lastly, after confirmation, they consume the new outputs into another transaction with equal-valued outputs, hiding who owns which coins.ZmnSCPxj confirms his understanding of the protocol and suggests JoinMarket has a superior technology that doesn't require a trusted third party. JoinMarket allows the market taker to decide how much the equal-value outputs are and define the address it goes to. The destination address can be to a payee and doesn't have to be controlled by the market taker. JoinMarket also includes how to get in touch with enabling third parties called "market makers."</summary>
