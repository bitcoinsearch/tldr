    <title>MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE and OP_RETURN</title>

    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Voegtlin discusses an issue he faced while trying to CPFP a transaction using OP_RETURN. Due to the dust threshold, the remaining output value was lower and thus, the scriptPubkey of the output became OP_RETURN+OP_0 with a single p2wsh input. However, the resulting 60 bytes transaction (without witness) was rejected because it was lower than MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE which is equal to 82 bytes. Thomas asks why this value is so high and if it would make sense to lower it to 60. In response, Greg Sanders explains that the number was picked to protect against CVE-2017-12842 covertly and shares a link to the pull request that updated the text to explicitly mention this fact.</summary>
