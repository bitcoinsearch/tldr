    <summary>The conversation revolves around a proposed protocol where Alice and Bob share secrets on the Litecoin (LTC) side and compete for it, with both parties using revoke transactions to claim their funds. The discussion highlights potential issues with the proposal, including the risk of competing revoke transactions and the use of refund transactions that could lead to chaos if they are broadcasted. The conversation also discusses the use of multiple CPFP outputs to prevent RBF and the need for a backup watcher in case one party behaves irrationally. The proposal is compared to Lightning Network's HTLCs which require absolute timelocks due to coordination issues. The conversation ends with a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of spending the revoke transaction before or after its absolute timelock period.</summary>
