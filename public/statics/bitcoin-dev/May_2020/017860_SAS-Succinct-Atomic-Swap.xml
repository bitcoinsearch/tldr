    <summary>A proposal for a coinswap scheme requiring only two transactions has been shared, which can improve scalability and privacy. The original coinswap proposal would reveal a funding transaction followed by a success transaction, which could be used as a fingerprint. Relative timelocks with OP_CSV could be used to create an old-style coinswap scheme, which would have the same two-transaction effect and bring efficiency and privacy gains. Private key handover was mentioned in the original Lightning Network paper in 2016, but nobody thought to apply it to coinswap or realized its benefits.</summary>
