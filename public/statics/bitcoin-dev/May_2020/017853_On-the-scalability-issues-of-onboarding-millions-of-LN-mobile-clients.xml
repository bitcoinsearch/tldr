    <summary>The discussion focuses on the issue of off-grid nodes relying on opportunistic local network peers for blockchain information in the Lightning Network. The concern is that direct peers could collude to not forward payment, making validation information unavailable to the off-grid node. One solution proposed is to use a system similar to watchtowers, where the validation-information-provider is prepaid and issues tokens that can be redeemed later. However, this is not suitable for opportunistic on-same-WiFi scenarios. Another solution involves using an alternative HTLC construct that only pays for valid 81 B headers that hash to 32 B values with a number of leading zeros committed by the HTLC. Public watchtowers or HTTP proxy data cache similar to a watchtower makes the most sense as they would be economically motivated and LN payment aware. Network agents that monetize full node information services beyond channel monitoring would be more than just a "Watchtower" for light clients.</summary>
