    <summary>In a recent observation, ZmnSCPxj suggested that light clients requesting for validation information might be at risk of defrauding from their peers. This could cause the money they have in their channels to become valueless. Opportunistically paying for validation information could also lead to direct peers not forwarding any payments, which would make it impossible for the light client to pay for the validation information. Therefore, ZmnSCPxj recommends using a system similar to watchtowers, wherein the validation-information-provider is prepaid and issues tokens that can be redeemed later. However, this may not be suitable for opportunistic on-same-WiFi situations where a laptop is running a validation-information-provider-for-payment program on the same WiFi as a light-client mobile phone. ZmnSCPxj suggests that one solution to this problem could be to use watchtower service providers.</summary>
