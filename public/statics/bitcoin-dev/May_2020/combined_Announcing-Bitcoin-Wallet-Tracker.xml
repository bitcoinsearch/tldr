    <summary>Nadav Ivgi has developed a new HD wallet indexer, bwt, that is similar to Electrum Personal Server and provides additional indexes on top of the bitcoind wallet functionality. The design is aimed at tracking an xpub and automatically deriving new addresses as needed, according to the gap limit. Bwt can query the Electrum RPC protocol and uses a modern HTTP REST API for app developers. Compared to using the bitcoind RPC directly, bwt provides real-time updates via Server-Sent Events or Web Hooks and minimizes RPC requests to bitcoind. The indexer can index 10k incoming txs in under a second or a mixture of 5k/5k in under 5 seconds.Esplora-electrs and bwt are compared by Antoine, who asked how they compare performance-wise. Both APIs are designed by Nadav and have similarities. Although it's difficult to compare their performance directly, esplora-electrs keeps a full index of everything, while bwt tracks wallet addresses only. If the user is only interested in wallet addresses and doesn't have a huge number of them, bwt will perform better. But if there are a lot of addresses, esplora-electrs will be better suited for the job. Esplora provides all the information one might want to know about transactions/blocks, while bwt intentionally reduces this to the subset useful in the context of app development. One major item on the roadmap that Nadav hopes to tackle soon is support for output script descriptors. Interested contributors can check out the README for useful developer resources as well as a handy script for setting up a development environment. This is an early alpha release, recommended for use with testnet/regtest.</summary>
