    <summary>The author discusses the economic weight of nodes in evaluating miner consensus-hijack success. They suggest that even if miners lure a majority of SPV clients, they may not be able to stir economic nodes due to their different economic weights. The author hopes that Lightning will replace centralized custodial services and explains how this would work. They also discuss the distribution of economic weight between the world with centralized custodial services and the Lightning future. The author suggests implementing forks detection and fallback to backup nodes to strengthen SPV, but this may lead to centralization. They suggest incentivizing publicly-facing backup servers to prevent monopoly.</summary>
