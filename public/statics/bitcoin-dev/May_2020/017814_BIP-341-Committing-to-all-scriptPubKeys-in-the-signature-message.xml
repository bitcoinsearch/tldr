    <summary>In an email exchange, Anthony Towns raises concerns about missing information in Bitcoin transactions. He notes that the height of a coin and whether it is a Coinbase output are not currently covered by any signature mode. While Towns suggests that committing to the coinbase flag might have some use, he cautions against adding the height of the coin as it would make it hard to chain unconfirmed spends. The coinbase output flag is already covered by the signature, but Towns expresses concern about making it easier to distinguish coinbase outputs from other outputs. However, no one is seriously proposing adding this information.</summary>
