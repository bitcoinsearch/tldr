    <summary>The discussion between Richard and ZmnSCPxj is about the challenges of an off-grid node relying on a local network peer for blockchain information. They discussed how the direct peers could collude to not forward the payment, thus making it difficult for light clients to obtain validation information. ZmnSCPxj suggested that using a system similar to watchtowers, wherein the validation-information-provider is prepaid and issues tokens that can be redeemed later, would work. However, Richard pointed out that this approach is not suitable for opportunistic on-same-WiFi. They also discussed privacy concerns when public-service nodes serve generic/un-personalized headers/filters/blocks to light clients. To address this, they recommended using Tor to access public-service nodes and decorrelating payments for services.</summary>
