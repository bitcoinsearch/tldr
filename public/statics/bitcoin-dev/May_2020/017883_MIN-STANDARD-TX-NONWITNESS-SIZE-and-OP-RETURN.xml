    <summary>In a mailing list, Thomas asked about his attempt to CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) a transaction using OP_RETURN. He explained that the remaining output value would have been lower than the dust threshold. The scriptPubkey of the output was OP_RETURN + OP_0, and there was a single p2wsh input. However, the result is a 60 bytes transaction (without witness), which is lower than MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE, which is equal to 82 bytes. Thomas was curious about why the value of MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE is so high and whether it would make sense to lower it to 60.</summary>
