    <summary>The author has shared a proof of concept in a Medium article, demonstrating the use of multisig and CPFP for post-mix usage. They are seeking feedback on whether it would make sense to add these options to the Bitcoin Core wallet, particularly with the upcoming taproot upgrade and its potential impact on privacy for multisig transactions. The author cites Peter Wuille's response on Reddit, which suggests taproot could indeed improve privacy for multisig. Overall, the author is looking for input to further develop their idea beyond just an article on Medium.</summary>
