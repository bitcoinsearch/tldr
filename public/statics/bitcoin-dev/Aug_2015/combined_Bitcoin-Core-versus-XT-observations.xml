    <summary>The ongoing block size issue in Bitcoin is causing uncertainty among investors and those who start companies, but people who invest directly in Bitcoin seem to enjoy the challenges. The recent Greek debt crisis led some to believe that Bitcoin could be used as a replacement currency, resulting in a spike in price, which some took advantage of by selling their coins. However, with reports of Bitcoin splitting in two, the price has dropped, allowing for buying back of coins. It's important to consider "developer attacks" when discussing the future of Bitcoin.On August 19th, 2015, Ken Friece via bitcoin-dev expressed his opinion on the idea of Not-BitcoinXT in an email. He argued that it was a "really terrible idea" because Mike had proven time and time again that he would not back down or blink. Friece believed that the chances of Not-BitcoinXT gaining 25% of the hashrate were pretty much nil, and as a result, all it would do is help XT reach the 75% threshold sooner and put more people on the losing side of the fork. However, if 25% or more of the hashpower were against XT, Not-BitcoinXT could become an important weapon for them. And while some may have dismissed it as a bad idea, it had the potential to shake the market. Currently, the debate over the block size issue in Bitcoin has led to many users running the XT client, not necessarily because they specifically support BIP101 but rather as a vote for bigger blocks. However, if Core were to support bigger blocks, most XT users would switch back to Core and XT would die. There are many scaling solutions that Core could adopt to appease XT users enough to kill XT. The longer it takes for Core to reach consensus on this issue, the stronger XT gets. The Bitcoin market price has a far greater mining centralizing effect than larger blocks ever will. With the total Bitcoin market cap under ~5 billion at the next halving in July 2016, it's game over for all but the most efficient miners. The mining centralization that may occur with 8MB blocks in 2016 is nothing compared to the centralization that will occur if the total Bitcoin market cap does not grow substantially between now and the next halving. Investors hate uncertainty, and the block size issue is adding a lot of uncertainty right now, making the mining nightmare scenario outlined above more likely. The entire ecosystem needs time to adjust and grow once a Core scaling solution is adopted. Not-BitcoinXT is considered a really terrible idea by some. Mike Hearn, the creator of the XT client, has proven time and time again that he will not blink or back down. The chances of Not-BitcoinXT gaining 25% of the hashrate are pretty much nil, so in effect, all Not-BitcoinXT will do is help XT reach the 75% threshold sooner and result in putting more people on the losing side of the fork.</summary>
