    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd, Garzik questioned the claim that Bloom filter usage has declined significantly in Bitcoin. While no data was provided to support the claim, Todd pointed out that he has noticed a drop in SPV clients from 5-10% down to 1% of his high speed nodes. He also mentioned the popularity of wallets like Mycelium that use SPV verification instead of bloom filters. However, Todd notes that the NODE_GETUTXO's implementation has provided infrastructure for wallets that need bloom filters to find appropriate nodes to connect to, and there are no shortages of nodes for those wallets to use. The email chain ends with Todd's signature and a PGP signature attachment.</summary>
