    <summary>The email conversation between Jorge Timón and Mike Hearn, two developers of Bitcoin, discusses their differing views on the optimal size limit for Bitcoin blocks. Mike Hearn believes that the block size limit should eventually be removed, while Jorge Timón believes that artificially constraining the block size would be better. He suggests a one-time increase to 8MB as a compromise between these two extreme positions. If the block size is increased to 8MB and it leads to problems, then another hard fork can reduce the block size back down. The discussion also touches on issues related to mining centralization and fees. While Hearn believes that a larger block size does not necessarily lead to more centralization, Timón disagrees and argues that limiting mining centralization should be a priority when deciding on consensus rules. They both agree that the impact on market fees is a secondary concern.</summary>
