    <summary>The author of the context expresses concerns about using Github for high-level discussions of a draft BIP and instead posts their thoughts on the proposal structure and wording. They suggest slimming down and simplifying the proposal's structure and history lessons. Additionally, they inquire whether BIP-001 was followed in regard to spelling checking and editor approval. The author also questions what kind of proposal this is: Informational, Process or Standards track. They believe it should be Standards Track and propose that the upgrade path be included as a patch into core, serving as a module that hard forks can use in the future. Alternatively, they suggest splitting up the BIP into a Standards track and a separate Informational BIP.</summary>
