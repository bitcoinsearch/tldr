    <summary>In August 2015, Eric Lombrozo, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, expressed his concern that the biggest challenge facing Bitcoin was not technical but political. He believed that until the political issues were resolved, technical discussions would be purely philosophical, making progress on consensus moot. Lombrozo's message was in response to a discussion regarding a hard fork with respect to block size. Alex Morcos also wrote a message in which he hoped all core devs would sign on to, requesting individual self-restraint to allow the list to return to a higher signal-to-noise ratio. He advised members to consider the degree to which any email sent is related to technical development before sending it and to avoid endless debate on the philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin.</summary>
