    <summary>A discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in August 2015 about the idea of a minimum block size for Bitcoin. Levin Keller initiated the conversation, asking if anyone was in favor of a minimum block size of 2 MB or more. However, Patrick Strateman responded by stating that he saw no value in requiring a minimum block size. Jeff Garzik added that traffic levels may not produce a minimum size block and miners could always collude to produce a lowered maximum block size, which is a sort of minimum maximum. It was also noted that miners could pay to themselves with a matured satoshi as many times as they need in the same block, making the minimum block size rule ineffective for SPV mining. Overall, the discussion did not lead to any concrete conclusions or proposals regarding the implementation of a minimum block size.</summary>
