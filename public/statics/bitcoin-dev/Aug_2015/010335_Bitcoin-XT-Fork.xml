    <summary>In a forum post on Bitcoin-dev in August 2015, Satoshi Nakamoto expressed the need for a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism. It is unclear whether he was referring to validating-only nodes or miners as there is already plenty of incentive for running a node via the coinbase. The issue lies in the current reward system being like a decentralized lottery with high entry cost. If the income could be smoothed out like in a mining pool without actually being a mining pool, more people may pay to enter the mining game. One suggestion was to make P2Pool the only pool allowed on the network.</summary>
