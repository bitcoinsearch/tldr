    <summary>In an email posted on August 17, 2015, Oliver Egginger expressed concerns about the authenticity of a message that was not PGP signed. However, the headers on the message were verified and the mail server in question was not an open relay, making it unlikely that the message was unauthentic. Egginger suggested focusing on the content of the message instead of speculating about its authenticity. The message requested that people eschew arguments from authority, which may have presented a challenge for the founder of the system to endorse without implicitly endorsing that approach through their own actions. Egginger encouraged people to respond to the content if they deemed it worth responding to and move on with their lives if not.</summary>
