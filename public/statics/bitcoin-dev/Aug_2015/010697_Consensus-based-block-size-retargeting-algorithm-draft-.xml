    <summary>A proposal was made to address the issues in Jeff Garzik's BIP 100 and Gavin Andresen's BIP 101. It starts with a 1 MB limit and throttles changes to Â±10% every 2016 blocks. It also imposes a tangible cost on miners who vote to raise the block-size limit and avoids incentivizing miners to vote to lower the block-size limit. However, it fails to answer a question regarding the mechanism for activation of the new consensus rule. Btc Drak submitted a pull request for this proposal which can be found on GitHub. In response to the proposal, Gavin Andresen questions how much it would cost a miner to include an extra 500-byte transaction if the average block size is 900K and it costs the miner 20BTC in electricity/capital/etc to mine a block. The calculation results in 0.11111 BTC or $2.50 at today's exchange rate, which seems excessive to Andresen.</summary>
