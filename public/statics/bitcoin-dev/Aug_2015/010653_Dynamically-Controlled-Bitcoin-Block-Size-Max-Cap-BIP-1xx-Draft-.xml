    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion, Simon Liu raised concerns about the feasibility of implementing a rule where one user can only have one vote. He asked how to prevent a user running multiple nodes. Chun Wang answered that the vote would not be counted by nodes but by bitcoin amount or coin-days, working like proof-of-stake. Peter Todd added to the discussion that to implement a vote where only users with access to a full node can vote, part of the vote would need to be determined by a non-miner-committed value calculatable by anyone with a full node. He gave an example of XORing a vote with SHA256(the entire blockchain).</summary>
