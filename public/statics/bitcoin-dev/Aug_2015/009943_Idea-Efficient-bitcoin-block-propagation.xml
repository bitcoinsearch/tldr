    <summary>The relay network transmission protocol is being investigated to understand how it works. The network aims to solve the issues of speed of transmission, block size, and block validation. The relay network includes an optimized transmission protocol that sends the entire block using only a couple of packets. No trust is required in this scheme, and the efficiency of the current scheme could be increased greatly with small improvements or if miners created blocks in an aware manner. With a maximum block size turning into 5kb with the current setup, there hardly appears to be a reason to do so right now. Ultimately, there is no need for information communicated with a block at discovery time proportional to the size of the block; with the right affordances, it can be accomplished with a small constant amount of data. The network was constructed and deployed to pull the network back from having a single pool with more than half the hashrate, as without it, the network would have already fallen into complete centralization as a response to larger blocks.</summary>
