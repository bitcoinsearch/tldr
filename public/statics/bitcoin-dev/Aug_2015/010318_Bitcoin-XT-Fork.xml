    <summary>In an email conversation between Oliver Egginger and Jorge Timón on August 17, 2015, Egginger requested that Satoshi Nakamoto's old email addresses be deleted from a list and blocked to avoid discussions about his authenticity. This request was made after the news of Craig Wright claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto had spread and was being discussed in various places. Timón questioned the need to block any email address and wondered if the content of the post mattered less than its author.</summary>
