    <summary>On August 17, 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev list regarding the possibility of Satoshi Nakamoto returning to be active in development. The list had restarted with an empty subscriber list on June 21, 2015. It was noted that whoever posted from satoshi at vistomail.com had recently subscribed and verified the address. Some members believed it was possible that the email could be genuine, while others argued that only the content was important. Oliver Egginger suggested blocking the creator's old email addresses as a solution to prevent such "abuses". However, he also raised the question of whether the community would even discuss the posting if the poster were not claiming to be Satoshi. He argued that Satoshi would have a decisive influence on the community, as what he says is perceived by all. If he were to say it's okay to do nothing as long as we stand together, people may have the courage to do something dangerous or even something wrong. In this sense, some type of dictatorship can make one free. In summary, the discussion revolved around the possibility of Satoshi Nakamoto returning to be active in development and the potential impact of his influence on the community. Some members believed that his return could be beneficial, while others were skeptical or concerned about the consequences.</summary>
