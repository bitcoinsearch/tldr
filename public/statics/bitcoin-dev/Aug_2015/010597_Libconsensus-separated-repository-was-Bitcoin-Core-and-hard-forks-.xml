    <summary>The email conversation between Jorge Tim贸n and Tamas Blummer discusses the risks that arise with every re-implementation, refactoring, or copy-pasting, as well as the opportunity to improve software engineering. However, Tim贸n argues that high-quality implementation is difficult to maintain over generations of developers and that enterprises are more concerned about functionality than quality for distributed ledgers. To achieve mainstream adoption, it is essential to get enterprises on board by developing code that is not only of a high standard but also easy to maintain with a development team with high attrition. Bits of Proof's implementation of scripts was not practically relevant in Tim贸n's commercially successful deployments due to the use of a border router, but it helped development, allowing easier debugging and precise error feedback even after Bitcoin Core had a reject message. Tim贸n integrated libconsensus only to speed up application-side tx verification, which turned out to be insignificant until secp265k1 is integrated. In enterprise development, it would be more helpful to have a slim protocol server, no wallet, no rpc, no qt, but a high-performance remoting API.</summary>
