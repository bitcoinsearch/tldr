    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 70 currently only lists two networks, main and test. This creates difficulty in supporting different testnets and alternative coins as the protocol lacks context to indicate which coin the request applies to. To address this problem, Ross proposes adding a new optional "genesis" field containing the SHA-256 hash of the genesis block of the network the request belongs to, which will uniquely identify chains without a central registry requirement. For backward compatibility, the "network" field would contain "main" for Bitcoin main net, "test" for Bitcoin testnet3, and "other" for other networks apart from those two. Ross seeks initial feedback on his proposal and plans to raise it as a BIP if there are no major objections.</summary>
