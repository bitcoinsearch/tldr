    <summary>The admin of the main communication channels for Bitcoin users have stated that they will censor any program that does not follow 51%+ hash power. This attempt to control the conversation is not democratic or libertarian in nature. These actions have been apparent in the Bitcoin ecosystem for a long time and anyone who raises these issues is immediately labeled as a "troll." A small group of irrational and inexperienced people outside of the Bitcoin ecosystem have control over the majority of resources, which is currently an obstacle in moving Bitcoin forward. Despite this, the problem may even itself out over time.</summary>
