    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Adam Back expressed concerns about the experience of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes after the activation of Bitcoin XT. He was worried that if full nodes were split 50:50 between XT and Bitcoin Core, SPV clients would be randomly connecting to either side of the fork, resulting in a chaotic experience. However, Peter Todd responded by pointing out that there are no known SPV implementations that do address caching and they all rely on peer servers in a centralized fashion. This means that if those peer servers are set up to only return nodes on one side of the fork, SPV clients will only connect to that side and never see the other chain.</summary>
