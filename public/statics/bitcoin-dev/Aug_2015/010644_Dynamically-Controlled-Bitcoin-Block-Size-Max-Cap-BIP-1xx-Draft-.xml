    <title>Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap [BIP 1xx - Draft]</title>

    <summary>In August 2015, a proposal was made by John Dillon to give the economic majority of coin holders a vote for the maximum block size, which was discussed on the Bitcoin development mailing list. The proposal suggested that miners could still vote for the maximum block size they were willing to use, limited by the vote of the economic majority. However, concerns were raised about the accuracy and feasibility of this approach as it would require technical knowledge to make informed votes. It was also pointed out that only a fraction of coin holders are likely to vote, and even then, most may not respond to the poll at all. Therefore, it was argued that ordinary users would not be able to vote meaningfully, similar to polling Toyota truck owners on whether the 2017 Tacoma should increase its engine's cylinder displacement by 10%.</summary>
