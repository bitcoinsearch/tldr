    <summary>Bitcoin XT 0.11A, which includes the bigger blocks patch set, has been released and is available for download from https://bitcoinxt.software/. The release comes after the Bitcoin Core project drifted away from principles important to many developers. A blog post and manifesto on the website by the developer behind Bitcoin XT aim to explain why this is happening and how Bitcoin XT plans to be different from Core. Developers who feel that Core no longer serves the interests of Bitcoin users are encouraged to join the Bitcoin XT community.</summary>
