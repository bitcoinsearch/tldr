    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has discussed the proposal to increase the block size limit while also considering the reward halving that is likely to happen in the third quarter of 2016. The original proposed date for the fork was December 2015, but it was pushed back to January, and then to a two-month window during July and August. The proposal suggests that a block size hardfork will happen on June 1, 2016, with a backup plan to be adopted if no other consensus can be reached before February 1, 2016. The backup plan is to increase the block size to 1.5MB, 30 days after 80% of miner approval, but not before June 1, 2016. If the backup plan is adopted, they agree to find a better solution before December 31, 2017.</summary>
