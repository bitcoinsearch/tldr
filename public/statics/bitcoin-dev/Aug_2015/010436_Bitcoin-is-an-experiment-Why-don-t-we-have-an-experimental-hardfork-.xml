    <summary>The message thread discusses the adoption of BitcoinXT by miners. It is noted that Chinese miners who control 60% of the network have already stated they would not adopt XT, so they cannot lead the revolution. The post then suggests that exchanges could encourage miners to switch to Bitcoin-XT by creating a taint system in which all non-XT coinbase outputs are marked as tainted and require a surcharge to be untainted. The participating exchanges agree not to exchange tainted coins, making them inherently less valuable. This scheme allows non-miners to flex their muscles, even if it seems unsavory. However, implementing taint machinery is a bad thing for fungibility. Another suggestion is checkpointing: creating one big block and agreeing to checkpoint it. A less strict rule is that blocks after the first big block count as double POW, meaning the big block chain only needs 34% of the hashing power to win.</summary>
