    <summary>In August 2015, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the maximum block size consensus rule and its effects on mining centralization. Milly Bitcoin had suggested that the rule limits mining centralization, while another member of the community urged him to work on a decentralization metric instead of making bald claims. Milly Bitcoin responded by stating that he was not inventing this idea and referred to Gavin Andresen's earlier analysis in which he concluded that bigger blocks were better for bigger miners. However, Gavin later denied the relation between the consensus maximum size and mining centralization, which Milly found surprising given his previous analysis. Nonetheless, Milly stated that he would change his mind about not touching the maximum blocksize consensus rule as soon as he saw data that convinced him that the proposed sizes were not very risky.</summary>
