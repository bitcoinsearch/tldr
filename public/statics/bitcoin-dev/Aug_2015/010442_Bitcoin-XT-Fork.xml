    <summary>Olivier Janssens has claimed that a Blockstream employee is trying to remove Gavin from his position. This claim was made in a Reddit post and pastebin. Olivier's post also mentions how Gavin and Mike have been quiet on the bitcoin-dev list, while there has been a stream of media articles, blog posts, podcasts, and ongoing backroom lobbying of companies to run bitcoin-XT. There is also no neutral or balanced information package being offered for these companies to make an informed decision. The workshops are trying to provide that balance. Olivier asks Gavin and Mike if they have anything to say about this matter.</summary>
