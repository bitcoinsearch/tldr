    <summary>On August 11, 2015, Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev wrote that if people are still doing transactions despite being unreliable, there must be a use for them. One usage of the form unreliable is when people start getting their transactions thrown out due to full blocks or full memory pools. However, the more significant issue is when software becomes unreliable at such loads. Bitcoin core will continue to grow in memory consumption and eventually crash, or even worse, crash the system it's running on. There are known issues with the software regarding running at over 100% capacity, and more problems will likely be found when this actually happens.IT experts avoid maxing out a system like the plague. This scenario is where centralization ends up happening when blocks are always full, and people need to upgrade their client every week to keep up with the bug fixes.</summary>
