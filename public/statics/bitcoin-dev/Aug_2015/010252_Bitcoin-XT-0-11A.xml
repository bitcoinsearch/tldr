    <title>Bitcoin XT 0.11A</title>

    <summary>The post talks about the potential risks of the proposed Bitcoin XT fork. Currently, none of the mined blocks have voted for XT, but if it gains support and reaches 50%, Core could start boycotting XT or appropriate its version string. This could lead to a node war and make it risky to transact, causing balances in new addresses to vanish. Disagreement between the network and the biggest economic actors, such as exchanges and wallet services, would cause BTC to plummet, eroding confidence. The author considers the takeover attempt foul and suggests a fair play alternative of voting through coinbase scriptSig or dynamic adjustment proposed by BIP 100. Once a majority is obtained, devs must react or face justified foul play.</summary>
