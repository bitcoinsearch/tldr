    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Mike Hearn agreed with Justus Ranvier's view that most Bitcoin users don't actually care about decentralization. However, Hearn's comment was more of a sarcastic remark in response to Ranvier's statement that no Bitcoin user could define the term. The context then shifts to a scathing critique of Bitcoin, calling it "terribly slow" and "very difficult" for users. It goes on to state that the currency is the "least private payment system ever conceived" while still being used by terrorists and pedophiles. The mining process alone uses over half a gigawatt of power, causing significant environmental damage. The author then argues that if decentralization is not a realistic goal, then Bitcoin should be replaced by a couple of geographically distributed SQL servers. They contend that without decentralization, Bitcoin is an "abomination that is best dismantled."</summary>
