    <summary>The email thread is regarding the implementation of BIP 100, a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Protocol for block size voting. The author mentions that they are currently working on the technical draft and implementation for ScalingBitcoin.org but only the PDF is publicly available as of now. In response to Andrew C's question about whether any client or code currently implements BIP 100 and how it will be deployed, the author confirms that the initial deployment will be in the same manner as size votes. The email ends with the usual mailing list details.</summary>
