    <title>Variable Block Size Proposal</title>

    <summary>The email discussion thread proposes a variable block size that aims to provide sustainable, long-term growth while balancing block propagation and spam attacks. The proposal suggests recalculating the block size parameters every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks) and using the calculated "average" size as the maximum block size for the next 2016 blocks, which is then doubled (200%). However, if the new maximum size is below 1MB, 1MB is used instead. To ensure miners are still confirming Bitcoin transactions, a block minimum of 25% of the current maximum will be introduced.The proposal's objective is to adjust the network to handle spikes in volume and readjust once they dissipate. However, Jameson Lopp warns against introducing a mandatory minimum block size, as it may not find support among miners. Instead, he recommends focusing on O(1) block propagation, where the Bitcoin Relay Network allows miners to relay blocks much faster. Gavin's proposal for O(1) block propagation into the Bitcoin protocol is also worth considering.The context provided appears to be an email signature, including a line break and the word "SIGNATURE" written in all-caps, possibly indicating the end of the email message. There is also a separator line consisting of dashes. While the signature may include an HTML attachment, no further details about its contents or purpose are given.</summary>
