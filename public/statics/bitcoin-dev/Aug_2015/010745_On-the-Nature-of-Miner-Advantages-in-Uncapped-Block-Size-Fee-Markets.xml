    <summary>The email thread is a discussion between Peter R and Matt Corallo regarding the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on orphan risk and miner advantages. The context involves analyzing how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in an uncapped block size scenario. Peterâ€™s paper holds unless the information about the included transactions is identically zero. There is a per-packet cost when transmitting across long-haul links, which is around 1400+ bytes before the increase in information relay cost is noticed. Several miners have nodes well distributed globally that pre-relay everything they are going to include, so at most, they might have to pick between a few pre-relayed blocks. The healthy fee market result follows from the Shannon-Hartley theorem, describing the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a physical communication channel. Even if the block solutions announcements contain no information about the transactions included in the blocks, the fee market would not be healthy in such a scenario, and it requires miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks according to their volition. Daniele Pinna submitted a paper analyzing mining advantages as a function of miner hashrate, showing how large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to the steady increasing marginal profits as hashrates grow. Finally, he shows that part of the large advantage the large miners have today is due to there being a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency mining class, leading to a marginal profit structure that decreases as a function of hashrate.</summary>
