    <summary>The discussion in the email thread on bitcoin-dev is about the maximum block size consensus rule and its effect on mining centralization. Milly Bitcoin suggested working on a decentralization metric instead of making bald claims. Tom Harding mentioned that he ran a simulation tool to test for hashrate centralization effects only and found that small miners were not at all disadvantaged by large blocks. However, Peter Todd pointed out that the simulation did not consider the scenario they are worried about, and the experiment was obviously misguided.</summary>
