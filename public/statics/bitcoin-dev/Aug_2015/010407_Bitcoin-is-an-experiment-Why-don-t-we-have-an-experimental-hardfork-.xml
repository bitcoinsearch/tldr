    <summary>This message addresses the ongoing controversy surrounding Bitcoin XT, noting that it poses risks as a non-peer reviewed alt with a number of problematic features. The development process has not followed any semblance of process in terms of the development funnel or BIPS process, instead choosing to hard fork bitcoin while being well aware of miner voting on viable solutions which have followed process. The writer suggests that there is no basis for further promoting XT by suggesting that it should even be tested. Regardless, miners are currently voting on proposals such as BIP 100 / BIP 101, and contentious hard forks are bad for Bitcoin. The message also points readers towards https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/hard-fork-policy for more information on this topic.</summary>
