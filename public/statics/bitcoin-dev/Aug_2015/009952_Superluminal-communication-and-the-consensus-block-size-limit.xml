    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, it was noted that Miner A is capable of processing 100 M tx/block while Miner B can only process 10 M tx/block. To close this gap, one suggestion was for Miner B to sell ASICs and buy 90 M tx worth of CPU. Another option would be to cap block size at 10 M tx, which would require Miner A to sell an equivalent amount of CPU and buy ASICs. Despite these solutions, Miner A would still have an advantage due to having more money than Miner B. The issue of centralization in mining, therefore, has less to do with block size and more to do with financial resources. Additional assumptions were suggested as a possible solution.</summary>
