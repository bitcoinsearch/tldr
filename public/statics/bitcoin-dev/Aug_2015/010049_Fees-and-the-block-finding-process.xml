    <summary>In August 2015, Alex Morcos wrote to the bitcoin-dev list that there are a lot of technical problems introduced by insufficient block space and they should be addressed now. Thomas Zander agreed with the idea of solving space restriction issues, but he believed that having several more years to make such solutions would be healthier. He argued that no proper solutions would be deployed in time for natural growth of usage to reach always 1MB full blocks. Additionally, Zander stated that many people had tried but failed to find a relation between max-blocksize and full node-count, and there were already pretty good solutions like a bootstrap torrent and the headers first. Zander also believed that these problems have been solved in large part already, and more is underway. He did not expect them to be showstoppers when the network finally allows bigger than 1MB blocks. Furthermore, Zander said that natural growth has shown that blocks won't jump in size significantly in one month anyway and this scenario still has six months or so.</summary>
