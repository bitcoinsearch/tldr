    <summary>In a discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell raised the question of whether it would be possible to represent one block with more than one increment. This could allow for additional space for future signaling or higher resolution numbers for a sharechain commitment. Jorge Tim√≥n responded that he had not considered this possibility before, but had explained the concept to Pieter using "for example, 10 instead of 1". Pieter suggested having 600 increments to make it more similar to timestamps. Another participant in the thread suggested that using a power of 2 would be more efficient and recommended figuring out the maximum relative block time needed before deciding how many bits were left over.</summary>
