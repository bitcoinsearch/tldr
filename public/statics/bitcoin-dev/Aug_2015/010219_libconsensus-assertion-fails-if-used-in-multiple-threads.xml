    <summary>The integration of libconsensus into bits of proof has been successful and works well in-line with the Java engine. The single-threaded performance is about 50% faster. However, when executed on multiple threads simultaneously, an error occurs due to the lack of registration of thread callbacks as advised for OpenSSL. The error is caused by inaccessible OpenSSL functions not exported from the lib. A workaround is sought and any pointers would be appreciated by Tamas Blummer.</summary>
