    <summary>In this email conversation from August 8, 2015 on the bitcoin-dev list, Dave Scotese argues that a backlog of unconfirmed transactions is not a problem as it only affects those who don't wait for even one confirmation. However, the mention he refers to was about the fact that continuously growing mempool is a real issue for Bitcoin software and could result in many people turning off their Bitcoind if it starts eating up more memory. Scotese claims that backlogs in the past have already started training users to wait for at least one confirmation or go off-chain. However, Thomas Zander questions this claim, stating that the only time full blocks were seen for a considerable amount of time was due to a spammer and we only taught wallet developers to use higher fees. Full blocks will eventually stop being a supported use case when people try to buy a coffee or beer, and waiting for a confirmation won't work for most current Bitcoin usages. Finally, Scotese suggests that those who rely on zero-conf transactions can be left in a bit of trouble, but Zander disagrees, stating that double-spending requires a lot of work and non-standard software, while replace-by-fee is not supported in the vast majority of Bitcoin land.</summary>
