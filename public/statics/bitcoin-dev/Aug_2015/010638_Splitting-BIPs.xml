    <summary>In an email sent by Eric Lombrozo, he suggests that the current "type" attribute needs to be modified and proposes adding an extra attribute to BIPs indicating their "level". The proposed levels are Consensus (hard/soft fork), Peer Services, RPC, Implementations, and Applications. Lombrozo argues that there are different degrees of "standard" and just because a lot of people do something does not mean that it is "officially" endorsed by other developers. He believes that disagreements might be tolerable for many things at most levels below 1. Lombrozo posted an example of what such a table might look like on blockhawk.net/bitcoin-dev/bipwiki.html and if others also think this is a good idea, he will start working on a BIP draft for this.</summary>
