    <summary>In an email conversation between Tom Harding and Peter Todd on the bitcoin-dev forum, the topic of discussion was Pieter's simulation. Peter had checked a scenario where only the radio is on in a car and found that it does not crash. He then asked Tom what he thinks would be an acceptable revenue difference between a small (1% hashing power) and large (30% hashing power) miner, along with what kinds of attacks on miners need to be resisted.Tom responded that none of this is within the scope of Pieter's simulation and if Peter thinks that casts doubt on his conclusions, it also casts doubt on Pieter's original conclusions. As far as Tom knows, Pieter's conclusions were that there was an effect but he suspended judgment on whether that effect was high enough to be important for a given size or not.</summary>
