    <summary>The main problem of the fork CoreXT is the possibility of double spending, which occurs when a user spends their coins and it is written in an 8 MB block that the Core does not accept. In response to this issue, Bdimych Bdimych proposed setting a minimum block size, suggesting that the free space could be filled with zeroes and compressed. However, a minimum block size may not prevent the problems caused by schism hardforks. It can also be easily cheated by miners paying themselves to follow the minimum size block rule without risking anything, as long as they have a single matured satoshi. It is recommended to search for previous posts before proposing or asking something.</summary>
