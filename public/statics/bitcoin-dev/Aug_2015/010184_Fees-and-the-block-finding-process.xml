    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Thomas Zander and Pieter Wuille debated the issue of unreliable transactions. While Wuille argued that if people continue to use transactions despite their unreliability, there must be a use for them, Zander emphasized that the real problem lies in software unreliability at high loads. Bitcoin core is expected to continue growing in memory consumption, which could cause it to crash or even crash the system it is running on. Zander warned that this issue needs to be solved regardless of block size and shared a link to a GitHub pull request aimed at addressing the problem.</summary>
