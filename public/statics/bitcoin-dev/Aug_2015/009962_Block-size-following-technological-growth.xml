    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille raised concerns regarding the possibility of a sudden influx of users or settlement systems who want to pay high fees and make the blockchain inaccessible for low-fee transactions. Gavin Andresen answered this question by providing tested C++ code that increases capacity only on a precise schedule for 20 years and then stops increasing. The code aims to address concerns about scalability while ensuring that the blockchain remains accessible and reliable for all types of transactions. This approach is designed to prevent sudden surges in block size from causing issues with the blockchain's performance.</summary>
