    <summary>The email is from an outside non-Bitcoin developer who wants to establish peaceful cooperation between the non-XT and XT community by reading BIP101, which proposes a fixed function for block size growth. The author requests plots of the measurements of the natural data and the model function to determine whether BIP101 is adequate as the central question is whether the natural source data has revealed its saturation curve to guess its defining constants. If it hasn't, it is questionable whether BIP101 is adequate. The author elaborates on mathematical problems due to the absence of plots in the BIP101 document. Finally, the author requests the XT community to provide plots or at least data and to be open to scientifically admitting that BIP101 might be insufficient if the plots show open questions.</summary>
