    <summary>In a Bitcoin email thread, Mark Friedenbach suggests modifying IsSuperMajority to take an optional mask field. Bits set in that mask are zero'd for the purpose of the IsSuperMajority calculation. For this vote, bits 0x20000007 are masked. To signal support for CLTV/CSV/etc., one must set bit 4. On Core this would mean a minimum version of 0x8, on XT/not-XT a minimum version of 0x20000008. However, the vote is still over whether to enforce BIP 65, 68, etc. for blocks with nVersion&gt;=4. The main objective of the proposal is to allow forks to fail to be adopted cleanly. If forks ever fail to get adoption, something the nVersion bits proposal handles cleanly, it creates hard-fork scenarios with respect to older software.</summary>
