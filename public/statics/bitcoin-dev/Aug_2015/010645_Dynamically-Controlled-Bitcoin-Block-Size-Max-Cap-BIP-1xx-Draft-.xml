    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd proposed an approach to give the economic majority of coin holders a vote for the max blocksize. However, in response, Matt Whitlock raised concerns about what fraction of coin holders would vote and how many of them have the technical knowledge to make an informed vote. Todd suggested that the % of voters required could adapt dynamically to voter interest. He also pointed out that car buyers make similar decisions through various market mechanisms. Todd proposed a voting mechanism that allows only users with access to validating nodes to vote, which is a fundamental requirement for users to fully participate in Bitcoin's governance.</summary>
