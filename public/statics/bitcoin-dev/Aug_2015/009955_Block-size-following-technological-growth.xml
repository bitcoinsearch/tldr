    <summary>In an email exchange from 2015, Pieter Wuille and Gavin Andresen discussed the idea of competition for block space in regards to Bitcoin. While Wuille believed that evolving towards this ecosystem was a positive thing, Andresen clarified that he too agreed competition for block space was good, but what was bad was artificially limiting or centrally controlling the supply of that space. This conversation highlights the importance of maintaining a decentralized system in which users have control over their transactions.</summary>
