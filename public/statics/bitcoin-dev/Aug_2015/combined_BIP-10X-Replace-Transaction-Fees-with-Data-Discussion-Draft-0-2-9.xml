    <summary>Ahmed Zsales and Adam Back have exchanged emails discussing privacy concerns in Bitcoin transactions. Ahmed emphasizes that anonymity is not something they would compromise, and they have no desire to create tools that analyze specific details of individual transactions, but rather aggregate data that can be useful for businesses. Ahmed provides examples where aggregated data from Bitcoin transactions could help small businesses access global, national and regional industry data figures. He also suggests using the blockchain ledger to fund Bitcoin's security infrastructure and growing bandwidth challenges. However, Adam expresses confusion about the proposed monetization model, which he believes conflicts with fungibility and planned Bitcoin improvements. Ahmed welcomes feedback on the proposal and indicates that technical content will increase in due course and discussion content will be removed.Moreover, Ahmed has proposed a long-term solution to replace mining rewards and transaction fees through BIP 104, which is currently a discussion draft. The working draft has been updated with specific clarifications on replacing the Coinbase subsidy and supplementing transaction fees. The long term idealized requirements are that the transaction itself would have cryptographic fungibility, and policy relating to identity for authorization would take place at the payment protocol layer. The payment protocol is already seeing some use. The Lightning protocol sees more of the data going point to point and so not broadcast nor visible for big data analytic monetization. However, there are concerns that the proposal may conflict with fungibility to the point of conflicting with many planned Bitcoin improvements and mid-term technical directions. References to creating global, national and regional Bitcoin Price Indices have also been added, and preferences for deployment dates of January 2017 or January 2018 have been mentioned.</summary>
