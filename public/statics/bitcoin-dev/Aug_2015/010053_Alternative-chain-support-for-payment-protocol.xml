    <summary>The proposal put forth by Ross Nicoll via bitcoin-dev is to add a new optional field named "genesis" in BIP 70, which currently lists two networks. The "genesis" field would contain a 16-byte sequence with the SHA-256 hash of the genesis block of the network to which the payment request belongs. This will enable unique identification of chains without any central registry. For backward compatibility, the "network" field would contain "main" for Bitcoin main net, "test" for Bitcoin testnet3, and "other" for other networks apart from the two. This addition will allow easy support for multiple testnets and usage of the protocol for alternative coins while avoiding dangerous situations where coins share address prefixes. The proposal received initial feedback and if there are no major objections, it will be raised as a BIP.</summary>
