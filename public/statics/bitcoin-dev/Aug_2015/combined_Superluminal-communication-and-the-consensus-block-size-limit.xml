    <summary>The issue of mining centralization in Bitcoin has been a topic of discussion among experts for years. In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón in August 2015, they discussed whether miner A who can process 100 million transactions per block, will be able to maintain its competitiveness against miner B, which is only capable of processing 10 million transactions per block. Andresen argued that it depends on all the variables that go into the mining profitability equation, including access to cheaper electricity, advanced mining hardware, inexpensive labor, and capital to finance investment in hardware.Andresen also brought up the possibility of using excess heat generated from mining productively as a way to change the mining centralization dynamics. He believed that if production of mining devices whose primary purpose is not mining but rather heating becomes a reality, then everybody should carefully reconsider all their assumptions about mining centralization. The number of fee-paying transactions a miner can profitably include in their blocks will also eventually be part of that equation, and it is insignificant today. However, they want miners to include lots of transactions in their blocks.In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, it was noted that Miner A is capable of processing 100 M tx/block while Miner B can only process 10 M tx/block. To close this gap, one suggestion was for Miner B to sell ASICs and buy 90 M tx worth of CPU. Another option would be to cap block size at 10 M tx, which would require Miner A to sell an equivalent amount of CPU and buy ASICs. Despite these solutions, Miner A would still have an advantage due to having more money than Miner B. The issue of centralization in mining, therefore, has less to do with block size and more to do with financial resources. Additional assumptions were suggested as a possible solution.The belief that block propagation times are the only metric to consider for evaluating the usefulness of the block size maximum consensus rule in limiting mining centralization is challenged by a thought experiment. The scenario envisions the invention of superluminal communication and free, infinite bandwidth for everyone, negating the need for block propagation times. However, even under these ideal conditions, the consensus block size maximum still serves a purpose in limiting mining centralization.Assuming miners no longer mine transactions with fees lower than 1 satoshi, there will still be physical limitations that benefit large mining players. For example, if miner A can process 100 M tx/block while miner B can only handle 10 M tx/block, removing the consensus maximum block size would favor miner A. This is because miner A's block reward would be greater than miner B's, ultimately leading to miner B going bankrupt or stopping mining. Therefore, the block size maximum will always be useful in limiting mining centralization, as there will always be some physical limitation that benefits larger mining players.</summary>
