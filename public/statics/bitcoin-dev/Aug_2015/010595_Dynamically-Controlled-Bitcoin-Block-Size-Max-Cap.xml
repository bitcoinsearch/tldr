    <summary>On August 21, 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n questioned a statement regarding revenue and suggested that the question should have been about profits instead. However, the original author responded by explaining that revenue would be less subjective and more focused on the underlying orphan rate question. The author also mentioned that part of the answer might include an assumed profit margin. The conversation was signed with a PGP signature.</summary>
