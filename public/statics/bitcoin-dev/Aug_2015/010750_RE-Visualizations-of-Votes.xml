    <summary>In this email thread, members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list discuss voting patterns in support of various proposed changes to the bitcoin block size limit. Christian Decker shares a link to a simple tracking page for "block votes," which currently includes the 8MB vote and XT, as well as the /BV\d+/ vote for generic size. He mentions that some pools vote to support BIP100 without specifying a desired block size, so he is tracking both dimensions on the same chart. Jeff Garzik points out a duplicated column and notes that BIP100 voting is /BV\d+/. Nicolas Dorier asks if there is a way to visually represent formal votes in a pie chart, but says there is no standard way for miners to informally vote for the BIP they support. The group discusses different ways to visualize the voting data, including pie graphs of what percentage of miners are voting for each proposal based on what is published in blocks. They also mention a site by Kacper Cie≈õla called Bitcoinity, which displays a chart of block size votes over time. The discussion ends with links to various resources and information about upcoming meetings.</summary>
