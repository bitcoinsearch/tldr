    <summary>The deployment of the proposed CLTV, CSV, etc. soft-forks has been complicated due to the existence of the XT and Not-Bitcoin-XT miners. Both mine blocks with nVersion=0x20000007, which would falsely trigger the previously suggested implementation using the IsSuperMajority() mechanism and nVersion=4 blocks. A key component of the fork deadlines is not implemented in both XT and Not-Bitcoin-XT mining software. In option 2, the nVersion bits set by XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT miners would be masked away, prior to applying standard IsSuperMajority() logic. This means that CLTV/CSV/etc. miners running Bitcoin Core would create blocks with nVersion=8, 0b1000. The most complex option would be to deploy via full nVersion bits implementation using flag bit #4 to trigger the fork.</summary>
