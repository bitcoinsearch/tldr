    <summary>In a conversation between Pieter Wuille and Gavin Andresen on August 7, 2015, Andresen expressed his belief that people in the Bitcoin ecosystem should be free to make different tradeoffs. Wuille agreed but added that the blockchain itself cannot offer many tradeoffs and trying to scale it could harm the whole system. He suggested that the place to introduce tradeoffs is in layers on top of the blockchain, where systems with various levels of trust can be built without harming others. However, Thomas Zander accused Wuille of misunderstanding or misquoting Andresen's point about trusting one's own node or using a centralized system. Zander criticized Wuille for pushing his own position and urged him to be more concise and on-topic.</summary>
