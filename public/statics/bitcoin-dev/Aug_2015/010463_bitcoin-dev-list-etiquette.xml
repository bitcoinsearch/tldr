    <summary>The core developers of Bitcoin have been urged to keep technical discussions related to the development of the cryptocurrency, as opposed to "philosophical" ones. The appeal follows months of debate about a hard fork with respect to block size.

The message urges individuals to consider the relevance of their email before sending it, and how many times they send emails on the same topic. It also suggests that any philosophical debates should be taken elsewhere, out of respect for the time of hundreds of developers who receive every email.</summary>
