    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list post, Tamas Blummer expressed his opinion on the libconsensus. He stated that he didn't believe that a libconsensus would have any networking layer and ideally, it would have a simple API to give it blocks and inform you of what the current chain is. He also mentioned that he didn't want to carry on the legacy of an antique tool set and a spaghetti style for creating and serving other block chains with different rules. Tamas Blummer believes that every re-implementation introduces a risk of disagreement, but it also opens up the chance of doing the work better in terms of software engineering. In addition, Tamas Blummer acknowledged that compatibility with Bitcoin is important, as he wants to deal with Bitcoins. He further stated that Bits of Proof uses scala (akka networking), java (api service), c++ (leveledb and now libconsensus) and he is eager to integrate secp256k1 (c) as soon as part of consensus. Each piece has been chosen because it appears best in what they do.</summary>
