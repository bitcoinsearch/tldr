    <summary>In an email conversation dated August 20, 2015, Peter Todd criticized Tom Harding's experiment that showed small miners were not affected by large blocks. Todd argued that the experiment was flawed because it did not consider the scenario where a miner needs to get their blocks to at least 33% of hashing power. Harding had used a 20% threshold in his experiment which is below this threshold. Additionally, Todd questioned why Harding assumed the small miner group was well connected to each other. In response, Harding explained that he had given the small miners collectively the same hashrate as the large miners in the original test and made them well-connected because everyone was well-connected intra-partition in the original test. He also defended his experiment design principle of varying only one thing. Lastly, Todd challenged Harding to prove that second-order and cross-term effects dominate.</summary>
