    <summary>Tom Harding, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, posted a message regarding an idea for preserving existing semantics in a Bitcoin transaction. However, another member replied stating they couldn't follow the logic and requested clarification. The semantics being referred to is that the earliest version of a transaction starts with the lowest sequence number and counts up. The inversion accomplishes this for CSV, meaning that the first version begins with a smaller number which increases with successful versions, and the highest possible number is final, resulting in no delay. Additionally, there was a discussion about representing one block with more than one increment, which could allow for future signaling or higher resolution numbers for a sharechain commitment.</summary>
