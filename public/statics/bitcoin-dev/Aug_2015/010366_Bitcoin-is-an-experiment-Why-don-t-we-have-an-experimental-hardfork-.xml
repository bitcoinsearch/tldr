    <summary>The author of a bitcoin-dev email is proposing an experimental hard fork to demonstrate the possibility of reaching consensus for future Bitcoin hard forks. The proposal includes a slight increase in block size to collect data for future hard forks and to relieve the pressure of full blocks without adverse effects on network performance. The objectives are intended to not be a kick-the-can-down-the-road solution, with the third objective being more like a side effect of the experiment. The proposal includes a backup plan to adopt if no other consensus can be reached before February 1, 2016, which involves increasing the block size to 1.5MB 30 days after 80% of miners approve, but not before June 1, 2016. If the backup plan is adopted, a better solution should be found before December 31, 2017. The proposal is open for community agreement and if agreed upon, coding of the patch will begin immediately.</summary>
