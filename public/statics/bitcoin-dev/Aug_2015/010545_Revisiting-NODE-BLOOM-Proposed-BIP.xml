    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email chain, Peter Todd notes that Bloom filter usage has decreased significantly as lite-SPV clients move towards using centralized servers run by wallet authors such as Mycelium, GreenBits, AirBitz, and Electrum. However, these wallets have not gained many new users during the past year, with the exception of Electrum. Specifically, Mycelium lost users during the last stress test when their centralized infrastructure was overloaded. In response, the developer announced on Reddit that they plan to move the wallet to SPV.</summary>
