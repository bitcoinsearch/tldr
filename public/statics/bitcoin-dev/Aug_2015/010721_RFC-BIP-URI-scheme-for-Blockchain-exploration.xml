    <summary>The blockchain development community has discussed a standard for looking up blocks, transactions and addresses on blockchain explorers. The current system sees Bitcoin clients pointing to arbitrary blockchain explorers when users want more details about a transaction, however, the new proposal aims to enable users to handle these requests with their preferred tool. Proposed by Marco Pontello, the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) suggests a simple URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme for the process. Blockchain: is the proposed prefix to be added to the start of each URI allowing blockchain explorers to apply disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search box. This will allow wallet developers (or other tools that need to show any kind of blockchain references) to simply make it a blockchain link without worrying about specific blockchain explorer or providing means for the user to select one.</summary>
