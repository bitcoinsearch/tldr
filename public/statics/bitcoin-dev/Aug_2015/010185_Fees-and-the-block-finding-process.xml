    <summary>In an email exchange on August 12, 2015, Jorge Timón expressed his belief that it was a bad idea to write in a way that required people to prove that bad things would happen if a certain change wasn't made. He argued that this polarizes the discussion and puts people into camps. Thomas Zander responded by asking for respect and stating that if Timón had the courage to accuse people of spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), he should have exhausted all possible avenues of cooperation first. Zander also pointed out that he had been trying hard to give straight answers and was saddened if Timón was giving up trying to understand his point of view. Zander argued that Bitcoin needed bigger blocks over the next couple of years for various reasons, including the fact that Lightning Network was not yet available and that known bugs needed fixing. To buy more time, he recommended getting bigger blocks now. However, he disliked Timón's approach and believed that it was important to keep the discussion civilized. He criticized Timón's analogy of "if you are not beating your wife, please prove it to me" as being too black and white and impossible to prove either way.</summary>
