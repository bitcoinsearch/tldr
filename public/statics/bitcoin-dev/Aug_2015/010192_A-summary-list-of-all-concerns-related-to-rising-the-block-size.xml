    <summary>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim√≥n raised concerns about "develop-by-concerns" and whether it was similar to fire fighting management. Thomas Zander replied that the question made sure the proper answers didn't fit, adding that Bitcoin is a growing network with a growing amount of transactions and that they will get into problems when the block consistently gets full. He argued that both Lightning Network (LN) and bigger blocks are needed to cope with this growth, especially for use cases such as remittances and cross-border purchases. He also provided links to other discussions and explanations about the need for a blocksize increase.</summary>
