    <summary>On September 1, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. via bitcoin-dev proposed the idea of disabling the ability to subscribe with digests on the bitcoin-dev list. He argued that digests were from an earlier era of Internet history and were inconvenient for everyone because replies have the problem of breaking threads. Instead, people should be setting mail filters to separate list mail from other mail. He believed that digests were not a net-positive for the community, and thus, the ability to use them should be turned off. Although some may find this decision annoying, it was deemed necessary for the benefit of the majority.</summary>
