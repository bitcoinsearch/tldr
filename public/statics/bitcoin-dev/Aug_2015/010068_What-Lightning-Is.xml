    <summary>The email thread is a conversation between Hector Chu, Patrick Strateman, Tom Harding, and Mark Friedenbach. Chu expresses concerns about the exploding cost of the network as it becomes more interconnected, to which Strateman responds with an explanation of how payment hubs operate. Strateman notes that payment hubs essentially swap funds between payment channels and require payment channels with other users/hubs. If the hub requires user funds to open these channels, then they have no reason to pay the hub anything in fees. Harding adds that although nothing requires the hub to advance anything, if it does, Bob can expect to pay for it. He predicts that hubs will assess fees for depositing funds, depending on the amount deposited and the amount of time the funds stay there. He concludes by asking readers to guess the name for these types of fees.</summary>
