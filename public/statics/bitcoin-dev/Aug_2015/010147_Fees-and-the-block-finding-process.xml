    <summary>Many people want to participate in a global consensus network where all participating nodes are aware of and agree upon every transaction. Constraining Bitcoin capacity below the limits of technology will only force users seeking to participate in a global consensus network to other solutions which have adequate capacity, such as BitcoinXT or others. Lightning/hub and spoke cannot meet the requirements for users wishing to participate in global consensus since all participating nodes are not aware of all transactions. The absence of response to questions is interpreted as a sign that there's no other reason to increase the consensus block size other than to avoid minimum market fees from rising above zero. There is frustration among those who do not see what else can be feared from not increasing the size apart from fees maybe rising and making some problems that need to be solved rewardless of the size more visible. This discussion has been explained several times, but clarity is needed. Only fear, uncertainty, and doubt are enemies of clarity.</summary>
