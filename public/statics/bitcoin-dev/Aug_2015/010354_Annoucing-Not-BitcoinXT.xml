    <summary>In an email exchange from August 17, 2015, GC questioned Dave's characterization of highly skilled psychological warfare agents as paranoia. Dave responded by pointing out that there are resources available, such as the #1 podcast in higher education on podomatic.com, GnosticMedia, SchoolSucksProject, and Corbett Report, that raise awareness about how people with high intelligence may not always have the best interests of their species in mind when engineering solutions. These resources do not specifically address bitcoin, but rather show that taxation is a form of parasitic human cannibalism and that humans have been farmed to tolerate such a system. Dave argues that learning is the answer and encourages everyone to defend themselves for the sake of everyone else.</summary>
