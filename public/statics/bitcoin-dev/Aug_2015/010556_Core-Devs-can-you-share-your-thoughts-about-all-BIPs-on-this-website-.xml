    <summary>A public release has revealed that a group has agreed that an increase in blocksize is necessary, but opposed the original suggestion of 20mb and instead suggested 8mb as it is more technically reasonable. They do not want blocksize to change in the short term future, stating that "after discussion we are in agreement that the blocksize should be within the ball park of 8mb for the short term future." While they have not explicitly rejected or supported other components of BIP101, it is believed that as long as the change is within the 8mb range, it will be acceptable. There is also discussion around Chinese mining pools supporting an increase in blocksize up to 8mb, but not wanting to upgrade to XT, which puts them on a schedule towards 8GB.</summary>
