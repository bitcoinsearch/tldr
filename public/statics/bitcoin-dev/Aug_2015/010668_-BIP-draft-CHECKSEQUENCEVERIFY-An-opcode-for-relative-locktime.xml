    <summary>In a message by Rusty Russell, he suggests that an IsStandard() rule should be immediately implemented to avoid any issues when a soft fork is initiated. This rule would ensure that nSequence is either 0xFFFFFFFF or 0. However, this suggestion is deemed unnecessary since BIP68 is not active for version 1 tx and no existing wallet would be affected.Rusty also suggests that nLockTime should apply even if nSequence != 0xFFFFFFFF. He proposes another IsStandard() rule to ensure that nLockTime is 0 in such cases. It is unclear if this proposal would affect anyone at present. This change would require a softfork and Rusty wonders if it should be implemented along with BIP65, BIP68 and BIP112.</summary>
