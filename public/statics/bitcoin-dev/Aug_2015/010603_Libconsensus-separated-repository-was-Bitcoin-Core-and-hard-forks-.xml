    <summary>Bitcoin developer Tamas Blummer has proposed a new infrastructure for enterprise applications. Blummer suggested that building consensus on the ledger is a cornerstone of the infrastructure for enterprise applications, but only a piece of the solution. He said enterprises have enough resources to solve the business problem, even at magnitudes higher cost than a hobbyist would bear. For mainstream adoption, he believes it is critical to get enterprises on board too. To help this, he suggests a slim protocol server with no wallet, RPC or QT, but with a high-performance remoting API.</summary>
