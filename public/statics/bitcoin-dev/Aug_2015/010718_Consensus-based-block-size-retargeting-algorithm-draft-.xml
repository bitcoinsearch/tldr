    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of dynamic block size proposals and the potential complications it may bring without the proper mechanisms for incentivizing validators and checks and balances. The discussion also involves the idea of miners voting on block size and how it goes against Bitcoin's security model. A hard cap on block size is proposed as a solution, which allows miners to increase block size within defined parameters and collectively agree on it. The flexicap idea, where miners can pay extra difficulty to create a larger block, is criticized for its critical flaw and lack of incentive for mining consensus. Another methodology suggested is changing the vote to be the block size itself, with miners paying extra difficulty to create a larger block, and the average or median of the last blocks becoming the new maximum block size limit. The email concludes with the proposal of raising the block size hard limit to 8MB while making a softer or inner limit part of consensus.</summary>
