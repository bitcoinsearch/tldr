    <summary>A suggestion was made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list on August 18, 2015 to increase the block size from 1MB to 1.5MB. This proposal would constitute a soft fork, as unupgraded nodes would accept the new, larger blocks as valid. The author of the proposal expressed concern that making the block size smaller would limit the amount of valuable data that could be gathered during the experiment. However, there was agreement that the technology had improved significantly since the 1MB cap was put in place five years prior.</summary>
