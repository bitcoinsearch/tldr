    <summary>Nicolas Dorier, a member of the Bitcoin development community, proposed a website that would allow developers to express their opinions on various proposals in one place. The goal of the site is not to make decisions but rather to provide the community with a coherent view of the pros and cons of various proposals. Developers are encouraged to complete the "Technical Opinion" section to explain their general worldview and concerns regarding each proposal. If they are undecided or lack information, they should not fill out the section. This helps signal the level of consensus for a proposal. The site could also be extended to include major stakeholders such as service providers and mining pools. The purpose of the site is to prevent important views from getting lost and serving as a reference point for everyone, including the media.</summary>
