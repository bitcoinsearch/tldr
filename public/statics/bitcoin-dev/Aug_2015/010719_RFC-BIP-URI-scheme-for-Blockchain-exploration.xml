    <summary>Richard Moore suggested having a standard for blockchain URIs that all explorers and even core would understand. He recommended making two changes to the current method, first by using a real URI scheme, "blockchain://", so that normal URL parsing libraries can be used. The bitcoin: scheme requires additional code to mutate it into a proper URI before passing it to URL parsing. Secondly, he suggested including type looking up in the blockchain URI scheme. Moore provided examples of different types of blockchain URIs, such as blockchain://blockhash/00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198, blockchain://txid/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a, blockchain://block/189000, and blockchain://address/1RicMooMWxqKczuRCa5D2dnJaUEn9ZJyn.He also suggested looking at the existing de-facto standard used by websites such as blockexplorer.com and blockchain.info, which use "/tx/" for transactions, "/block/" for blocks (supports both hash or height), and "/address/" for addresses.</summary>
