    <summary>The idea of a futures market for the Bitcoin block size is proposed, where a hypothetical security named BLK would be bought for bigger blocks and shorted for smaller blocks. Futures contracts for BLK could be settled to determine the new Bitcoin block size for the following three months based on the current BLK/BTC price. This allows for capacity planning and an efficient market would result in BTC/USD profits increasing for participants. The complexity and security issues of such a market are debated, but it is suggested that Bitcoin.org could run the exchange with profits funding Core development. While the idea is interesting, it may not necessarily constitute an incremental security improvement and could potentially complicate the issue further.</summary>
