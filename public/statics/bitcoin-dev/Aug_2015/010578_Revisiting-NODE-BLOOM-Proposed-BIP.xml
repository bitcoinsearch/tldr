    <summary>In an email thread on August 21, 2015, Peter Todd discussed the popularity of wallets such as Mycelium that use Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) verification of block headers with lookup servers instead of bloom filters. He mentioned that a Mycelium employee had told him they were considering moving to SPV/Bloom due to server issues mentioned by Andreas Antonopoulos. However, Todd did not have any further information about their plans and cautioned against assuming the statement was correct.</summary>
