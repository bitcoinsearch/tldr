    <summary>The email conversation revolves around the activation rules for the version bits BIP. Option 2 is being used for Bitcoin Core with nVersion=8 and a bitmask of 0xdffffff8. The &gt;=4 comparison allows recovering the bit later if needed, else version &gt;=8 is used. The supermajority applies to unmasked blocks, and a sequence of blocks with version 8 can be followed by version 4 blocks. If 950 of the last 1000 blocks have bit 0x08 set, then any block with a version less than 4 should be rejected. This makes transitioning to the version bits BIP possible by dropping the version back to 4 and enforcing BIPs for version 4 and higher blocks. This enforcement would be part of the version bits BIP.</summary>
