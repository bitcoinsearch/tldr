    <summary>The blocksize issue in Bitcoin is causing uncertainty among investors and those who start companies. However, people who invest directly in Bitcoin seem to enjoy these challenges.

Now, with reports of Bitcoin splitting in two, the price has dropped, allowing the author to buy back their coins. It's important to consider "developer attacks" when discussing the future of Bitcoin.</summary>
