    <summary>In this conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave Scotese proposes a user-configurable default limit to the size of the mempool as a permanent solution to the problem of Bitcoind eating more and more memory. This problem has nothing to do with the consensus block size maximum and needs to be solved regardless of what the maximum is. Thomas Zander notes that if the backlog grows faster than it shrinks, it could become a real problem for those who don't wait for even one confirmation. He also suggests that if Bitcoind starts eating more and more memory, lots of people that run it now may turn it off. The "doing nothing side" has been working on solving this issue too through a pull request on GitHub.</summary>
