    <summary>In an email conversation, Btc Drak expressed concern about the idea of preventing fees from rising from zero. He suggested that doing so would harm incentives for miners to secure the chain as the block subsidy dries up. However, another person responded by saying that urgent transactions could potentially fund hashing power on their own while there are still some non-urgent transactions being mined for free. It seems that there is debate surrounding the best way to incentivize miners and secure the blockchain as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve.</summary>
