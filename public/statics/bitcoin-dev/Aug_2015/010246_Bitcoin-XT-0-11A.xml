    <summary>The author of the given context is defending his stance on Bitcoin's decentralization. He argues that forking a code repository does not make Bitcoin development decentralized like Bitcoin mining but it is closer to checks and balances seen in political systems. The author claims that people have misunderstood the concept of decentralization and called him a troll or accused him of attacking developers when he pointed out the risks associated with development. He compares the situation to a central bank controlled by a small group, which is not immune to human nature.</summary>
