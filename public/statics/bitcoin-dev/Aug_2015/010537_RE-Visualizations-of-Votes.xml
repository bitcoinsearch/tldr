    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Nicolas Dorier, suggested a visualization that shows the percentage of votes for proposals in pie graphs. He was looking to get a visual comparison of the competing proposals such as BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB and BIP sipa. However, there is no standard way for miners to informally vote on the BIP they support. When asked about formal votes, he wondered if it would be possible for them to appear in a pie chart as the votes become apparent in blocks. The author of the email appreciates good visualizations and provides links to his own protocol concept and Keybase profile.</summary>
