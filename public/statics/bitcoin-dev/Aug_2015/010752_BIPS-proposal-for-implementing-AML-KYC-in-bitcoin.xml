    <summary>On August 27, 2015, a proposal was made by Prabhat Kumar Singh on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to create an AML-KYC module that would control the network and qualify use cases in an OFAC compliant way. The proposal document was attached to the email and feedback was requested. In response to this proposal, odinn replied with a simple "No" on August 28, 2015. The email thread ends there. The email thread includes a PGP signature at the end of the message which indicates that the message was signed with the SHA256 hash algorithm using GnuPG v2.0.22 (MingW32).</summary>
