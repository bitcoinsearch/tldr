    <summary>According to Danny's inquiry, there have been no blocks for nearly two hours in TestNet. This information has been verified by multiple block explorers such as blockr.io and Danny's own bitcoin node. Before the last block (530516), there were a lot of blocks with zero transactions and only occasional blocks with a high volume of transactions. It is unclear what is causing this issue and if there is any additional information available.</summary>
