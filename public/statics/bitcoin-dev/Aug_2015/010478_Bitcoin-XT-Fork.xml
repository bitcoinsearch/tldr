    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Lombrozo and Jorge Timón discussed the issue of consensus code being subject to the same commit policies as other code. Lombrozo argued that the consensus code should be separated from other code and that libconsensus would help achieve this goal. However, he expressed concern that as long as libconsensus was built directly out of the bitcoind repository, Bitcoin Core could not be considered just another implementation. He questioned how other implementations could transition off of the repository and commit policies, or if they would be dependent on it perpetually. Lombrozo also noted that intentional hard forks were now a reality, making it harder for stakeholders to maintain consensus when it was their individual intent. He suggested that stakeholders work together to achieve their mutual goal and offered to participate in an offline discussion facilitated by Timón.</summary>
