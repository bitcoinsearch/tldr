    <summary>The author suggests that instead of focusing on a voting mechanism, there should be an information site about the current outstanding BIPs and their differences. This site should include supporting and counter statements regarding these proposals and highlight certain things like pools in China voicing their opinions that increase should happen, which is relevant to the discussion. In response to a suggestion made by Btc Drak, Peter Todd proposes asking developers to explain their threat models and what should be at the root of their thinking about the block size. The author of the email signature, Yifu Guo, adds a quote about life being an everlasting self-improvement.</summary>
