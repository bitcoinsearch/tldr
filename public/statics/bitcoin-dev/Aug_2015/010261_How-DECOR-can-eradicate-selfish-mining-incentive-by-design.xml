    <summary>The author proposes the DECOR protocol, which allows miners to share block rewards if they mine competing blocks. Ethereum adopted a similar strategy but created an uncapped inflationary one, so the supply function cap was not maintained. The author then proposed DECOR+, which addressed the problem of unbalanced rewards. However, if miners are dishonest, these proposals do not solve the underlying problem. Thus, the author introduces DECOR++, which pays full rewards to all competing blocks and chooses the parent block based on a deterministic random selection in case of conflict. Transactions of all competing blocks will be processed, and fees will be paid to original miners for non-conflicting transactions in uncle blocks. The money supply will be decreased in blocks following blocks including uncles to compensate for the increase in money supply, and the amount of uncles that can be included over an interval of blocks will be limited.</summary>
