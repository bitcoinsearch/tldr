    <summary>Alex Morcos, a member of the Bitcoin development team, proposed a set of requirements for accepting new transactions into the mempool and relaying them. The policy would affect transactions with inputs from unconfirmed transactions. The motivation behind this policy is to limit the size of the mempool, ensuring that once it is full, a new transaction can pay for any dependent transactions it would evict. Four new policy limits are proposed, which are all command line configurable. The first two limits ensure that no chain of transactions will be too large for the eviction code to handle. The third limit ensures that calculating the state required for sorting and limiting the mempool is computationally feasible. The fourth limit aims to maintain the pre-existing policy goal that all transactions in the mempool should be mineable in the next block. The limits proposed include the maximum number of descendant transactions, the maximum descendant size, the maximum number of ancestor transactions, and the maximum ancestor size. The proposed limits would have affected less than 2% of transactions entering the mempool in April or May of that year. During the stress test period between July 6th and 14th, as many as 25% of transactions would have been affected. The code to implement the descendant package tracking and new policy limits can be found on Github.</summary>
