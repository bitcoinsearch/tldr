    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community named Btc Drak raised a question about an issue he was facing with his own project that uses auxpow. He suggested using a bitmasking method to get rid of auxpow version bits before making standard integer comparisons in order to deploy BIP66 using IsSuperMajority(). However, another member pointed out that this approach may not be foolproof since it would fail the test if a version number of 257 is used in the future, which would appear to be a version 1 block.</summary>
