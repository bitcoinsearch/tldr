    <summary>In an email thread dated August 20, 2015, Jorge Timón argued that the maximum block size consensus rule was crucial in limiting mining centralization. He expressed his concern over Gavin Andresen's lack of understanding on the subject even though he had written extensively about it. Timón emphasized the importance of taking a public position to get miners, who were highly centralized at the time, to implement changes in the consensus rules.</summary>
