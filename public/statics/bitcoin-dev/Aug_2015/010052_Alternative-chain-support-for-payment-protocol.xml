    <summary>The context mentions the idea of creating a new network string for alt coins as BIP 70 doesn't do this. The reason behind this is that alt coins can vary in arbitrary ways from Bitcoin and so things in BIP70 that work for Bitcoin may or may not work for other coins. The suggestion is to define a new network string for the alt coin if it is close enough to BIP 70 and reuse it "as is". Another option would be to use the genesis hash as the network name, but that would involve lookups to figure out what the request is for. Overall, the feedback is requested on the idea and if there are no major objections, it will be raised as a BIP.</summary>
