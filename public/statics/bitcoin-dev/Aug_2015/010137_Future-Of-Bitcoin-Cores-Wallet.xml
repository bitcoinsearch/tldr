    <summary>The author of the message discusses the lack of focus on Bitcoin Core's wallet development and how it has shifted towards SPV, thin clients, and centralized web middleware. This shift is appreciated by users who can run a bitcoin-client on a smartphone or computer with small resources. However, running a full validation node could be end-user friendly with some changes in the current concept, as it would increase the amount of participating full nodes while giving users more privacy and security. The author suggests a strategy for an end-user focused full node wallet that includes enabled pruning by default, throttled validation, throttled block download, and SPV during catch up. They also suggest disabling bloom filtering if there is enough bandwidth, maintaining to lists/databases of wtx, and re-validating after full catchup and displaying potential conflicts. The benefits of such a system include creating a counterweight against SPV/thin clients, avoiding wallet development centralization, and slowly completing full validation to increase privacy and security.The author also discusses the idea of using smartphones as wallets, but notes that the above solution might not work well on them due to high bandwidth and CPU usage. Instead, they suggest groups of people who trust each other (a family, etc.) might run one or multiple full node(s) on a hardened system where the system could serve smartphones over something like a stratum server or bitpays wallet-service does.The author is working on a wallet-focused Bitcoin Core fork with the ability to re-merge it to the Bitcoin Core branch. Their long-term goal is to decouple the wallet and core by using Bitcoin Core as a library for the wallet side. They are open to criticism and any ideas and have set up a mail to avoid parallelism on a works stream.</summary>
