    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ryan Butler suggested that a Raspberry Pi 2 node with a reasonable internet connection and hard drive could easily run a node with 8 or 20mb blocks. However, there is no available data on how fast an RP2 can do the necessary cryptographic calculations to validate blocks of various sizes. While the typical time for one block is 10 minutes, this doesn't account for situations where multiple blocks are found in quick succession, which happens daily. It is unclear at what point an RP2 node would fail to be able to validate a second or third block because it hasn't finished processing the first. Additionally, the ability to DoS lower-performance nodes by mining transactions without broadcasting them to the network would depend on how long it takes to mine these transactions, ignoring other considerations such as bandwidth.</summary>
