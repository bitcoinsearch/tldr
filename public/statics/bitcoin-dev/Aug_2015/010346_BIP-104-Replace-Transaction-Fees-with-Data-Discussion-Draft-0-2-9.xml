    <summary>On August 17, 2015, Ahmed Zsales proposed a long-term solution to replace mining rewards and transaction fees. The proposal was titled BIP [104] and was initially a discussion draft only. In response, Btc Drak pointed out that bip numbers cannot be assigned by individuals, but must follow the format of "BIP-myproposal". Ahmed Zsales updated the proposal and removed the reference to self-ascribed numbers. Angel Leon confirmed that privacy issues were covered in the proposal. Peter Todd made a public remark on Twitter about the proposal, adding the term "data mining" to its title. While the remark was likely meant to be disparaging, Ahmed Zsales thanked Peter Todd for his contribution. It is ironic that Peter Todd posted the remark on Twitter, where messages are aggregated and sold to data miners. Twitter made $48 million from selling data to data miners in 2014, with a 95% year-on-year growth rate. Twitter has since spent $130 million on buying a data mining business in order to further grow this part of their business. This side of their business is one of their more profitable areas.</summary>
