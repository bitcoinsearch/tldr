    <summary>In August 2015, Eric Lombrozo via bitcoin-dev proposed the ability to switch filtering on and off globally, as well as on a per-connection basis. However, Wladimir suggested that it would be more useful to give special privileges to whitelisted peers rather than sending everyone the same nServices bits. Additionally, he recommended only advertising the intersection of supported services in `addr` messages, specifically those offered to the general public.</summary>
