    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has seen a discussion on the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on the fee market. The email thread involves analyzing how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in an uncapped block size scenario. One sender argues that the effect of block compression protocols is included in the "coding gain" represented by the Greek letter "gamma." As long as block solution announcements contain information about transactions included in a block, the fee market will be healthy according to the Shannon-Hartley theorem. However, a scenario where block solutions announcements contain no information at all about the transactions included in blocks would result in an unhealthy fee market and require miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks according to their own volition, essentially centralizing the system.Daniele Pinna submitted a paper analyzing mining advantages as a function of miner hashrate, showing how large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to the steady increasing marginal profits as hashrates grow. The paper also shows that part of the large advantage large miners have today is due to there being a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency mining class, leading to a marginal profit structure that decreases as a function of hashrate. As block subsidies decrease, this high-efficiency class is expected to vanish leading to a marginal profit structure which decreases as a function of hashrate. The author hopes the paper will reignite consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101).In a discussion between Peter R and Matt Corallo, it was noted that several large miners pre-relay the blocks they are working on to their nodes globally, reducing relay times for transactions. Transaction validation upon receiving a block can be easily made negligible, thus reducing the increased orphan risk for including a transaction to a very tiny amount. Large miners have their own network to pre-relay blocks, meaning that at announce-time, there are only a few bytes to broadcast, leading to very low relay times. Small miners are at a disadvantage in such a system, but it provides strong incentives for the network to centralize in other ways.The email thread also includes comments on the BIP101 proposal and its potential for an uncontroversial hardfork. Daniele Pinna believes that BIP101 has been hastily placed on the chopping block due to XT fork drama. He further stated that he doesn't like relying on exponential growth and suggested turning bip101 into just another proposal for an uncontroversial hardfork. He also talked about bip102 as his favorite proposal so far but warned about the dangers of a schism hardfork for it.In summary, the email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on the network. The discussion is about the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on the fee market. If block solutions announcements contain information about the transactions included in a block, then the fee market will be healthy. The Shannon-Hartley theorem describes the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a physical communication channel. Matt Corallo responds to Peter R's comments and suggests that many large miners already have their own network to relay blocks globally with only a few bytes on the wire at block-time. The increased orphan risk for including a transaction can be reduced to a very tiny amount making the optimal block size to include everything that is in the mempool of other reasonably large miners.</summary>
