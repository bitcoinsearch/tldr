    <summary>Mike Hearn, a developer in the bitcoin community, responded to comments that Gavin Andresen had bypassed the review process for his BIP 101 proposal. Hearn argued that there were months of public discussion leading up to BIP 101 and it was submitted via the normal process, with only minor changes suggested from other developers. In response, Peter Todd noted that there were issues with the BIP 101 proposal, including no details about testing, non-deterministic expiration dates, and other concerns, which were not addressed by its author. Todd stated that the review process is to identify and fix issues until all are resolved.</summary>
