    <summary>In 2015, a proposal was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Prabhat Kumar Singh to create an Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer (AML-KYC) module to control the network and qualify use cases in an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliant way. The proposal aimed to mitigate the risks associated with money laundering by regulating the flow of funds through the network. A link to a Reddit post from 2013 discussing similar issues with bitcoin and the Bitcoin Foundation's Law and Policy Committee was also included in the message for reference. The proposal requested feedback and suggestions from the community.</summary>
