    <summary>Section 200.3(c)(2) at http://media.scmagazine.com/documents/127/virtual_currency_rules_31557.pdf lists consumers who solely use virtual currency for the purchase or sale of goods or services or for investment purposes as exempt from licensing requirements. Theo Chino proposed starting a Church to protect Bitcoin network from politicians' overreaching, citing HBO's John Oliver's program about Churches and their hypocrisy. Chino argued that such an entity could argue that Bitcoin is a belief system and force the issue under Church and State separation at a federal level. Chino is waiting for his license to be denied to protest and appeal it, waiting to hear from the License process to appeal the law in general, and meeting elected officials in New York City, NY State, and France to educate them on Bitcoin. Btc Drak shared his technical analysis of the Satoshi email, which he wrote in a pastebin. The email is the one used by Satoshi to announce Bitcoin, originated from vistomail's server, and had not been signed with any PGP keys.</summary>
