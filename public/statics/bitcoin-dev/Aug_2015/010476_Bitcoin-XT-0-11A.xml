    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential chaos of SPV nodes if full nodes are 50:50 Bitcoin Core and XT. The conversation then turns to the controversy surrounding Bitcoin XT and its potential schism fork. The author argues that forks and rule changes should be allowed due to Bitcoin's open source nature, but expresses concern over a hardfork causing a division among users and potentially causing both currencies' prices to drop near zero. The author also addresses the issue of honest majority in Bitcoin and emphasizes the importance of miners not attacking the network for too long. Despite the ongoing debate and uncertainty, Bitcoin's unique advantages and lack of competitors make it unlikely to die or split, according to the author.</summary>
