    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Joseph Poon responds to Benjamin's questions about online identification and non-cooperative hubs in regards to Lightning Network. Poon explains that if a node is offline during a payment transaction, the payment can be cancelled and re-routed. However, Lightning Network does not currently solve the key exchange problem, which requires public-key infrastructure out-of-band to identify users. This problem exists within Bitcoin as well. Poon suggests that every transaction should have signed proof of payment to ensure that the recipient received the funds. In regards to non-cooperative hubs flooding the network and making it unusable, Poon explains that there are incentives towards keeping the system functional via fees. If someone attempts to flood the system, they will likely end up paying substantial fees, which could be interpreted as an attack by those running nodes. Overall, Poon stresses the importance of considering various attack models.</summary>
