    <summary>In an email exchange between Sriram Karra and Jorge Tim贸n, the topic of mining centralization in relation to the maximum block size consensus rule was discussed. Tim贸n noted that the current rule already limits mining centralization, but expressed concern about changing it without fully understanding the potential consequences. He also commented on Gavin's lack of understanding on the subject. Karra questioned what public position Tim贸n would take if he wanted to limit mining centralization through a change in consensus rules.</summary>
