    <summary>The mining centralization prevents successful attempts to mine spoofing blocks in real names. This makes it difficult to run the real BitcoinXT or create Not-BitcoinXT. Running such software will only be interpreted as XT-supporters. The node count is always manipulable and people running these programs are seen as supporters of the XT movement. Julie announced the creation of Not-BitcoinXT on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The Github repository for Not-BitcoinXT can be found at https://github.com/xtbit/notbitcoinxt#not-bitcoin-xt. Additionally, VFEmail offers a Metadata Mitigator service to keep email out of the NSA's hands. They also offer one-time lifetime accounts with privacy features, 15GB disk space, and no bandwidth quotas. Commercial and bulk mail options are available as well.</summary>
