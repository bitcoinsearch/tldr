    <summary>The paper in question simply states that transaction fees will not go to zero even without the blocksize limit if miners do not centralize. While this may be a nice academic research finding, it is not practical for most users of the Bitcoin network who are concerned with issues of centralization. For many users, including the author, the main concern is maintaining a fair and secure network through decentralization. As such, users are willing to pay high transaction fees as long as the network remains decentralized.</summary>
