    <summary>A proposal to limit the size of a mempool has been made by Alex Morcos, which would affect transactions that have inputs from other unconfirmed transactions. The proposed policy includes four new limits that are all command line configurable. The first two limits ensure no chain of transactions will be too large for eviction code to handle, while the third limit ensures computational feasibility in calculating the state required for sorting and limiting the mempool. The fourth limit maintains the existing policy goal that all transactions in the mempool should be mineable in the next block. The proposed depth limit of 100 may not provide a sufficient cap on memory consumption or loop/recursion depth for brokered asset transfers, requiring sets of transactions with a dependency tree depth of 3 or more to be published together. If this is not sufficient, a limit of 10 would provide plenty of headroom. Matt Corallo sees no problem with such limits and suggests limiting entire tx dependency trees to a maximum of two levels deep and a maximum of ten transactions. These limits would have affected less than 2% of transactions entering the mempool in April or May of 2015, but during a stress test in July of the same year, as many as 25% of the transactions would have been affected.</summary>
