    <summary>On August 21, 2015, Christian Decker via bitcoin-dev sent an email regarding a tracking page for 'block votes'. The tracking page currently includes the 8MB vote and XT, as well as the /BV\d+/ vote for generic size. Odinn via bitcoin-dev responded to Nicolas Dorier's inquiry about a visualization of pie graphs that would show what percentages are voting for BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, BIP sipa, etc., based on what's published in blocks. There is currently no standard way for miners to vote informally for a BIP they support. However, Odinn asked if there is a way to visually have formal votes appear in a pie chart as the votes become apparent in blocks.</summary>
