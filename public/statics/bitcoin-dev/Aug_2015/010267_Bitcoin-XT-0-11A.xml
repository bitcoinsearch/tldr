    <summary>The email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Levin was shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Blummer expressed his agreement with the BitcoinXT manifesto created by Mike and Gavin. As a bitcoin software developer and entrepreneur, Blummer believed that success in the field is not solely based on technology and is not inevitable. However, he commended the creation of the BitcoinXT branch, which he believes should resonate with many fellow entrepreneurs. Levin also shared his thoughts, stating that he prefers to use the "only-bigblocks" branch instead of XT since he is not mining. Nevertheless, he supports the idea of raising the block size as soon as possible and is grateful for Mike's initiative.</summary>
