    <summary>In an email exchange, Eric Lombrozo and Levin Keller discuss their opposing views on the decentralization of Bitcoin. Keller supports total decentralization while Lombrozo is in favor of a "guided decentralization." Lombrozo clarifies that he wants complete decentralization but for practical reasons, it cannot start at this point. He adds that Bitcoin came into existence through Satoshi's rules without any voting or committee involvement. Adam Back, in response to Lombrozo, writes that starting a fork war is not constructive and there are multiple proposals being evaluated. Back also notes that Bitcoin-XT is both a hard-fork and a soft-fork that exposes SPV nodes to loss in the likely event that it results in a network-split. Lombrozo argues that attempting a hard fork mechanism that has never been done before in such a politically divisive environment is risky and could lead to a war, tanking the value of everyone's assets on both chains. He urges people to see the bigger picture and understand that nobody is trying to stop anyone from doing anything out of some desire for maintaining control.</summary>
