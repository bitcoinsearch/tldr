    <summary>Chris created a chart to track the block votes for BIP 100 support as well as actual size voting. Some pools vote to support BIP 100 without specifying a desired block size, which Chris decided to track on the same chart as actual size voting. However, he may split them into different charts for clarity later. Jeff Garzik pointed out a duplicated column and clarified that BIP 100 voting is represented by /BV\d+/. Nicolas Dorier suggested a pie chart visualization of the percentage of votes for BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, BIP sipa, etc., but there is currently no standard way for miners to informally vote for the BIP they support. Odinn asked about formal votes and whether they could be visually represented in a pie chart as they become apparent in blocks. Chris's chart can be found at http://bitcoinstats.com/network/votes/.</summary>
