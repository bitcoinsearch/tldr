    <summary>On August 4th, 2015, Jorge Timon posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about the block size limit and its role in limiting mining centralization. Hector Chu responded by saying that the technical list requires a proof of concept and simulation to base future judgment on. The tools for simulation exist, and anyone can run a simulation to demonstrate what they're talking about, such as the variable block size regtest PR created by Jorge Timon. Hector also added that repeating a claim ad-nauseum doesn't necessarily make it true, and a block size limit won't prevent miners from buying each other out in the future. He emphasized that without a simulation, people will just be talking without making any progress. The email concludes with links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and a PGP signature from GnuPG v1.</summary>
