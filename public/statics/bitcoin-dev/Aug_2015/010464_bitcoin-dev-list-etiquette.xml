    <summary>The biggest challenge facing Bitcoin is not technical but political, according to a message written by Alex Morcos, posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The message was intended for all core developers to sign onto in order to appeal for individual self-restraint and a higher signal-to-noise ratio on the list. Morcos calls for a return to technical discussions and a reduction in philosophical topics, which have rendered the list almost unusable. Morcos also asks members to consider the relevance of their email to technical development before sending it, and to limit the number of emails on the same topic. Finally, he suggests that any debate on the philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin should be taken to another forum.</summary>
