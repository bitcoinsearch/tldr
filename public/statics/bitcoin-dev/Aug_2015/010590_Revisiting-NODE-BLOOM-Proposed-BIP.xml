    <summary>The email conversation between Matt Corallo and Peter Todd regarding the BIP # for NODE_BLOOM service bit has been shared. This BIP extends BIP 37, Connection Bloom filtering, by defining a service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support bloom filters explicitly. It also bumps the protocol version to allow peers to identify old nodes which allow bloom filtering of the connection despite lacking the new service bit. The motivation behind this is that BIP 37 did not specify a service bit for the bloom filter service, thus implicitly assuming that all nodes that serve peers data support it. The connection filtering algorithm proposed in BIP 37, and implemented in several clients today, has been shown to provide little to no privacy, as well as being a large DoS risk on some nodes. A service bit was chosen as applying a bloom filter is a service.</summary>
