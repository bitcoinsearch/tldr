    <summary>A developer named Tier Nolan suggested on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that a version of Bitcoin XT with only blocksize changes should be made available to address mining pools' concerns about the software being "experimental." Nolan proposed that the absolute minimum changes to core should be made, and that the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE parameter could be overwritten whenever the longest tip changes, which would save creating a new function. The consensus measuring code could be removed as well, making the patch even easier to implement. Satoshi Nakamoto's original proposal for a block height comparison (a year in advance) could be used instead, and the state storing code could be eliminated by using the standard "counting" upgrade system, which would not require any state to be stored in the database. The "only bigblock" patch is available on Github.</summary>
