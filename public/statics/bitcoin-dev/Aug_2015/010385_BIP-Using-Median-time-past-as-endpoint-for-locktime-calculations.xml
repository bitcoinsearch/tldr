    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd apologized for an oversight in editing and requested a link related to a discussion about incentives related to nTime. In response to Thomas Kerin's BIP document acknowledgments, Todd stated that Gregory Maxwell should receive credit for the idea in question, which was discussed between Todd and Luke-Jr. Todd offered to search for a link to the discussion for historical interest. The email also included standard mailing list information and formatting.</summary>
