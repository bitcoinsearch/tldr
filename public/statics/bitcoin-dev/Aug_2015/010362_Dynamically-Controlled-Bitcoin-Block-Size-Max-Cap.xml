    <summary>The argument presented is in response to a statement made about the potential for miners with a significant amount of hash power to sabotage block size increases by only mining empty blocks. The author argues that this approach would not be economical, as it would require sacrificing transaction fees, and that pool owners would ultimately lose out as miners switch pools. Additionally, the author proposes a technical solution in the form of an algorithm that would adjust block sizes based on the percentage of block size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period. This approach would give both miners and end users a say in the process, as end users would fill up the mempool from where miners take transactions to fill up blocks. The proposal would also prevent data discrepancies among different nodes due to orphan blocks. The author requests comments on their proposal.</summary>
