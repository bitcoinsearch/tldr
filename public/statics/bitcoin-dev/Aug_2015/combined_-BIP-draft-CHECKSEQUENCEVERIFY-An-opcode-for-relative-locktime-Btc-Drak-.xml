    <summary>In August 2015, Nicolas Dorier expressed his desire to have a proposal pushed together with BIP68 and CLTV in a bitcoin-dev email thread. He believed that if BIP68 was included in the next fork, then CSV would be an easy decision to make. However, he asked if there were any competing RCLTV proposals that did not rely on BIP68 for information. In response, Matt stated that all such proposals were dropped because the current proposal seemed like a better idea. The proposal was related to implementing the CSV (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) alongside CLTV (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) and BIP68 (relative lock-time). The implementation of CSV would be a no-brainer if BIP68 gets pushed in the next fork. However, there is a question about whether there was a competing RCLTV (Relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) implementation that did not depend on BIP68 for information, but it seems difficult to find any information on this. Overall, the discussion revolved around the implementation of various proposals related to Bitcoin development. Nicola Dorier expressed his desire for a specific proposal, and Matt responded by stating that other proposals had been dropped in favor of the current one. However, he encouraged anyone to come up with a new proposal or revive an old one.</summary>
