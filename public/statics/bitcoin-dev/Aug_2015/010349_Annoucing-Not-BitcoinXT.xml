    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of hostility in the Bitcoin community and how it is perceived. The author suggests that hostility is often a result of perceived hostility and that assuming the best intentions of others can lead to finding common ground or driving away those who are trying to deceive. The current core developers of Bitcoin are listed, and there is no perceived hostility from any of them. The author also suggests that those who are threatened by Bitcoin may be using psychological warfare agents to undermine the decentralization movement. In response to a statement about censorship on /r/Bitcoin, the author suggests that identifying individuals who are being hostile or pointing out hostility is not productive. Instead, the author recommends ignoring bad ideas and responding to possible misconceptions with factual information. The author also expresses concern about the block size issue and the potential for division and hostility within the community. Finally, the author offers their services as a techie and lists some of their past projects.</summary>
