    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd proposed an idea of creating a voting mechanism in which only users with access to validating nodes would be able to vote. However, some concerns were raised regarding this proposal. One concern was that if the rule is that one user can only have one vote, how do you prevent a user running multiple nodes? Another concern was how to verify that a node is indeed a fully validating node with its own copy of the blockchain. Despite these concerns, the idea of designing a voting mechanism for Bitcoin's governance remains an interesting concept to explore.</summary>
