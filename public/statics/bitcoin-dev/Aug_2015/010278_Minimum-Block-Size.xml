    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list had a discussion on the potential of having a minimum block size. Levin Keller initiated the conversation, asking if anyone was in favor of a minimum block size and expressed his support for a lower limit. However, Jeff Garzik replied to the thread with his opinion that there would be no value in requiring a minimum block size. He pointed out that traffic levels may not produce a minimum-sized block, and miners could collude to produce a lowered maximum block size, which he referred to as a 'minimum maximum.' The email thread did not result in any concrete decisions or conclusions regarding the implementation of a minimum block size.</summary>
