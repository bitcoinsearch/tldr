    <summary>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Zander and Jorge Timon discussed concerns about increasing the Bitcoin block size limit. Zander attempted to steer the discussion towards identifying risks associated with a block size increase so that they could be addressed before any change was made to the network. He argued that Bitcoin is a growing network and will eventually face problems if the blocks consistently become full. While Bitcoin's Lightning Network (LN) has been developed to cope with this growth, it won't handle all use cases, such as remittances and cross-border purchases. Therefore, both LN and bigger blocks are needed. However, Zander wanted to discuss "things that could go wrong if we raise the consensus block size maximum" in this thread, while creating another thread to discuss why the block size should be increased. He urged contributors to think about risks that could arise from increasing the block size, even if they were certain that these risks weren't a concern at that scale, as identifying and estimating the risks would be useful for future increases.</summary>
