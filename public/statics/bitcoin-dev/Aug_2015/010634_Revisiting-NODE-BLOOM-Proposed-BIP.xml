    <title>Revisiting NODE_BLOOM: Proposed BIP</title>

    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Lombrozo suggested the implementation of a feature that allows users to switch filtering on and off globally or on a per-connection basis. In response, Matt Corallo stated that BIP 111 was assigned and provided a pull request with proposed changes for it. Additionally, Peter Todd commented that NODE_BLOOM is distinct from NODE_NETWORK, indicating that it is legal to advertise NODE_BLOOM but not NODE_NETWORK. However, there is little reason to do so now, and some proposals may make this more useful in the future. Lombrozo then suggested a client/server architecture with proper authentication and access controls, as opposed to the current RPC which he claims "sucks so bad for doing anything beyond administering a node instance you fully control yourself."</summary>
