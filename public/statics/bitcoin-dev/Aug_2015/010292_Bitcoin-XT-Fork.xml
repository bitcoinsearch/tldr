    <summary>In an email sent on August 15, 2015, Satoshi Nakamoto expressed his concerns about the Bitcoin XT fork proposal and its potential danger to Bitcoin. He claimed that the developers of Bitcoin XT were violating the original vision of Bitcoin by not achieving near unanimous agreement for a change in consensus rules. Satoshi also acknowledged changes since his original writings, such as pooled mining and the need for a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism. He warned that if two developers could redefine what "Bitcoin" is through populist tactics, he would have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project. This email caused a stir in the news and was discussed in various places.</summary>
