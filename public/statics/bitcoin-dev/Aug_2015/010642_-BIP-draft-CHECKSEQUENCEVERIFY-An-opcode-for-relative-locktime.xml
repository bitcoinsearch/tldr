    <summary>A new BIP, BIP112, has been assigned by the BIP repository maintainer. The pull request has been updated accordingly. There was a suggestion to cannibalize the version, but this was deemed disadvantageous as it would lead to a loss of fine-grained control over txins, thereby reducing its usefulness considerably. Additionally, using version is considered ugly because there isn't a semantic association with what they are trying to achieve. Instead, sequence, which is associated with transaction finality, is the more appropriate and logical field to use.</summary>
