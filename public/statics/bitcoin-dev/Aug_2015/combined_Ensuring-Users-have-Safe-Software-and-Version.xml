    <summary>The Bitcoin.org website has issued an alert stating that the issues related to the 4th of July event still affect the network. To ensure safety, users are advised to wait for 30 more confirmations than usual when using Electrum and directed to a resource on en.bitcoin.it. The most current version of Bitcoin Core is considered safe software as it avoids inadvertent connection to an XT node. However, the information about the software and version provided voluntarily by server administrators is not validated. Depending on the wallet type used, different methods can be employed to determine which software is being used, such as Core or any other hardware, desktop, web, or mobile wallet. The Get Block Header custom plugin can be used authoritatively to determine which side of the fork an Electrum server is on.</summary>
