    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Elliot Olds responds to Michael Naber's argument that Bitcoin must increase its transaction capacity in order to remain competitive with other cryptocurrencies. Olds points out that it is not useful to discuss hypothetical scenarios involving Bitcoin while ignoring centralization concerns. He notes that decentralization is fundamental to Bitcoin's value and meaning, and thus any scaling solution must take this into account. Olds supports the idea of adding another layer on top of Bitcoin to cater for increased adoption and transaction volume.</summary>
