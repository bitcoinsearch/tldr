    <summary>The message thread between Zach G and Michael Wozniak discusses a decentralized forum that integrates the Bitcoin blockchain with every post. The system is designed to store most of the data in a hash reference table and shares data via a torrent-esque system, making it censorship-resistant. Zach is working on the project 24/7 and will release the code once it's ready. He believes that the system can be used for more than just messaging and can be used to upload anything and everything.  A similar project called Twister has been reviewed by Zach, but its developer chose to make an altcoin instead of using the real blockchain, which makes its network weak. Michael expressed interest in helping out by running some alpha/beta software as part of the network and might help with code depending on the language used. Another user, Natanael, suggests a list of decentralized communication mechanisms for further discussions.</summary>
