    <summary>In an email sent to bitcoin-dev, Michael Naber argues that hitting the limit is not necessarily a bad thing, and the real question is whether we should constrain it below what technology is capable of delivering. Pieter, a Bitcoin Core developer, responds by stating that the question is not what technology can deliver, but what price we are willing to pay for it. He believes that a small increase in block size may come with higher centralization pressure and that consensus rules are necessary to keep the system together. Pieter emphasizes the need to merge consensus changes only when they are uncontroversial, as disagreement poses a larger risk than a small block size increase. Although he agrees that a block size increase may be necessary, he believes it should be done for the right reasons and not out of fear of rising fees or unreliability.</summary>
