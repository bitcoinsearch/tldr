    <summary>In an email exchange, Michael Naber highlights the importance of Bitcoin's capacity and how constraining it will only lead users to alternative solutions such as BitcoinXT which have sufficient capacity. He notes that many people would like to participate in a global consensus network where participating nodes are aware of and agree upon every transaction. He argues that Lightning/hub and spoke do not meet this requirement since all participating nodes are not aware of all transactions. In response, Jorge questions whether fees rising as a consequence of hitting the limit would push people towards other altcoins, to which Michael agrees.</summary>
