    <summary>On August 29, 2015, Daniele Pinna via bitcoin-dev expressed his apologies for lagging behind on his work due to his two weeks long involvement in block size scaling proposal (BIP101). He believes that BIP101 has been hastily placed on the chopping block due to XT fork drama. He further stated that he doesn't like relying on exponential growth and suggested turning bip101 into just another proposal for an uncontroversial hardfork. He also talked about bip102 as his favorite proposal so far but warned about the dangers of a schism hardfork for it. In addition to this, he asked for more information about the claims made in a scribd document related to miner advantages in uncapped block size fee markets.</summary>
