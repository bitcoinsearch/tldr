    <summary>In an email discussion, Tom Harding points out to Daniele Pinna that the optimal way of choosing transactions to be included in a block is a knapsack problem which is NP-complete and simple fee-density prioritization is not necessarily optimal. He refers to Peter R's analysis of fee markets in the absence of blocksize limits, which shows that the hashrate advantage of a large miner is a side-effect of coinbase subsidization. As the block rewards get smaller, so will large miner advantages. Large blocksizes as proposed by BIP100-101 hope to stimulate the increase of TX fees by augmenting the network's capacity. The sooner block rewards become comparable to block fees, the sooner mine centralization can be eliminated.</summary>
