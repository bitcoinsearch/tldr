    <summary>Mark Friedenbach has requested the BIP editor to assign an official number to his work as per the rules of BIP 1. The idea was previously discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and a reference implementation is available on Github. However, Mark suggests allowing some time for discussion with the proposed text before assigning any numbers. Btcdrak had asked for numbers prior to posting any text, but Mark asked him to post the text first.</summary>
