    <summary>A new project called Not-BitcoinXT has been announced on Github. It is a fork of Bitcoin Core, the original software behind the Bitcoin network. The project aims to provide an alternative to Bitcoin XT, which is another fork of Bitcoin Core that has been controversial in the Bitcoin community. Not-BitcoinXT is designed to address some of the issues that Bitcoin XT has faced, such as the lack of support from the majority of the Bitcoin community. One of the key differences between the two forks is that Not-BitcoinXT does not include a block size increase proposal. In addition, VFEmail offers a Metadata Mitigator tool that can help users keep their emails private and out of the hands of the NSA. Lifetime accounts with privacy features are available for a one-time fee of $24.95, with 15GB of disk space and no bandwidth quotas. Commercial and bulk mail options are also available.</summary>
