    <summary>In response to a question about "develop-by-concerns," the speaker provides a link to an article discussing the importance of setting goals and developing roadmaps to achieve those goals. The article suggests that fire-fighting management, or constantly reacting to crises as they arise, is not an effective way to manage a business. Instead, businesses should focus on identifying their concerns and developing plans to address them in a strategic manner. By setting clear goals and creating roadmaps to achieve those goals, businesses can make more informed decisions about which changes to implement and when.</summary>
