    <summary>BitPay has expressed its support for BIP 101, which could potentially increase the block size limit in Bitcoin. However, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain as research on the current protocol version is deemed important. XT was created out of frustration regarding the slow pace of research, but it is hoped that the current block chain will continue to survive. If XT prevails or core is changed within the terms of BIP 101, concerns arise about whether there will be enough people to continue with the old protocol version. It is unclear if developers will fork a Bitcoin client for supporting the old nodes with security updates, or if compatibility mode in XT will allow it to behave like an old Bitcoin node. The fate of smaller projects such as picocoin is also up in the air.In an email thread, the writer expresses their perspective on block size increase and opposition to XT. They mention that they would like to see a block size increase in the context of something like BIP 100. The writer also addresses the question of whether they would continue with bitcoin if XT prevails, saying that they would fight it as long as possible and never use it themselves. The email also includes a message from Oliver Egginger via bitcoin-dev, who discusses BitPay's support for BIP 101 and the subject of research on Bitcoin. Egginger suggests that further research on the current protocol version is important and hopes that the current block chain survives, albeit at a lower level with fewer users. He also poses several questions about the possibility of continuing with the old protocol version if XT prevails, including whether there are enough people to support the old nodes and whether developers would fork a Bitcoin client for supporting the old nodes with security updates.</summary>
