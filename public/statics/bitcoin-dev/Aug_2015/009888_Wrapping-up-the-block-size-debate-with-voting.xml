    <summary>The email is a proposal to end the discussion on Bitcoin's economic policy by voting. The author suggests using fiat currencies if one wants a majority vote, as Bitcoin's consensus rules are not democratic. The proposal outlines candidate proposals and voter groups, including miners, Bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full node operators. The voting system would use single transferable vote, where voters rank their preferences, and the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated until the most popular candidate is determined. The technical issues of the voting process are also addressed, including the need for a trusted person to verify voters' identities and the possibility of double voting. Multiple identity is allowed for those who contribute in multiple categories.</summary>
