    <summary>The writer subscribed to the libbitcoin list after meeting Amir Taaki in a Spanish hackmeeting. The writer had an interesting conversation with Taaki and he shared his concerns about Bitcoin Core, naming Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen as two people who were causing issues. Hearn had recently proposed a blacklisting scheme for Bitcoin, which the writer thought was unlikely to be accepted by other developers. The writer believed that Andresen was someone who could be trusted, despite his visit to the CIA. However, in hindsight, the writer now realizes that Taaki's concerns about both Hearn and Andresen were not unfounded. Andresen was also worried about the payment protocol, although the writer disagreed with him on this matter. This is not meant to be taken as an argument of authority, but rather a curious anecdote.</summary>
