    <summary>In a discussion thread on 19 August 2015, Jameson Lopp suggested that an SPV node can check transactions by querying other nodes. However, the proposal requires nodes to validate unconfirmed transactions and commit to validation through POW. This may increase the data size of every transaction, leading to more contention for block space. The proposal suggests stipulating that coinbase fields only hold space for a single pubkey, ensuring that the entire block header including two coinbases should only take around 100 bytes extra, which is approximately a 33% increase from routine 250 byte transactions.</summary>
