    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list posed a question regarding the block size of Bitcoin. They suggested reducing the block size to 0.125MB, which would allow for 0.375tx/s. The author noted that this change would result in more full nodes, as it would be more affordable to run them. They also asked if reducing the block size to 0.5/0.7/0.9MB would have a similar effect. An argument has been made that increasing the block size would decrease the security of the network, but it is unclear if the inverse is true. The discussion raises questions about the relationship between block size and the number of full nodes on the network.</summary>
