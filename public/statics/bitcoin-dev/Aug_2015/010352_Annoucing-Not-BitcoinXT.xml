    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of hostility in the Bitcoin community and the possibility of "enemies" waiting for it to collapse. The author suggests that assuming the best intentions of others can lead to finding truth and avoid driving them away. He also mentions that the current Core developers have shown no hostility. However, he believes that those who are threatened by Bitcoin might have hired highly skilled psychological warfare agents to assault decentralization enthusiasts. The author advises against identifying individuals who are being hostile and suggests letting others recognize it on their own. In addition, the email thread touches on the issue of block size, with one member suggesting that the PR battle is not the same as a discussion on technical merits. The member claims that resistance to bigger blocks is actually much more towards untested hardforking mechanisms and serious security concerns. Ultimately, the email thread provides insights into the complexities of the Bitcoin community and highlights the importance of civility and understanding in resolving issues.</summary>
