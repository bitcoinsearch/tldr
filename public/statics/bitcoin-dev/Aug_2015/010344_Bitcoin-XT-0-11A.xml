    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community, Matt, responded to a thread on the mailing list discussing a potential scenario in which miners could intentionally harm confidence in Bitcoin Core. The conversation was sparked by a suggestion that involved spoiling ballots and encouraging miners to vote for the Bitcoin XT fork. Matt argued that this approach would not be necessary for Bitcoin Core to lose confidence and that it could occur if over 25% of the hash power supported the XT fork. In this scenario, a hard fork target of 75% is reached, but over 25% of the hash power did not allow the hard fork, and the hard fork is essentially a reverse soft fork. The miners who voted for the fork would be constantly generating blocks that are soft-forked-out by the &gt;25% and non-supporting miners. Matt claims to have pointed this out to the Bitcoin XT team weeks earlier, but it apparently did not sway their decision.</summary>
