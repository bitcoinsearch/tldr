    <summary>In an email conversation, Hector Chu proposed a prediction market in block-size that would be open to everyone. However, it was noted that the market seems complex to operate and keep secure in a decentralized way. Currently, there are experimental projects using blockchain ideas to figure out how to do this securely, but it is still early days for those projects. There is no particular reason to believe that it should result in a secure parameter set. It was also questioned whether creating such a market would be an incremental security improvement or just convert a complex security problem into an even more complicated one.</summary>
