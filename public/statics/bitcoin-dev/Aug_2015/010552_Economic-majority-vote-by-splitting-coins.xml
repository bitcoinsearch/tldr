    <summary>In an email conversation, odinn expresses his skepticism that most users would be able to utilize a proposal involving a BIP and soft fork. The proposal assumes that many wallets would support or recognize encumbered coins, even if not all of them do. Users would still be able to move their coins around, but only those trading between XT and Core would need wallets that support it. By consolidating BTC-Core and BTC-XT into a single output, the user can convert it back to a normal output. The purpose of this proposal is to offer a sneak preview and show which choice will give the highest BTC value.</summary>
