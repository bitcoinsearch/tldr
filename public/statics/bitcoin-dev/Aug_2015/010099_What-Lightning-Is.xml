    <summary>In this message, Odinn responds to Pieter Wuille's comment about the block size limit change proposal. He clarifies that his proposal is in favor of Cameron Garnham's dynamic softfork proposal, which can be tested out while making preparations for moving forward with Garzik's BIP 100. Odinn quotes his proposal and notes that it was unfair to quote only a part of it. Pieter agrees to keep the thread about Lightning. The message includes links to Odinn's website and Keybase profile.</summary>
