    <summary>The email thread discusses the recent controversy surrounding the blocksize increase of Bitcoin. The author mentions that he has implemented application-level filters to prioritize posts from certain people. He is not in favor nor against the blocksize increase as he does not have enough information to make a definitive decision on the topic. The author believes that the Schism hardfork may not kill Bitcoin but it will create two different coins and "there will be a winner and everybody will just move there" is incredibly uninformative. The author also points out that Bitcoin's value cannot be decreased or killed by two people forking the software and submitting a consensus rule to a vote. Having a software fork and consensus rule submitted to vote actually proves how open Bitcoin is, and how there is a lack of control over it from all parties. Regardless of what happens, if XT will reach the threshold or not, Bitcoin will go on just because it has some unique advantages and has no competitor from some points of view.</summary>
