    <summary>The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) has chosen the Bitcoin-Qt client v0.11.0 for its 2015 survey to measure wallet privacy. Volunteers have performed functional tests, but several features are not easily discernible by non-developers. Therefore, the OBPP is seeking developersâ€™ help and has drawn up a list of questions about how different wallets handle various aspects related to transaction formatting, mixing, donations, balance queries and broadcasting, network privacy, physical access, custodianship, telemetry data, and source code and building.Developers have until August 13 to return their surveys to ensure the score for their application is as accurate as possible. In the email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Kristov Atlas responds to Wei's questions related to the privacy features of the Bitcoin-Qt wallet application. The conversation covers topics such as transaction ordering, BIP implementation, balance queries, network privacy, password protection, and telemetry data. Overall, the discussion provides satisfactory answers to the questions posed.Kristov Atlas provides answers related to Bitcoin-Qt's transaction formatting, mixing, donations, balance queries and TX broadcasting, network privacy, physical access, custodianship, telemetry data, and source code and building. He explains how Bitcoin-Qt handles non-mixing transactions, the use of algorithms for ordering inputs and outputs in a transaction, and the implementation of BIP 62. The responses address the ability to compile the application using a deterministic build system. Kristov mentions cryptographic randomization of transaction ordering as one notable feature that provides the greatest possible privacy, with the BIP 69 recommendation being equally private if universally used. The joinmarket module can be used with Bitcoin Core to include coinjoins. Currently, there are no decentralized mixing tools available that do not harm the user's privacy. Bitcoin Core does not implement anti-features like donations and always has the highest possible FP rate. To obtain balance information, the software makes remote queries, but these can be directed to use Tor for all communications before starting. All network connections are independent via Tor by default. Separate "identities" require separate wallets. Reliable deletion of private data is not very feasible on current hardware/OSes, so users are advised to use OS-level encryption to protect their privacy locally. The application does not perform any external lookup related to identifying transaction senders or recipients. The application connects to known p2p full nodes to bootstrap the connection to the Bitcoin p2p network. Users are recommended to run Tor, which should prevent identifiable traffic except for timing/volume analysis. The application allows users to encrypt the wallet file with a password, preventing decryption of private keys until the password is entered. Each wallet file can have its own single password protecting spending, and there is no custodianship. There is no obvious telemetry data being sent, and the application supports a deterministic build process that is actively audited by multiple parties who post cryptographic signatures of their duplicated builds.</summary>
