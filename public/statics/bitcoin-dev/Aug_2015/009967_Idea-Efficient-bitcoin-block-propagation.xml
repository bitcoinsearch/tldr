    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner asked for up-to-date documentation about TheBlueMatt relay network and the block compression it is currently performing. He specifically requested this information apart from the source code. Lerner also inquired if TheBlueMatt relay network relayed the invalid post-softfork block, 0000000000000000009cc829aa25b40b2cd4eb83dd498c12ad0d26d90c439d99. If so, he asked if there was reason to believe that by doing so, it contributed to the growth of the 2015-07-04 fork. Additionally, he asked if the relay network would validate block version numbers in the future.</summary>
