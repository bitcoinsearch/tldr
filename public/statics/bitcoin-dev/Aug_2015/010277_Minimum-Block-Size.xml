    <summary>Levin Keller started a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the possibility of implementing a minimum block size. He asked if anyone was in favor of a minimum block size of 2 MB and expressed his own support for a lower limit. The conversation focused on the fact that traffic levels may not always produce a minimum size block and that miners could collude to produce a lowered maximum block size, which would essentially create a sort of minimum maximum.</summary>
