    <summary>Nicolas Dorier created a website where users can approve or disapprove of various Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and leave comments. The website requires users to fill the chart by themselves with a signed PGP message and allows HTML so users can link their posts. Dorier hopes that important developers, big miners, or other proposals that he missed can be added to the website. However, one user expressed concern that this approach could lead to premature judgments before proper analysis and options are laid out, potentially negating future work on BIPs that are still in development or have yet to be proposed.</summary>
