    <summary>The email thread discusses the topic of centralized discussion forums, namely /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org. The rules set by a centralized authority have helped facilitate a large userbase frequented by many relevant experts, but people are unhappy with the moderation happening on these forums. The switching cost for online discussion forums is low and people can create competing forums without moderation or "censorship". David Vorick invites people to post links to bitcoin discussion forums where the moderation authority is different. A recently popular subreddit mentioned is /r/bitcoin_uncensored. Consensus critical changes and Bitcoin Core development are independent from these forums.</summary>
