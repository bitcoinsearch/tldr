    <summary>There is a consensus among core developers that block size should be raised, but questions remain about how, when, how much, and how fast. The objective of a proposed experimental hardfork is to show that consensus for a Bitcoin hardfork is possible, collect data for future hardforks, and slightly relieve the pressure of full blocks without adverse effects on network performance. The proposal recommends an increase in block size to 1.5MB, to be implemented with the backup plan if no other consensus is reached by February 1, 2016. The backup plan would activate 30 days after 80% miner approval but not before June 1, 2016. The proposal acknowledges that the backup plan is not a final solution and aims to find a better solution by December 31, 2017, with 1.5 years of data and further debate. If the community agrees, the plan will be announced on bitcoin.org and coding of the patch will begin immediately.</summary>
