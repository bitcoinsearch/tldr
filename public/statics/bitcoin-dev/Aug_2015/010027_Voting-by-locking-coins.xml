    <summary>There has been a suggestion to lock coins until a certain date for casting votes on an issue. This proposal involves using CLTV to lock coins until the vote closes, which could be three months from now. To increase the weight of one's vote, more coins can be locked, and the choice can be written in the scriptPubKey or an OP_RETURN data output. The nodes would tally up the coin values for the different vote options, and the choice with the highest total would be the winner. While this idea may not solve the block size issue, it could potentially be used to make choices like keeping the block size the same, reducing it by 10%, or increasing it by 10%. The vote could be a rolling one, where the next vote for the following three months begins once the present vote is decided.</summary>
