    <summary>Lightning technology is not a viable option as it requires users to become speculators and merchants and payment hubs will be at the mercy of Bitcoin prices, while their funds remain locked up in payment channels.

This approach can enable users to earn fees by having their wallets participate in channel rebalancing, while exchanges can benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.</summary>
