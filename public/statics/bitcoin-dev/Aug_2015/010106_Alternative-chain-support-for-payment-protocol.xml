    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, it was pointed out that not all genesis blocks are unique, with Litecoin and Feathercoin sharing the same one. However, this is considered a fatal design flaw in Feathercoin, and is irrelevant to Bitcoin. The topic then shifted towards Regtest, which is a testchain similar to testnet2 and testnet3. Testchains allow for the support of multiple chains using CChainParams. It was clarified that BIPs are specifically for Bitcoin improvements, and anything that only improves altcoins is outside the scope of a BIP. However, it was suggested that an extension allowing payment directly on the sidechain could address the need for payments made of bitcoins on a sidechain. This would avoid the need to round-trip it, and could potentially kill two birds with one stone. For payment protocol testchains, sidechains and altcoins are all quite similar, but it is fine to just focus on testchains if sidechains and altcoins are out of scope.</summary>
