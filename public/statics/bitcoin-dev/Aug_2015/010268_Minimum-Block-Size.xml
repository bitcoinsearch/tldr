    <summary>Levin, a member of a group discussing the "max block size" debate in the context of cryptocurrency, has raised the question of whether anyone is in favor of a minimum block size. He suggests a limit of 2 MB and expresses interest in exchanging ideas on the topic. Levin himself is currently giving the idea of a lower limit considerable thought. The message was posted to the group for discussion.</summary>
