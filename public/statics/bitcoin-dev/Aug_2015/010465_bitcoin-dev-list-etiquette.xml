    <summary>In an email exchange between Bitcoin developers on August 19, 2015, Eric Lombrozo expressed that the biggest challenge facing Bitcoin at the time was not technical but political. He believed that until the political issues were resolved, even technical discussions would be purely philosophical and little progress could be made on consensus. Alex Morcos had previously attempted to organize a message for all core devs to sign onto, regarding the hard fork with respect to block size. However, he failed to finish organizing it and instead shared his own thoughts on the matter. Morcos stated that the volume of emails and proportion of discussion that was more philosophical than technical had rendered the list almost unusable for its primary purpose of technical discussion related to Bitcoin development. To return to a higher signal-to-noise ratio, Morcos urged individuals to consider the degree to which any email they send is related to technical development before sending it and how many emails they are sending regarding the same topic. Additionally, he stated that the list is not appropriate for an endless back-and-forth debate on the philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin and that such a debate should be taken to another forum for discussion.</summary>
