    <summary>The Bitcoin community is facing a problem of decreasing decentralization as the number of full nodes decreases. Full nodes bear the cost of validating, relaying, and storing the blockchain but gain nothing financially from it. However, they play an important role in validating transactions and keeping miner dishonesty in check. The lack of independent full nodes makes it possible for mining pools to collude and control the protocol.The issue with decentralization is compounded by the increasing number of people using Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients, which will further reduce the number of full nodes even without a block size increase. Many in the technical community are against drastic block size increases as it would worsen the problem of decentralization. Existing hardware is capable of validating/processing blocks larger than the current limit, but the core issue is that of incentive.Before the concept of lightning, there did not seem to be any trustless way of feasibly paying small micropayments to full nodes for their services. With payment channels and lightning, a node could advertise its rates to SPV nodes upon connection, and the SPV could either agree or look for another node with lower fees. Fees would be trivial, and competition would drive down fees close to the cost of running a full node.In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luv Khemani proposed incentivizing full nodes through payment channels and lightning. A node could advertise its rates to an SPV node upon connection, and the SPV could either agree or look for another node with lower fees. Fees are likely to be trivial (few satoshis per request) as competition will drive down fees close to the cost of running a full node. This should spur an increase in the number of full nodes, thus increasing decentralization of the network.Without independent full nodes, it would be possible for 3-4 of the biggest mining pools to collude and do whatever they wanted with the protocol. Therefore, incentivizing full nodes through payment channels and lightning could help increase their numbers, thus decentralizing the network. The burden on existing full nodes will increase with more people using SPVs, which will further reduce the number of full nodes.</summary>
