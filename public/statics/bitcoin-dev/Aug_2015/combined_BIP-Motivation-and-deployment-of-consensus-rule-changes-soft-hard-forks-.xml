    <summary>The author of the context is expressing concerns about using Github for high-level discussions of a draft BIP. Instead, they have posted their thoughts on the proposal structure and wording. The author suggests slimming down and simplifying the proposal's structure and history lessons. Moreover, the author inquires whether BIP-001 was followed in regard to spelling checking and editor approval. They also question what kind of proposal this is: Informational, Process or Standards track. The author believes that it should be Standards Track and proposes that the upgrade path be included as a patch into core, serving as a module that hard forks can use in the future. Alternatively, they suggest splitting up the BIP into a Standards track and a separate Informational BIP.</summary>
