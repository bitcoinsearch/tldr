    <title>Revisiting NODE_BLOOM: Proposed BIP</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on Github, Matt Corallo stated that the pull request and BIP do not intend to phase out bloom filtering support in the protocol. If they did so it would break SPV clients' ability to operate on the P2P network as bloom filters are used by them to double-check centralized servers. The pull/BIP suggests phasing out REQUIRED bloom filtering support in the protocol to fix the peer selection of SPV clients in the face of btcd with some flags/many patched versions of Core/etc peers, providing a remedy for a potential DoS attack. On bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding wrote that someone is attacking Mike Hearn's Bitcoin fork and therefore it is the perfect time to write a BIP and author changes that begin the process of dropping support for the most broadly successful class of wallets, which is enabled by Mike Hearn's SPV client library. Peter Todd added that XT nodes are undergoing repeated Bloom filter requests to soak up disk IO bandwidth during this attack.</summary>
