    <summary>A discussion is taking place among developers regarding a proposed change to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. The proposal involves changing how transactions are selected in the mempool and would prioritize transactions with shorter relative locks, which have a higher priority. While some developers are indifferent, others express concern over technical debt. Joseph Poon suggests that the information should be noted for those who wish to write code for mempool transaction selection, regardless of their opinion on the matter.</summary>
