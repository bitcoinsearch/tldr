    <summary>Yifu Guo, a developer who has worked in the bitcoin space, shared his opinion on implementing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) measures within the bitcoin protocol. He argued that legal problems are not technical problems, and it should not be directly implemented on the protocol level. Instead, he believes that companies and individuals should answer questions when necessary, for example, if stolen bitcoins get sent to a company's payment address. While these are not technical problems, they will need answers eventually. Yifu Guo also provided a link to coinvalidation.com, which is currently shelved due to lack of legal and regulatory framework.</summary>
