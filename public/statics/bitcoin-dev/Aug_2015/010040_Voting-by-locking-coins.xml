    <summary>On August 8th, 2015 Hector Chu sent a message to clarify a point in John Dillon's proposal. Chu wanted to know if the coins would be locked up or still freely spendable post-vote. In response, Peter explained that John Dillon's proposal is essentially to have the economic majority give miners permission to raise the blocksize and making the vote costly would go against the design intent of accurately capturing the broadest possible economic consensus.</summary>
