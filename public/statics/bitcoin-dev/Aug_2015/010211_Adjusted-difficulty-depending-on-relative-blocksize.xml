    <summary>Jakob Rönnbäck, a non-programmer and bitcoin enthusiast, posted a question on the Bitcoin Development mailing list in August 2015. He suggested adjusting the difficulty of individual blocks based on their size relative to the average block size of the previous period. For example, if a miner created a block that was half the size of the average block size for the previous period, the difficulty of mining that block would be twice the normal level. This would encourage miners to create blocks as close to 1MB as possible, which was the limit at the time. However, Jakob believed that this approach would help maximize fees when the block size limit was raised. The idea generated discussion on the mailing list, but it is unclear whether anyone implemented it.</summary>
