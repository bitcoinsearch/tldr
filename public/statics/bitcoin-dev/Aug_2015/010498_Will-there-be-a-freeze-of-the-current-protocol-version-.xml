    <summary>BitPay has expressed its support for BIP 101, paving the way for a potential increase in the block size limit. The future of Bitcoin is uncertain, but research on the current protocol version is deemed important. While XT was created out of frustration regarding the slow and uncertain pace of research, it is hoped that the current block chain will continue to survive. However, if XT prevails or core is changed within the terms of BIP 101, there are concerns about whether there will be enough people to continue with the old protocol version. It is unclear if developers will fork a Bitcoin client for supporting the old nodes with security updates, or if compatibility mode in XT will allow it to behave like an old Bitcoin node. The fate of smaller projects such as picocoin is also up in the air.</summary>
