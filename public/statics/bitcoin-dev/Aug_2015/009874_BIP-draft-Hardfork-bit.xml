    <summary>A proposal for a "hardfork bit" has been put on Github by jl2012. The specification of the coinbase message has been removed, requiring instead that a flag block must not be shared by multiple hardfork proposals. It is unclear whether the proposal should be classified as a Standard, Informational or Process BIP and there is also uncertainty over what it should be called. Michael Ruddy has praised the "hardfork bit" proposal, saying that it addresses concerns faced by users of a fork where a small/near/fluctuating majority of mining power is supported. He believes that it provides a fallback mechanism for economic actors who can make a decision and say "we're doing this". Finally, Ruddy has asked whether the latest version of the proposal is available on Github or elsewhere for easier collaboration.</summary>
