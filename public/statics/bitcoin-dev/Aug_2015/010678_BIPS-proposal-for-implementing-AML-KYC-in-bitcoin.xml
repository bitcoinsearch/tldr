    <summary>The email begins with a statement that money is attached to life, not liberty. The author states that they strongly disagree with this belief but do not think the dev mailing list is the appropriate forum for philosophical discussions. They also express a hope that proposals such as the one mentioned in the email never gain traction in the community of Bitcoin. The author believes that these ideas are the opposite of what the experiment stands for. They suggest having the discussion over a beer and hookah instead of taking up more space on the mailing list. The email ends with an apology for commenting and a promise to return to lurking and learning.</summary>
