    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rune K. Svendsen explained that Lightning raises the value of transactions on the blockchain by allowing Lightning nodes to collect fees and settle on the blockchain with a larger fee attached. This ensures that their transaction gets into the blockchain quickly, and they can afford to pay this fee because they've made much more on the Lightning transactions they've routed. However, Thomas Zander disagreed with this argument, saying that companies wouldn't give away profits for no reason, and that the speed of settlement doesn't matter if the channel has been open for a month.</summary>
