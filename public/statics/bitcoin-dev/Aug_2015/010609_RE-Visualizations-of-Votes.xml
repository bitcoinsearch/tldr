    <summary>The author of the post expresses their opinion that they would prefer to see a vote by owners/holders of bitcoin rather than miners only, as they believe that bitcoin development is an oligarchy if only miners with 10%+ hashrate are allowed to vote. A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list shared a tracking page for the 'block votes', which currently includes the 8MB vote and XT, as well as the /BV\d+/ vote for generic size. Another member of the mailing list expressed interest in seeing pie graphs of what % are voting for various proposals based on what's published in blocks. However, there is no standard way for miners to vote informally BIP they support. The author also provides links to their website and Keybase profile.</summary>
