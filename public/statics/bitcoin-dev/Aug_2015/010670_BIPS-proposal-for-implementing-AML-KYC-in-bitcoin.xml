    <summary>In an email exchange between Prabhat Kumar Singh and Gavin Andresen, Singh proposed a plan for the Bitcoin Foundation to act as a "fair play party and enforcement body to control the misuse of vast financial powers which bitcoin has." However, Andresen strongly opposed the idea, stating that any proposal that puts the Foundation in a position of centralized authority is unacceptable. He argued that the idea that a central organization can be trusted to keep secrets secure is fundamentally wrong, citing recent failures by government and commercial organizations to do so. Additionally, he pointed out that decentralization is a bedrock principle of Bitcoin.</summary>
