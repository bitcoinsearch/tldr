    <summary>Ahmed Zsales, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed a long-term solution to replace mining rewards and transaction fees. The proposal, called BIP 104, is currently in a discussion draft and has been updated in response to public and private comments and feedback. The updates include specific clarifications on replacing the Coinbase subsidy and supplementing transaction fees, clarification on block chain overhead, and the ability to create global, national, and regional Bitcoin Price Indices for popular baskets of goods transacted with Bitcoin. Additionally, references to price speculation have been removed, preferences for deployment dates of January 2017 or January 2018 have been added, and the proposal is moving towards BIP format after a discussion and evaluation period. Technical content will increase in due course and discussion content will be removed. Feedback is welcome.</summary>
