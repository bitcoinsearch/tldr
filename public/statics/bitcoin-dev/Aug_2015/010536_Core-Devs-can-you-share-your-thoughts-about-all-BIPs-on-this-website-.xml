    <summary>The goal of the website proposed by Nicolas Dorier is not to make decisions, but rather to provide a way for the community to see the pros and cons of various proposals in one place. Users can fill out their opinions on whether they would "approve" or "veto" a proposal after analyzing it, and provide links to discussions that led them to their conclusion. Users can also edit their position as they progress through their analysis and new BIPs become available. Gregory Maxwell expressed concern about prematurely laying down "battle lines" before all options and insights are presented, which could potentially harm future decision making.</summary>
