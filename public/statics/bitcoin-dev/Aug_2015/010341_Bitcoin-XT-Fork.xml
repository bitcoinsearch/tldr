    <summary>Theo Chino, a Bitcoin activist, has proposed starting a church to protect the Bitcoin network from the overzealous reach of politicians. He suggests that the church could argue that Bitcoin is a belief system and would force the issue at a federal level under the separation of Church and State. Chino is waiting for his license to be denied in New York State so he can appeal it and educate elected officials on Bitcoin. He is also requesting Satoshi's help with original coins to fund the church. Meanwhile, Btc Drak shared his technical analysis of the Satoshi email which was used to announce Bitcoin in 2008. The email originated from an authentic source, but it is unclear if the webmail service was hacked or commandeered.</summary>
