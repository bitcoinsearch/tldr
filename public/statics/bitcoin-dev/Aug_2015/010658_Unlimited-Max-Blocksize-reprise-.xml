    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, the risks of a contentious/schism hardfork were discussed. A document was shared to improve understanding of these risks. The discussion also included an analysis by Peter_R on the existence of fee markets with uncapped max blocksizes. It was mentioned that critiques made towards his work were not definitive and the discussion stopped. Simulations were referred to which showed that larger miners have advantages over smaller ones, however, it was argued that this is only due to coinbase subsidization. It was suggested that the moment block rewards become comparable to block TX fees, large miners would lose the incentive to mine an un full block which would even out the playing field. It was noted that large blocksizes as proposed by BIP100-101 hope to stimulate the increase of TX fees by augmenting the network's capacity.</summary>
