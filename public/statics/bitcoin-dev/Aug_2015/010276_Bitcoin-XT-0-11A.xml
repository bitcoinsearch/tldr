    <title>Bitcoin XT 0.11A</title>

    <summary>The email exchange is regarding the possibility of setting up a fork of Bitcoin XT to allow people to easily make transactions only on the XT fork. The person who wrote this email suggests spamming the 8mb blocks with 1 Satoshi outputs to the brainwallet 'BitcoinXT', which can be let in BitcoinXT, not Bitcoin. Another suggestion was to let the forked XT client include an unspent dust output with any transaction and create 100 dust outputs for other people to use in the same transaction. This transaction will only be possible to confirm with Bitcoin XT, leaving Bitcoin coins untouched. The writer of the email seems to like this approach as it is ironic that spam is more cheaply done with larger blocks. There is also a quick political note attached referring to abstentionism and how hard forks are not democratic processes, thus frustrating a false-democratic process is legitimate.</summary>
