    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list saw a conversation around the concept of decentralization, with Mike Hearn and Justus Ranvier agreeing that its definition is often misunderstood. Monarch argued that without decentralization as an ultimate goal, Bitcoin should be dismantled. However, Ranvier countered this argument by stating that Monarch failed to understand the value of proof of work and the features that differentiate good money from poor money. He also criticized the use of the word "decentralization" as a distraction tactic. Another participant expressed concerns over the centralization of mining and the accumulation of hardware by big companies, which poses a threat to the long-term decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity and importance of decentralization in the world of cryptocurrency.</summary>
