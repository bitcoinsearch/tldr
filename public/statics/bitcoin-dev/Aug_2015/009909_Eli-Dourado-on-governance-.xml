    <summary>On August 4th, 2015, Gavin Andresen shared his thoughts on using a prediction market to deal with tough tradeoffs. He referenced the preliminary results of the Block Size Debate website and found them to be roughly correct. However, he also noted that the scicast prediction market was shut down at the time. Andresen went on to share some numbers related to network hash rate based on block size and replace-by-fee factors. He found these numbers to be completely implausible, representing around 2.9-3.6 doublings of the current hashrate.</summary>
