    <summary>The discussion in this context is about the benefits of Bitcoin as a censorship-resistant currency. They discuss how Bitcoin will not be repressed if it has the capability to go underground. The threat of going underground may keep it from being repressed in the first place. However, there are counter-arguments that countries or states that fail to legally get the bandwidth to do mining are not an indicator for the success of Bitcoin. The system as a whole will work just fine for people in totalitarian regimes as long as 100% of the world doesn't reach that point. The discussion also touches on block size and scaling solutions for Bitcoin. It is suggested that Lightning and sidechains should be used along with bigger blocks because no single solution is the answer. They argue that Bitcoin needs a combination of multiple solutions to scale properly.</summary>
