    <summary>Several proposals have been put forth to fix the issue of nLockTime and time-based locks creating negative incentives for miners. One suggestion was timestamping, which could solve the problem by allowing all users to set their clocks to what the majority of hashing power thinks nTime is. However, this created a new problem of an inflation attack and traded off one risk for another more existential one.In response to this problem, a proposed solution to the problem with minimal change to the current softfork logic has been suggested. The solution still allows all features described in sipa's Version bits BIP. The proposal for BIP XX titled "Median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations" has been drawn up by Thomas Kerin and Mark Friedenbach. This proposal redefines the semantics used in determining a time-locked transaction's eligibility for inclusion in a block.At present, transactions are excluded from inclusion in a block if the present time or block height is less than or equal to that specified in the locktime. This has the unfortunate outcome of creating a perverse incentive for miners to lie about the time of their blocks in order to collect more fees by including transactions that have not yet matured. This proposal seeks to ensure reliable behaviour in locktime calculations as required by BIP65, BIP68, and BIPXX (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY).Lock-time constraints are checked by the consensus method IsFinalTx() or LockTime() under BIP68. These methods take the block time as one parameter. Additionally, a pull request has been submitted for BIP 113, with a link to the discussion surrounding it. The discussion took place in 2013 in the #bitcoin-wizards chat, where concerns were raised about miners manipulating nLockTime with time-based locks. This could create incentives for miners to mine blocks at the limit of the two-hour window and allow them to include high-fee nLockTimes in the blocks they create. Several solutions were proposed to fix this issue.The email thread discusses a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for nVersion bits, with the author being Thomas Kerin and Mark Friedenbach for designing and authoring the reference implementation. However, Peter Todd clarifies that Gregory Maxwell came up with the idea during a discussion about incentives related to nTime on #bitcoin-dev or #bitcoin-wizards. In July 2013, a discussion took place in the #bitcoin-wizards channel regarding the issue of nLockTime and time-based locks creating negative incentives for miners. Several proposals were put forth, including using the last block's ntime instead of the current one or enforcing nLockTime to require data on what block a transaction was created at and enforcing the 10 min per block rule. One suggestion was timestamping, which could solve the problem by allowing all users to set their clocks to what the majority of hashing power thinks nTime is.Regarding the deployment of the nVersion bits proposal, it uses up a version bit unnecessarily and will hard-fork blocks with nVersion=0b001...000 off the network. Alternative solutions were proposed, including a stateless nVersion bits w/ time-expiration proposal and implementing the original stateful nVersion bits proposal. The former only leads to a hard-fork if a soft-fork has been rejected by the time the upgrade deadline is reached, while the latter is higher risk due to the extra complexity of tracking soft-fork state.In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list conversation, developers discussed the trade-offs between two options for setting nLockTime in transactions. The first option is minimum time, which involves more hashing power and is easier for users to understand why the transaction is not getting mined. The second option is adding a constant offset, which sidesteps the problem but creates an inflation attack. The conclusion seemed to be that minimum time is probably the best option if hash power is well distributed.In conclusion, it is recommended that this soft-fork deployment trigger include other related proposals for improving Bitcoin's lock-time capabilities, such as BIP65, BIP68 and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. A pull request has been submitted for BIP 113, which aims to fix the issue of miners manipulating nLockTime with time-based locks. The discussion surrounding this took place in 2013 and involved several proposed solutions such as using timestamping or delaying relaying the block to increase the risk of it being stale. Ultimately, timestamping was seen as the best solution. BIP 113 was assigned number 113 and updated accordingly with credits given to Gregory Maxwell.</summary>
