    <summary>The Bitcoin community is divided over the issue of increasing block size, with some proposing a dynamic approach and others advocating for a more drastic increase. One group, led by Mike Hearn and known as Bitcoin XT, has released a new version of the cryptocurrency that includes a bigger blocks patch set. However, Eric Lombrozo, a developer on the opposing side, has expressed concerns over the way in which this change is being pushed, stating that it could lead to permanent ledger forks and alienate the entire user base. Lombrozo also notes that those who are against network consensus will be severely punished with complete loss of income. He suggests that a less contentious change should be attempted first to test deployability. Despite significant technical achievements in the past, the debate over block size continues, with some suggesting that the core developers are scared to death that the bitcoin network may change without their blessing. The longer this debate drags on, the more people agree with BIP 100 and Jeff Garzik because the core devs are already being influenced by outside forces and should not have complete control of the blocksize.</summary>
