    <summary>In an email conversation, Jorge Tim√≥n expressed interest in helping with the implementation of versionbits, stating it as the "most future-proof" solution. However, versionbits has not been implemented yet and the BIP is still under review. In the absence of versionbits, another IsSuperMajority() rollout has been indicated by Pieter, to be used as a deployment method until versionbits is ready. The focus should be on the proposed featureset rather than the deployment method, as moving forward, versionbits seems essential for rolling out multiple features in parallel without waiting for activation and enforcement each time.</summary>
