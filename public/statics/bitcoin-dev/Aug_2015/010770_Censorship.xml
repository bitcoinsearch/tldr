    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list named Zach G shared his idea of creating a decentralized forum. He claimed that it would be uncontrollable in raw form and exist on thousands of computers, so it could not be destroyed and not centrally hosted. Zach expects users to create external software to parse the data, so people can centralize as much or as little as they want in their sub-forums built on this system. There will be various leaders who utilize this program and organize quality forums, but fundamentally the raw de-centralized system cannot be controlled, so people posting to it will always have a venue to speak without being censored.Zander is also working on a similar project, AetheralResearch, but it's difficult to make it truly censorship-resistant in solving the theymos factor and spam/abuse/overloading as an attack. The centralization and censorship of the Bitcoin community is massively inhibiting the advance of Bitcoin and also the growth of the Bitcoin economy. The community needs a regular forum that is heavily moderated for spam/noise/insults, not just for opinions. Roger Ver controls bitcoin.com, which could be a nice forum if properly moderated, and we must have leadership to set up proper moderation.</summary>
