    <summary>In an email conversation between Hector Chu and Jorge Timón, the topic of mining centralization and the role of block size limits was discussed. Jorge argued that while a block size limit may not prevent miners from buying each other out in the future, it is still the only consensus tool to limit mining centralization. Hector disagreed, stating that simply repeating this claim does not necessarily make it true. He challenged Jorge to provide a counter-example of another consensus rule that limits mining centralization or to prove that this rule does not help with mining centralization at all. Hector also pointed out that if one denies that the block size limit serves to limit mining centralization pressures, advocating for keeping the limit in place seems inconsistent. He questioned what purpose the limit would then serve. Overall, the email exchange highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the role of block size limits in addressing issues of mining centralization in cryptocurrencies.</summary>
