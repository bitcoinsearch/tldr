    <summary>The proposed hard fork for larger blocks in Bitcoin is causing concern among some individuals who believe it to be a significant risk. However, others do not see the upcoming hard fork as a major issue. The fear of losing to XT in an honest battle is also present, with some resorting to rigging the game instead of letting the best man win. Even the recent post by "Satoshi" has not been immune to this behavior. Additionally, a quote by theymos stating that if 90% of r/Bitcoin users find the policies intolerable, then they should leave has been compared to something a dictator would say. Despite the concerns and controversies surrounding the topic, it is difficult to control or manipulate discussions on the internet.</summary>
