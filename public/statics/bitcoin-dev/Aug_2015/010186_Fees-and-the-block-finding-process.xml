    <summary>In a forum discussion on August 12th, 2015, user Jorge Tim√≥n expressed concern about the need to solve Bitcoin's issues with growing backlogs, regardless of block size. Thomas Zander, another user in the discussion, agreed that there is a lot of work to be done in order to address the issue and stated that it likely won't be solved within the next 6-12 months. Zander argued that a bigger block size would give developers more time to address these problems.</summary>
