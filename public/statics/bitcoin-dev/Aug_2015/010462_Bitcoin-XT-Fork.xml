    <title>Bitcoin XT Fork</title>

    <summary>The writer suggests that the consensus code should be separated from other developments within Bitcoin, and be held to a different set of commit policies. While other projects such as XT can continue to evolve, it is important that the consensus code is not subject to the same policies. Furthermore, there needs to be clear communication to laypeople about the difference between a source code fork and a blockchain fork, something that opponents of XT have struggled with so far. The aim is to avoid confusion among users and prevent them from switching to alternative currencies like XTBTC.</summary>
