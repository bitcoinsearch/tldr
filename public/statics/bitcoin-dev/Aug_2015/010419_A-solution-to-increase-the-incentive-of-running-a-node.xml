    <summary>In an email thread between Jameson Lopp and Hector Chu, the topic of incentivizing full node operators was discussed. Lopp expressed that a technical solution would need to be found in order for a node operator to prove they are honest and hosting the entire blockchain before any monetary incentivization proposal could move forward. Chu countered by stating that validation of transactions is proof enough and having the entire blockchain is not necessary, but it would be a plus. Additionally, Chu noted that if operating as an SPV node, it can check transactions by querying other nodes. The discussion then shifted to the potential increase in data size for each transaction, which could create more contention for block space.</summary>
