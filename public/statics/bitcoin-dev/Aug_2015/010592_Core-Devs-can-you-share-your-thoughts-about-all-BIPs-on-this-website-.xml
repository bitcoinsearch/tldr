    <summary>The debate on bitcoin block size increase continues with a recent tweet from Antpool stating that they support increasing the block size and would be prepared to switch to XT if a majority had switched. However, many people are supportive of increasing the block size but have spent much time calling attention to the many problems of XT. Jihan Wu's statement has raised concerns about the influence of the Chinese state on Chinese mining and how it might cause Chinese miners to adopt XT due to state pressure. This is important given Hearn's move to support blacklisting and the disabling of Tor in XT. It is recommended that people do not use XT and work to develop consensus on an alternative proposal that increases block size such as BIP 100. People should also attend conferences such as the upcoming one in Montreal and agree on something other than XT. It is important to visualize different proposals and votes on them so that people can see what is happening. Additionally, end users can deal with this situation by contributing to the discussion at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1157545.msg12189776.</summary>
