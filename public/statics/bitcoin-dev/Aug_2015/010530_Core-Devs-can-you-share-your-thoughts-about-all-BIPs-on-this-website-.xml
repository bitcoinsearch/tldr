    <summary>Nicolas Dorier created a website which displays a chart of approvals for various Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). The site allows individuals to fill in whether they approve or not and leave comments. Btc Drak offered suggestions of other developers and technical people that should be added, including Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Jorge Timons, Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld, Charlie Lee, and Mike Hearn. He also recommended separating out the Technical Opinion column to improve readability. Nicolas Dorier agreed to add these individuals and asked for their PGP public keys.</summary>
