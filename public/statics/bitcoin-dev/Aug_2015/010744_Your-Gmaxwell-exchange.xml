    <summary>In this email conversation, Peter R accuses Greg of forwarding their private email conversation without permission. Peter also points out significant errors in Greg's work which undermines it completely. Greg had promised to make certain corrective actions, but according to Peter he has not yet taken them even after a month. This led to another author extending Greg's work without being aware of the errors pointed out by Peter and might require significant revisions. Peter decided to forward their complete discussion to the other author. Peter apologizes if he breached Greg's confidence but argues that Greg was already obligated to share at least the substance of the discussion with the other author for intellectual progress. Peter believes his time would be better spent implementing improved relaying described rather than continue an academic debate over the inconsequential difference between epsilon and zero.</summary>
