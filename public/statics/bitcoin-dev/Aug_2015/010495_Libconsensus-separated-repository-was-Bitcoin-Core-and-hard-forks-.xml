    <summary>The risk of disagreement increases with every re-implementation, re-factoring and even copy-paste. However, these actions also provide the opportunity to improve in terms of software engineering. A message from Jorge Tim√≥n highlights the importance of extracting consensus rules from Bitcoin Core to avoid the need for future re-implementations. The author aims to maintain compatibility with Bitcoin while creating and serving other block chains with different rules, without relying on outdated tools and spaghetti code. Bits of Proof uses scala, java, c++, and is eager to integrate secp256k1 (c) as part of consensus. These choices were made based on the strengths of each piece.</summary>
