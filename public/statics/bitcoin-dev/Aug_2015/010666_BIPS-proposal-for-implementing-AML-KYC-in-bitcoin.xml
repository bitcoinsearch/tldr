    <summary>A user named Prabhat suggested building something to save the decentralized currency ecosystem. He urged people to offer suggestions and scrap his idea if necessary but emphasized that it was essential to realize the dream of decentralized currency. He mentioned that other coins and protocols might implement something, but egoists would always meet the ashes. In response, the speaker expressed excitement and requested Prabhat to code it up and submit a pull request on Github. The speaker also advised Prabhat not to expect anyone else to do it for him.</summary>
