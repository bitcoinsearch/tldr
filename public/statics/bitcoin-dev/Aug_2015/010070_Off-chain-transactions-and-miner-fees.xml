    <summary>The discussion in this mailing list centers around the argument that rewarding miners with transaction fees is necessary to ensure network security. However, off-chain transactions such as the Lightning Network can potentially extract fees that would otherwise go to miners if the transactions were on-chain. This raises the question of whether promoting an environment where many transactions are off-chain could be contradictory or even harmful to the goal of securing the network.Despite recent discussions on the topic, this potential conflict has yet to be addressed. It is important to consider the implications of off-chain transactions and their impact on miner rewards and network security.</summary>
