    <summary>The email exchange shared here discusses the need for a global consensus network. The writer argues that constraining Bitcoin's capacity below the limits of technology will push users to find other solutions, such as BitcoinXT or others. Lightning/hub and spoke do not meet requirements for users wishing to participate in global consensus networks because all participating nodes are not aware of all transactions. The discussion also touches on the need to increase the consensus block size for reasons other than avoiding minimum market fees from rising. The writer requests direct and succinct answers to questions without getting links to something already read in response.</summary>
