    <summary>In an email conversation on bitcoin-dev, Jorge Tim√≥n raises concerns about a potential indirect consequence of rising fees; a software problem independent of concrete block size that needs to be solved anyway. He argues that the issue is not rising fees, but rather the possibility of making air travel unusable if a new law is passed to prevent airlines from selling tickets cheaply and running themselves out of business. He suggests that it would be unwise to go all-in on a solution that doesn't exist yet, which may or may not arrive in time, and may or may not do the job that is needed. Instead, he proposes using the solution already available to get by in the short term. In response, Geir H. Hansen notes that mining pools had to be coaxed into increasing their block size and that many don't even pay out transaction fee income to their miners.</summary>
