    <summary>On August 6, 2015, Tom Harding asked a question about the BlueMatt relay network on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. He wanted to know if there was any updated documentation about the relay network and what kind of block compression it was currently doing. Another question he had was whether the relay network relayed BTC Nuggets block that was invalid post-softfork. The version check was only added hours after the initial fork, so it should have taken part in it. Tom also enquired whether by relaying BTC Nuggets block, the relay network contributed to the growth of the 2015-07-04 fork. It is unlikely as other miners were watching each other's stratum servers, so the relay network should not have had a significant effect. However, miners are already aggressively relaying around the network/between each other, so it is not a major concern.Lastly, Tom wanted to know whether the relay network will at least validate block version numbers in the future. The mailing list is a platform where people discuss technical matters related to Bitcoin development.</summary>
