    <summary>In August 2015, Jameson Lopp proposed that a technical solution needed to be developed to allow a node operator to prove to the rest of the network that they are running an honest full node that hosts the entire blockchain. He stated that no one had been successful in this endeavor and any proposal would need to be able to differentiate between a full node and a pseudonode. Lopp suggested checking out the PseudoNode project on GitHub.The validation of transactions is crucial in proving the honesty of a full node, as it requires access to past transaction history. While having the entire blockchain is not necessary, it would be beneficial.</summary>
