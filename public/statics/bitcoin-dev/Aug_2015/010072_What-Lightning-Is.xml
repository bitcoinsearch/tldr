    <summary>In this context, Gavin Andresen requests for someone to write a high-level description of the user experience of payment hubs or lightning network. He asks for an explanation of what communication happens underneath and what new pieces of infrastructure need to be built to make it work. To provide an example, he gives a use-case where a customer with eleven on-chain bitcoin wants to pay for a cup of tea at a lightning-enabled cash register using their lightning-enabled wallet on their iPhone. The scenario assumes that neither the customer nor the tea shop is technically sophisticated.</summary>
