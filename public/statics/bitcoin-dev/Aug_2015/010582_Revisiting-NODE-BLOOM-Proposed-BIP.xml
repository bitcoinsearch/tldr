    <summary>On August 20, 2015, Peter Todd posted on bitcoin-dev noting a decrease in the number of SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients on his high-speed nodes. He mentioned that he did not have historical logs to compare, but he estimated the drop to be from about 5-10% to around 1%. Another member of the group, who checked their own connection, found that they had 20.4% bitcoinj connections.</summary>
