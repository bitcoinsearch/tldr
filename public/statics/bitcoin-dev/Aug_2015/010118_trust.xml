    <summary>In this email thread, Jorge Tim√≥n and Adam were discussing how trust can be involved in different ways with Bitcoin. The argument was made that Bitcoin loses its functionality when you deviate from the trust-no-one path. However, Thomas Zander argued that risks can only be assessed fairly if people are less black/white in their thinking. He suggested that having various data centers around the world where software can be run can mitigate the risk of trusting data center operators. In addition, he provided examples of how Bitcoin could benefit the unbanked population, such as the M-Pesa example, and emphasized the need for larger blocks for these use cases.</summary>
