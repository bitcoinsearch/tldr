    <summary>The context of the conversation is a proposal regarding the maximum block size of Bitcoin, presented at http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php. The author requests that the conversation be kept specific to this topic and asks for any demerits to be pointed out. The proposal is laid out in algorithmic format: if more than 50% of a block's size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period is more than 90% MaxBlockSize, then double MaxBlockSize; if more than 90% of a block's size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period is less than 50% MaxBlockSize, then half MaxBlockSize; otherwise, keep the same MaxBlockSize. Two links are provided for further reading on the topic.</summary>
