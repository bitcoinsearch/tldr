    <summary>On August 8, 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev forum between Thomas Zander and Adam Back regarding on-chain and off-chain transactions. Zander had given an example of on-chain use case with a trusted middleman, to which Back had responded that it was essentially off-chain since a middle man has private keys and gives IOUs. Zander corrected him, saying that he meant a multisig escrow transaction where the escrow is trusted by both parties. However, this feature of allowing trust to be involved in different ways is optional, and the main point remains that one does not need to trust anyone to use Bitcoin.</summary>
