    <summary>In the context provided, it is stated that BIP 70 cannot be modified anymore and it can only be extended. This means that any changes or updates to BIP 70 are no longer possible and it will remain as it is. Additionally, it was mentioned that having a dedicated chain ID for regtest mode is not necessary since BIP70 requests for regtest should only be found on the developer's machine where the ID does not matter. Therefore, there is no need to have a separate chain ID for regtest in this case.Overall, the context seems to be related to the technical aspects of BIP70 and its usage in regtest mode. It highlights the immutability of BIP70 and the purpose of having a dedicated chain ID for regtest.</summary>
