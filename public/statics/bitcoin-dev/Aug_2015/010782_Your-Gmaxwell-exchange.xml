    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, Adam Ritter expressed his concern that after the block size limit is gone, he'll still have to pay transaction fees which would make using Bitcoin less practical for him. He went on to say that his main concern was centralization, and he would be willing to pay high transaction fees if the network was fair and secure. Justus Ranvier responded by stating that he didn't believe Bitcoin users actually cared about decentralization as none of them he had asked could define the term. He suggested that decentralization has become a placeholder word for features or ideas that people like and that it's time to bring the discussion back to achievable goals. He stated that users want to own their bitcoins, retain exclusive control over their balances, not have their fraction of the Bitcoin ledger diluted, and be able to spend their coins without requiring permission from a third party. While a decentralized architecture in certain parts of the network can be helpful for achieving these goals, it is not always necessary or sufficient to achieve them.</summary>
