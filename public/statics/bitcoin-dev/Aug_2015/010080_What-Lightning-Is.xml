    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in August 2015, Btc Drak mentioned the existence of the Lightning Network development mailing list and its interesting explanations. However, one participant, Thomas Zander, raised the question of limitations and where it would not make sense to use the Lightning Network. Specifically, he was interested in knowing when it would be better to put transactions directly on the blockchain instead. Zander also mentioned other use cases for the Lightning Network, such as remittances and international payments to facilitate global commerce.</summary>
