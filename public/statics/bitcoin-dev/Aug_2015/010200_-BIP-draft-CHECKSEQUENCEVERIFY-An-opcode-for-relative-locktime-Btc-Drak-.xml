    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread dated August 13, 2015, Nicolas Dorier expressed his desire to have a proposal pushed together with BIP68 and CLTV. He believed that if BIP68 was included in the next fork, then CSV would be an easy decision to make. Dorier also asked if there were any competing RCLTV proposals that did not rely on BIP68 for information. In response, Matt stated that all such proposals were dropped because the current proposal seemed like a better idea. However, he encouraged anyone to revive or come up with a new proposal.</summary>
