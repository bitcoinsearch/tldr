    <summary>There have been multiple previously-proposed and exotic SIGHASH types. Some of these include SIGHASH_MULTIPLE, SIGHASH_LIST, and SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE, which were discussed on bitcointalk.org. Another proposed type is SIGHASH_NOINPUT, which is mentioned in a paper about the Lightning Network and also has commits on Github. There are also proposals for SIGHASH_NORMALIZED and SIGHASH_WITHOUT_PREV_SCRIPTPUBKEY. Furthermore, there have been suggestions for new types such as SIGHASH_SIGN_STACK_ELEMENT, SIGHASH_DONT_SIGN_TXID, SIGHASH_DANGEROUSLYPROMISCUOUS, SIGHASH_DOUBLE, SIGHASH_NLOCKTIMEVERIFY, SIGHASH_SUM, and even SIGHASH_UNICORN. These different types could potentially be useful for different purposes.</summary>
