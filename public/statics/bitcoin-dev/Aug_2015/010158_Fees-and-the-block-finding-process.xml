    <summary>In an email exchange between Michael Naber and Jorge Timón in August 2015, they discussed the issue of hitting the limit on Bitcoin's capacity. Naber argued that constraining Bitcoin's capacity below what technology is capable of delivering will only push users to other solutions which have adequate capacity, such as BitcoinXT. He also stated that lightning/hub and spoke models do not meet requirements for users wishing to participate in global consensus since all participating nodes are not aware of all transactions. Timón questioned if fees would be the reason for people to switch to altcoins. However, Naber did not directly answer the question and instead emphasized the importance of not constraining Bitcoin's capacity.</summary>
