    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in August 2015, Satoshi Nakamoto raised the issue of needing better incentives for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism. The distinction between full nodes that validate and SPV wallets that don't validate is not consistent with the design of Bitcoin. While there is already plenty of incentive for running a node with the coinbase, one can mine without running a node. The idea of making P2Pool the only pool allowed on the network has been suggested but scalability reasons make this hard. In the P2Pool design, there is a substantial tradeoff in variance reduction versus communication costs.</summary>
