    <summary>In August 2015, Gavin Andresen expressed his disagreement with predictions that the number of nodes in the Bitcoin network would decrease, even with no change. He believed that the number of full nodes on the network would drop to a few thousand because the general-purpose-home-PC is becoming obsolete. However, he also stated that things like the Raspberry PI and similar hardware are gaining ground fast and can run a node just fine. As Bitcoin gains traction with these users, he has no doubt that a nice portion of them will run a node for the same reason they are running their private cloud: Trust No One. In other words, as Bitcoin grows in popularity and more people find it interesting, the desktop node that eventually gets shut down will be replaced with the next generation hardware of a different kind of Bitcoin user.</summary>
