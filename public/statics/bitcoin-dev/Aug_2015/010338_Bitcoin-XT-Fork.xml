    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell responded to a suggestion about making P2Pool the only pool allowed on the network. However, he noted that scalability issues make this hard as there is a tradeoff in variance reduction versus communication costs in the P2Pool design. The suggestion was made that pools could be required to do p2pool between them, but there would still be pools needed to further reduce variance.</summary>
