    <summary>In this email thread from August 11, 2015, Bitcoin developer Thomas Zander responds to a comment about Gavin Andresen's blog posts and the ongoing debate over increasing the size of Bitcoin blocks. The commenter expresses frustration with the discussion and questions the potential consequences of not increasing block size beyond rising fees. In response, Zander lists ten reasons why he believes increasing block size is necessary and criticizes the commenter for not remembering these points. However, Zander also expresses a desire to avoid polarizing the discussion or blaming others, as he feels that neither side in the debate is completely right and that bigger blocks will not solve all scalability issues. He encourages further discussion on the topic by providing a link to an email thread.</summary>
