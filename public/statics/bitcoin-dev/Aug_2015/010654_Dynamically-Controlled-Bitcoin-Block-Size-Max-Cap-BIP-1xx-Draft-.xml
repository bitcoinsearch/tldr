    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Peter Todd proposed XORing votes with SHA256 of the entire blockchain as a simple toy example of voting mechanism. However, this proposal was criticized for not being effective. In response to this, another proposal was made by an unknown individual to use CLTV to lock coins (votes), which was considered to be better than the previous proposal. In case a soft-fork cannot be implemented in time, counting votes from the UTXO set is also considered to be acceptable, but it may not provide strong evidence of commitment like CLTV.</summary>
