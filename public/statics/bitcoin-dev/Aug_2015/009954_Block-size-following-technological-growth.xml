    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Gavin Andresen responded to Jorge Tim√≥n's statement that the block size limit must be increased as soon as possible or bitcoin will fail. Andresen argued that such patently false statements do not help the debate and explained in his blog post why increasing the max block size is urgent. He clarified that he never said Bitcoin will fail, but if the number of transactions waiting gets large enough, the end result will be an over-saturated network, busy doing nothing productive. Andresen believes that it is more likely people just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable. However, Pieter Wuille disagreed with Andresen's view that competition for block space is a bad thing. Wuille proposed a BIP stating that "the development of a fee market and the evolution towards an ecosystem that is able to cope with block space competition should be considered healthy."</summary>
