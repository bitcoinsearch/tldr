    <summary>In an email conversation, Hector Chu talks about Mike's position that the block size limit should be removed eventually. He also responds to a suggestion that the block size should be kept artificially low, stating that he doesn't know what the right block size for the short term is but believes that the maximum block size limit consensus rule serves to limit mining centralization. Chu argues that how the change can affect mining centralization must be the main concern, instead of projections about usage growth. The majority position on block size lies somewhere in between, i.e., a one-time increase to 8MB. If the block size is increased to 8MB and things get demonstrably worse, then there will be a solid leg to stand on. There is no criterion based on mining centralization to decide between two sizes in favor of the small one. Chu suggests that proponents of a blocksize change should propose such a criterion and now they have the tools to simulate different block sizes.</summary>
