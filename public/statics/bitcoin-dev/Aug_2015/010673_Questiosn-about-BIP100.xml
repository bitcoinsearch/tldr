    <summary>In this email conversation between developers, they discuss the implementation of BIP 100 and its deployment. The person asking the question is confused about the term "most common floor" and asks for clarification. Jeff Garzik responds, stating that he is currently working on a technical draft and implementation of BIP 100 and that only the PDF is publicly available at the moment. He also confirms that the initial deployment will be in the same manner as size votes. Andrew C asks if there is any client or code that currently implements BIP 100 and how it will be deployed. The conversation ends with no further information provided.</summary>
