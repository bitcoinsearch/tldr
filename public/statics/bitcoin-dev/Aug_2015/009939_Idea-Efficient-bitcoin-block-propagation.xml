    <summary>The Bitcoin Relay Network (BRN) is currently being used by the majority of large miners and is available to anyone. Its protocol is simple, and it could easily be modified to keep its block ready to quickly relay to the nearest server. The client only has to relay the header, the coinbase transaction, and small amounts of other data. This method is much less complicated than a proposed solution that would introduce bitcoin-backed guarantees between miners. Arnoud Kouwenhoven of Pukaki Corp suggests in a proposal that “Guarantee Messages” would allow miners to mine on blocks that are not yet fully transmitted, thus reducing the effect of slow internet connections and leveling the playing field for all miners. They believe that this will increase mining efficiency for everyone while decreasing transaction confirmation times and strengthening the distributed nature of bitcoin. It is possible to implement their idea as a fork of bitcoind, or as a layer between the standard bitcoind and the mining equipment. In the future, it could be incorporated into bitcoin core if and when that becomes a priority. The proposal is currently at v.0.2 and can be found in both PDF and HTML format.</summary>
