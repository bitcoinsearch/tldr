    <summary>The centralization and censorship of the Bitcoin community is causing inhibition in its advancement and economy growth, leading to the scaring away of intellectuals, businessmen, and newbies. The creation of a truly decentralized forum is the solution to this problem, but it has proven difficult due to factors such as spam, abuse, overloading, and the theymos factor. /r/bitcoinxt has been a great forum so far, but a regular forum is also needed. It should be heavily moderated like battle.net or Steam forums and not just for free speech, but also to filter spam, noise, and insults. The forum should have an "official seal of approval" and regular presence of top XT people. Roger Ver controls bitcoin.com, which could be a suitable platform for the forum. The key to success is proper moderation and leadership.</summary>
