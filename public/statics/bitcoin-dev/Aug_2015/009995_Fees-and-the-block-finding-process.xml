    <summary>On August 7, 2015, Gavin Andresen expressed his opinion regarding the need to raise the maximum block size of Bitcoin. In addition to concerns about the potential negative consequences that could occur if the network hit the current 1MB limit, Andresen believed there were other reasons to increase the block size. He explained that he valued the opinions of smart engineers who have experience with resource planning and understand the impact that capacity issues can have on a network. When asked about the potential consequences of hitting the limit, Andresen acknowledged that rising minimum market fees would be a concern, but he did not believe this was the only issue that could arise.</summary>
