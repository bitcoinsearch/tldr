    <summary>On August 21, 2015, Christian Decker created a tracking page for the 'block votes' which currently includes the 8MB vote and XT as well as the /BV\d+/ vote for generic size. Odinn via bitcoin-dev asked if there is a way to visually display formal votes in a pie chart as the votes become apparent in blocks. Nicolas Dorier responded that he would gladly show the pie on BIPxDevs if such a vote existed but there is no standard way for miners to vote informally BIP they support. Odinn's signature contained links to their website abis.io, which is "a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and a new social good," and their Keybase profile. The message was signed with a PGP signature.</summary>
