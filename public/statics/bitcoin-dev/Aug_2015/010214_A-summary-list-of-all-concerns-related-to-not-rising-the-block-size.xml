    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev forum post on August 14, 2015, Venzen Khaosan questioned the impact of increasing the block size limit to 1.6GB in the case where a government or banking group utilized 1.5GB of the capacity of each block for their settlement network. Thomas Zander responded to this use-case by stating that it would only make sense if we assume that blocks are community property, which is not the case as proven during a recent spam attack. During the spam attack, people were able to continue sending payments without issues by just increasing the fee slightly. Therefore, bigger blocks do not immediately get filled and create more space for everyone, while those abusing the system will have to spend significantly more money to disrupt it, benefiting the network as a whole.</summary>
