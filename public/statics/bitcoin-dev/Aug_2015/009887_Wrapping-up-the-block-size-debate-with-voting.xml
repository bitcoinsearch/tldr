    <summary>The proposal suggests putting an end to the endless debate regarding Bitcoin development by voting on concrete proposals. The candidate proposals must be complete BIPs with reference implementation ready to merge immediately, approved by developers in a technical standpoint without political or philosophical considerations. Several voter groups will participate in the voting process independently. These include miners, Bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full node operators. Each group has specific eligibility criteria and voting rules. Single transferable vote system is applied where voters rank their preference. Approval rate is calculated for each candidate proposal, and the one with the most significant ranking is considered the winner, unless the difference in approval rate is enormous.</summary>
