    <summary>The discussion is about the off-chain use of Bitcoin and its impact on security. While some people may be comfortable with off-chain use, it is not a strong argument for weakening Bitcoin's security. Security is important, and providing more security than people seem to want would be useful. However, sometimes people don't understand the importance of security until something goes wrong. Therefore, it would be ideal to provide both scale and decentralization with increased security. Lightning-like protocols are being developed to provide security at scale.</summary>
