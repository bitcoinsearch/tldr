    <summary>In this email, Gavin Andresen discusses the issue of determining the minimum fee for Bitcoin transactions. He argues that it should be up to the market, rather than any single entity, to decide when is a good time to set fees. However, he also believes that the community should decide what risks it is willing to take and set limits accordingly. When asked about whether block size increase proposals should have a criterion or test, Andresen does not think they should all have to justify their size or rate of increase. He sees the debate as being about a sanity-check upper-limit, and as long as it doesn't create new DoS possibilities, he does not believe the exact number matters much. Pieter Wuille, who responded to the original email, suggests that relying on trusting miners for DoS protection is not ideal and notes that the market will fill up whatever space is available, leading to the same discussion when the new limit no longer seems sufficient. Overall, the email highlights differing opinions about how best to approach setting transaction fees and block size increases in the Bitcoin network.</summary>
