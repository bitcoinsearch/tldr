    <summary>In August 2015, Wes Green proposed a game theory-based solution to Bitcoin's block size issue which allows miners to double the block size at any time but penalizes them by taking a percentage increase in the rewards from both fees and normal rewards. The remaining amount would be rewarded to the next miner that found a block. According to one response to Green’s proposal, the equilibrium for the game would be to keep the same block size. The response also suggested that having more reasonable scaling parameters, a and c, would make it easier to produce a fee market for Bitcoin transactions. The average cost per byte of a transaction would be just “a(B-c).” To provide real numbers, the response made some assumptions on fee levels. For example, with 1MB blocks, free transactions and no fees would be expected. With 8MB blocks and people paying 0.1 mBTC/kB in fees, 0.8 BTC in fees per block would be okay. A miner having 95% hashing power would have a 95% chance to find the next block and collect the penalty, which is biased against small miners. A suggestion was made to require miners to burn the penalty instead. The proposal aims to force miners to hold the whole blockchain because SPV does not allow seeing all transactions in a block. By doing this, miners would also have an eye on blockchain size and wouldn't want it getting too huge too fast outside of Moore's law.This system would encourage block size growth due to organic growth, and the penalty would encourage it to be slow as to still keep reward high and preserve ROE. Miners would only have an incentive to raise the limit when there is organic growth in the network and spam attacks would have to be dealt with as it is currently. In addition, the proposal would force miners to hold the whole blockchain, adding to the gamification.</summary>
