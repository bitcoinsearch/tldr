    <summary>A suggestion was made by Ross Nicoll on June 23rd, 2015, that instead of replacing most of Testnet with a specialized test chain, it might be wise to consider creating a fourth test network with large blocks from the genesis onwards. They also provided a patch/PR link for those who may be interested. To further expand on this idea, someone else suggested creating multiple test networks using the same code.</summary>
