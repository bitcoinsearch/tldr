    <summary>On August 4th, 2015 Gavin Andresen posted a message in response to Pieter Wuille's statement on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Wuille claimed that things had already gotten terrible and the mining landscape was centralized due to agreements made to trust each other's announced blocks without validation. Andresen questioned why this was a problem, which caused Wuille to ask if he was misunderstanding Andresen's position on large-block advocates. Large-block advocates believe that pushing individual economic actors away from running full nodes is a natural consequence of block size increase, as they're expected to rely on Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). Andresen appeared to agree with this position, but Wuille wondered who would validate large blocks if not miners and what their incentive would be. The conversation ended with Andresen's cryptographically signed PGP message.</summary>
