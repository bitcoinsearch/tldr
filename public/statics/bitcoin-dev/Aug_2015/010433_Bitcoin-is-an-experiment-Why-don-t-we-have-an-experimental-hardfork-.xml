    <summary>In an email conversation between odinn and Jorge Timón, they discussed the controversy surrounding Bitcoin XT. Odinn provided a link to a pull request which he claimed was conclusive about the controversial nature of Bitcoin XT. However, Jorge argued that Bitcoin XT, the software fork, and BIP101 implemented as a schism hardfork in Bitcoin XT were different things. Jorge believed that if there wasn't a schism hardfork in the making, there wouldn't be any warning about Bitcoin XT in bitcoin.org because Bitcoin XT had implemented the same consensus rules and was largely ignored. Jorge also suggested that BIP101 could be modified to be deployed like an uncontroversial hardfork. He asked if odinn had read BIP99 and could tell him where he disagreed with what's in it. Odinn responded by saying that Hearn's efforts were an attack on the bitcoin network and that there was no basis for further promoting XT by suggesting that it should even be tested. He insisted that people were doing other unsuspecting users a disservice by even suggesting that it should be downloaded. The big problem, according to odinn, was BIP101 being deployed as a Schism hardfork, which was certainly a problem.</summary>
