    <summary>The email thread discusses the necessary bits required to enable/disable relative lock-time and indicate whether seconds or blocks should be used as the unit of measurement. It is noted that a granularity of 256 seconds would be greater than the Nyquist frequency, requiring only 17 bits for one year. Block-based relative lock-time requires about 18 bits, and time-based relative lock-time requires about 19 bits, leaving 13 or 14 bits for other uses. The maximum time limit for relative lock-time is discussed, with a suggestion of at least one year as a hard maximum. There is a question posed regarding the need for more than one year of relative lock-time. A suggestion is made to represent one block with more than one increment, providing additional space for future signaling and higher resolution numbers for a sharechain commitment.</summary>
