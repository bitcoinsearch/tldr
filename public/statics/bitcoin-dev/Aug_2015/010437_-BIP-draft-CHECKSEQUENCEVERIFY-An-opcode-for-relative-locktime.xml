    <summary>The author of the message is indifferent about the issue of bit inversion, but chose to implement it in order to preserve existing semantics. This choice was made to avoid the proposal being held up by those who might find the change confusing. The author states that they are open to changing their decision if there is strong preference from multiple people. Jorge Tim√≥n repeated his concern about the issue on GitHub and Bitcoin Core.</summary>
