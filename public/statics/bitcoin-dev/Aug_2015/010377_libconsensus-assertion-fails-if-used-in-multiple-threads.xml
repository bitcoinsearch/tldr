    <summary>In an email dated August 18, 2015, Tamas Blummer discusses the performance of libconsensus and compares it to Java. He remarks that the performance of the C++ library is similar to that of Java, indicating that there is little advantage in trading off advances in language for a marginal gain of performance with C/C++. The author notes that if performance were the only trade-off with Java and if C++ was frozen in time, then perhaps there would be a point in considering moving away from Java. However, this is not the case. The email concludes with thanks to Cory for his work on the issue.</summary>
