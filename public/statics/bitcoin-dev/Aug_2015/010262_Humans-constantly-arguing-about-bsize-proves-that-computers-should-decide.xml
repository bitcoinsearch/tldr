    <summary>The author of the post suggests that the ongoing debate about block size should be delegated to a self-adjusting system. The need for administrators to constantly tweak a magical, Satoshi-given constant is a strong indicator that an automated system would be more effective. The proposed solution involves using an averaging function based on previous block sizes to determine the new max block size. Ultimately, the goal is to end the flamewar and continue with real development. The author believes that systems that do not require human intervention are more beautiful, especially when designing a decentralized P2P network. The post is signed by xor, a developer working for the Freenet anonymous P2P network.</summary>
