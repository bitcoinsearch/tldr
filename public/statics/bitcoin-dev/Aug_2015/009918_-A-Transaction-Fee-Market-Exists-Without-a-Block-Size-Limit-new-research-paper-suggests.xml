    <summary>On August 4, 2015, a member of the Bitcoin community, Dave Hudson, expressed concern about equation 4 in a paper that had been published. Hudson claimed that the orphan rate was not only affected by time but also depended on the block maker's proportion of the network hash rate. He argued that a block maker would not orphan its own blocks and that small miners would face greater risks of orphaning than larger ones. Another member of the community criticized the paper more harshly, calling it "fatally flawed" and questioning why the author did not see the flaws in their work. This member urged people interested in researching Bitcoin to be cautious and seek expert opinions before publishing work related to the politically charged topic of the block size limit. They suggested that the type of analysis required for such research should be similar to that used to investigate security exploits like selfish mining. The message ends with a PGP signature.</summary>
