    <summary>A discussion was held on the bitcoin-dev forum regarding the possibility of making the genesis field "repeated" to specify all potential networks. Ross Nicoll proposed this idea, but it was met with opposition. It was argued that the chain ID needs to be unique for proper fork detection. The response should indicate which hash was used, with height in a further field. Overall, the discussion centered around how to ensure the uniqueness of the chain ID while still allowing for multiple potential networks.</summary>
