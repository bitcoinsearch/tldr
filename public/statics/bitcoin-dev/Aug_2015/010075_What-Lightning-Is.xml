    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list continues regarding borrowing rates in relation to payment hubs. The borrowing rates involve the risk of default, however, in lightning, the funds of the hubs are not at risk as long as they maintain control of the private keys. The rates charged by the hubs will most likely be much lower than those charged on p2p lending sites. However, the funding required for the hubs to initiate and maintain the ability to receive payments is likened to gold lease rates in the Lightning Network paper. Bob may want different maximum payment amounts, and channels open for different lengths of time, so burying the cost in general fees might not work well.</summary>
