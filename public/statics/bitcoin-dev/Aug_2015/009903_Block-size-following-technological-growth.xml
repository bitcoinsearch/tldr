    <summary>In an email correspondence sent on August 4th, 2015, Hector Chu expressed his opinion that the majority of people are in favor of larger blocks. However, some developers are encouraging users to ask for bigger blocks, while others don't want to change consensus rules against the will of users even if they represent only a minority. In response, one developer stated that they do not want to impose changes against the will of a reasonable minority and that the block size limit is the only consensus rule to limit mining centralization. They also mentioned a proposal to reduce the block size to 400 KB and requested a simulation that proves the change would be beneficial. Additionally, it was noted that there is another consensus rule in place, the maximum block sigops, to limit mining centralization.</summary>
