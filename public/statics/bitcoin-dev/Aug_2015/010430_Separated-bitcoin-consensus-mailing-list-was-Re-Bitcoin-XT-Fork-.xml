    <summary>The discussion revolves around creating a mailing list for general discussions about Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin Core. The existing general discussion list has been inactive for a long time, leading to the idea of creating a new one. The potential benefits of such a list would be the ability to share and discuss academic and technical matters, while also having a separate read-only list for announcements about new versions of Bitcoin Core and critical warnings. Some members suggest separating Bitcoin Core-specific development from general BIPs and consensus discussions, but concerns are raised about too much separation causing confusion. Overall, there is agreement that a general discussion mailing list is necessary for those developing and maintaining Bitcoin protocol software or services relying on it. The idea of creating a new mailing list is still under discussion.</summary>
