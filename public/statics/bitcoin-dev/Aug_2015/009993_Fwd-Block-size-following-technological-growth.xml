    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, argued that low node count indicates the difficulty of running a full node. However, Thomas Zander pointed out that running a node is only necessary if someone doesn't know anyone they can trust to run it for them. Zander argued that the need to run a node in the first place should be considered before making conclusions about node count indicating difficulty. He also dismissed historical node-count as a basis for speculation in the blocksize debate. Wuille believes that incentives for people to use full nodes should increase with increased adoption, as the lack of need for trust is Bitcoin's fundamental improvement over other systems. However, Zander believes that most merchants and miners have no need for a node, and users don't make enough payments to care.</summary>
