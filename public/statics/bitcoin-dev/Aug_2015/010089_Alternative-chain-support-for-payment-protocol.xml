    <summary>In a discussion on August 10, 2015, Mike Hearn stated that BIP 70 is immutable and can only be extended. However, there was a point made about making exceptions for regtest mode, which would make the code more complex rather than simpler. It was argued that all supported chains should be treated in the same way in the code. The dedicated chain ID for regtest mode is not necessary as it should not be found outside of a developer machine where the ID does not matter.</summary>
