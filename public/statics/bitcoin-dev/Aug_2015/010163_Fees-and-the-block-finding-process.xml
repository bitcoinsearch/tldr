    <summary>In an email thread between bitcoin developers, Michael Naber argued that the low cost of transactions is a key characteristic toward Bitcoin's success. He suggests that if this characteristic is lost, Bitcoin will lose its appeal and be replaced by other digital currencies that are less expensive to transfer. However, Adam Back counters this argument, stating that the most interesting aspect of Bitcoin is trustlessness - being able to transact without relying on third parties. Meanwhile, Pieter Wuille argues that the block size issue is not a matter of what technology can deliver, but rather a balance between utility and risk. He also emphasizes the importance of consensus rules in keeping the system together and suggests that consensus changes should only be made when uncontroversial.</summary>
