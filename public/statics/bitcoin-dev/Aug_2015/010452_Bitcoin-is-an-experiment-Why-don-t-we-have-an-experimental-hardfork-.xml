    <summary>In an email conversation sent on August 19th, 2015, Danny Thorpe asked about how "big-block" testnet nodes running the 6382 rev could recognize each other on the peer network. He posed a hypothetical scenario where he set up a 2MB block limit testnet node and added another 2MB block testnet node to it. If his node then mined a block containing 1.3MB of test transactions, the other "big-block" node should accept the mined block, but the rest of the testnet network would immediately orphan the block because it exceeds their notion of block size limit. Thorpe's questions were addressed in another thread, and he requested review and testing of #6235 to eventually merge the full #6382 branch into bitcoin/master.</summary>
