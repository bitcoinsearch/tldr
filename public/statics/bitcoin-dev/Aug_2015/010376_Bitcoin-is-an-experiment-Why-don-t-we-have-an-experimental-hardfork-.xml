    <summary>The discussion revolves around testing the proposed implementation of Bitcoin's blocksize limit experiment. The idea is to test it on the public global testnet network, rather than sterile environments, so that real-world hazards such as network lag, bandwidth constraints, traffic bottlenecks, etc can be evaluated. An experimental hardfork is being proposed for long-term trials using the testnet. However, the biggest challenge facing Bitcoin might not be technical but political, as convincing enough people to switch without causing any damage to the system seems difficult. It is suggested that a test deployment would give more people an opportunity to see how the proposed implementation works and reduce angst about the proposals.</summary>
