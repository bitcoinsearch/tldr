    <summary>A discussion is taking place on whether to establish two separate mailing lists for Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin Core discussions. However, Jeff Garzik thinks that having multiple lists will not make much difference as long as Bitcoin Core remains the reference client. He also suggests that there haven't been any rules in place for -dev to force general discussion over to the Bitcoin list. Garzik believes that offloading non-technical/academic debates to the Bitcoin list could significantly reduce the off-topic/noise on the bitcoin-dev list. Additionally, he mentions that it just needs a bit of shepherding and he would be happy to help out. Finally, Garzik asks about the moderators and whether SourceForge is the best platform or if there are better alternatives like another list on the Linux Foundation.</summary>
