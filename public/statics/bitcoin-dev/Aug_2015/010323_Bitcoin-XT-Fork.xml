    <summary>In an email conversation between Jorge Timón and Oliver Egginger on August 17th, 2015, Egginger requested that Satoshis old email addresses be deleted from a list and blocked to avoid confusion, particularly in the media. Timón questioned why any email address should be blocked and Egginger responded that it would prevent discussions about Satoshi's authenticity. Timón then asked if the content of a post matters less than its author, to which Egginger replied that he finds it unfair when people use Satoshi's name to submit their personal views on an issue.</summary>
