    <summary>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin development mailing list in August 2015, Thomas Zander asked about the limitations of using the Lightning Network and when it would be better to put a transaction directly on the blockchain. Btc Drak suggested checking out the Lightning Network development mailing list for more information, but Zander felt that the current list should discuss this topic. He mentioned Gavin's use case as being useful and was curious about remittances and international payments, such as when a company in Nairobi buys stock from a company in Spain. The Lightning Network is a payment protocol designed to enable secure and instant transactions between participating nodes. However, if a path cannot be built to the recipient through the Lightning Network, then a standard transaction should be used.</summary>
