    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón, the debate on whether to increase the block size limit was discussed. Timón expressed his opinion that it would have been better to start the discussion with a more reasonable position, rather than claiming that Bitcoin would fail without increasing the block size limit. Andresen pointed out that such patently false statements do not help the debate and referred to his blog post where he stated that an oversaturated network could make transaction confirmation increasingly unreliable, leading people to stop using Bitcoin. Timón argued that all fears related to not raising the block size limit in the short term could be reduced to the fear of fees rising in the short term unless he was missing something. Andresen stressed the need to focus on how to move forward and how best to resolve difficult questions like this in the future, rather than making over-the-top claims about what "the other side" believes. Timón then posed three questions to Andresen, asking when it would be a good time to let fees rise above zero, when the block size would be considered too dangerous for centralization, and if he would be in favor of completely removing the consensus rule that limits mining centralization by imposing an artificial block size maximum. He emphasized that repeatedly asking these questions did not seem to be effective and urged Andresen to answer them, so they did not have to imagine what the answers could be. Given the lack of real answers, Timón provided fictional ones, suggesting that a big block advocate would not care about mining centralization and would want to remove the consensus rule limiting it. However, he was confident that Andresen would have better answers and asked him to provide them.</summary>
