    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Yifu Guo stated that not increasing the blocksize is not an option. However, he also believes that increasing the blocksize will only eliminate the pressure to find long-term solutions and may not turn out as expected. He expressed doubt about the success of a 20-year plan and suggested that clearing away the auto-increase could be the best solution at present. Guo hopes that the current protocol and blockchain will continue, even if with fewer users.</summary>
