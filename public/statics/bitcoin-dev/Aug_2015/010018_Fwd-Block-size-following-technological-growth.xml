    <summary>The context begins with a quote by Pieter Wuille in response to a concern raised about increasing the block size of Bitcoin. Wuille believes that if the reason for increasing the block size is due to fear of a change in economics, then it means one prefers not dealing with that change. He had previously stated that finding a non-controversial solution and not taking unnecessary risks was essential. Thomas Zander questions Wuille's desire to change the basic economics of Bitcoin and suggests that such a change would be an unnecessary risk.</summary>
