    <summary>The author of the message is proposing the creation of an AML-KYC module to control the network and qualify use cases in OFAC compliant way. The author believes that something needs to be done to stop those who are hashing and winning blocks+transaction fees and not in a safe country list, as they could potentially fund illicit activities such as the Haqqani network. The author suggests that decentralized currency requires responsibility and that those who do not care about it are a threat to everyone. The author invites criticism and suggestions from others in the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One member responds by asking for evidence of illicit miners and users and questioning the validity of singling out bitcoin as opposed to other financial systems.</summary>
