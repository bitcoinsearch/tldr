    <summary>In an email conversation between members of the Bitcoin development community in August 2015, a proposal was made to increase the block size from the then-current 1MB limit. Thomas Zander suggested raising the limit to between 8MB and 8GB, but others in the conversation emphasized the importance of defending any proposed increase with data and analysis, given the contentious history of previous changes to the block size. One member cautioned against repeating past mistakes and creating more problems than were being solved.</summary>
