    <summary>In August 2015, Gavin Andresen discussed a new approach to govern Bitcoin with GJB. He suggested that groups with similar interests, such as exchanges, should come together and reach consensus on important issues like the block size debate instead of having a foundation that tried to represent everyone's interests, which often conflicted.During the same month, Bitcoin developers were discussing the results of a prediction market called blocksizedebate.com. Anthony Towns found the results implausible, pointing out that the PH/s rate is higher with bigger blocks but assumes that the difference in price is mostly due to price. He suggests a 1.5MB-2MB max block size would probably be enough for the next two years. Gavin Andresen disagreed with predictions that the number of nodes in the Bitcoin network would decrease even with no change. Andresen believed the number of full nodes on the network would drop to a few thousand because the general-purpose-home-PC is becoming obsolete. However, he also stated that things like the Raspberry PI and similar hardware are gaining ground fast and can run a node just fine. As Bitcoin gains traction with these users, he has no doubt that a nice portion of them will run a node for the same reason they are running their private cloud: Trust No One.Eli Dourado wrote an excellent blog post on how Bitcoin should be governed which hasn't been referenced yet. The author of the context agrees with Dourado's conclusions that there needs to be better communication and organization mechanisms between stakeholders, including developers, miners, merchants, exchanges, and end-users.Peter Sztorc proposed a sidechain that could be implemented using Blockstream's method. However, Eric Lombrozo suggested using theory, empirical data, and engineering to fix the problems instead of speculating on fake markets. Owen noted that since there is no money at stake in these prediction games, it's not surprising that the results are implausible.In conclusion, Bitcoin developers discussed the use of prediction markets to address issues with Bitcoin. While some preliminary results seem roughly correct, the lack of convincing predictions suggests that theory, empirical data, and engineering should be used to solve the problem at hand instead of speculating on fake markets. Additionally, there needs to be better communication and organization mechanisms between stakeholders, including developers, miners, merchants, exchanges, and end-users. Finally, developers should focus on using theory, empirical data, and engineering to fix problems rather than relying on speculation.</summary>
