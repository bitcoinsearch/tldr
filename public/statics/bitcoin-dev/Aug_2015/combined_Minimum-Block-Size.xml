    <summary>The possibility of implementing a minimum block size for Bitcoin has been discussed in the context of the "max block size" debate. However, this is a complex issue with no easy answer. The problem with using "block size" as a measure of resource usage is that it doesn't reliably measure typical usage transactions versus those constructed for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, designing for DoS worst case scenarios rather than the average/expected use case is necessary. There is also an issue of time horizons and what presumed improvements are made to the client. Bitcoin Core currently struggles to handle 1MB blocks but this is an engineering limitation. As a result, it's unclear whether to raise the block size before testing and validating any performance improvements. Most developers have not given straightforward statements on specific block sizes due to the complexity of the issue. Nevertheless, workshops are being organized to discuss these issues.Levin Keller initiated a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about the possibility of implementing a minimum block size. He suggested a limit of 2 MB and expressed his own support for a lower limit. However, Jeff Garzik replied that there would be no value in requiring a minimum block size. He pointed out that traffic levels may not produce a minimum-sized block, and miners could collude to produce a lowered maximum block size, which he referred to as a 'minimum maximum.' The email thread did not result in any concrete decisions or conclusions regarding the implementation of a minimum block size.The discussion around the "max block size" for Bitcoin has led to consideration of a minimum block size. However, the issue is complicated and requires further examination. While some have suggested a 2 MB limit, others argue that such a rule may be ineffective or unnecessary. Workshops are being held to address this and related topics and anyone can participate by visiting http://scalingbitcoin.org/.</summary>
