    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, expressed concerns about the decreasing number of full nodes in the Bitcoin ecosystem. He argued that as the odds at stake in the system go up, so should those who take an interest in verifying. However, he acknowledged that there have always been more people using centralized services or SPV-level-security wallets than running full nodes, even back when blocks were tiny. Gavin Andresen, another Bitcoin developer, disagreed with Wuille's view, stating that people in the Bitcoin ecosystem will choose different tradeoffs and be free to make those choices. Andresen also believed that block size has very little to do with the decision to run a full node or not. He thinks that the block size should follow technological evolution and not reinforce the belief that it should follow demand, preferring that there should be compromises in dealing with increasing demand.</summary>
