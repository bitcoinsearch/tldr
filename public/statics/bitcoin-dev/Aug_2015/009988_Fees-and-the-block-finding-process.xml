    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille on August 7, 2015, they discuss the possibility of raising the maximum block size for Bitcoin. One of the reasons mentioned for doing so is the fear of network capacity running out as the current limit of 1MB is approached. Gavin takes seriously the opinions of engineers who have seen what happens when networks reach their capacity, and believes that smart resource planning is necessary to prevent negative outcomes. He acknowledges that there may be a need for further increases in the future and encourages future Bitcoin engineers to consider the benefits and costs of such changes before implementing them.</summary>
