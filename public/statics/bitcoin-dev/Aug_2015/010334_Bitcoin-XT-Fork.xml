    <summary>On August 17th, 2015, Oliver Egginger requested the removal of Satoshi's old email addresses from the bitcoin-dev list and to block them. The list had been restarted with an empty subscriber list on June 21st, 2015, so whoever posted from satoshi at vistomail.com had recently subscribed and verified the address. Warren questioned whether manual approval for new subscribers should be implemented to prevent such abuses.</summary>
