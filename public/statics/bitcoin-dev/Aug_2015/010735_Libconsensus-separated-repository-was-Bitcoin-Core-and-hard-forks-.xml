    <summary>In an email dated August 23, 2015, Tamas Blummer expressed his concern over the lack of a vision for the software architecture in Core despite the huge amount of effort put into it. Blummer went on to outline his plan for dealing with the Core code base which included considering the separation of networking and storage as suggested for a future extended libconsensus low priority. He also proposed creating an API to the consensus+networking+storage service that is not at the C++ language level but some scalable cross-platform remoting like ZeroMQ. Blummer's API would unlock user land development by distinct teams with diverse technologies. He then talked about moving the wallet, QT, RPC, and other backward compatibility stuff (if e.g. there is some mining support) in-top of the new API and into distinct source code repositories. The RPC is the API, and for libconsensus, its C API is the API. Finally, modularization is a prerequisite for separating the wallet and qt to a different repository.</summary>
