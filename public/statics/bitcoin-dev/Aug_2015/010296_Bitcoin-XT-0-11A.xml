    <summary>In an email thread from August 2015 on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd and Cameron Garnham discuss ways to spam 8mb blocks with 1 Satoshi outputs to the brainwallet 'BitcoinXT'. Todd suggests using coinbase outputs of XT blocks to create those outputs or using coinbase outputs of Bitcoin blocks to create "definitely Bitcoin-only" outputs and then spending the inputs to those transactions again on the XT chain. However, this method is not as secure as a large reorg on the XT chain could potentially spend them. The discussion highlights the technical aspects of the Bitcoin network and the potential for malicious actors to manipulate it.</summary>
