    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list expressed disappointment in what they saw as a one-sided perspective on the platform. Bitcoin core developer, Wladimir J. van der Laan, responded to the comment, stating that meta-discussions of communities have no place on the list and that everyone has the ability to create their own community or list focused on bitcoin. He encouraged users to create their own spaces rather than trying to pressure others to change their behavior on their own platform. The email exchange took place on August 21, 2015.</summary>
