    <summary>It would be great to have the CSV (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) implemented alongside CLTV (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) and BIP68 (relative lock-time). The implementation of CSV would be a no brainer if BIP68 gets pushed in the next fork. However, there is a question about whether there was a competing RCLTV (Relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) implementation that did not depend on BIP68 for information, but it seems difficult to find any information on this.</summary>
