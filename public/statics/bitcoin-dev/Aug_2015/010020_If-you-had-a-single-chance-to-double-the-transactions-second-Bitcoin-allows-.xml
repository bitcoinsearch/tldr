    <summary>In an email exchange between Sergio Demian Lerner and Mark, they discuss the importance of response time in the context of Bitcoin transactions. Lerner emphasizes that even a few minutes can make a significant difference in completing a transaction before someone goes out of office. However, he acknowledges that what truly matters is seconds, and suggests using some form of multisignature notaries to ensure doublespend protection from the time of publication to the first block confirmation. He references Greenaddress.it and the lightning network as examples of these types of notaries.</summary>
