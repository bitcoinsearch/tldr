    <summary>On August 16, 2015, a developer named xor shared their thoughts on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about the ongoing argument regarding what to do with the block size. The developer suggested that instead of relying on administrators to tweak a constant, which is a "strong indicator" for something that should be delegated to a self-adjusting system. They proposed using a function to determine the new maximum block size based on previous block sizes or how much work has been put in by miners. The developer emphasized the beauty of systems that do not require human intervention, especially when designing a decentralized P2P network.</summary>
