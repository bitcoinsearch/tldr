    <summary>A suggestion to support side-chains is the bip44 coin type registry which could be added as an optional field to PaymentRequest to serialize incompatible PaymentDetails to serialized_payment_details field. However, using human-meaningful identifiers such as BitcoinDark or Litedoge may cause name collisions. Additionally, the genesis hash could also be used as a network ID instead of short names. BIP 70 does not define new strings for alt coins as they can vary in arbitrary ways from Bitcoin, but if an alt coin is close enough to BIP 70 for reuse 'as is', a new network string for the alt can be defined. The genesis hash can also be used as the network name, but it would involve lookups to figure out what the request is for if found in the wild.</summary>
