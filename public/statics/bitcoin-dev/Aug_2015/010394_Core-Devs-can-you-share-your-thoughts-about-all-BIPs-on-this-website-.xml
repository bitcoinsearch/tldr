    <summary>A small website has been created to help the community in showing a chart of approvals for various BIPs. Users can fill out if they approve or not and give comments with HTML accepted, allowing for linking. The creator is open to adding other important developers, big miners, or other proposals that may have been missed. Responses can be sent through BTC Talk or Github, as the creator does not read mailing due to spam. The link to the website is http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/.</summary>
