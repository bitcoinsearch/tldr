    <summary>Bitcoin is a complex system that involves many factors for its security. One of the aspects of security is Proof of Work (POW), an algorithm adopted by miners and created by developers. The security of Bitcoin depends on the actions of these two groups. If they were to do something insecure, Bitcoin's security would be compromised.However, POW is not the only factor in Bitcoin's security. There are many other aspects to consider, such as network uptime, software development, and protocol upgrades. All of these factors depend on human actions. In short, Bitcoin's security is not just about algorithms or protocols. It is a result of the collective actions of developers, miners, and users. Any compromise in these actions can lead to vulnerabilities in the system.</summary>
