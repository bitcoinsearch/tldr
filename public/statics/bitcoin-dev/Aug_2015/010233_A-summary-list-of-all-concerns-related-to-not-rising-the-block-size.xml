    <summary>The author has created two personal lists of arguments on "each side" to try and be objective. These lists may not hold any practical value, but they are maintained locally by the author. The author will only add arguments that they consider reasonable and understand, making it clear that they will not be impartial. The lists are in the public domain for anyone to use and modify. The author invites others to fork the threads with different criteria. The updated both-thread lists can be found at http://0bin.net/paste/igHZMgeoIbYjCJd9#ovaOUlSAKvQYT2p3VXuIuUmNk2XyLH-GnjR5NZMZgFb.</summary>
