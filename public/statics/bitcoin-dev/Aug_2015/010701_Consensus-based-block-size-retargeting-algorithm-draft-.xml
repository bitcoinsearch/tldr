    <summary>In an email exchange, Gavin asked about the cost for miners to include a 500-byte transaction if the average block size is 900K and it costs the miner 20BTC in electricity/capital/etc to mine a block. He calculated the cost to be 0.01111 BTC or $2.50 at today's exchange rate, which he deemed excessive. However, this calculation was not relevant to the proposal as miners are not paying to include an extra transaction. Instead, the BIP details how miners can vote for a larger block size limit during a window of 2016 blocks. The block size limit does not increase during this phase. The block size limit is adjusted at the end of the sample window and the new size is valid until the next retargetting. If clarification is needed, the proposal's author is available to provide specifics.</summary>
