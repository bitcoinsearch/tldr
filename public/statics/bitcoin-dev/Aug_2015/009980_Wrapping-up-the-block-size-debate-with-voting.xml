    <summary>On August 7, 2015, Dave Scotese raised a question on the bitcoin-dev forum regarding whether miners can unilaterally decide to change Bitcoin's protocol rules. He argued that miners would need to be a closed group and rely on the 51% rule to do so. However, Pieter Wuille responded by stating that miners don't need to use full nodes for propagation, and they only care about whether their blocks are ultimately accepted. Additionally, full nodes have the ability to change what blocks they accept, which is known as a hard fork.</summary>
