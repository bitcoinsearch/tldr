    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev list in August 2015, Gregory Maxwell suggested that analysis and options should be laid out before making any decisions on blocksize. Another participant agreed with Maxwell's view. A developer commented that they have mostly not made any comments on whether specific proposals were good or bad ideas except when they felt that proposals were broken for reasons other than the blocksize. They noted that some proposals had serious flaws regardless of thoughts on the blocksize while others were implemented well and thus did not comment on them. The developer suggested that it would be valuable to ask developers to explain their threat models and what should be at the root of their thinking about the blocksize.</summary>
