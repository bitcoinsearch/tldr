    <summary>The context discusses the potential of lightning and its adoption in Bitcoin. Early adopters of lightning would be in a favorable position to capitalize on it in the long term. The blocksize limitation is seen as a conflict of interest because it artificially creates demand for lightning, which would not exist if blockchain scaled reasonably. There is an ongoing debate regarding the increase of block size, and some developers stand against it. Some believe that miners should examine Bitcoin XT seriously, while others argue that miners are not competing with lightning and sidechains. Moreover, there are concerns about permanent ledger forks and the risk of other peopleâ€™s money at stake. Some developers feel that Core is no longer serving the interests of Bitcoin users, while others disagree with this statement. Overall, the discussion highlights the need for consensus, testing, and caution when making any changes to the protocol.</summary>
