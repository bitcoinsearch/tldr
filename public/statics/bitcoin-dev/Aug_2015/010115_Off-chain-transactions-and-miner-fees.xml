    <summary>A discussion among bitcoin developers on the efficiency of the Lightning Network (LN) took place on August 10, 2015. The topic was whether users of the LN would be willing to pay 100 times the fees that users of traditional transactions would pay for the same limited space in a blockchain. One argument was that users of the LN could group 100 real-world payments into one crude transaction. However, some participants argued that it does not make sense to pay for something you do not need, and paying something just because you have money is not a good business strategy.</summary>
