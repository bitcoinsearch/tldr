    <summary>The email conversation between Ken Friece and Eric Lombrozo on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list on August 15, 2015, discusses the risks of forking a ledger representing real assets that people are holding. Lombrozo believes that the risk of permanent ledger forks far outweighs whatever benefits any change in the protocol might bring. Lombrozo further states that the core developers are not the only people who should have a say in this matter; however, they are being held up by outside forces, which is deeply problematic. He recommends testing the hard fork mechanism with a less contentious change first. Furthermore, he counters Mike Hearn's claim that miners are in direct competition with the lightning network and sidechains for fees. Lombrozo also points out that most of the mining hash power is already voting for 8MB blocks BIP100 style. Lombrozo asks Hearn to stop using Bitcoin as his own political football and hurting his own reputation. Meanwhile, Hearn has released Bitcoin XT 0.11A, which includes the bigger blocks patch set, due to the Bitcoin Core project drifting too far from the principles that he feels are important. Hearn urges other developers to join him in the fork, stating that there is no other way to fix things.</summary>
