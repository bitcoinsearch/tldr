    <summary>In a discussion between Sergio Demian Lerner and Natanael, the former suggests that payment channel networks should be worked on to improve Bitcoin's payment time. Lerner argues that our time is mostly measured in minutes, and reducing payment times from 10 minutes to 1 minute would be a significant improvement. He gives an example of paying for parking while other cars are waiting behind you, stating that he wouldn't want them to get upset. Natanael responds by suggesting the use of multisignature notaries to ensure double-spend protection from the time of publication of the transaction to the first block confirmation, which would take a matter of seconds.</summary>
