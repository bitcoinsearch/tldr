    <summary>This context is an email conversation about a proposed solution to the bitcoin block size controversy. The proposed solution involves dynamically controlling the maximum block size based on the percentage of blocks in the last difficulty period that are higher or lower than a certain percentage of the maximum block size. If more than 90% of blocks are higher, then the maximum block size is doubled, and if more than 90% of blocks are lower, then the maximum block size is halved. This solution aims to increase or decrease the maximum block size based on transaction volume, ensuring rational derivation of the maximum block size. The email also lists other proposed solutions to the block size controversy, including making decentralized economic policy, elastic block cap with rollover penalties, increasing the maximum block size, block size following technological growth, and implementing the Bitcoin Lightning Network for scalable off-chain instant payments. The author invites opinions on their proposed solution and provides contact information for further discussion.</summary>
