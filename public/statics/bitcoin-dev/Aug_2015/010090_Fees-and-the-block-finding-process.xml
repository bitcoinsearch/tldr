    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón, the issue of raising the maximum block size in Bitcoin was discussed. One of the reasons for raising it was fear of network saturation and its consequences. Andresen stated that when networks become over-saturated, they become unreliable, which is a bad outcome. Additionally, without an increase to the max block size, the network will become both unreliable and expensive, which is even worse. Andresen also linked to previous articles he had written on the topic, expressing his frustration at having to answer questions that had already been addressed. Timón queried whether anything else would happen if the network ran out of capacity apart from minimum market fees rising above zero, to which Andresen replied that any consequences of fees rising were included in his concern. Finally, Andresen argued that the same argument for dealing with the issue now rather than later could be made about changes needed to support a larger block size.</summary>
