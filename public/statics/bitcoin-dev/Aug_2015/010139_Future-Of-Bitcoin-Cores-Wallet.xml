    <summary>The message suggests an alternative approach to serving SPV wallets from pruned storage. The proposed path suggests creating a bitcoinj based desktop wallet app that contains a bundled bitcoind, syncing two wallets simultaneously: one from the P2P network as today and another from the local bitcoind via a local socket passing buffers around internally. The app should then switch between using the wallet synced to P2P to the wallet synced to localhost when the latter is fully caught up and back again when the local node is behind. If there's a discrepancy, it alerts the user. There are several advantages of this approach over the current one. For instance, the switching back and forth between local full-security mode and remote SPV security is instant and transparent to the user, which is important for laptop users who don't run a local node all the time. Additionally, the modern JVM tools and languages are much more productive than working with C++. If one wants a thing that runs a home server, the best way to do that would be to bundle Tor and make it auto-register a Tor hidden service. Then one can define a QR code standard for 'pairing' a wallet to an onion address. Any bitcoinj based wallet can sync to it, and as it's one's node, one can use a Bloom filter sized to give virtually no false positives. No additional indexing is then required.</summary>
