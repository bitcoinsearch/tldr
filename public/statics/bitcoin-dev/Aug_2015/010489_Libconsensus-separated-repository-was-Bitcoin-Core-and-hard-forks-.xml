    <summary>In this thread, Eric Voskuil and Jorge Timón discuss the separation of libconsensus from Bitcoin Core to a separate repository. Timón suggests forking the libconsensus project for schism/controversial/contentious hardforks and modifying it rather than Bitcoin Core. However, Voskuil disagrees with this idea and believes that it is much safer to have already done the work of separating consensus portions of libconsensus from Bitcoin Core. He thinks that operating under the assumption that a hard fork can happen at any time is necessary. In response to Timón's suggestion, Voskuil explains that they never considered forking Bitcoin Core and still would not. Furthermore, he notes that there is currently consensus code all over the place, mainly in main.cpp, and changing the order would increase the total amount of work. Lastly, Timón proposes another option of finishing the libconsensus separation in an independent branch on top of a given version, then separate a repository from that. Alternative implementations can start using a full libconsensus, and Bitcoin Core can replace the consensus folder with the libconsensus subtree.</summary>
