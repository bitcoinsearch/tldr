    <summary>In a message sent on August 10th, 2015 to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alex Morcos expressed concern over the immaturity of blockchain technology and suggested that efforts should be focused on improving it before scaling to world acceptance levels. Thomas Zander replied suggesting the creation of a generator of transactions on the test network that a large number of people can run, which would generate useful data using randomization and actual estimation code. Zander also offered to volunteer his node to run the generator.</summary>
