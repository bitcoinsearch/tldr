    <summary>The discussion revolves around the concept of decentralization in Bitcoin. The writer acknowledges Justus's summary of what people want from decentralization. However, they argue that no Bitcoin user can define the term decentralization. They highlight the irony in the statements made by Bitcoin users and developers who claim that Bitcoin is decentralized because it's open-source but insist on controlling modifications to the code. The writer suggests that this belief is contradictory, referring to it as doublethink.</summary>
