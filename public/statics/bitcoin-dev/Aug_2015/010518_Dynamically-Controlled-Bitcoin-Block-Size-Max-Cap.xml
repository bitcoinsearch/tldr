    <summary>In August 2015, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the maximum block size consensus rule and its impact on mining centralization. One member suggested working on a decentralization metric instead of making bald claims. Another member, who had tested a simulation tool built by Pieter, found that small miners were not disadvantaged by large blocks when only testing for hashrate centralization effects and not network partitioning effects. The only person who commented on this result agreed with the findings and complimented Pieter's insight. The full discussion can be found in the provided link to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
