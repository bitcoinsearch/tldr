    <summary>In an email exchange between Ross Nicoll and Luke Dashjr on August 10, 2015, they discussed the limitations of BIP 70 in supporting different testnets and alternative coins. Ross proposed a new optional "genesis" field to identify chains without any central registry, but Luke pointed out that genesis blocks are not necessarily unique. They also discussed using the most recent block hash for fork detection, but it could advertise if a merchant is on the wrong fork. Ross emphasized that avoiding future problems is the main benefit of the proposal. However, Luke reminded him that BIPs are for Bitcoin improvements specifically, and suggested that the proposal could address the need for payments made of bitcoins on a sidechain by allowing payment directly on the sidechain at the customer's choice.</summary>
