    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen responded to Pieter Wuille's statement that the mining landscape was very centralised. He said that although many companies prefer to outsource mining validation, it is not a problem unless some unnatural barriers to competition occur. As Bitcoin grows, pieces of the ecosystem will specialise, and he sees this as a natural maturation process. In his opinion, Bitcoin can "work" with gigabyte blocks today if everyone uses the same few blockchain validation services, the same few online wallets, and mining is done by a cartel that only allows joining after signing a contract so they can sue you if you create an invalid block. Andresen wants to build a system that works for hundreds of millions of people, with no central point of control and the opportunity for anybody to participate at any level.</summary>
