    <summary>Gavin Andresen via bitcoin-dev requested for a higher-level description of the user experience, the communication that occurs beneath it, and the infrastructure needed to make it all work in relation to Lightning. Joseph Poon is currently writing a summary on Lightning with a focus on UX. Poon noted that all Lightning services/wallets should support on-chain payments to ensure usability and security/fungibility. Therefore, the payment flow after channels are established should not be significantly different from Payment Protocol-based payment flows.</summary>
