    <summary>In this email exchange, Eric Lombrozo and Hector Chu discuss the potential risks associated with increasing block size in Bitcoin. Lombrozo argues that larger blocks are linked to a higher propensity for consensus forks, which can lead to incidents requiring manual intervention and good-faith cooperation between core developers and mining pool operators. He asserts that security should be prioritized over greater throughput and that fixing issues that can lead to these incidents should take precedence over trying to increase block size. Chu argues that a little cooperation is necessary at times for the system to work efficiently and that the incentives of Bitcoin remain intact even with larger blocks. However, Lombrozo cautions against assuming that altruism will always prevail and warns against designing a system around such an assumption.</summary>
