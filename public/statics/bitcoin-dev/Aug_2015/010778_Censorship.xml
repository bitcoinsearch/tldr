    <summary>The email thread discusses the creation of a decentralized forum that integrates the Bitcoin blockchain with every post. The sender expresses surprise that no one has done this yet, despite similar projects existing. They propose a parallel program that stores most data in a hash reference table and shares it via a torrent-esque system. The sender also mentions a subreddit for discussing decentralized communication mechanisms and expresses interest in contributing to making them usable and popular. They advocate for letting users pick their own moderators and filters instead of relying on centralized forums. The thread goes on to discuss the centralization and censorship of the Bitcoin community, which inhibits its growth and scares away potential participants. The discussion proposes creating a heavily moderated forum that is not for opinions but for spam and noise control. The need for leadership and proper moderation is emphasized, along with an official seal of approval from top XT people. The email ends with a link to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
