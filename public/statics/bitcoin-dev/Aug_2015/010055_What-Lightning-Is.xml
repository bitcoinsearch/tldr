    <summary>Pieter Wuille, in a message to Bitcoin developers, expressed concern about Bitcoin losing its appeal. He discussed how Bob would receive money using the Lightning Network and highlighted two possible sources of funding for Bob's increased claim: a deposit from Bob's payment hub or Bob's previous spends. However, these sources of funding have limitations and pose issues such as third-party dependency, fees, and centralization incentives. Wuille concluded that the need for a powerful middleman to send and receive money effectively with the Lightning Network is uninteresting.</summary>
