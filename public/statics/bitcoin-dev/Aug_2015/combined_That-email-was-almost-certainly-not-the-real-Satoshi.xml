    <summary>A security expert named Jonathan Wilkins shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that the server hosting vistomail.com is in disarray. He stated that it is a Plesk box with multiple services having questionable security histories and many open ports. Wilkins provided an nmap scan report for vistomail.com, which showed that there were multiple services running on the server, including MailEnable smtpd, MSRPC, RDP, Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5, and more. The server appears to be running on Microsoft Windows operating system and could be a general-purpose device or a phone. It is unclear whether the open ports are due to poor security practices or if the server is a honeypot.The Nmap scan report for the website shows that there are numerous open ports, including Microsoft ftpd, MailEnable smptd 8.60, Microsoft DNS 6.1.7601, Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5, MailEnable POP3 Server, Microsoft Windows RPC, MailEnable imapd, and Microsoft Terminal Service. Additionally, there are SSL/HTTP and HTTP-alt ports open. The SSL certificates for the website are not valid before May 3, 2015 and after May 2, 2018, respectively. However, due to at least one open and closed port being unidentifiable, OSScan's results may be unreliable. Therefore, it is suspected that someone has hacked into the server.Wilkins informed the bitcoin-dev community of the potential insecurity of the vistomail.com server and prompted further investigation into its security practices through his email. It is essential to note that the purpose of the email was to alert the community about the issue and encourage them to take necessary precautions rather than provide a solution to the problem.</summary>
