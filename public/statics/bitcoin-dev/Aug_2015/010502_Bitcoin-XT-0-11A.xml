    <summary>The security of Bitcoin is dependent on the actions of its developers, users, and miners. If a majority of these parties engage in insecure behavior, then the entire ecosystem becomes vulnerable to exploitation. This means that nobody should have the power to affect Bitcoin as a whole, regardless of how many miners or companies they may lobby. In fact, if such influence is possible, it indicates that Bitcoin's security is not as robust as previously believed. Therefore, it is crucial for all stakeholders to prioritize secure practices in order to maintain the integrity of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
