    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev forum post, Peter R has expressed his concern over the centralization of nodes, mining and development in Bitcoin Core. He believes that with 85% node share around Bitcoin Core, it is possible for a group of coders to prevent important changes from being made in a timely fashion if their interests no longer align with those of the larger Bitcoin community. In response, Allen Piscitello agreed that decentralization is essential for Bitcoin to be a useful alternative. Gavin Andresen wants multiple robust implementations of the core protocol. Peter R argues that reducing the network's dependency on Core by supporting multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol would be a good strategy.</summary>
