    <summary>On August 10, 2015 at 1:55 pm, Jorge Tim√≥n sent a message to bitcoin-dev, discussing the block size debate. In his message, he interpreted the lack of response to questions about increasing consensus block size as an agreement that the only reason for doing so would be to avoid minimum market fees from rising above zero. He requested that anyone with a different perspective share their reasoning.Shortly after, Thomas Zander replied, directing readers to his various emails in the last hour.</summary>
