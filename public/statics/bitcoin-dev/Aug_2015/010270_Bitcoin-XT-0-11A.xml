    <summary>In an email exchange on August 16, 2015, Tamas Blummer discussed his views on Bitcoin software development and entrepreneurship. He stated that success is not solely based on technology or inevitability. Blummer expressed his support for the BitcoinXT manifesto created by Mike and Gavin, stating that it provides a choice for entrepreneurs. In response to this email, Adam asked Blummer if he believes that BIP 101, BIP 102, BIP 103, and the Flexcap proposal should be given equal consideration. Additionally, Adam invited Blummer to participate in the BIP review process and attend the workshop on Bitcoin scaling.</summary>
