    <summary>Chun Wang suggested that the tx fee collected could be manipulated by miners in response to Proposal 1. A new approach was presented by Peter Todd, proposing that coin holders have a vote for the max block size and miners could still vote BIP100 style. This would give all parties a clear voice in the matter, making the results more legitimate and less controversial. The email also included a digital signature from Peter Todd.</summary>
