    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-Development mailing list, Rusty Russell proposed an IsStandard() rule that would ensure nSequence is either 0xFFFFFFFF or 0 in order to avoid issues with soft forks. However, jl2012 pointed out that this was not necessary because BIP68 is not active for version 1 transactions and no existing wallets would be affected. Rusty also suggested applying nLockTime even if nSequence != 0xFFFFFFFF but later withdrew the suggestion after Mark pointed out its uses.</summary>
