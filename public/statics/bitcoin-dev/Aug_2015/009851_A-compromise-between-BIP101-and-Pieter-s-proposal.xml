    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer on the Bitcoin project, raised the question of what would have happened if Bitcoin had 8 MB blocks from the start. He speculated that more people would have been running high-transaction-rate use cases on the chain, resulting in regularly seeing 4-6 MB blocks. The proposal suggests scaling the cap based on technology growth while still having a cap to prevent negative consequences. The author suggests that once this is done, there should be less concern about efficiency and allowing users to work within the created space to figure out how to make good things happen.</summary>
