    <summary>The conversation starts with a question about self-assigning a bip number, which is related to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. The document mentioned in the conversation is BIP-0001. Moving forward, it is stated that the big data analysis market was valued at $125bn in 2015 by IDC. As the Bitcoin blockchain replaces existing payment systems and attracts millions or hundreds of millions of users, the intrinsic value of the data in the block chain will increase, making it attractive to data analytics businesses and blockchain start-ups. However, it is pointed out that this proposal can potentially make Bitcoin the most Orwellian money ever and goes against proposals like CoinJoin. Finally, the speaker thinks that this idea won't be accepted by the Bitcoin community.</summary>
