    <title>Revisiting NODE_BLOOM: Proposed BIP</title>

    <summary>In an email thread on August 21, 2015, Peter Todd via bitcoin-dev reported a DoS attack on the Bitcoin XT nodes. This attack involved repeated Bloom filter requests that consumed disk IO bandwidth. Matt Corallo asked for the best reference for the DoS issues. In response, Peter Todd suggested referencing the ongoing attack on Mike Hearn's Bitcoin fork. The attack seems to have prompted the need to write a BIP and make changes that would begin the process of dropping support for the most broadly successful class of wallets, which is enabled by Mike Hearn's SPV client library.</summary>
