    <summary>The proposal titled "URI scheme for Blockchain exploration" by Marco Pontello suggests a simple URI scheme for looking up blocks, transactions and addresses on a blockchain explorer. The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to handle all the requests for details about blocks, transactions, etc. with their preferred tool, whether it be a web service or a local application. Currently, a Bitcoin client usually points to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when the user looks for the details of a transaction. Sometimes, resorting to cut-and-paste is needed, as well as for posts and messages that reference some particular txs or blocks. The proposed URI follows a simple form: blockchain: &lt;hash&gt;. Examples include blockchain:00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198, blockchain:001949, and blockchain:3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a. The author suggests that keeping it simple should be practical enough, and blockchain explorers can apply the same disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search box. Using this scheme means that wallet developers (or other tools that need to show any kind of Blockchain references) can simply make it a blockchain: link and be done with it, without having to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the user to select one. Blockchain explorers, in turn, will simply offer to handle the blockchain: URI, the first time the user visits their website, or launch/install the application, or even set themselves if there isn't already one. Users get the convenience of using always their preferred explorer, which can be especially handy on mobile devices, where juggling with cut-and-paste is far from ideal.</summary>
