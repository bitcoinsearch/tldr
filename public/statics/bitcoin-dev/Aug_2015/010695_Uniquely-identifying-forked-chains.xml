    <summary>In August 2015, a discussion on the use of hash of hashes in identifying chains was brought up on bitcoin-dev mailing list. A user suggested using either the genesis block hash or the block hash of the first block in a fork to identify chains. The latter seems like the best solution in the schism hardfork case as it avoids hurting bystander users who cannot tell the difference between the old and new currency/chain. The user proposed extending BIP99's section on schism hardforks. Another user proposed identifying blockchains for BIP 21 and any other relevant needs through the genesis block hash for a new chain or a hash of the genesis block hash concatenated with block hash(es) of fork point(s) for a fork chain. This would support forks, forks of forks, forks of forks of forks, etc while preserving a fixed length chain identifier. Multiple chains can be coexisting and actively mined during times of existence.</summary>
