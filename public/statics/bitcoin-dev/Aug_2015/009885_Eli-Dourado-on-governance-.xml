    <summary>In an email exchange in August 2015, Gavin Andresen discussed the idea of a foundation for bitcoin with GJB. He pointed out that one of the issues with the existing Bitcoin Foundation was that it tried to represent everyone's interests, which often conflicted. Instead, he suggested that groups with similar interests, such as exchanges, should come together and reach consensus on important issues, like the block size debate. This approach would allow stakeholders to advocate for their own interests without being overshadowed by others.</summary>
