    <summary>On August 24, 2015, Matt Corallo discussed the possibility of advertising NODE_BLOOM instead of NODE_NETWORK in the future. He stated that it could be an interesting thing to do and is not against the spec. Peter Todd acknowledged this proposal. Though there is little reason to do so now, some proposals may make this more useful in the future. A digital signature was also included in the email.</summary>
