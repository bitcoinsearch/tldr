    <summary>In an email exchange on August 19, 2015, Joseph Poon and Mark Friedenbach discussed the inversion of nSequence in mempool transaction selection. Jorge Tim√≥n had previously expressed disagreement with the inversion in a pull request on Github. While Poon is indifferent to the issue, he does express concern about technical debt and notes that transactions with shorter relative locks have higher priority. The group ultimately agrees to remove the inversion for ease of use and mental calculation. A digital signature is included in the email as an attachment.</summary>
