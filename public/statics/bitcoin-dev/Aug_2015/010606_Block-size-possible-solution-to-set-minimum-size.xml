    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bdimych Bdimych suggested that the main problem with the CoreXT fork was the possibility of double spending. He proposed a solution of setting a minimum block size to prevent double spending and suggested filling free space with zeroes and compressing them. However, Jorge Tim√≥n responded that a minimum block size does not prevent the problems that come from schism hardforks. Furthermore, he stated that miners can easily cheat a minimum block size by paying themselves as many times as they need in the same block. He provided a link to a previous post explaining this.</summary>
