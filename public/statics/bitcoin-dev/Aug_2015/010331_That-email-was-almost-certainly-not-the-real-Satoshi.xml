    <summary>The server hosting vistomail.com is in disarray, with a Plesk box and multiple services with questionable security histories. The Nmap scan report for the website shows that there are numerous open ports, including Microsoft ftpd, MailEnable smptd 8.60, Microsoft DNS 6.1.7601, Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5, MailEnable POP3 Server, Microsoft Windows RPC, MailEnable imapd, and Microsoft Terminal Service. Additionally, there are SSL/HTTP and HTTP-alt ports open. The server appears to be running on Microsoft Windows 2008, 7, Vista, or Phone. The SSL certificates for the website are not valid before May 3, 2015 and after May 2, 2018, respectively. However, due to at least one open and closed port being unidentifiable, OSScan's results may be unreliable. It is suspected that someone has hacked into the server.</summary>
