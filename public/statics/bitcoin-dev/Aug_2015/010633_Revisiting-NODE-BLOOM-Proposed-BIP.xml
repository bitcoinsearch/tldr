    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of a bloom filter in Bitcoin's client/server architecture. The ability to switch filtering on and off globally and per-connection basis was suggested. However, some participants pointed out that it would be better to replace the bloom filter with proper authentication and access controls in an actual client/server architecture. The use of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) was also criticized for its inefficiency. Meanwhile, BIP 111 was assigned, and a pull request with proposed changes was made available on Github.</summary>
