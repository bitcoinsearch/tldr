    <summary>On August 20, 2015, Milly Bitcoin suggested to a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list that they should create a standardized metric to compare decentralized systems. The idea was to link "centralization pressure" and "pressure to merge with a big miner" to an overall decentralization metric, which would then allow for specific use cases to be measured. The group discussed how big miners reduce decentralization and how measuring decentralization in software projects like Bitcoin is complicated. They also referenced papers on measuring decentralization in political systems and suggested that a system would need to be developed to apply to software projects like Bitcoin.</summary>
