    <summary>On August 11, 2015, Venzen Khaosan responded to a message from Elliot Olds via Bitcoin-dev discussing the reliability of Bitcoin with regards to block size. Elliot argued that for any particular use case of Bitcoin, that use case will be more reliable with a larger block size, disregarding centralization effects. Venzen pointed out that it is not useful to discuss hypothetical scenarios involving Bitcoin while ignoring centralization effects. Pieter then argued for the existence of an effect on reliability that was independent of centralization risk. However, when arguing that this effect does not exist, it is appropriate to hold centralization risk constant.</summary>
