    <summary>In an email conversation, Michael Naber questioned how many nodes would be required to ensure network reliability and at what point adding more nodes would have a negligible impact on the system. However, Pieter argued that the issue was not about reliability as there were already enough nodes for synchronization and other network functions. The real concern is about reducing trust in the network. Running a full node and using it to verify transactions ensures that everyone is following the rules. Even if someone else uses full nodes, it is valuable to know that they are doing so. Running 1000 nodes in a data center without using them is pointless as it adds network capacity without use. Nonetheless, the full node count is still significant because it indicates how difficult it is to run or use a full node, providing feedback. However, it is not the goal but merely an indicator.</summary>
