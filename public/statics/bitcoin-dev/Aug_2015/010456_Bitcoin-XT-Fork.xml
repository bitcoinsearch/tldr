    <summary>The Bitcoin Core developer community is in turmoil over the release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, a fork of the cryptocurrency created by Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn. The release was made in response to concerns about the 1MB block limit that could prevent Bitcoin from supporting increased traffic and users. However, many claim that Andresen did not follow the correct channels in releasing this version of Bitcoin, bypassing the review process and risking a controversial hard fork deployment war.Adam Back, who is on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, expressed his disappointment at this move, stating that the Bitcoin XT project did not even pretend to work through the proper process involved with Bitcoin development. Additionally, Back claims that no one else was reckless enough to try to start a deployment in such a way, and warns that the damage to community reputation and collaborative environment that this all causes is optimally bad. Satoshi Nakamoto himself voiced his concerns too, stating that if two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, then he will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project. This suggests that there is a significant amount of disagreement within the Bitcoin community about the direction that the protocol should take.The context appears to be an email or post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation. The post contains a PGP signature at the beginning and end, which is a way of verifying the authenticity and integrity of the message. It seems that the post is intended for members of the Bitcoin development community who are subscribed to the mailing list. The purpose of the post is unclear, as there is no content included in the message other than the PGP signature and links to the mailing list.Overall, the context suggests that this is a technical discussion forum focused on the development of the Bitcoin protocol and related technologies. Participants are likely to have a high level of technical expertise and familiarity with cryptographic tools like PGP signatures.</summary>
