    <summary>In August 2015, Eric Lombrozo sent a message to bitcoin-dev expressing concern about the confusion between source code forks and blockchain forks. He suggested that the community make it clear they are not against a code fork where someone acts as a "benevolent dictator," but only against the controversial hardfork being attempted by Mike Hearn. Lombrozo noted that if this distinction is not made clear, users may sell all their BTC for XTBTC or forget about BTC entirely in favor of XTBTC.</summary>
