    <summary>Oliver Egginger sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list requesting the removal of Satoshi's old email addresses and blocking them. Jorge Timón questioned the reason for blocking the email addresses and suggested that it shouldn't matter who the author of a post is, but rather the content. Oliver explained that it was to avoid confusion and people abusing Satoshi's name to present their personal views on an issue. Jorge agreed that people had been using Satoshi's name to present their views in the block size debate, but he personally didn't care about the author's identity as only the arguments matter.</summary>
