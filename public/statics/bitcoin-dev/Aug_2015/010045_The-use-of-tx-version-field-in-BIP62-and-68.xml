    <summary>The author of an email suggests that the current version selection for transactions is not optimal, as it does not allow selective application of new consensus rules. The author proposes dividing the transaction version field into two parts, with the higher 4 bits indicating which BIPs are active and the lower 28 bits allowing for 28 independent BIPs. This would make it easier to repurpose nSequence or take advantage of malleability in the future. Additionally, the author notes that some current BIPs, such as BIP62 and BIP68, may cause issues when introducing a new script system with a soft fork. The author emphasizes the need for caution when implementing soft forks to ensure enough flexibility for future development.</summary>
