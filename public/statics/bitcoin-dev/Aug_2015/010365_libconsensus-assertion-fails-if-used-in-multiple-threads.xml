    <summary>A pull request has been submitted for Bitcoin Core's libconsensus to fix a rare bug that can cause parallel transaction validation to produce incorrect results. The patch, produced by Cory Fields, has already been tested in Bits of Proof's stack and is performing well. While it may not be necessary for the next release of Core, Fields believes it should be backported to the 0.10 and 0.9 series. Additionally, he notes that Core is switching to libsecp256k1 for several reasons, including speed. Fields adds that there is no timeline for secp256k1 integration. Finally, Fields disputes Tamas Blummer's claim that modern implementations that validate transactions in multiple threads are affected by the OpenSSL race issue; according to Fields, only those using ancient versions of OpenSSL or those with OPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT support disabled should be affected.</summary>
