    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Gavin Andresen had an email exchange discussing the blockchain's accessibility for low-fee transactions and reliability for medium-fee transactions due to sudden influxes of high fee-paying users. Andresen said he was okay with marginal transactions being priced out if the network couldn't handle the transaction volume people want to pay for. When Wuille asked why an 8 MB block size was acceptable but a 1 MB block size was not, Andresen replied that "better is better" but he was willing to deploy imperfect solutions if they addressed short-term problems. Wuille proposed increasing the block size to address the issue of being "forever locked at the same scale" while technology evolves, but Andresen disagreed, stating that consensus was against Wuille on that point. The email exchange sheds light on the ongoing debate surrounding the scalability of Bitcoin's blockchain, with some advocating for larger block sizes to accommodate more transactions and others arguing for maintaining the current size to prioritize decentralization and security.</summary>
