    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding asked if payment hubs advance credit and Mark Friedenbach responded that they do not. The funds are debited from a payment hub and simultaneously credited from either another payment hub or the person making the payment so that the net funds flow at a payment hub always sums to zero. Bitcoin fees do not play a part in this balance. However, there are costs associated with running a payment hub such as transaction fees, lost interest or opportunity cost on locked up funds, networking and electricity, which would be passed on as costs to the clients of the payment hub. Tom Harding predicts that hubs will assess fees for depositing funds that may depend on the amount deposited and the amount of time it stays there.</summary>
