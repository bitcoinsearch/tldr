    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Btc Drak expressed his concern about the mailing list being overloaded with non-technical discussion, drowning out its technical content. He suggested creating a separate email list for non-technical discussions and leaving the original one for academic and technical debates. However, someone else pointed out that such a list already exists but is not as efficient as intended. Others agreed with Drak’s suggestion of separating Bitcoin Core-specific development from general bips and consensus discussions to create a less noisy platform for developers of alternative implementations. The idea was met with positivity, though some were skeptical about its potential benefits.</summary>
