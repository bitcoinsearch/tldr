    <summary>The context discusses different proposals for increasing the blocksize of Bitcoin. Peter's proposal suggests a gradual increase over time, matching blocksize growth with technological bandwidth growth. However, it ignores the last 6 years and underestimates storage and bandwidth growth. Ryan Butler believes that designing any growth rate on theoretical centralization pressure is not sensible and Peter's proposal lacks technical criteria. Butler also argues that we can design an increase to blocksize that increases available space on chain and follows technological evolution. On the other hand, Peter seems to believe in decreasing the need for trust required in off-chain systems. Butler disagrees, stating that relying solely on an off-chain settlement layer will lead to centralization. Butler suggests that a reasonable node test is sufficient for maintaining decentralization. He believes that a raspberry pie 2 node on reasonable internet connection with a hard drive can run a node with 8 or 20mb blocks easily. The proposal indicates that if the growth factor exceeds what technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a tighter limit. Butler agrees with this approach but suggests being ahead of the curve rather than behind it.</summary>
