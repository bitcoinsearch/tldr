    <title>Splitting BIPs</title>

    <summary>The author of this post suggests that there is a lot of unnecessary contention within the Bitcoin development community over things that don't really need to be agreed upon. To help prioritize efforts, they propose adding an extra attribute to BIPs indicating their "level," which would be split into five categories: consensus (hard/soft fork), peer services, RPC, implementations, and applications. The author provides an example of what such a table might look like on blockhawk.net/bitcoin-dev/bipwiki.html and offers to work on a BIP draft if others agree that this is a good idea.</summary>
