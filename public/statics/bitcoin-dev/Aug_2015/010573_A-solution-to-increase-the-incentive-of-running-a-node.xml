    <summary>In a conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jameson Lopp discusses the incentives of running a full node on the Bitcoin network. He argues that while these incentives may not be obvious to the average user, they do exist. Having a local copy of the blockchain that has been validated by oneself is essential to maintaining trustlessness in the system. Additionally, supporting the network through running a node may be seen as necessary out of altruism or as an incentive to protect one's investments in Bitcoin. Tamas Blummer responds to this discussion, noting that the implicit value of validating oneself may become even higher in a heterogenous environment where there are hard forks in the wild. He also points out that pooled mining became an option due to the homogenous nature of the network.</summary>
