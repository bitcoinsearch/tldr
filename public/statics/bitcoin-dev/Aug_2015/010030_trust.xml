    <summary>In this email conversation, Adam Back and Thomas Zander discuss the topic of trust in Bitcoin. Back clarifies that off-chain use of Bitcoin with trusted middlemen is not what he meant previously. He agrees that some people are fine with trusting others for off-chain use cases, but it should not weaken Bitcoin's security. In a world where scale and decentralization are possible, providing more security than people want would be useful, as sometimes people only understand the importance of security after something goes wrong. Lightning-like protocols may provide security at scale.</summary>
