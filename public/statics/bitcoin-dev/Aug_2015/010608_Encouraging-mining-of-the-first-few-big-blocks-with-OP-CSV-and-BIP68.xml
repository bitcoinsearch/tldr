    <summary>In September, someone plans to burn 150BTC to create a backlog of 30 days. The money could be used better by incentivizing mining of the first few big blocks assuming OP_CSV and BIP68 are enabled and max tx size remains 1MB. The donor will create a transaction with an input of 150BTC and 10 outputs ranging from 0 to 42 BTC with "OP_CSV" tags. The first output will fill up the size to 1MB. Pre-hardfork miner won't be able to confirm this transaction as the coinbase tx will consume some block space. The first big block miner will collect 66BTC of fee, and the block confirming the first big block will collect 42BTC of fee, creating a long enough chain to bootstrap the hardfork. The amount is chosen to ensure that the difference is covered.</summary>
