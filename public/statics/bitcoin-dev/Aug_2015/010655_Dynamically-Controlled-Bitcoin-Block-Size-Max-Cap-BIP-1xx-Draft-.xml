    <title>Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap [BIP 1xx - Draft]</title>

    <summary>The email chain discussion is requested to focus on the proposed draft of DynamicMaxBlockSize instead of voting process. The link to the proposal is provided in the email for reference. A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Hector Chu, proposed using CLTV (CheckLockTimeVerify) to lock coins as a better alternative to counting votes from UTXO set. However, if a soft-fork to implement CLTV is not feasible, counting votes from the UTXO set is still an acceptable option, albeit less strong evidence of commitment. Peter Todd suggested a toy example of XORing a vote with SHA256 of the entire blockchain, but it was deemed ineffective by Hector Chu.</summary>
