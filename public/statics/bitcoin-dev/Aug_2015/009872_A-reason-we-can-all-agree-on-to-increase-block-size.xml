    <summary>In an email exchange between Hector Chu and Eric Lombrozo from August 3, 2015, they discuss the issue of larger blocks leading to consensus disagreement and manual intervention. Lombrozo argues that there have already been two incidents requiring good-faith cooperation between core devs and mining pool operators that would have ended up costing a lot of people a lot of money had no action been taken. He states that there is strong evidence linking larger blocks with the propensity for consensus forks that require manual intervention. Moreover, he believes that increasing block size cannot possibly make these forking tendencies better but very well could make them worse. Lombrozo urges the prioritization of fixing the issues that can lead to these incidents rather than trying to increase throughput. In contrast, Chu argues that cooperation is necessary for mutual benefits, and he asserts that the block size is political because it affects nearly all users to some degree. He suggests that the system will reorganize and readjust after the move to big blocks in a way that still has a reasonable degree of decentralization and trustlessness.</summary>
