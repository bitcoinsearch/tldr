    <summary>On August 20, 2015, NxtChg via bitcoin-dev revealed that Jorge Timón had made the most posts with a total of 72. Despite believing that his posts were on-topic, he acknowledged that some repetition could have been avoided. His focus has been on linking to threads or documents to make his comments shorter. However, he admitted that most of his posts centered around general consensus topics rather than specific Bitcoin Core development issues. In light of this, he apologized for setting an unplanned record. The conversation took place in the context of a discussion about separating the bitcoin-consensus and bitcoin-dev lists.</summary>
