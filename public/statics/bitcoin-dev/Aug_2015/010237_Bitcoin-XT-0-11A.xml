    <summary>Mike Hearn, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has released Bitcoin XT 0.11A with the bigger blocks patch set. According to him, the Bitcoin Core Project had drifted so far from the principles that he and many others feel are important that a fork is the only way to fix things. Hearn believes that forking is a natural thing in the open-source community, and often, people say there was insufficient communication. To ensure everything is crystal clear, he has written a blog post and a kind of manifesto describing why this is happening and how XT plans to be different from Core.However, what seems unfair is that only miners get to vote and decide, while users will have nothing to say about it. Even individual miners will not vote since mostly mining pools will do it, and individual small miners will accept whatever their pool runs on. If 20% of the miners go away, the network will still operate normally, and the btc/usd price will be the same. But if 20% of the users go away, then the btc/usd price will drop, which could force miners to quit. The btc/usd rate is based on supply and demand, and only users take part in this. Users have more control over miners. So, it's unfair to ignore them. Although he uses Bitcoin heavily, he doesn't mine, and he cannot vote. He missed the argument explaining why users don't matter and only miners do.</summary>
