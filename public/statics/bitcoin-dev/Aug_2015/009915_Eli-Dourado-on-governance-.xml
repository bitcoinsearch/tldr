    <summary>On August 4, 2015, Bitcoin developers were discussing the results of a prediction market called blocksizedebate.com. However, one developer named Anthony Towns found the results implausible, pointing out that the PH/s rate is higher with bigger blocks, but this is surprising since the site also predicts USD/BTC will be $280 with no change but $555 with bigger blocks, so he assumes that difference is mostly due to price. The increase in transaction volume due to the block size increase was only 15%, which he finds lower than expected, and he suggests that a 1.5MB-2MB max block size would probably be enough for the next two years. He also notes that predicting that the node count will drop from ~5000 to ~1200 due to increasing block sizes seems quite an indictment as far as centralisation risks go, but given he's not convinced by the other predictions, he's not sure he wants to give that much weight to that one either.</summary>
