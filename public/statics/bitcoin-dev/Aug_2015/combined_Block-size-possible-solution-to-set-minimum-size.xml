    <summary>In the world of cryptocurrencies, there is a fork known as CoreXT which faces the problem of double spending. This issue arises when an individual uses the XT software to spend their coins and it is written in an 8mb block, but the Core software does not accept this block. However, if the individual then uses Core to spend their coins again, it is written in a 1mb block which the XT software accepts. This results in both blocks (8 and 1) containing the individual's coins in the XT blockchain. To tackle this problem, a possible solution could be to set a minimum block size of 1mb for each block in the blockchain. In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bdimych Bdimych suggested this solution and also proposed filling free space with zeroes and compressing them. However, Jorge Tim贸n responded that a minimum block size does not prevent the problems that come from schism hardforks. He further stated that miners can easily cheat a minimum block size by paying themselves as many times as they need in the same block. It is recommended to search for previous posts before proposing or asking something.</summary>
