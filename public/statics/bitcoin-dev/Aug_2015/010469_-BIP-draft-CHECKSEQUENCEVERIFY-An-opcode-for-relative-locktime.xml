    <summary>The email exchange between Joseph Poon and Mark Friedenbach via bitcoin-dev discusses the issue of mempool transaction selection. Poon mentions that while he is indifferent to the issue, he dislikes technical debt and notes that transactions with shorter relative locks have higher priority. He suggests that those who wish to do/write-code-for mempool transaction selection keep this in mind. Friedenbach had asked for anyone with strong opinions on the matter to speak up. Poon also mentions that changing the policy code should be simple.</summary>
