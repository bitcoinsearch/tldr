    <summary>The issue of Gavin Andresen's commit privileges for the Bitcoin Core repository has been debated among developers. Btc Drak expressed concern that Andresen had abused the pull-req process by deleting other users' comments on his own pull-reqs and censoring posts. Odinn agreed with this assessment, stating that it was inconsistent with the responsibility of having commit access. However, some developers are cautious about removing Andresen's privileges from a PR standpoint, as he and Mike have been clever in framing the issue as "obstructionism from the core devs" and relying on confusion between source code forks and blockchain forks.</summary>
