    <summary>Several developers, including Wladimir, Greg, Peter Todd, Pieter, and Alex Morcos, have been discussing ways to improve the signal-to-noise ratio on the bitcoin-dev list. One proposal was to split the list into multiple mailing lists, but it was pointed out that a less technical Bitcoin discussion list already existed in the past but had not been used. The discussion moved towards instituting on-topic guidelines for bitcoin-dev instead of creating yet another mailing list. Gavin, Wladimir, and a few others agreed to a few paragraphs written by Alex Morcos, which Wladimir agreed to post. Btc Drak suggested offloading non-technical/academic debate to the bitcoin list to reduce the off-topic noise of bitcoin-dev. This would require some shepherding, and he expressed willingness to help out. It was suggested that general discussions had little use on bitcoin-dev because there were no rules to force them over to the bitcoin list. The discussion also touched on the idea of establishing two lists, but many felt that it would not make much difference as long as Bitcoin Core remained the reference client. There were questions about who the moderators for the bitcoin list were and whether sourceforge was the best platform for the list.</summary>
