    <summary>The proposed BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) extends BIP 37 by defining a service bit to allow peers to advertise their support for bloom filters explicitly. The proposal adds a new protocol bit called NODE_BLOOM, which sets nodes that support bloom filters apart from others that do not. It is also suggested that DNS seeds and other peer-discovery mechanisms should support the ability to specify required services. The proposal aims to address some of the privacy issues associated with connection filtering algorithms and reduce DoS risks on some nodes. The increase in protocol version from 70002 to 70011 is for backward compatibility. While old nodes may still use a protocol version smaller than 70011 but larger than 70000, it is recommended that clients requiring bloom filtered connections avoid making this assumption. After sufficient time for SPV clients to upgrade, an updated version will be released, resulting in older SPV clients being disconnected from peers when they send filter commands. This feature may be removed once there are enough NODE_BLOOM nodes available and SPV clients have upgraded, allowing node operators to fully close the bloom-related DoS vectors.The proposal is currently a draft and is available on GitHub for review. This document is placed in the public domain.</summary>
