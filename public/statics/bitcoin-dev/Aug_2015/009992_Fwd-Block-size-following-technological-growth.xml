    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Zander and Pieter Wuille discussed the issue of low node count in the Bitcoin network. Zander argued that nodes are meant for people to stop trusting someone they have no trust-relationship with. However, he also acknowledged that running a node is only necessary if one doesn't know anyone they can trust to run it for them. Wuille countered this argument by stating that the lack of need for trust is Bitcoin's fundamental improvement over other systems and that increased adoption should lead to an increased incentive for people to use a full node. He expressed concern over the decreasing trend in node count and suggested that there may be a problem with the incentives for running a node not weighing up against the cost/difficulty of using one oneself.</summary>
