    <summary>A proposal draft has been posted which is still in need of some fleshing out in the subsections. The author welcomes any comments or suggestions regarding this. Eric Lombrozo replied to the post suggesting that there are different degrees of 'standard' and that just because a lot of people do something doesn't necessarily mean it is officially endorsed by other developers. In order to prioritize, an extra attribute should be added to BIPs indicating their 'level', which should be split into five categories: consensus (hard/soft fork), peer services, RPC, implementations, and applications. An example table for this can be found here: http://blockhawk.net/bitcoin-dev/bipwiki.html. If others agree with this idea, a BIP draft will be worked on.</summary>
