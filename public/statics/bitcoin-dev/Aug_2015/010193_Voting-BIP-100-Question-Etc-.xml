    <summary>The author of the message is seeking information on how miners would vote on BIP 100, assuming it becomes a viable option. They reference a post on Bitcoin Stack Exchange for some information, but are unclear on when miners would take action. Additionally, the author poses a follow-up question about when BIP 100 will be published and moved to 'accepted' status on GitHub. It is not entirely clear from the message what BIP 100 entails. However, the author's focus is on the process of miner voting and the timeline for publication. They provide links to their website and Keybase profile.</summary>
