    <summary>This is a conversation between Jorge Tim√≥n and odinn regarding Bitcoin XT, a software fork. The conversation revolves around the controversial nature of XT. BIP101 (as currently implemented in Bitcoin XT) is a Schism hardfork or an altcoin that poses major risks as a non-peer reviewed alt with a number of problematic features. It has not followed any semblance of process in terms of the development funnel or BIPS process, with XT developers instead choosing a dangerous path of hard forking bitcoin while being well aware of miner voting on viable solutions which have followed process. Given the state in which bitcoin is in now, one could say things are fairly horrible, but by no means necessitating a schism hardfork. It is clear and evidenced by previous posts and others that Hearn's efforts are an attack on the bitcoin network.</summary>
