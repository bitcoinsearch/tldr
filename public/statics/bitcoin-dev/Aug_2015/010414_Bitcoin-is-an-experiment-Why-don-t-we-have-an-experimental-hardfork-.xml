    <summary>In an email dated August 19, 2015, odinn criticized Bitcoin XT as being controversial and a schism hardfork. He explains that BIP101, as currently implemented in Bitcoin XT, poses major risks as a non-peer reviewed alt with a number of problematic features, including privacy issues. Moreover, he argues that the development of Bitcoin XT has not followed any semblance of process, which is dangerous since it involves hard forking bitcoin while being well aware of miner voting on viable solutions which have followed the process. Despite his concerns, odinn acknowledges that users are free to use software that is less reviewed at their own risk. He suggests that the proposals found in http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/ are deserving of attention, and BIP 100 is probably the best of these. However, he emphasizes that it's users and not miners who decide the consensus rules. Odinn warns that contentious hard forks are bad for Bitcoin and directs readers to https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/hard-fork-policy. While odinn believes that Schism hardforks may be necessary in some situations, he doesn't consider this one reasonable. Therefore, he argues, there is no basis for further promoting XT by suggesting that it should even be tested. Nonetheless, he clarifies that Bitcoin XT the software fork is totally fine, like other alternative Bitcoin implementations, and the big problem is BIP101 being deployed as a Schism hardfork.</summary>
