    <summary>The author, Asher, has shared a draft proposing an alternative set of chain mechanics to address issues with existing proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems. The problems the proposed system aims to solve include mining centralization, wealth concentration, nothing-at-stake, and lack of full-node incentives. Asher has also provided a link to the proposal, which can be found at http://ashes.network/ashes.pdf. They are seeking feedback on their idea and welcome any comments or suggestions.</summary>
