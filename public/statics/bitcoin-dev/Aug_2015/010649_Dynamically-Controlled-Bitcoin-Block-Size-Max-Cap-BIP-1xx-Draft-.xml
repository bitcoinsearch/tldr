    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Simon Liu raised concerns about a voting system for users that could be exploited by those running multiple nodes. In response, it was clarified that the proposed system would not count votes based on nodes, but instead on bitcoin amount or coin-days, similar to a proof-of-stake model. It was suggested that a combination of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake would be optimal for such a system.</summary>
