    <summary>On August 20, 2015, Elliot Olds posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about a website he created that lists all the strongest arguments and counterarguments on the block size debate. This post was in response to Jorge Tim√≥n's personal lists of arguments on both sides, which he created to be objective. The block size debate is centered around whether or not to increase the block size limit to allow for faster and cheaper transactions. The "for" argument states that if everyone agrees an increase is required at some point, the longer you leave it, the greater the numbers who have to upgrade. On the other hand, the "against" argument highlights that insufficient testing before moving to production-ready releases sets a bad precedent. The link to the website, which can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/bitcoinblocksizedebate/, allows users to explore both sides of the argument in detail. Feedback is welcome.</summary>
