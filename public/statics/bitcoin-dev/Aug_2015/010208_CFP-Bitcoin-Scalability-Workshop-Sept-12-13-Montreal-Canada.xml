    <summary>The Bitcoin development community is organizing a pair of workshops to collect technical criteria, present proposals and evaluate technical materials and data with academic discipline and analysis that fully considers the complex tradeoffs between decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. The first workshop will be held in Montreal, Canada on September 12th-13th, 2015. Its purpose is to discuss the general tradeoffs and requirements of any proposal to scale Bitcoin beyond its present limits. The second workshop pertaining to actual block size proposals is to be planned for Hong Kong roughly in the late November to December timeframe.Both events will be live-streamed with remote participation facilitated via IRC for parallel online discussion and passing questions to the event. Travel, venue details, and accommodation recommendation are available at scalingbitcoin.org. There will also be an application process for independent or academic researchers to apply for travel assistance to help cover the expense of airfare and hotel fees up to $1,000 per qualified presenter who intends to give a presentation. To encourage early submissions to help with planning, review and circulation, expressions of interest and proposals surrounding Bitcoin scalability *will be accepted on a rolling basis until 00.00 UTC Sept 1st 2015*. Those with technical interest are invited to participate in this pair of workshops. If one has any research relevant to issues surrounding Bitcoin scalability, their proposal for a presentation at the Montreal workshop would be most welcome. Pindar Wong, the Chairman of VeriFi (Hong Kong) Ltd., is the chair of the Montreal Workshop Planning Committee. The four underwriters of this event have agreed to jointly review applications and cover the travel subsidies for qualified presenters.
