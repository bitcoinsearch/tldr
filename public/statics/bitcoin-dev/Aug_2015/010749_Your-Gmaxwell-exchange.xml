    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Rizun and Greg Maxwell, Maxwell argues that the level of centralisation among miners is significant to the real-world impact of Rizun's research. Rizun responds by stating that his paper makes no claims about miners changing their level of centralisation and that it is outside the scope of the paper. He also argues that what Maxwell calls "errors" are assumptions that are valid for the network as a whole currently. Rizun agrees to clarify these assumptions in the paper to make it stronger. Maxwell suggests that if Rizun's assumptions are accepted, the most profitable configuration would be one where there is only one "super pool." However, Rizun believes that this is unlikely to happen due to game theory involved and that whether it is likely or not is irrelevant to the result that a fee market exists without a block size limit given the assumption that there is more than a single miner. The two agree to disagree and acknowledge each other's contributions to the field.</summary>
