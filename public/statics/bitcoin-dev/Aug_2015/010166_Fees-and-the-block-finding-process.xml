    <summary>The conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list focused on the importance of Bitcoin being inexpensive to transact. Some argued that if Bitcoin were no longer cheaper than other forms of money, it would be replaced. However, others felt that trustlessness - the ability to transact without relying on third parties - was the more important characteristic of Bitcoin. There was also discussion around the block size issue and whether or not to increase it for the right reasons. While some saw a small constant factor increase as unlikely to break anything in the short term, others cited higher centralization pressure as a concern. Overall, there was agreement that consensus rules are critical to keep the system together, and that uncontroversial commits should be supported. Despite different opinions on what counts as an uncontroversial change, most agreed that the issue of Bitcoin's competitiveness is a deal breaker for many users who do not care about decentralization and only want to send money from A to B like email.</summary>
