    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in June 2015, Ross Nicoll suggested using a minimum height as an imprecise but workable solution for activating hardforks. However, BIP99 at the time recommended a minimum height plus 95% mining upgrade confirmation for uncontroversial hardforks. The activation discussion for general hardforks was still inconclusive. BIP99's proposed code for an example uncontroversial hardfork can be found on GitHub, but no pull request had been made yet.</summary>
