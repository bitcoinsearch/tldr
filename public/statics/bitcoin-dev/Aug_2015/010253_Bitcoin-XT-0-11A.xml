    <summary>The context of the conversation revolves around the conflict of interest in making money off lightning, which is an open-source protocol. The discussion was triggered by Mike's comment that if someone liked micro payment channels, they should work on them. In response, Ken Friece raised concerns about how increasing the block size would lead to less demand for lightning, creating a conflict of interest. Moreover, he stated how lightning network is a way to take fees away from miners without investing in SSH-256 ASIC mining hardware. Eric Lombrozo disagreed with Ken's claim that lightning network and sidechains were in direct competition with miners for fees. Mike Hearn's release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A with a bigger blocks patch set was a result of how Bitcoin Core had drifted far from the principles held by many users. He explained that forking was the only way to fix things. In response, Eric Lombrozo expressed his disappointment in Mike's divisive approach. He believed that equating the fork of an open source project with a fork of a cryptoledger was bogus since there was a lot of other people's money at stake. Eric further stated that consensus was all or nothing, and many people familiar with Satoshi's invention didn't believe forking was a good idea. Mike invited developers who felt that Core was no longer serving the interests of Bitcoin users to join Bitcoin XT.</summary>
