    <summary>In an email sent on August 10th, 2015, odinn proposed the implementation of Cameron Garnham's dynamic softfork proposal, which can be found at http://is.gd/DiFuRr. However, Pieter disagreed with this proposal, stating that anyone who believes a block size limit change can be done as a soft fork needs to do some basic reading first. Pieter also requested that the thread stay focused on Lightning. No further information was provided in the context.</summary>
