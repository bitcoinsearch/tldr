    <summary>In August 2015, Matt Corallo proposed extending BIP 37, Connection Bloom Filtering, by defining a service bit. This service bit would allow peers to advertise that they support bloom filters explicitly. The protocol version would be increased from 70002 to 70011 in the reference implementation. The NODE_BLOOM bit is distinct from NODE_NETWORK, and it is legal to advertise NODE_BLOOM but not NODE_NETWORK. If a node does not support bloom filters but receives a "filterload", "filteradd", or "filterclear" message from a peer, the node should disconnect that peer immediately. It is suggested that DNS seeds and other peer discovery mechanisms support the ability to specify the services required. A service bit was chosen as applying a bloom filter is a service.</summary>
