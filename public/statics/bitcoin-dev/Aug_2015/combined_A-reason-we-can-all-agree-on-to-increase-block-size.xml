    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently debating the issue of mining centralization and blocksize consensus limits. Chinese miners control 57% of all mined Bitcoins due to advantages such as cheap electricity, natural cooling, and cheap ASIC chips. While an increase in the blocksize limit may potentially increase centralized control by the Communist Chinese government, restricting it allows them to maintain their current hold on Bitcoin hashing power. Some suggest that miners outside of China should build more farms in smaller countries such as Venezuela or Iceland, which have cheap electricity and could be good places to mine. However, others argue that warning against increasing the blocksize consensus limit would be more appropriate if the concern is truly about mining centralization. There is a debate about whether increasing the block size limit would be a problem for Chinese miners, with five of the largest already signing a draft agreement indicating they are fine with an increase to 8 MB. However, the potential issue is China's international bandwidth, which is relatively low compared to other regions and could lead to higher orphan rates for non-Chinese miners if Chinese miners cease to build on top of blocks that are too large to sync in a timely fashion into China. Intra-Asia capacity is improving all the time, with a major consortium cable called FASTER set to come online in Q2 2016.Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, urges caution in discussions about increasing the block size limit and proposes a scientific approach focused on technical requirements, security, and rigorous analysis. Eric Lombrozo argues that larger blocks are linked to a higher propensity for consensus forks, while Hector Chu believes that cooperation is necessary for mutual benefits, and the block size issue is political because it affects nearly all users to some degree. The economic majority is identified as a natural check-and-balance that can influence miner behavior. The writer suggests that miners do not currently favor smaller blocks and transactions due to the risk of making the system less useful and driving away users. In terms of maintaining consensus on acceptable block and transaction sizes, the writer proposes the use of a secondary, non-consensus rule layer that would allow for more experimentation without risking the stability of the network. Ultimately, the debate should focus on scientific evaluation, technical requirements, and security rather than political or business compromises.The issue of block size in Bitcoin is a topic of discussion among members of the community. Eric Lombrozo and Hector Chu discuss the potential risks associated with increasing block size, with Lombrozo arguing that larger blocks are linked to the propensity for consensus forks that require manual intervention, while Chu believes that cooperation is necessary for mutual benefits. The conversation highlights the fragility of the distribution by consensus system and the importance of finding a balance between decentralization, trustlessness, technical requirements, and security. Other concerns include mining consolidation within China, which could lead to political manipulation, as well as bandwidth limitations that affect non-Chinese miners. However, improvements in intra-Asia capacity may help address this issue. Ultimately, the Bitcoin community must find a way to balance technical and political considerations to maintain the decentralized decision-making process of miners, merchants, and users.China controls 57% of all Bitcoin being mined due to advantages such as subsidized electricity, cheap manufacturing of ASIC chips, and natural cooling conditions. However, the Communist Chinese government's control over Bitcoin hashing power has raised concerns among critics. Recently, a draft of the National Security Law in China has surfaced which mandates the safeguarding of security in critical industries such as cryptocurrency mining. Furthermore, another national security-related law is currently being reviewed which would require all internet companies operating in China to provide backdoor access and encryption keys to the government, including exchanges and mining operations.While Chinese miners have advantages over others, their only disadvantage is bandwidth. Increasing block size would be detrimental to them, but some suggest that most of the free world has enough bandwidth to handle larger blocks, which could get mining out of centralized control by the Chinese government. The issue of block size remains controversial, with Hector Chu arguing that cooperation is necessary for mutual benefits while Eric Lombrozo asserts that consensus forks requiring manual intervention are linked to larger blocks.In an email exchange dated August 3, 2015, Simon Liu listed F2Pool, Antpool, BW, BTCChina, and Huobi as the largest Chinese miners who signed a draft agreement indicating their acceptance of an increase to 8 MB. However, this approach was criticized as not being scientific and could lead to disastrous consequences. The priority should be on ensuring the security of the system rather than engaging in political lobbying. Secondly, it was suggested that the Chinese miners agreed to the increase under duress of threats of worse outcomes beyond what they felt they could safely cope with.Although Chinese miners are not opposed to an increase in block size, their international bandwidth is relatively low compared to other regions, which could lead to higher orphan rates for non-Chinese miners if Chinese miners cease to build on top of blocks that are too large to sync into China.
