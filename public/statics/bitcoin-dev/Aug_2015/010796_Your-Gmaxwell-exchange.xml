    <summary>The notion of decentralization is contextual and lacks a precise definition. While some members of the community understand it well, there is no form demanded to define it. Bitcoin Core software is used by around 90% of nodes that accept incoming connections. However, this does not make Bitcoin less decentralized since the software is open-source, has many contributors worldwide, and has high-quality code. Other implementations exist, but they are not widely used because they do not match the quality of code in Bitcoin Core. As a result, developers contribute to Bitcoin Core instead of creating their own implementation, making it stronger and better. One concern raised is the 85% node share around Bitcoin Core, which could allow a group of coders to prevent important changes from being made in a timely fashion. Therefore, supporting multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol could reduce the network's dependency on Core and promote decentralization in development.</summary>
