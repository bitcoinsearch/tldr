    <summary>In an effort to address issues with existing proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems, the author Asher has shared a draft proposing an alternative set of chain mechanics. The proposed system aims to solve problems such as mining centralization, wealth concentration, nothing-at-stake, and lack of full-node incentives. Asher has also provided a link to the proposal on http://ashes.network/ashes.pdf and is seeking feedback on their idea. They welcome any comments or suggestions from the community. It remains to be seen if this alternative set of chain mechanics will gain traction in the crypto community but it presents an interesting solution to some of the major issues plaguing current proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems.</summary>
