    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his views on the ongoing block size debate in an email. He believes that the core issue is not about block size but rather that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen feel that the core developers are being obstructionist. However, he acknowledges that the PR battle is important and that arguments against the fork actually play into Mikeâ€™s hand. Eric believes that the block size issue is too nuanced and can easily be spun simplistically, which makes it easy for people to take sides based on charismatic leadership and authority. Eric thinks that from a PR standpoint, the block size issue is irrelevant as most people do not really understand scalability. Eric suggests that everyone should be given equal treatment and that making it clear that you are not obstructionist is the key to winning the PR battle. Eric reminds everyone that Bitcoin was designed such that changing the rules is hard and this is a feature. A hard fork for such a politically divisive issue will almost certainly lead to a lack of cooperation and refusal to work together out of spite.</summary>
