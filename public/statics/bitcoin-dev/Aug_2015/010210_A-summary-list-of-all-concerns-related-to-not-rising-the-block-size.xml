    <summary>The debate over increasing the block size limit in Bitcoin has been ongoing for several years, with proponents arguing that it is necessary to prevent constantly full blocks that can cause transaction backlogs and potentially kill the network. However, others argue that increasing the limit could lead to centralization and undermine Bitcoin's decentralized nature. In 2015, Geir Harald Hansen of the Bitminter mining pool warned that if the block size limit was not increased, Bitcoin could die due to a backlog of transactions and people abandoning the network. However, some believe that there are other ways to address the issue, such as incorporating technological growth into Bitcoin by keeping the 2010 1MB limit but accounting for "inflation." This would allow for more users to come on board the Bitcoin train without sacrificing decentralization. Ultimately, the decision to increase the block size limit or not will have significant implications for the future of Bitcoin, and requires careful consideration and consensus-building among stakeholders.</summary>
