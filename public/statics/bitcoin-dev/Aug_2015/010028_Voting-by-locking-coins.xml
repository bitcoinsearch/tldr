    <summary>The email conversation discusses the possibility of using locked coins for casting votes on an issue. The proposal suggests that individuals who want to cast a vote must lock their coins until the vote closes, using CLTV. The weight of the vote would increase based on the number of coins locked. The choice would be written in the scriptPubKey or an OP_RETURN data output. Nodes would tally up the coin values for various vote options on the date the vote closes, with the choice having the highest total being declared the winner. The proposal also suggests that the voting could be a rolling one, with the next vote starting when the present vote is decided. While the solution may not solve the block size issue, it could offer choices such as keeping the block size the same, reducing it by 10%, or increasing it by 10%. There may need to be weighting depending on how long the coins have been locked for, to prevent voting at the last minute from having an undue influence.</summary>
