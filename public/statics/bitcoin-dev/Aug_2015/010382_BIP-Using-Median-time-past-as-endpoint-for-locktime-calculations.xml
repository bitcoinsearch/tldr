    <summary>The email thread discusses a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, with Thomas Kerin as the author and Mark Friedenbach for designing and authoring the reference implementation. However, Peter Todd clarifies that Gregory Maxwell actually came up with the idea in question during a discussion about incentives related to nTime on #bitcoin-dev or #bitcoin-wizards. Todd believes that Maxwell deserves credit for the idea and will try to find a link to the discussion for historical interest.</summary>
