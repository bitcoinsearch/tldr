    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev list, there has been a discussion about whether to manually approve new subscribers to prevent potential abuses. This discussion was sparked by a post from "satoshi at vistomail.com," which some believe could be genuine. There are differing opinions on whether the content of the post is what matters or if the identity of the poster is crucial. If the real Satoshi were to post something, it would have a decisive influence on the community. However, this also raises concerns about blindly following someone's words without fully understanding the consequences. The author suggests that some types of dictatorship can make you free, but not all types.</summary>
