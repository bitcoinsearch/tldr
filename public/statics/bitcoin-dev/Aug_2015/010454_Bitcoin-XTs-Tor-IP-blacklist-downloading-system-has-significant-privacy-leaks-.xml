    <summary>In an email conversation on August 19, 2015, Mike Hearn, via bitcoin-dev, mentioned that the code was peer-reviewed in the XT project. He did not submit any revisions to Core as it had already been rejected. When asked for a link to the peer review, Hearn was unable to provide one other than a few comments between himself and Gavin, which the person asking the question deemed insufficient for peer review. Hearn also commented on the number of incorrect statements made in the thread.</summary>
