    <summary>Peter Todd, a GitHub user, has expressed his opinion on the pull-request process for Bitcoin Core. He highlights that normal users submitting pull-reqs to Bitcoin Core cannot delete other users' comments on their own pull-reqs, calling it an abuse of the pull-req process. Todd further argues that this indicates Gavin Andresen's commit access rights for the Bitcoin Core repository should be reconsidered. To support his argument, Todd provides archive links to his comment and where he was told his posts had been censored. He concludes by stating that it is time for a change.</summary>
