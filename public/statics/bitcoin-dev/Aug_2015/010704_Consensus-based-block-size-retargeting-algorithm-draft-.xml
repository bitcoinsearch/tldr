    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin developer community, Btc Drak, posted a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing a proposal for increasing the block size limit. Another member, Matt Whitlock, raised a concern that the proposal failed to answer how the new consensus rules would be activated. Btc Drak responded by saying he did not want to focus on hard fork methodology at this stage, and proposed a fixed activation approach. He also suggested that a clear way forward with what block size proposal to use should be determined before discussing deployment mechanisms. Finally, Btc Drak requested that discussions about deployment mechanisms be kept to one thread in BIP99.</summary>
