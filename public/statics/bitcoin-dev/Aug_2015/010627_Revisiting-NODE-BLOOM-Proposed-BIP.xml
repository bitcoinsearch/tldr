    <title>Revisiting NODE_BLOOM: Proposed BIP</title>

    <summary>In a discussion between Matt and Wladimir J. van der Laan, the former suggests rewording the statement that NODE_BLOOM is distinct from NODE_NETWORK and it is legal to advertise NODE_BLOOM but not NODE_NETWORK. He suggests stating that it is not against specification to do so as they expect some future proposals to make it useful. Wladimir questions the usefulness of advertising NODE_BLOOM without deciding on a way to signal which blocks pruned nodes have. He suggests leaving the speculation for a future BIP. The statement is related to nodes running in pruned mode that provide filtered access to the data they have.</summary>
