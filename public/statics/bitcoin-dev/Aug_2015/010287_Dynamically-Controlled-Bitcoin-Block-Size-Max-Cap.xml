    <summary>On August 17th, 2015, Upal Chakraborty contacted the bitcoin-dev mailing list requesting comments on his attempt to solve the maximum block size debate. He provided a link to his proposal at http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php. However, the message was met with skepticism and criticism as some members believed that the link was suspicious and potentially harmful. One member even stated, "Nobody is going to click that..." The email thread can be found on the bitcoin-dev mailing list archives.</summary>
