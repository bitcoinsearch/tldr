    <summary>On August 17, 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the creation of a transaction that is still within the op count and sig ops limits but larger than 1MB. Andrew LeCody questioned whether such an action would require a fork lasting for more than 100 blocks. In response, Peter Todd suggested using coinbase outputs of XT blocks to create "definitely Bitcoin-only" outputs or, if those were not available, using coinbase outputs of Bitcoin blocks to create similar outputs and then spending the inputs to those transactions again on the XT chain. Cameron Garnham suggested spamming the 8mb blocks with 1 Satoshi outputs to the brainwallet 'BitcoinXT'. The discussion ended without any further developments.</summary>
