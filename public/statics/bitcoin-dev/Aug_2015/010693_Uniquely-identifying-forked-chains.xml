    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, the use of a hash of hashes was proposed as a means of identifying blockchains for BIP 21 and other relevant needs. The proposal suggested using either the genesis block hash or a hash of the genesis block hash concatenated with block hashes of fork points for a fork chain. This would allow identification between blockchain forks building upon the same genesis block and support forks of varying degrees while preserving a fixed length chain identifier. While some may see this as redundant, the proposer argued it is inevitable that multiple chains will coexist and be actively mined at some point. Users can specify "whatever chain is the longest with PoW" using (1) or use (2) to specifically identify a chain in times where multiple chains are coexisting and being actively mined.</summary>
