    <summary>In an email thread, Matt Whitlock suggested a correction to a blockchain URL that included "mainnet" and "testnet" as host names. He proposed using the format: blockchain:?network=testnet&amp;txid=3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a instead. In response, another participant preferred using chain= over network=, referring to the hash of the genesis block as chain ID. He also expressed agreement with Andreas Schildbach's suggestion to respect commonly used schemes. Finally, he provided examples of his preferred format for a transaction in testnet and a block in Bitcoin's mainnet.</summary>
