    <title>Proposal: Disable digests on bitcoin-dev</title>

    <summary>In a message to the bitcoin-dev list, Warren Togami suggested disabling the ability to subscribe with digests. Togami argued that digests were from an earlier era of internet history and inconvenient for everyone because replies have the problem of breaking threads. He suggested that people should be setting mail filters to separate list mail from other mail instead. Ultimately, Togami believes that digests are not a net-positive for the Bitcoin community and should be turned off.</summary>
