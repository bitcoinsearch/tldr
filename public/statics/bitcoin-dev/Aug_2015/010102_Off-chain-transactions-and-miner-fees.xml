    <summary>In a message sent to bitcoin-dev on August 10, 2015, Anthony Towns expressed his belief that the time value of bitcoin was currently zero. However, another member of the group pointed out that this was not necessarily the case, as bitcoin is liquid and can easily be exchanged for fiat currency which can then be held for interest. The time value of bitcoin in this scenario would be determined by the yield curve of interest rates.</summary>
