    <summary>The implementation of the proposed CLTV, CSV, etc. soft-forks has become complicated due to XT and Not-Bitcoin-XT miners who use nVersion=0x20000007, which would falsely trigger the previously suggested implementation using the IsSuperMajority() mechanism and nVersion=4 blocks. Both implementations produce blocks with nVersion=0x20000007 and neither support a fork deadline. The BIP101 draft was changed from using the nVersion bits compliant 0x20000004 block nVersion, to using two more bits unnecessarily. There are three options for deployment of CLTV/CSV/etc., which include plain IsSuperMajority() with nVersion=4, nVersion mask with IsSuperMajority(), and full nVersion bits implementation. The most complex option is the full nVersion bits implementation using flag bit #4 to trigger the fork.</summary>
