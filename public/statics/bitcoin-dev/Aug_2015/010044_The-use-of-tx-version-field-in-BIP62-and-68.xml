    <summary>The version selection is not possible for certain features with higher version numbers as there may be already signed transactions that would violate the new rules. However, moving forward, all new consensus rules should be applied to transactions without any selective picking and choosing. BIP68 and some of the BIP62 rules are only applied if a transaction's version is greater than or equal to 2 and 3 respectively. This creates potential issues when introducing a new script system with a soft fork. The suggestion is to divide the transaction version field into two parts - the higher four bits and lower 28 bits. BIP62 and BIP68 will become mandatory for all v4 transactions. By adopting this change, it will be easier to re-purpose nSequence or take advantage of malleability in the future. The low bits will allow for 28 independent BIPs, and when exhausted, the high bits can be switched to a different number and redefine the meaning of low bits. These changes may apply to other draft BIPs with similar interpretations of the transaction version.</summary>
