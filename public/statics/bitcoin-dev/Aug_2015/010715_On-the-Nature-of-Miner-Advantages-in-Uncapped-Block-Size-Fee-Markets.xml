    <summary>The author of the paper intends to submit it to the dev-list for analysis. The paper analyzes how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. It builds on the work of Peter R's, correcting a mistake and addressing critiques made by the community. The paper's primary result is a detailed analysis of mining advantages as a function of miner hashrate. Large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to an increase in marginal profits. Part of the advantage large miners have today is due to a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency mining class which has access to expected profits an order of magnitude larger than everyone else. As block subsidies decrease, this high-efficiency class is expected to vanish leading to a marginal profit structure that decreases as a function of hashrate. The author apologizes for any typos and stands by for comments from the community. They hope the paper will reignite consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101).</summary>
