    <summary>A recent release by the XT author(s) does not show any sign of moving towards a version which would be "increasing consensus." The BIP authors can work together and create something meaningful and useful. Visualizations or graphs of the miner votes going on right now on BIP 100 and BIP 101 are expected. Regarding XT, one statement is simple: "Do not download this loathsome XT thing. Cast it back into the fires from whence it came." Tier Nolan suggests making available a version of XT with only the block size changes to address mining pools' concern about its experimental nature. Additionally, BIP 100 and 101 could be combined to increase consensus. If the BIP 100 and BIP 101 would be combined, it would look like miner vote threshold reached, wait notice period or until earliest start time, block size default target set to 1 MB, soft limit set to 1MB, hard limit set to 8MB + double every 2 years, miner vote to decide soft limit (lowest size ignoring bottom 20% but 1MB minimum), block size updates could be aligned with the difficulty setting and based on the last 2016 blocks, miners could leave the 1MB limit in place initially, legacy clients would remain in the network until &gt;80% of miners vote to raise the limit and a miner produces a &gt;1MB block.</summary>
