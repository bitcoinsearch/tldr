    <summary>On August 4, 2015, the bitcoin-dev mailing list received messages regarding the use of prediction markets to address issues with Bitcoin. Eric Lombrozo suggested using theory, empirical data, and engineering to fix problems instead of speculating on fake markets. Owen stated that there is no money at stake in prediction games, making it unsurprising that results are implausible. Gavin Andresen shared preliminary results from a prediction market used to address tradeoffs. Anthony Towns noted that the scicast prediction market is currently shut down and provided numbers related to network hash rate that seem implausible.</summary>
