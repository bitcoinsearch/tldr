    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Lombrozo, has voiced his concern over the potential for a hard fork in the Bitcoin protocol. He noted that because a hard fork has never been attempted before, it is impossible to predict what may happen if one was to go ahead; even uncontroversial soft forks have caused problems in the past, so a hard fork could be catastrophic. In his view, the issue of whether or not to increase block size is not a significant enough problem to warrant the risk of a hard fork. Another member of the mailing list, Adam Back, responded by saying that Bitcoin-XT is both a hard-fork and a soft-fork, and that there are already proposals being evaluated, so starting a "fork war" is not constructive. However, he did recognise that Bitcoin-XT exposes SPV nodes to loss if it results in a network-split. The email exchange ended with a call for well-argued thoughts rather than "FUD and flaming".</summary>
