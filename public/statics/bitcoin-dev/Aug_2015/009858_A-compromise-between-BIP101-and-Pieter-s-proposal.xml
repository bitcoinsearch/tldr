    <summary>The context discusses the possibility of a group of evil individuals investing in Bitcoin's demise by making a set of prepared transactions to fill a seemingly random, bloated, and useless block. This block will be created experimentally at first but on the active Bitcoin network, and the evil group will measure its effect on the mining community. The goal is to catch the Bitcoin community unawares and do as much damage to morale as possible. The author suggests that good concrete descriptions of the threats against which the community wants to guard will be helpful. However, he also stresses the importance of imagining what to do if and when one of these scenarios actually occurs. Finally, the author expresses his paranoia due to the fact that those who like to control everything are losing it.</summary>
