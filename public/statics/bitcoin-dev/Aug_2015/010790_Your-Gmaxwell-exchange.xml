    <summary>In an email thread from August 31, 2015, Justus Ranvier questions the use of the term "decentralized" in regards to Bitcoin. Monarch had justified the existence of Bitcoins as a system without the trust of third parties to process electronic payments. However, Ranvier asks for an explanation and understanding on what it means to use a decentralized network instead of a trusted third party to process electronic payments. He suggests using the Kano model to organize Bitcoin's various features to give them something objective to talk about. The Kano model is used to differentiate between essential and optional features of a product or service. It can be helpful to identify actual goals and solutions rather than just decentralization.</summary>
