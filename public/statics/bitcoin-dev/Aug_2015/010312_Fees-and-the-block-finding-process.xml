    <summary>A message was sent on August 17, 2015, by the BitMinter operator via bitcoin-dev. The message stated that mining pools will not immediately make blocks as big as possible if the hard limit is raised. It was noted that XT includes a patch that sets the soft limit to be the same as the hard limit by default. This means if miners use the defaults, "as big as possible" blocks would be produced. The message was signed with a PGP signature.</summary>
