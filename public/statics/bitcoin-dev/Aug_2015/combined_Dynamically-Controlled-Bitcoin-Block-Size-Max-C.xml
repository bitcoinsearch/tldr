    <summary>The analysis of fee markets in the absence of blocksize limits indicates that large miners have a hashrate advantage due to coinbase subsidization. However, as block rewards decrease, so will the advantage for larger miners. One criticism of larger blocksizes is that they allow connected miners to exclude smaller miners by filling blocks with self-paying transactions. Despite this, larger miners will still move full blocks, but it will not be in their interest to fill them with spam since their main source of income comes from fees. This context explains why BIP100-101 proposes larger blocksizes to increase the network's capacity and stimulate an increase in transaction fees. Ultimately, when block rewards become comparable to block fees, mine centralization will be eliminated.</summary>
