    <summary>A discussion thread on GitHub about a draft BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) has been moved to the mailing list, as using GitHub for high-level discussions is not specified in BIP001. The original poster has concerns about the structure and wording of the proposal and suggests slimming it down and simplifying it. They also suggest removing some history lessons mentioned in the proposal. The author of the proposal requests more specific suggestions to take any action. There is a question about a separate BIP for "code forks", which is clarified as out of scope for this BIP. It is noted that spell checking has not been followed for any BIP. The proposal is currently labeled as "informational | process" but may be changed depending on its appropriateness. The contained code in the proposal is an example of an uncontroversial hard fork to create a precedent. A proposal for a "patch into core as a module that hard forks can use in the future" is unclear and requires elaboration.</summary>
