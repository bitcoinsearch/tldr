    <summary>A proposal to improve Bitcoin's transaction finality has been given the code name BIP112 and is being discussed among developers. One developer, Btc Drak, updated the pull request to reflect this. Another developer who tested the initial proposal implemented Lightning test code and found that a 256-second granularity would be useful in deployment but not ideal for testing. They suggest using 64 seconds instead. The maximum duration proposed for transaction finality is one year. There was also a suggestion to use the "version" field, but it was argued that using the "sequence" field makes more sense because it is associated with transaction finality.</summary>
