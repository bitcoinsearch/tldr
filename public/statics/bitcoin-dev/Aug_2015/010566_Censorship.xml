    <summary>There is currently a division in the bitcoin community and people are questioning why this is happening. Bitcoin discussion communities, such as BitcoinTalk and Reddit, are where most of the discussions happen. However, it has become clear that these platforms are managed by a single person, Theymos, who has been accused of censoring bitcoin discussions, mainly on Reddit but also on BitcoinTalk. This has led to concern that if one person can control what content is allowed, then the debate becomes one-sided. This is especially worrisome considering that many core developers belong to Blockstream, which opposes bigger blocks. There does not seem to be a solution at this time, and it is disappointing that many in the community are not discussing this important issue.</summary>
