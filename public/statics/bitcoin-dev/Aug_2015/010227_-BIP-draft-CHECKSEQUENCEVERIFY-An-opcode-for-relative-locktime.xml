    <summary>The writer expresses their strong displeasure towards the inversion to preserve the "previous nSequence semantics". They argue that these semantics were not enforceable by consensus and can be replaced with nMaturity for realistic use cases. The writer urges to move forward without technical debt that may cause regret in the future. If the inversion is implemented, it may be carried on indefinitely. The writer believes that clearer and possibly shorter documentation can be achieved as a result of this decision.</summary>
