    <summary>In this email conversation, Levin and Eric discuss the issue of hard forking in Bitcoin. Levin advocates for total decentralization of Bitcoin while Eric prefers guided decentralization. The conversation ultimately boils down to political beliefs rather than technical arguments. Adam Back also chimes in, stating that starting a fork war is not constructive and brings up concerns about Bitcoin-XT being a hard fork on full-nodes and a soft-fork attack on Bitcoin core SPV nodes that did not opt-in. Eric expresses concern about attempting a hard fork mechanism that has never been done before in such a politically divisive environment. He argues that attempting a novel hard-forking mechanism on such a polarizing issue risks the entire air force and billions of dollars worth of other people's money, all so we can process 8 times the number of transactions we currently do, which is still nowhere close to touching big payment processors like Visa. Eric urges everyone to see the bigger picture and understand that nobody is trying to stop anyone from doing anything out of some desire for maintaining control. Rather, different people have different priorities and preferences as to which changes would be best to do first. In conclusion, the conversation highlights the various viewpoints and concerns surrounding hard forking in Bitcoin.</summary>
