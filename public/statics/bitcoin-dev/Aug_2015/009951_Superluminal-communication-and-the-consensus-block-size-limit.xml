    <summary>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón in August 2015, they discussed whether miner A who can process 100 million transactions per block, will be able to maintain its competitiveness against miner B, which is only capable of processing 10 million transactions per block. Andresen argued that it depends on all the variables that go into the mining profitability equation, including access to cheaper electricity, advanced mining hardware, inexpensive labor, and capital to finance investment in hardware. He also brought up the possibility of using excess heat generated from mining productively as a way to change the mining centralization dynamics. Andresen believed that if production of mining devices whose primary purpose is not mining but rather heating becomes a reality, then everybody should carefully reconsider all their assumptions about mining centralization. Andresen also talked about the number of fee-paying transactions a miner can include in their blocks and how it would eventually be part of the equation for mining profitability. However, he stressed that mining should remain decentralized.</summary>
