    <summary>In an email thread, Btc Drak suggested the creation of a specific mailing list for Bitcoin Core development to better define clear rules about what is acceptable in terms of academic and technical discussion. The idea was to create a forum where people could discuss purely academic and technical matters without interference from non-technical individuals. A bitcoin-announce read-only list was also suggested for consumers of Bitcoin Core to subscribe to for announcements about new versions and critical warnings. The potential downside of separating Bitcoin Core-specific development from general bips and consensus discussions was mentioned; however, the possibility of having just a -dev and -discuss list was also suggested. It was mentioned that such a list already exists but was not being used much.</summary>
