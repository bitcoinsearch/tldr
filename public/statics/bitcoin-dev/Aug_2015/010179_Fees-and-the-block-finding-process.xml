    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of bigger block size in Bitcoin. There are a few assumptions in the discussion that are common in the current wave of "bigger blocksize" topics. Firstly, the assumption that supplying bigger blocks will meet the demand of more people is flawed. Secondly, the notion that dissatisfied users will move to alt-coins so Bitcoin better be careful underestimates the quality of developer attracted to Bitcoin Core to apply themselves to this project. Thirdly, Bitcoin is better money, but it does not fit every use-case. Lastly, the notion that there be dragons at the capacity limit is unfounded and reactionary. The email thread highlights that the main chain is the lynch-pin to the whole system and we've got to do a good job meeting demand that people have for wanting to utilize the main-chain, or else we'll risk being replaced by some other main-chain solution that does it better. On the other hand, the system should aim to do a block size increase for the right reasons. The thread concludes that the block size issue needs consensus on whether to agree, disagree, or not take a side and why.</summary>
