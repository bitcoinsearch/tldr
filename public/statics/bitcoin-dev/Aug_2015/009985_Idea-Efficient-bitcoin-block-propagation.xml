    <title>Idea: Efficient bitcoin block propagation</title>

    <summary>The context discusses an idea proposed by Arnoud Kouwenhoven from Pukaki Corp in 2015 to increase the speed of bitcoin block propagation after a new block has been mined. The proposal suggests using a mechanism to prove that something has been shown by a certain order, which is essentially what blockchain does. However, the proposal fails when it comes to showing if a block defined in the Guarantee Message has not been shown. This means that the proposal only works with a centralized trusted party, making it unsuitable for a decentralized system like bitcoin.</summary>
