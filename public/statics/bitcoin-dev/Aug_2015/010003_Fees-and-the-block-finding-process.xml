    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, jl2012 asks for reasons why the block size should or should not be reduced. Some arguments have been put forth that even if reducing the block size doesn't necessarily increase the number of full nodes, it could still have other benefits such as alleviating bandwidth saturation and reducing the time spent validating transactions due to fewer transactions. Bryan offers his perspective on the matter.</summary>
