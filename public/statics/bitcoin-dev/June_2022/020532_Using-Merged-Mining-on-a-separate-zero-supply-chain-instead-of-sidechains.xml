    <summary>Sidechains can be introduced without any forks by creating a new chain with zero coins and introducing coins to it by signing a transaction from other chains. Coins can be withdrawn by publishing the transaction from the original chain which can be copy-pasted to the new chain and used to destroy the coins that were produced earlier. This process is enough to make a test network but to make it independent, moving coins inside that chain is required. Transaction joining can be used to transform a chain of transactions into one transaction, enabling sidechains. Homomorphic Encryption can be used to add new features without touching consensus. By adding transaction joining in a homomorphic encryption way, sidechains can be introduced in a no-fork way. The hash of the chain can be added to the signature inside a Bitcoin transaction, preventing overwriting history. Merged Mining could be used to reward sidechain miners.</summary>
