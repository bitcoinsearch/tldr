    <summary>In response to a message from Peter Todd via bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty expresses his opinion that if Bitcoin doesn't have enough demand for block space, it should die. He mentions that he is not completely against Peter's proposal but is sure that it will not have consensus to be implemented. Erik believes that maintaining the security of the protocol is solely the responsibility of the Bitcoin software and the core developers. However, he disagrees with Peter's statement that continued demand for block space is critical for Bitcoin's security, explaining that it is only so because of the block reward going away. He suggests that if the block reward was made to continue indefinitely through an inflation hard fork, demand for block space would not be critical to Bitcoin's security.Erik also shares his view that users paying 100x fees for opening and closing LN channels is not wrong. He ends the message by signing off as /dev/fd0 and using Proton Mail secure email. It can be inferred that Erik has a strong stance on maintaining the technical integrity of Bitcoin and believes that any proposals should be thoroughly reviewed before being implemented.</summary>
