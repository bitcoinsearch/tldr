    <summary>The article discusses the possibility of introducing sidechains in a no-fork way using transaction joining and homomorphic encryption. To achieve this, a new chain with zero coins needs to be created, and coins from other chains can be introduced by signing a transaction. Merged mining can be used to reward sidechain miners, and the hash of the chain can be added to the signature inside a Bitcoin transaction to prevent overwriting history. The article also suggests that encrypting the amount in a homomorphic encryption such as Pedersen commitments / ElGamal commitments is how MimbleWimble coins (such as Grin) work.</summary>
