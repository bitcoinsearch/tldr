    <summary>In a conversation, Bryan suggested to use Tor hidden service to publish instead of using OP_RETURN while keeping the details of the transaction off-chain. Alfred pointed out that this method is an off-chain solution and it won't work in an offline regime. He also mentioned that Tor keys can be derived from master keys, but this approach isn't much different from Bitmessage notifications in BIP47.</summary>
