    <summary>The email exchange between alicexbt and Peter Todd discusses the security of Bitcoin and the proposal to continue block rewards indefinitely. Alicexbt is not completely against the proposal, but believes that if Bitcoin doesn't have enough demand for block space, it should die. However, Peter Todd argues that the Proof-of-Work (PoW) security of Bitcoin benefits all users, proportional to the value of BTC they hold, and paying for it on a per-tx basis won't work due to lack of consistent demand. Todd believes that it would be unfortunate if Bitcoin died simply because there was no way to pay for its security. The email thread ends with Todd's contact information.</summary>
