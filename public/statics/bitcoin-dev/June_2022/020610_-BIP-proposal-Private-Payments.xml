    <summary>In this conversation, the participants discuss the potential issues that may arise if the number of standard scripts increases significantly. One concern is that wallets will have to watch all of them, which could create a performance hit. Additionally, some wallets may not support certain scripts, leading to confusion when sending funds. One proposed solution is to use Taproot-only, but there are concerns about locking down the BIP to a single script type for future proofing. Instead, participants suggest using address type flags to solve these issues at the expense of having a couple of extra bytes. However, this approach can make it difficult to support light clients and requires everyone to publish a single pubkey on-chain.Participants note that only senders would need to publish their key on-chain, and pure recipients could just publish their codes off-chain. However, this creates a footprint, so users could mitigate this by publishing an ephemeral pubkey for each recipient. It is also noted that this mechanism is not safe against miners, as they can pay themselves arbitrarily high fees with no downside. A possible solution suggested is to require an OP_RETURN burn instead of benefiting the ecosystem by sending coins back to miners.</summary>
