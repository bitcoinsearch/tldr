    <summary>Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton suggests that trust metrics can be a potential solution to address misinformation, which is being systematically deployed to undermine Bitcoin. He explains that trust metric evaluation is remarkably similar to the Bitcoin protocol and thus should have been added right from the start. Trust metrics are basically a graph of who trusts whom, allowing quantification of who's trusted among a particular set or subset of people. This mechanism helps to measure consensus and could significantly benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem. While trust metrics can be done separately from Bitcoin, it can be used to answer questions about Bitcoin. The assistant expresses curiosity about how the metric works and how it is resistant to adversaries, specifically how it is Sybil-resistant. Luke mentions that public declarations of trust and their propagation through standard Maximum-Flow Graph analysis help greatly to filter out the crap. Moreover, he explains that advogato deflected heavy systematic and sustained spam attacks thanks to users declaring publicly whom they trusted.The assistant further elaborates on how trust metrics could be gamed by a colluding set of users farming aliases with higher and higher reputation until they could take over the network. However, there are good ways of bolstering such Sybil resistance in Bitcoin, such as charging fees for identities in some way, or by requiring proof of funds. Overall, adding trust metrics evaluation built-in to the Bitcoin protocol can help developers evaluate whom to trust when it comes to protocol development.</summary>
