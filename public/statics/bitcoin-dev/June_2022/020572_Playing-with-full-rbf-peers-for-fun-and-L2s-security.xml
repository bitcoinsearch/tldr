    <summary>Luke Dashjr and Peter Todd discussed the use of NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE in Bitcoin Knots on June 15, 2022. While Bitcoin Knots still uses the service bit, it wasn't signaled by default due to a bug in some older versions. However, there are at least 100 nodes with full RBF. It was noted that if NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE is added to the desirable service flags, those nodes won't preferentially peer with each other unless added to the list returned by GetDesirableServiceFlags. Additionally, the DNS seeds must support NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE for it to be ideally implemented.</summary>
