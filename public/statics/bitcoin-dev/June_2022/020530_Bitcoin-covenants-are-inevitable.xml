    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion mailing list, a user named alicexbt expressed their opinion that covenants on Bitcoin will eventually be implemented with a soft fork. They believe that CTV is the easiest and best possible way to do so. They also highlighted several potential benefits of covenants such as allowing developers to build interesting projects with real market demand, better tooling for application developers, and potential funding improvements for Bitcoin developers and projects. However, John Carvalho, in response to the email, stated that core development is not a hackathon project. He emphasized that none of the quoted items mentioned in the original email are features or responsibilities of the Bitcoin software or Core developers. Carvalho further argued that CTV, nor any change to Bitcoin software, should never be justifiable simply because some people think it is cool or might make more people like them. He urged users to stop spamming about CTV and called it a non-contentious issue. The original email did not provide any technical NACKs for CTV and claimed that all developers who participated in the discussion were either okay with CTV or OP_TX or covenants in general. The author suggested improving the review process for soft fork BIPs and sharing honest opinions with agreement and disagreement on technical merits. They preferred BIP 8 or improved BIP 8 for soft fork but would not mind anything else being used if it improves Bitcoin. They believed that implementing covenants before the next cycle would provide opportunities for developers to build interesting things during the bear market.</summary>
