    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email, a victim of abuse expressed concern regarding "rfc timestamping" and its potential for misleading users into believing that their documents are preserved. The victim recommends uploading .ots files to chains with cheap storage, such as arweave or bitcoin sv. However, Coingeek reports that Bitcoin SV's transaction fees currently cost $644/GB, while Amazon Glacier Deep Archive only costs $0.012/GB/year. Assuming a 25-year data lifetime, Bitcoin SV is 2000x more expensive than Amazon, and with the number of BSV nodes decreasing, long-term storage may be better trusted with Amazon.</summary>
