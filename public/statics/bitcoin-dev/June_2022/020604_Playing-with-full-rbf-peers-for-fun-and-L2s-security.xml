    <summary>In a conversation on June 27, 2022 at 8:03:38 AM EDT, Greg Sanders pointed out that punishing someone based on mempool behavior is difficult due to the fact that there is no "the mempool". However, this point was deemed irrelevant in the context of a DoS condition caused by a double spend for a given txout used in a coin join. This condition is solely under the control of the wallet and can be avoided regardless of mempool behavior.</summary>
