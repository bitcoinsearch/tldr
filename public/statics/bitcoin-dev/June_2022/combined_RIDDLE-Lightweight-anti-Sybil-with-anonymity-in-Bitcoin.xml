    <summary>The post discusses sublinear ring signatures and the potential for logarithmic scaled ring signatures, with Groth/Kohlweiss 2014 being a key player. Bootle et al. in "Short Accountable Ring Signatures Based on DDH" in 2015 found a significant efficiency/compaction by generalising the concept using an n-ary decomposition and delta-functions. Noether &amp; Goodall's Triptych can address the outstanding question of how to get one/N time usage of these ring signatures with key images, which is essential for something like RIDDLE. Adding in the key image needs more space in the proof, but only by less than a factor of 2. Therefore, Triptych seems to give both things needed: first, a key image, along with a very compact size for high anon sets. The research endpoint, for now, is that Triptych appears to be practical for genuinely big anonymity sets.AdamISZ also posted a suggested protocol for doing anti-Sybil that isn't too demanding for the users, but actually keeps a decent level of privacy. The protocol is mostly focused on a user/customer of a service/product/website, but it could be useful in e.g. anti-Sybil in things like Lightning. In order to address the question of how practical it might be to get genuinely big anonymity sets, AdamISZ did some research into sublinear ring signatures and found that through bilinear pairings crypto could give substantially more efficient constructions, but that would not work on 'bare' secp256k1.</summary>
