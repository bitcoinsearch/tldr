    <summary>The concept of consensus involves trust, and this trust is measured using a mechanism called Trust Metric. The Ford Fulkerson Max Flow Algorithm is used to convert an unordered graph of "Trust Declarations" into a Directed Acyclic Graph with weighting to limit long-distance Transitive Chains from being faulty. Sybil resistance is achieved by linking pseudo-identities to someone who is linked to the "seeds" and requiring a minimum number of incoming Trust Declarations before flow is permitted to cross outwards.However, attackers can still pose as trustworthy individuals and mark themselves as trusting various sock puppets. Negative Certs were considered but never implemented due to potential harm. Additionally, maintaining the system takes discipline, and it does not incentivize people without risking bribery. It is also difficult to get people to pay BTC to make declarations of trust.There was a discussion about whether developers are being paid enough in BTC to afford making a Declaration. To address this, the idea was proposed to separate the Declaration from the payment threshold so that anyone can enter a zero-value transaction with a Declaration of Trust. However, independent post-processing would determine whether their Declaration would be included in the Graph Processing. A rule was suggested that if a developer has 500 incoming Declarations of Trust and is only one degree away from the "seeds," charging them for making Declarations would be unnecessary.Overall, these issues can be solved with alternative approaches.</summary>
