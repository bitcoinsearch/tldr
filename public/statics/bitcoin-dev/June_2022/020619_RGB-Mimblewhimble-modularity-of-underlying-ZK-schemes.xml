    <summary>The writer is inquiring about the modularity of the underlying zero-knowledge (ZK) schemes used to bring privacy on RGB. They are specifically interested in knowing if there is any documentation available as to how hard it would be to switch to a quantum-resistant alternative from the current use of Bulletproofs, which are not quantum-resistant.They also ask about the design rationale for cryptographic primitives used in the Bitcoin ecosystem and wonder if ZK-Starks could be used for some use cases like this. They inquire whether anyone has started experimenting with this approach.The writer expresses uncertainty about the most important criteria for RGB use cases, including proving time, verification time, size of proofs, quantum resistance, and communication complexity. They are curious about the particular choice of Bulletproofs in this context and cannot find any useful information about it.</summary>
