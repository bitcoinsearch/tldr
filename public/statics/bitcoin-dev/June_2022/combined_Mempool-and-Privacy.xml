    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has been experimenting with a configuration option in Bitcoin knots that would disallow address reuse in mempool. The configuration option, spkreuse=conflict, can be found in the GUI of the Settings and Options sections. The developer ran two nodes on signet to test the option. Node 2 had "spkreuse=conflict" saved in bitcoin_rw.conf file, which rejected all transactions reusing addresses in mempool. Replacement transactions were ignored even if the address appeared twice in mempool.Debug=mempool did not print logs that could be helpful to know which transactions are getting rejected in mempool for address re-use, so running two nodes and comparing mempool transactions was done. The developer wondered what other aspects could affect privacy in mempool but have not yet been explored. Three things were mentioned: RBF policies, rebroadcasting mechanism, and different types of relay fee. Although this may not be used by many Bitcoin nodes and miners, it was still appreciated as an option provided by knots.The email was sent using Proton Mail secure email.</summary>
