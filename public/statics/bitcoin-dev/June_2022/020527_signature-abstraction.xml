    <summary>The author is proposing the creation of a protocol for signatures using bounded elliptic curve parameters in the script, which could allow efficient verification of a range of elliptic curves schnorr signatures instead of a fixed curve. The author is wondering if anyone has proposed this before and believes that this approach could allow for higher bitness, broad HSM compatibility, and decentralized and competitive security parameters for different environments. While this would be useful for the author, they are unsure of how many others would care about it.</summary>
