    <summary>The author, alicexbt, expresses their disagreement with the implementation of full-RBF (replace-by-fee) in Bitcoin Core software. However, they do not have an issue with experimenting with multiple RBF policies. The author argues that there is a lack of basic options in Bitcoin Core to enable/disable different RBF policies and questions the rationale and arguments for full-RBF. They express a desire to share these disagreements and engage in discussion, even if it may appear off-topic or like a strawman argument on Github. In response, the commenter cndm1 points out that Bitcoin Core is open-source software and developers submit pull requests to be merged after review. If there is a perceived "lack of basic options," it could be because it doesn't make sense or isn't a priority for anyone. The commenter suggests that if the author wants to share their preference, they are welcome to suggest a pull request themselves instead of repeatedly demanding others to do it for them.</summary>
