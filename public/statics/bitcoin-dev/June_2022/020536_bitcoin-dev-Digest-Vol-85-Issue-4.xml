    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion group, AliceXBT discusses the concept of misinformation and how it is being used to undermine Bitcoin. She explains that misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is intentionally intended to deceive people. AliceXBT goes on to say that this is a technique that was refined by psy-ops over 60 years ago and it should come as no surprise that it is now being used to undermine Bitcoin.AliceXBT suggests that Trust Metrics could be a potential solution to this problem. She mentions that the most successful open-source experiment in this regard was advogato.org by Raph Levien. AliceXBT says that she expanded it greatly so that any user could specify the "seeds" whom they trusted, rather than being forced to utilize the fixed hard-coded user ids in the advogato.org source code. She explains that public declarations of trust, and their propagation through standard Maximum-Flow Graph analysis, helps greatly to filter out the crap.AliceXBT points out that the similarity between trust metric evaluation and the Bitcoin protocol is remarkable and she is stunned that it was not added right from the start. She finds it ironic that the lack of integrated trust metric evaluation built-in to the Bitcoin protocol is now hampering developers from being able to evaluate whom to trust when it comes to protocol development.</summary>
