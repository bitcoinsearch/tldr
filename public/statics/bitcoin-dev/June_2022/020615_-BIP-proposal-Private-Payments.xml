    <summary>In a recent bitcoin-dev thread, there was a discussion around the mechanism to demand that a notification transaction meets some minimum miner fee. However, it was pointed out that this mechanism is not safe against miners as they can pay themselves arbitrarily high fees with no downside. Block space being relatively expensive, one suggestion made was that the spammer has to publish at all. Another suggestion put forward was to do a timelocked sacrifice with OP_CSV.</summary>
