    <summary>In a conversation about demurrage and inflation, it is noted that they both act as a tax on savings. The difference lies in the implementation of this tax. Despite this, the discussion around inflation suggests that on-chain services may be a valuable incentive to drive fees. One proposed idea is the use of on-chain "payment codes", which could be implemented with a light-touch approach to allow for utility growth in response to halvings. However, it is suggested that lightning has already consumed a significant amount of on-chain fees. As future compression and privacy protocols like mweb are developed, it is important to keep this concern in mind.</summary>
