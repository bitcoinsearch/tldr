    <summary>Bitcoin Knots still uses the service bit, despite a bug in some older versions that did not signal it by default. There are at least 100 nodes with full RBF (Replace-By-Fee) already. Node operators interested in experimenting with full-RBF can connect to a public node or spawn one themselves. In addition, there is a ##uafrbf libera chat available for information on settings and connecting with other full-RBF users. Peter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer, previously maintained a fork of Bitcoin Core that utilized nServices bit 26 and preferred segwit peers. However, he has not worked on the Bitcoin Core codebase for years and is unsure if a similar approach can be easily implemented now.</summary>
