    <summary>In a private conversation, additional opinions were shared regarding the limitations of Open Timestamps (OTS). While OTS is useful for proving the duration of a document, it does not demonstrate the shortness of its existence or whether an earlier version was already published. This is because the author must separately publicize any private material that was hashed with the document hash. Therefore, any unpublished private material could be an earlier equivalent to a public proof. The author of the opinions refers to OTS as "designed to be broken" since it allows individuals to rewrite history by republishing other people's documents under different contexts. This suggests that the use of OTS may not be entirely reliable in verifying the authenticity of a document.Furthermore, the author speculates that OTS may fail to add transaction history containing its hashes to associated wallets. This could result in the hashes being lost in chain forks, making the verification process even more challenging. Overall, while OTS can provide evidence of the duration of a document, it has limitations and should be used with caution when attempting to verify the authenticity of a document.</summary>
