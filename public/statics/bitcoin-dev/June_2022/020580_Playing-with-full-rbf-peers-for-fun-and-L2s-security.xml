    <summary>The lack of a basic option to disable all RBF policies in a node's mempool was removed in PR #16171, but no one has opened a pull request to revert this because most maintainers and reviewers agreed with the change. A reviewer who NACKed it already maintains the config option to disable all RBF policies in Bitcoin Knots which is a derivative of Bitcoin Core. The sender of the email is not demanding anyone to add a few lines of code and open a pull request but is reviewing a pull request in an open-source project and sharing feedback. Other 'basic options' will be easier to accommodate with `-mempoolreplacement` used in PR #25373, which is unlikely to be merged. Antoine and Luke agreed to add the option if other reviewers have no issues or the sender can do it. This option, in context with another being added for a new RBF policy, was being discussed in PR #25353 and earlier emails in the thread.Bitcoin Core is open source software, where developers open pull requests to try to get them merged after review. If someone sees a "lack of basic options" and no one has opened a pull request for it, it may be that it just doesn't make sense, so no one sees a point in implementing it, or it isn't on anyone's list of priorities. No one is holding someone back from implementing it themselves and suggesting a pull request. Repeatedly demanding others to do it for you is not helpful in open-source software development.</summary>
