    <summary>On June 13th, 2022, Antoine Riard posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list inviting node operators to test full replace-by-fee (RBF) by connecting to a node he had set up or by creating their own public node. He also mentioned that there was a chat group available for anyone who wanted more information on the settings or was looking for full-RBF friends. In the future, it may be possible to automate the process of finding full-RBF nodes by setting up a dedicated network bit and reserving outbound slots for them.Peter Todd, a former maintainer of a Bitcoin Core fork, responded to the post, mentioning that he had used nServices bit 26 to achieve a similar goal in the past. He linked to the commit on his Github page and noted that he had used code written to prefer segwit peers. However, he also mentioned that he hadn't worked on the Bitcoin Core codebase in years and wasn't sure if a similar approach would still be easy to implement. Todd's contact information was also included in his response.</summary>
