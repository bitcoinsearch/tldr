    <summary>Antoine Riard, a Bitcoin developer, has suggested that fixing the Denial of Service (Dos) vector could benefit multi-party funded transactions by enabling propagation of honest multi-party transactions to interested miners. To achieve this, he submitted a small patch against Bitcoin Core, enabling it to turn on full-replace-by-fee (RBF) as a policy. As of now, the default setting remains false, keeping opt-in RBF as a default replacement policy. He also started running the patch on a public node at 146.190.224.15. Antoine Riard changed one of his OTS calendars to issue fee-bumping transactions without the opt-in RBF flag set as an experiment. The transaction strategy is to start at the minimum possible fee and bump up the fee every time a new block arrives without the transaction being mined. This approach shows that there is not much full-RBF hash power at present. The current status can be seen at https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/.</summary>
