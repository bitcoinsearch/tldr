    <summary>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named alicexbt expressed frustration with the spread of "misleading information" regarding the implementation of covenants on Bitcoin. The user provided several links to examples of false or inaccurate information being spread on social media and through other channels. Despite this, the user remained optimistic that once the non-technical community had time to discuss the issue, progress would be made towards implementing covenants. The user suggested that the Bitcoin community should work on better ways to catch the attention of the larger community for important changes without alarming them. The email from alicexbt was in response to another user named Jorge Tim√≥n, who questioned the idea that covenants were not contentious and accused some people of spreading misinformation. Alicexbt argued that there were zero technical NACKs for CTV (a specific type of covenant), and that all developers who participated in the discussion were either okay with CTV or covenants in general. Alicexbt also argued that Bitcoin should not wait years for a proposal that everyone will agree on, but rather improve the review process for soft fork BIPs and share honest opinions on technical merits. The user preferred BIP 8 or an improved version of it for soft forks, but was open to other options if they improved Bitcoin.</summary>
