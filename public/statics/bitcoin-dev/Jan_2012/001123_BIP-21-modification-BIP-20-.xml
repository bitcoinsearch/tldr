    <summary>In this email exchange, various aspects of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21 are discussed. The "send to private address" field is debated as to whether it should be part of this BIP or a future one. There is agreement that the current version of the BIP should only define the bare-bones URL scheme, leaving room for future extensions such as send-to-private-address and send-multiple-signers, which should be forwards-compatible. The "expires" field is noted as having a pressing need and the only point of contention is the inclusion of a dual representation (block or timestamp). It is argued that a block number for expiration is unnecessary complexity and that a UTC timestamp would suffice. The "version" field is also deemed redundant, with everything needed within the Bitcoin URI scheme able to be encoded with suitable optional fields. The URI signing mechanism is discussed and considered a good idea but in need of more work before being included in a dedicated BIP. The 'send' parameter and the 'version' parameter are both unclear, with the former lacking a practical use case and the latter requiring further clarification as to how clients should handle it. The GUI client implementations of the BIP are considered important, with more weight given to those with actual URI scheme implementations.</summary>
