    <summary>In an email conversation on February 1, 2012, Gavin Andresen expressed his preference for BIP 21 over BIP 20, stating that "simpler is better". He also agreed that signing and dating URIs are good ideas but proposed waiting until there is consensus around BIP 21 before writing follow-up BIPs. One suggestion made by Andresen was to allow payment directly to a public key or the calculation of a bitcoin address from it, which would eliminate the need for a bitcoin address in the URI. The email included three non-text attachments: two application/pgp-keys files with the same name and size, and an application/pgp-signature file.</summary>
