    <summary>The discussion revolves around whether or not Bitcoin.org should take a political stance. Slush and Alan Reiner believe that the website should remain apolitical, as not everyone cares about the political attitude of main project developers. However, Amir Taaki argues that SOPA/PIPA threatens Bitcoin directly and suggests that Bitcoin.org should follow in the footsteps of Wikipedia and other websites by implementing a full and global blackout. Jeff Garzik disagrees and thinks that Bitcoin.org should remain neutral to avoid alienating users. Ultimately, no clear decision is made on whether or not Bitcoin.org should take a political stance.</summary>
