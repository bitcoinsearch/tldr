    <summary>In an email exchange on January 30, 2012, Gary Rowe and an unknown recipient discussed the differences between BIP 20 and BIP 21 proposals. The main difference between the two proposals is how they standardize the "amount" field. BIP 20 proposes allowing alternative representations of the amount, while BIP 21 requires the use of a single representation in decimal notation. Gary argues that despite BIP 20's proposal for alternative representations, BIP 21 is still the better option because it reduces complexity for end clients at both the human and machine level. In response to this argument, the unknown recipient suggests that using a strtol-compatible amount would be the best solution to reduce complexity.</summary>
