    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin.org potentially participating in a blackout protest against SOPA/PIPA legislation, some community members disagreed on whether or not Bitcoin should take a political stand. Alan Reiner suggested that while it would be appropriate to mention on the website that SOPA threatens Bitcoin's philosophy, the project should generally avoid making bold political statements. Amir Taaki argued that the issue affects Bitcoin directly and that a blackout would be an appropriate response, similar to what other websites like Wikipedia were doing. Jeff Garzik expressed concern that taking a political stance could alienate users and preferred that Bitcoin.org remain apolitical.</summary>
