    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of plain multi-sig being potentially abused and whether it should be considered standard. However, it is important to differentiate between multisig addresses and P2S with multisig output scripts in general. The only argument against multisig outputs is the size of the potentially unprunable transaction outputs which isn't an issue yet. Negotiated escrow arrangements can work okay either way. P2SH is still better for these types of transactions for two reasons. One, reasonable anti-spam behavior by network participants may make it hard to make large output scripts. Two, P2SH lets you use a separate escrow-maker tool for clients paying into escrow without any knowledge or support of escrow transactions in that client. This uncoupling is important both for general "feature velocity" as well as providing a uniform feature set across bitcoin services.</summary>
