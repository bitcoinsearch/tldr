    <summary>The author believes that there is a need for more mechanisms than just DNS and hardcoded seednodes to prevent blocking. The current mechanisms are highly susceptible to being blocked. However, the author notes that Bitcoin is not intended to be blocking-resistant but can be combined with Tor and Tor anti-censorship tools. The author suggests that users can add nodes/addr.txt to address this issue or people will host manual lists and nodes on hidden sites like Tor/I2P/etc. Additionally, deploying a DHT and having one friendly node can maintain the list through node expiry rules. IRC, DNS, etc would go away in favor of autonomy. This mechanism wouldn't be any more resistant, but if people wanted that, some form of signatures from hidden nodes would do - if you trusted them. Trust isn't easy, as noted by the Tor/I2P people.</summary>
