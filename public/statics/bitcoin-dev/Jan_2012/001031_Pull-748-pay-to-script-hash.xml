    <title>Pull 748 pay to script hash</title>

    <summary>The context refers to a comparison between a defunct OP_EVAL proposal and the current pay to script hash proposal. The comparison is being made by reading a diff of the two proposals, which can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/748/files. It is suggested that it would be more beneficial for code review purposes if the old pull is reverted and the new one re-requested. This would simplify the process of identifying the actual changes made between the two proposals.</summary>
