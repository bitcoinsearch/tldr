    <summary>In this email conversation from 2012, Amir Taaki proposes that BIP 20 should be modified and championed by Matt Corallo. He provides a link to BIP 21, which is essentially the same as BIP 20 without the non-decimal number system. Taaki suggests that GUI client implementations such as MultiBit or Bitcoin-Qt should be asked if they support BIP 20 or BIP 21, and more weight will be given to GUIs with actual URI scheme implementations. The goal is to achieve a general consensus on which BIP to support. The email ends with an advertisement for an online learning library for Microsoft developers.</summary>
