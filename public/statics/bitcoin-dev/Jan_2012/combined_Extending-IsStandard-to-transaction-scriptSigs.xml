    <summary>A new patch is being developed for Bitcoin to make transaction inputs with extra data non-standard as a precautionary measure. Currently, any node on the network can add bytes to the transaction's scriptSig before passing it on, which may cause problems for other implementations or transaction-handling software. The patch aims to prevent this unexpected behavior by making transactions with extra stuff in the scriptSig non-standard, so they won't get relayed or mined by new nodes.The implementation of the patch is still under discussion, and there are considerations to require the OP_PUSHDATA and OP_PUSHDATA to be DER-encoded for the transaction to be IsStandard(). There is also a suggestion to require the "filler item" to workaround the OP_CHECKMULTISIG pops-one-too-many-items-off-the-stack bug to be exactly OP_0. This would remove some wiggle room and improve security.Overall, discussion is welcome, and a pull request will be made for the patch shortly. It is hoped that this patch will provide greater security and stability for the Bitcoin network.</summary>
