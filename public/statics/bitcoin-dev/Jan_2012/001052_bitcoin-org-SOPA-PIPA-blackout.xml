    <summary>The debate in the Bitcoin community about the SOPA/PIPA blackout has seen differing opinions. While some believe that Bitcoin's philosophy is threatened by SOPA and that it should join sites such as Reddit, 4chan, and Wikipedia in a global blackout, others think that Bitcoin should remain apolitical. The argument for a blackout stems from the belief that SOPA strikes at the heart of everything Bitcoin is about and that no legislation could be more relevant to Bitcoin than this. However, those opposing the blackout feel that a central voice for Bitcoin would give the impression of centralization and may not be in the best interest of the community. Additionally, they suggest that some heavily-invested Bitcoin users may see SOPA as an opportunity for profit, making it difficult to reach a consensus on the issue. It is suggested that if any response is made, it should be a very light one.</summary>
