    <summary>The issue of internet censorship is not just a political one, as the internet holds great importance for bitcoin and its users. The proposed laws could criminalize both users and developers, leading to serious consequences. While stopping these specific laws may not solve the underlying issue, it is still important to take action against them rather than succumbing to fear paralysis. This is not a matter of political opinion; it is about protecting free speech and keeping the internet working and un-balkanized. Furthermore, the fact that bitcoin depends directly on a globally connected internet underscores the importance of this issue. While other countries may continue to push for similar laws, it is crucial to stand up against censorship and defend basic principles of freedom and democracy.</summary>
