    <summary>The context provided is an email conversation between Amir Taaki and Jeff Garzik regarding the importance of a world issue. Amir Taaki expressed his concern about the threat to everything and suggested going nuclear to show nerd-rage. He also urged everybody to blank their personal sites, Americans to take to the streets, and the world to scream at the US embassy. However, Jeff Garzik preferred bitcoin.org to remain apolitical for the long-term appreciation of its users.</summary>
