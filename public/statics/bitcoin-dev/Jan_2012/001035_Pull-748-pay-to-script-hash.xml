    <summary>The purpose of counting the number of sig ops after executing a script in ConnectInputs is to ensure compliance with the rule that "a block shall not contain more than MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS (20,000)". This rule applies to both the old and new ways of counting sig ops, which involves looking at scriptPubKeys and pay-to-script-hash scripts in the scriptSig. However, there is concern that this counting may be too late in the process. To address this, further refactoring of ConnectInputs is suggested, including the addition of FetchInputs() and AreInputsStandard() functions.</summary>
