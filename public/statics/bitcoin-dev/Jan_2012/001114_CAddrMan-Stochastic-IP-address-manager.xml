    <summary>Gavin Andresen, one of the Bitcoin developers, has suggested that the IRC bootstrapping mechanism should be removed. He believes that removing it would reduce the amount of code and stop ISPs from tagging Bitcoin as malware. After testing the list of built-in bootstrapping IP addresses, he found that they connected fairly quickly and that the DNS seeding hosts were working well. Gavin suggested disabling the mechanism by default for version 0.6 and completely removing it before version 0.7 if no issues arise.</summary>
