    <summary>On January 27, 2012 at 7:36:31 PM, a member of the bitcoin-list at bluematt.me wrote that the implementation of Bitcoin-Qt for drag-and-drop and system URI handling has been done. However, this implementation has already been present in many clients throughout 2011 and is not new. The BIP 20 version on the wiki has extraneous information in its number encoding that was explicitly voted against during the time the spec was being discussed. This vote took place three months after the spec had a consensus and multiple implementations.</summary>
