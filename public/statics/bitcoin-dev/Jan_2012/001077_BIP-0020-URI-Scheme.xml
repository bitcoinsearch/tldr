    <title>BIP 0020: URI Scheme</title>

    <summary>Amir Taaki, on January 27, 2012, mentioned that BIP 0020, an old URI scheme, has been given draft status. However, it had already been finalized according to BIP 1 standards since late January 2011. Amir is unsure about moving it to accepted status and believes that having a re-decision is healthy as there was no standardization process when it was first accepted. He suggests revisiting the URI scheme for revision once P2SH is deployed and eventually replacing or superseding BIP 20.</summary>
