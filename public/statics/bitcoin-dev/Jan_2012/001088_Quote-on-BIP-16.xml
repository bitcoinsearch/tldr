    <summary>In a mailing list, Amir Taaki quoted Gavin's argument regarding the controversy surrounding bitcoin addresses longer than 70 characters. Gavin argued that very long addresses are not workable because it becomes difficult to copy and paste, harder to scan an address with your eyes to see if you're paying who you think you're paying, harder to upgrade website or database code that deals with bitcoin addresses, etc. He suggested that having a P2SH scheme might be necessary for 70-byte long addresses. Alan expressed his concern over the implementation of BIP 13/16/17 and the risk involved in implementing such a huge change to the network. He proposed that multi-sig should be available as something to fall back on if something goes wrong after implementation. However, gmaxwell expressed concerns that plain multi-sig could be abused which suggests that it may not be considered standard. Alan is not promoting one thing or another but feels like copy &amp; pasting is not a big deal. However, he realizes that regular users may not be so adept at copying long strings.</summary>
