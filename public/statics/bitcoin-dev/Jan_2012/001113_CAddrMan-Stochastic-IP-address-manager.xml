    <summary>In a discussion about the design of Bitcoin, Gavin Andresen praises Pieter's design for being resilient to many attacks. However, he raises concerns about the possibility of a Sybil attack from a large botnet filling all buckets in both tables. In response, another participant in the discussion notes that given the randomness in Pieter's design, such an attack would be extremely unlikely or difficult to do. They also ask if it's possible to calculate what percentage of nodes on the network an attacker would have to control to have a 1% chance of a successful Sybil attack. Despite these concerns, Gavin expresses his support for Pieter's design and states that he would like to include it in the upcoming 0.6 release of Bitcoin. He also suggests removing the IRC bootstrapping mechanism, which would remove code and prevent reports of Bitcoin being tagged as malware by various ISPs. In testing, the list of built-in bootstrapping IP addresses connects quickly, and the DNS seeding hosts are working nicely.</summary>
