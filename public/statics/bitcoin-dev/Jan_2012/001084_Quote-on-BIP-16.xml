    <summary>Gavin, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has raised the question of whether very long Bitcoin addresses would be functional. He provided an example of a Bitcoin address that is 70 characters long and argued that it would be difficult to use such addresses for copying, pasting, scanning, generating QR codes, upgrading website or database code that deals with Bitcoin addresses, etc. He also noted that there is a rough consensus that very-long addresses are not workable.The concern about long Bitcoin addresses is related to the current P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) scheme used for multisig transactions, which limits the length of the redeem script to 520 bytes. Gavin's argument raises the question of how a 70-byte long address would be possible without using the P2SH scheme, which is currently the only way to achieve this.Overall, the debate around very long Bitcoin addresses highlights the importance of usability in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. While longer addresses may have some advantages, such as improved security, they may also pose challenges for users and developers. As the Bitcoin community continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how this issue is resolved.</summary>
