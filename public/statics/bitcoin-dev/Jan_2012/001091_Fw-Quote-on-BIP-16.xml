    <summary>In an email conversation between Amir Taaki and Gavin Andresen, the former questioned how a given bitcoin address could be so small. Gavin explained that it was an alternative design for multisig addresses that included a byte indicating the transaction type and the 20-byte hashes of each public key involved. This design did not use CHECKMULTISIG and therefore avoided issues with maximum-sigops-per-block, but it also meant creating a new type of bitcoin address for each new transaction type. Despite its advantages, this solution was not popular due to its impracticality.</summary>
