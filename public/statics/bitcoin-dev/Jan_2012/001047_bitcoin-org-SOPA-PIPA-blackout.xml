    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Wladimir on Jan 16, 2012, the topic of internet censorship and its potential impact on Bitcoin was discussed. Wladimir expressed concern that if people do not stand up for their rights now, Bitcoin would be threatened by internet censorship. However, Gregory pointed out that very few people actually care about loading a specific URL. He also suggested that an informative popup might be a better solution than making the entire site inaccessible. Overall, they agreed that a notice would be sufficient and there is no need to make the entire site inaccessible.</summary>
