    <summary>The MultiBit team will not be supporting Tonal Bitcoins anytime soon and instead backs the BIP 21 proposal. Although MultiBit does not currently support "message" or "send" fields, they are willing to add this functionality if required. The idea of a signed URI is appealing but may not work as it aims to protect a URI from malicious replacement. If a Bitcoin URI is served up from a trusted source, there should be no need for signing. However, in situations where the attacker has complete control over the content of the URI, they can successfully swab it to match their own fraudulent address. The MultiBit team would like to add an "expires" field to the BIP 21 proposal, which would allow merchants to issue Bitcoin URIs that would expose them to a currency/inventory risk for a defined period of time.</summary>
