    <summary>In an email exchange on January 31, 2012, Gary Rowe expressed his belief that doubles or floats should never be used for money. However, this statement is not entirely accurate as many people use these data types for financial transactions. One example given is the ability to place a sell order on mtgox for an exorbitant amount of money, resulting in a trade stored as doublemax. Therefore, while doubles and floats may have their limitations, they are still commonly used in monetary transactions.</summary>
