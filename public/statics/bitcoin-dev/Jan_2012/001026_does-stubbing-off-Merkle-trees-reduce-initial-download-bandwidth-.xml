    <summary>In a conversation between Christian Decker and another individual, it was discussed that full blocks would be necessary in order to detect usable inputs for future outgoing transactions. The conversation also touched on the fact that a paranoid client would need an unstubbed copy of the entire blockchain in order to confirm receipt of coins, as incoming coins may have already been spent. Although a stubbed chain can still be used for other actions, such as sending coins, confirmation of receipt requires the full unstubbed chain.</summary>
