    <summary>A suggestion was made to use satoshis instead of decimal bitcoin, but this could lead to confusion when working with COIN scale. Working with numbers stored as radix-2 floating point to get satoshis and then trying to multiply them back up to COIN scale would be confusing. Decimal numbers allow values to be treated as strings and avoid arithmetic that could cause confusion.</summary>
