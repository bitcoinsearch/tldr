    <summary>In an email sent on January 30, 2012 at 1:07:16 PM, thomasV1 at gmx.de expressed support for BIP21 over BIP20. However, it is important to note that BIP21 is not forwards-compatible and is designed with a decimal bias. On the other hand, BIP20 is neutrally biased, forward-compatible, and has already been implemented for over a year. It is argued that any proposal seeking to supersede BIP20 should improve upon it rather than make it worse with bigotry and short-sightedness.</summary>
