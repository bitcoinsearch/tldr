    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin forum in 2012, Alan Reiner argued that internet censorship legislation did not directly affect Bitcoin and its community. He believed that imposing a single purpose or idea on everyone who uses Bitcoin would prevent widespread adoption. Reiner stated that Bitcoin was about providing a monetary system for the Tonal number system. He also noted that while he thought internet censorship legislation was necessary in some form, he did not see how it was relevant to Bitcoin. The discussion addressed the broader issue of differing perspectives on what Bitcoin is and what it represents.</summary>
