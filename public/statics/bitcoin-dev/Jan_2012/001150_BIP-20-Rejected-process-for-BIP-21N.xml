    <summary>Matt Corallo, a developer, has changed "mustimplement" to "req" in regards to backward compatibility. He stated that "req" is shorter and still makes sense. Additionally, he explicitly noted that numbers should not contain commas and should use periods to separate whole numbers and fractional decimal fractions to avoid any localization concerns. Wladimir, another developer, likes the idea of using "mustimplement" but suggests using a shorter prefix to keep URL sizes small for QR codes and such. Matt believes that depending on variable names to provide information is ugly and welcomes suggestions for a better solution.</summary>
