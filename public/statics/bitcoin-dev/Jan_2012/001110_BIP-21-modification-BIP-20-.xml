    <summary>The discussion revolves around the comparison between BIP 20 and BIP 21, which are both proposals for standardizing the "amount" field in Bitcoin transactions. While BIP 20 suggests that "amount" can have alternative representations, BIP 21 requires the use of a single representation in decimal notation. Even though BIP 20 proposes clear definitions for alternative representations, BIP 21 still wins as it reduces complexity at both human and machine levels. Luke-Jr clarifies that BIP 20 does not require support for Tonal Bitcoins and, in fact, states that clients should interpret even if one unit (e.g., TBC) would be a more rational way to display a specified amount, it should still be interpreted in the way that is deemed most intuitive to the user (e.g., BTC). The MultiBit team supports BIP 21 and will not be supporting Tonal Bitcoins anytime soon.</summary>
