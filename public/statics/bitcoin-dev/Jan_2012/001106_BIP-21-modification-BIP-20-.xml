    <summary>The writer supports BIP21 over BIP20 but is confused about the "Sending money via private key" feature and when it would be useful. They posted a proposal in the forum to extend the URI syntax with signatures, which would provide a proof of identity of the recipient. However, they were advised by genjix to post it elsewhere. The proposal is described in detail on ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html and the original forum post is available at bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=58534.msg689190#msg689190. The context ends with a promotional message recommending GMX DSL and offering rewards for referring friends and acquaintances.</summary>
