    <summary>A post on StackOverflow has introduced “Free Vote-Based Advertising for Open Source Projects”. The process involves submitting a 220x250 pixel ad, and when it receives six upvotes or more, it will be included in a rotation of ads displayed on the right-hand side of the StackOverflow site. The advertisement must be soliciting participation and contribution from programmers writing source code, rather than being a general-purpose ad for consumer products that happen to be open source. Suggestions for ad content can be made, but not posted on StackOverflow, as multiple ads for one project are not allowed.</summary>
