    <summary>In an email conversation on January 16th, 2012, Wladimir expressed concerns about internet censorship being a threat to Bitcoin. He argued that if people do not stand up for their rights now, they will deserve whatever consequences follow. However, the sentiment towards censorship was not widely shared, as very few individuals care about loading a particular URL. The impact of censorship would be more significant if it targeted forums. One suggestion was to run informative popups, but this may not be effective given the prevalence of such popups on higher traffic sites. An example of such a popup can be seen in the Wikipedia SOPA Blackout Design image.</summary>
