    <summary>In a conversation dated January 17, 2012, Jorge Tim√≥n stated that Wikipedia's stance against censorship is not a political issue but rather about free speech. He argues that free speech is a basic principle of both freedom and democracy and should be upheld. However, the opposing view is that censorship is good in principle while free speech and democracy are evil. This opposing viewpoint suggests that idolizing liberty is also evil and that backward morals are worse than a political issue. The author then suggests reading an article by Bishop Sanborn on the topic.</summary>
