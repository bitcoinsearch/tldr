    <summary>Amir Taaki and Gary Rowe discuss Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 20. Taaki notes that BIP 20 has no support among several implementations, while it does among others such as Spesmilo and WalletBuddy. He argues that it achieved consensus and Final status before any objections were made, and that the formal BIP process should be followed. Rowe questions the use of satoshi notation, citing readability, backwards compatibility, and forwards compatibility issues. Taaki counters that decimal numbers are not incompatible with web standards, which use hexadecimal numbers, and that satoshi notation is necessary for internal consistency and forward thinking. However, he concedes that a spec using strtol-compatible satoshis for amount would be simple and forward-compatible.</summary>
