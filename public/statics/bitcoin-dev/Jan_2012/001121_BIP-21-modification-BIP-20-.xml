    <title>BIP 21 (modification BIP 20)</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the modification of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) 20 and 21, with Matt Corallo proposing a modification of BIP 20. Andreas Schildbach prefers BIP 21 over BIP 20, but is neutral on the 'send' parameter included in both BIPs and requests a practical use case for it. He also questions the clarity of the 'version' parameter and suggests including how clients should handle it in the BIP. Wladimir suggests that the BIP should only define the URL scheme and leave room for future extensions such as send-to-private-address and send-multiple-signers. The extensions should be forwards-compatible, meaning older clients can detect schemes they don't understand and give appropriate error messages. The email ends with a promotion for the online learning library, LearnDevNow.</summary>
