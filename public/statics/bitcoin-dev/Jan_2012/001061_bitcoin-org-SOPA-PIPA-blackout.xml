    <summary>The author is against a blackout because it would harm users' trust in Bitcoin. There are many spammers advertising "miracle GPU miners" or "secure Bitcoin clients" that are actually just trojans. However, the author is okay with making a statement or putting up a banner. In response to someone asking how SOPA or PIPA affects Bitcoin, Gregory Maxwell states that SOPA contains new requirements for payment networks which may adversely impact Bitcoin services businesses and limit their ability to do business in the US and other places where similar legislation is adopted. The term "payment network provider" means an entity that directly or indirectly provides the proprietary services, infrastructure, and software to effect or facilitate a debit, credit, or other payment transaction. The act could also affect miners and mining pools located in the US by ordering them not to process transactions containing the well-known addresses of targeted infringing sites. Despite some people believing that SOPA/PIPA awareness is someone else's problem, the author argues that it is important to stay informed and involved because we live in one world, and anything that risks imposing new barriers is a threat to us all.</summary>
