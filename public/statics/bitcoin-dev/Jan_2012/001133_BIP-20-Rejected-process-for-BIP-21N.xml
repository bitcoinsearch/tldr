    <summary>In an email thread between Amir Taaki and slush on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2012, the topic of whether to use satoshis instead of decimal bitcoin for BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 21 was discussed. Slush suggested that using satoshis would be a better choice due to the difficulty of handling decimal numbers across all implementations. However, Amir argued against this idea, stating that all the HTML, URI, and everything else uses decimal numbers alone and there is no reason to break with tradition. He also pointed out that BIP 20 had no support among popular implementations such as Bitcoin-Qt, Electrum, MultiBit, or Bitcoin-JS, and was incompatible with almost every standard on the web. Thus, he recommended rejecting BIP 20 and making the new BIP 21 a consensus among developers. Despite some contentious issues such as the send private key and adding a time to expire field for merchants, a consensus seemed to be forming on most parts. In conclusion, Amir discouraged breaking with convention and suggested that developers agree on a new standard for BIP 21.</summary>
