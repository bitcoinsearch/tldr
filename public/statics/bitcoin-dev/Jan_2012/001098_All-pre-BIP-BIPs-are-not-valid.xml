    <summary>In a discussion on January 29, 2012, Matt Corallo expressed agreement with Luke's statement that the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21 had been finalized a long time ago. However, another participant disagreed, claiming that there was no consensus on the version agreed upon, which can be viewed on the Bitcoin Wiki page. The participant also provided links to the biased polls conducted by Luke on the Bitcointalk forum, which were started months after the URI scheme was finalized in January 2011.</summary>
