    <summary>The proposal written by Alberto Torres Ruiz (a.k.a. DiThi) suggests a way to add a hash-tree based check in the blockchain that would allow verification of unspent transactions without downloading and checking the entire blockchain. This solution is simple, and although the idea is not new, there isn't any technical description available on how this can be done at present. Satoshi's original paper describes pruning spent transactions in the blockchain to save storage space while it remains consistent and verifiable, but it is useless for partial blockchain downloads as one cannot know if a given transaction has been spent in a subsequent transaction. The proposal aims to make the process of verifying unspent transactions more efficient and feasible.
