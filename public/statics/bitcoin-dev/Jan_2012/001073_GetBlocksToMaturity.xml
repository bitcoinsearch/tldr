    <summary>In the context provided, the question arises as to why 20 is added to COINBASE_MATURITY. The protocol accepts spent transactions at 100 (COINBASE_MATURITY), so adding 20 more confirms seems like a measure to discourage people from spending until 120 confirms. Although if one is determined enough to hack their client, they can still spend before 120 but after 100.The speculation arises as to whether or not Satoshi overestimated how many competing races there would be between mined blocks.</summary>
