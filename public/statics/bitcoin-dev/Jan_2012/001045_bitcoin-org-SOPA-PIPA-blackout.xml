    <summary>The discussion revolves around internet censorship and its potential impact on Bitcoin. One member argues that if we do not stand up for our rights against censorship now, we will suffer the consequences in the future. However, another member suggests that Bitcoin.org should remain apolitical as there are always issues that can raise moral outrage and it would be impractical to constantly "blackout" the website over every problem. The conversation took place in 2012 and was shared on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Additionally, an RSA(R) Conference 2012 advertisement was included in the email.</summary>
