    <summary>The context is a discussion about the status of BIP 20, which was assigned as Final over a year ago. Amir Taaki disagrees with the status of BIP 20, stating that it did not go through the formalized motions in public and did not have the consensus building a standard requires. He claims that BIPs are always draft status, and their status changes as specified in BIP 0001. However, Luke Dashjr argues that there was a consensus and multiple implementations for BIP 20 in early 2011, thus making it a Final status. He adds that assigning a number does not give Amir Taaki the authority to demote a preexisting standard. Luke also notes that anyone can submit a competing BIP aimed at superseding BIP 20; however, until that occurs, BIP 20 remains in its current Final status. Despite their disagreement, they both agree that it is best to focus on actual forward progress. The URI Scheme is an example of a standard that did not go through the proper procedures and has been objected to by at least two implementations. The purpose of a standard is consensus-building, not enforcement from above. Therefore, it is argued that no BIP existed before the BIP process, and new BIPs are always draft status until they meet the conditions specified in BIP 0001.In a discussion on January 29, 2012, Matt Corallo expressed agreement with Luke's statement that the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21 had been finalized a long time ago. However, another participant disagreed, claiming that there was no consensus on the version agreed upon, which can be viewed on the Bitcoin Wiki page. The participant also provided links to the biased polls conducted by Luke on the Bitcointalk forum, which were started months after the URI scheme was finalized in January 2011.In a discussion on Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Amir Taaki claimed that BIP 20 was not accepted as final a year ago, despite Luke Dashjr's assertion to the contrary. Taaki argued that a BIP needs to go through the proper formalized motions in public before becoming accepted and claimed that the URI Scheme did not go through these motions. He stated that he did not know it was even accepted, and at least two implementations have objected to the standard as is. Taaki concluded by saying that he was not accepting it and anyone is welcome to submit a competing BIP to Luke's BIP 20. Matt, who was part of the discussion, agreed with Luke and pointed out that the version that was agreed on can be seen at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021. Additionally, he provided links to Luke's three biased polls for further reference: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6206.0, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6207.0, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6208.0.There are conflicting views about whether BIP 20 was accepted as final a year ago before the BIP process existed or not. While Luke Dashjr asserts that it was accepted, some disagree and believe that a BIP needs to go through formalized motions in public before becoming accepted. The discussions also revolved around the fact that the URI Scheme did not go through the proper procedures and has been objected to by at least two implementations. Despite their disagreement, they both agree that it is best to focus on actual forward progress.</summary>
