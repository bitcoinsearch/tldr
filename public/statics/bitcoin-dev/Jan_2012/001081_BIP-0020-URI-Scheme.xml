    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin transactions, Wladimir states that the spec needs to be minimally complete and that the subset implemented by bitcoin-qt allows for the description of all desirable transactions. He adds that the rest of the spec is simply redundancy, as all other ways of describing the same thing are unnecessary. He also mentions that if new transaction types are added, the spec obviously needs to be extended, but not with multiple ways to write the same thing. The debate was sparked when Luke-Jr mentioned that the version on the wiki armed as BIP 20 has a lot of extraneous information in its number encoding which is not implemented in Bitcoin-Qt. In response, Wladimir declines to reopen the debate, stating that a biased poll was conducted and that there were no links to Luke-Jr's version.</summary>
