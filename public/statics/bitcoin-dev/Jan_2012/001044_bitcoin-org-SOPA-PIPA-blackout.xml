    <summary>In a discussion on January 15, 2012, Jeff Garzik emphasized the importance of bitcoin.org remaining apolitical. He argued that although there are always issues that raise moral outrage, it is not practical to constantly 'blackout' the website over every single problem. Garzik's opinion was supported by another participant in the discussion who agreed that there are more important and urgent problems than SOPA/PIPA. The participants concluded that bitcoin.org should stay focused on its mission and avoid political controversies.</summary>
