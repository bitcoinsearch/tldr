    <summary>In an email exchange between Matt Corallo and Gary Rowe in 2012, Andreas Schildbach raised concerns about the use of ':' in URL parameter names. Gary Rowe referred to RFC 3986 on URI schemes which recommends that reserved general delimiters like the colon be changed to one of the unreserved characters that do not have to be URL encoded. The proposed options were underscore, hyphen, tilde, or period. Gary preferred Option B - hyphen. Matt acknowledged the usefulness of sources other than the RFC itself and agreed to change it to a hyphen.</summary>
