    <summary>The sender is inquiring about a fuzzer that is currently being developed. They are interested in finding more information on this topic and would like to know if there is already a fuzzer available for libbitcoin, as they plan to create one themselves if not. The sender is looking for a simple fuzzer that can set the previous block hash, set the current target, start hashing, and connect and send to a specified host (i.e localhost). They believe that building one should be trivial but still wish to ask for more details.</summary>
