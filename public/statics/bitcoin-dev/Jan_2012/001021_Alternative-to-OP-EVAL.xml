    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed a new OP_EVAL alternative that allows users to publish a short "funding address" as the hash of an arbitrary redemption script. He suggests implementing this in a backwards-compatible-in-the-blockchain way via a "pay to Script hash" transaction type. The proposal includes additional validation steps for new clients/miners, such as failing validation if there were any operations other than "push data" in the original scriptSig and running an additional validation on the deserialized script. Despite being described as a "hack", the proposal is considered cleaner than OP_EVAL, more straightforward to implement, and matches the feature of moving code from the scriptPubKey to the scriptSig.</summary>
