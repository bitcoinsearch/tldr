    <summary>In a discussion about the bitcoin URI system, Gary Rowe expressed that he believes simplicity is best and doesn't see a good use case for a block number. He suggests that the expires field is more important for limiting risk against currency or inventory movement. Rowe also notes that static pubkeyhash-addresses are only temporary solutions for merchant purposes until better solutions appear. He believes that these addresses are too limited and shouldn't be extended with too many features. Instead, there have been discussions about more dynamic approaches, such as HTTP communication to negotiate an address. Pieter, the original poster, agrees with Rowe's stance and suggests keeping bitcoin URIs simple for now.</summary>
