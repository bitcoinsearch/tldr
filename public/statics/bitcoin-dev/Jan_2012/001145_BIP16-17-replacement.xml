    <summary>In an email conversation on January 31, 2012, Andy Parkins expressed his nervousness about the ongoing debate surrounding BIP 17 and BIP 16, saying that it had veered into personal territory. He suggested that if there were objections to both proposals, then perhaps another solution would be better. He added that he was not aware of any remaining tangible objections to BIP 17, except for a theoretical risk that Gavin had brought up. However, Parkins stated that he was willing to withdraw BIP 17 if a better solution emerged.When someone else suggested that if client upgrades were going to be required anyway, why not make a big change, Parkins pointed out that both BIP 16 and 17 were backward-compatible enough that people could continue to use old clients with each other. Upgrades would only be necessary to send or receive new 3...-format addresses. Nevertheless, Parkins noted that the practical implications of both proposals could be rewritten in the suggested format, which would even eliminate one of the major objections to BIP 16 (its inconsistency).</summary>
