    <summary>The author believes that the internet has already covered the issue of SOPA and PIPA, and although they could potentially impact Bitcoin, it is not the most important or deadly fight for the cryptocurrency. The DMCA already makes it difficult for someone publishing blocks online to operate under a DMCA request, but SOPA would allow the US to cut access to offending sites across the world. However, the bills are not specifically aimed at Bitcoin, and companies with the most stake are taking the threat seriously.</summary>
