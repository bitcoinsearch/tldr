    <summary>StackOverflow has introduced a new way of advertising for open source projects through its platform. The process requires a 220x250 pixel ad to be submitted, and when it receives six upvotes or more, it will be included in a rotation of ads displayed on the right-hand side of the StackOverflow site. However, the advertisement must be soliciting participation and contribution from programmers writing source code, rather than being a general-purpose ad for consumer products that happen to be open source.It is important to note that suggestions for ad content can be made but not posted on StackOverflow as multiple ads for one project are not allowed. This initiative provides a unique opportunity for open source projects to gain visibility and attract contributions from developers. Overall, this free vote-based advertising for open source projects aims to promote community involvement in developing and improving open source software.</summary>
