    <summary>In an email dated January 30, 2012 at 1:50:03 PM, Gary Rowe spoke on behalf of the MultiBit team stating that they would not be supporting Tonal Bitcoins anytime soon. The team is instead backing the BIP 21 proposal. It was clarified that BIP 20 does not require Tonal Bitcoin support and actually states that even if one unit (such as TBC) could be a more rational way to display a specified amount, clients should still interpret it in the way that is deemed most intuitive to the user (such as BTC).</summary>
