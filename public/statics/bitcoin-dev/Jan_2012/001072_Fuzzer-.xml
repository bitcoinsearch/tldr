    <summary>Gavin Andresen created a transaction fuzzer on Github for the purpose of stress-testing BIP 16. The fuzzer can be used by using the send* RPC commands to obtain one or more transaction IDs, and then running a script that repeatedly calls relayfuzzed with a nonce/txid while observing how the connected peer(s) react to all the fuzzy 'inv/tx' protocol messages. Although he built the fuzzer with the intention of stress-testing BIP 16, Gavin states that there are many other useful features that could be added and welcomes patches. He also mentioned that adding block fuzzing is on his to-do list for the future.</summary>
