    <title>BIP 21 (modification BIP 20)</title>

    <summary>Matt Corallo has submitted a modification of BIP 20 which excludes the alternative non-decimal number related components. The modification is available on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021 and the author is being asked to become a champion of the BIP he submitted. Currently, GUI client implementations like MultiBit or Bitcoin-Qt are being asked if they support BIP 20 or BIP 21, with more weightage being given to GUIs with actual URI scheme implementations. It is important to have a general consensus on this matter, objections are welcome.</summary>
