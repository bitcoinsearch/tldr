    <summary>On January 31, 2012, a conversation took place between Gregory Maxwell and Gary Rowe regarding the use of doubles or floats for money. Gary made a statement that one should never use doubles or floats for money to which Gregory replied saying that many people do. He challenged Gary by asking him to place a sell order on mtgox for an exorbitant amount of money per BTC and see the doublemax trade it actually stores for him. The conversation was posted on the mailing list Shudder with a smiley face emoji. No further context or information is provided in the given text.</summary>
