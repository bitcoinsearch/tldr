    <summary>Amir Taaki forwarded an email from Gavin, who expressed concerns over creating really long Bitcoin addresses that exceed 70 characters. The issue was whether it would be okay for the new Bitcoin addresses to have such a length and whether they would still be functional. Gavin opined that having very long addresses would make it harder to copy and paste, scan with eyes, create readable QR codes, and upgrade website or database code that deals with Bitcoin addresses. He argued that there was a rough consensus that very-long addresses are not workable. Amir Taaki queried how it was possible to have a 70-byte long address without a P2SH scheme.</summary>
