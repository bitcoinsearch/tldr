    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Amir Taaki claimed that BIP 20 was not accepted as final a year ago, despite Luke Dashjr's assertion to the contrary. Taaki argued that a BIP needs to go through the proper formalized motions in public before becoming accepted and claimed that the URI Scheme did not go through these motions. He stated that he did not know it was even accepted, and at least two implementations have objected to the standard as is. Taaki concluded by saying that he was not accepting it and anyone is welcome to submit a competing BIP to Luke's BIP 20. Matt, who was part of the discussion, agreed with Luke and pointed out that the version that was agreed on can be seen at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021. Additionally, he provided links to Luke's three biased polls for further reference: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6206.0, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6207.0, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6208.0.</summary>
