    <summary>The writer of this post is struggling to locate the "create new post" link on the forum and decides to leave their feedback in this space instead. They provide three pieces of feedback for the client's developers. Firstly, it would be helpful if the client asked users whether they want to set a password to encrypt their wallet when they first start it up. Secondly, after synchronizing with the network, the OS X client crashes on startup every time. Lastly, the writer is unable to reply or create new posts on the forum. They offer to provide a backtrace if they can reproduce the error.</summary>
