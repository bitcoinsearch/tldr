    <summary>The issue of Bunk argument is affecting Bitcoin directly. The author believes that Wikipedia has a greater need to remain neutral and apolitical than Bitcoin. The Wikipedia community decided on a full and global blackout, and the author suggests that Bitcoin should do the same in unison with other websites such as Reddit and 4chan. The email from Jeff Garzik to Amir Taaki discusses the SOPA/PIPA blackout, with Amir Taaki expressing the opinion that it's the most important issue right now and suggesting everyone takes to the streets. However, Jeff Garzik prefers that bitcoin.org stays apolitical.</summary>
