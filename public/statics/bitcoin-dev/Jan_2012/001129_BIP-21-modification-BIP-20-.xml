    <summary>In a recent discussion about Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21 and BIP 20, Gavin Andresen expressed his preference for the former, stating that "simpler is better." He also endorsed the idea of signing and dating URIs, but suggested waiting until there is consensus around BIP 21 before pursuing it. Andresen recommended that follow-up BIPs be written after some experience with signing and dating URIs has been gained.</summary>
