    <summary>A suggestion has been made to revert the old pull and re-request it for easier code review of the real changes. The author counted one major merge and eight commits to fix bugs or tweak things, but was hesitant to revert them and risk losing a fix that they wanted to keep. Instead, they updated their gavinandresen/master github branch to the state just before the OP_EVAL merge for code review purposes. The changes can be viewed at https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/compare/master...pay_to_script_hash. There are unrelated 0.6 pulls in those changes as well, but it should be obvious what is what.</summary>
