    <summary>A discussion is underway regarding the purpose of counting the number of sig ops after executing a script in ConnectInputs. Gavin Andresen suggests reverting an old pull and then re-requesting it to make it easier to see the real changes, but he notes that there were one major merge and eight commits to fix bugs or tweak things. He updates his gavinandresen/master GitHub branch to the state of the tree just before the OP_EVAL merge for code review purposes. The changes include unrelated 0.6 pulls, but it should be pretty obvious what is what.</summary>
