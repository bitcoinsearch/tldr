    <summary>The bitcoin-development mailing list was originally created as a medium for discussion of development topics, as the bitcoin.org forum was filled with off-topic noise. One member expressed concern that the SOPA topic was not relevant to the list and suggested discussing it on more appropriate forums such as bitcointalk. Another member responded with comments about censorship being good and free speech and democracy being evil. The original poster requested that discussions remain focused on technical topics rather than internet trolling. Links to an online learning library for Microsoft developers were also included in the email.</summary>
