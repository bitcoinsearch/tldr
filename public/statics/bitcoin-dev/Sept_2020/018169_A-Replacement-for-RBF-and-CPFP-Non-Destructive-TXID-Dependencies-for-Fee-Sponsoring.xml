    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has proposed a draft mechanism to replace Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) and Replace By Fee (RBF) for increasing fees on transactions in the mempool. The proposal outlines a general purpose mechanism for expressing non-destructive dependencies on specific transactions being in the same block that can be used to sponsor fees of remote transactions. The motivation behind the proposal is to provide a fully abstracted primitive that requires no special structure from an underlying transaction in order to increase fees to confirm the transactions. The policy specification restricts the mempool such that no transaction with a Sponsor Vector may have any child spends, and a sponsoring transaction is exempted from any limits saturated at the time of submission. The proposal also includes a reference implementation demonstrating these rules. The author acknowledges that this is a best effort implementation, but has not been carefully audited for correctness.</summary>
