    <summary>In an email exchange between LL and Jay Berg via bitcoin-dev, LL stated that there is not much of a difference in security or privacy. The advice to avoid key-reuse remains the same and for the same reasons. Jay Berg, who is new to bitcoin-dev, asked if reusing keys acts differently in taproot than with Pay-to-PubKey-Hash. He also questioned whether the security/privacy implications are worse when reusing pubkeys with taproot. The original thread being referred to in this conversation is about Taproot (and graftroot) complexity and was started by Anthony Towns on February 10, 2020. The link to the thread is provided in Jay's email.</summary>
