    <summary>The discussion regarding the location of the sponsor vector in a transaction chain A-&gt;B-&gt;C is being held. The commitment to txid A by the sponsor S_A, where A is unaware of the sponsor has been highlighted. The consensus rules dictate that sponsor commitments are non-rival, and there is no issue in allowing multiple sponsors as long as they have feerate(S*) &gt; feerate(A). However, in the mempool, there may be issues with denial of service as it only allows one sponsor target per input. While the annex is a possible location for the sponsor vector, the witness space is more efficient, but it poses new challenges like specifying the sponsor vector in case of a 2-input transaction. The code has been fixed regarding the number of vectors allowed to be present in a transaction.</summary>
