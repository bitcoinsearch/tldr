    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeremy raises concerns about a potential attack using the Bitcoin mempool pinning mechanism. He notes that while it is expensive for attackers, there are ways to make it cheaper if they were planning to consolidate UTXOs at roughly the same feerate anyway. To prevent such attacks, he suggests two policies: restricting the size of sponsoring transactions to 1000 bytes or limiting the number of inputs and outputs in a sponsoring transaction to two. Dave agrees that the first policy is simpler and should allow full use of the sponsor mechanism while preventing this class of issues mostly. Dave also expresses concern that it would be hard to find a constant relay fee bump amount that was high enough to prevent abuse but low enough not to unduly hinder legitimate users.</summary>
