    <summary>It appears that there is a policy decision being made about accepting either the first-seen or a secondary deterministic test, but it is believed that the most-work chain is still always better than a "more fit" but less work chain. However, the properties of this change are being met with skepticism. The first-seen property has the advantage that once a block is received, there is reduced incentive to orphan it because the rest of the network will work on building on that block. With fitness, there is a 50% chance of a mined block being accepted, which could destabilize consensus convergence at the tip. A fitness rule like this could be useful if both blocks are seen within a very small window, such as 10 seconds, as it could decrease partition risk if the orphan was likely mined within close range of the other.</summary>
