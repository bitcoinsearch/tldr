    <summary>In response to David Harding's message regarding Powswap, the author expresses enthusiasm for the concept which allows users to bet on future Bitcoin mining outcomes without requiring any protocol changes. However, they note a potential issue with the need for watchtowers to prevent fund sweeping by the losing party, and raise concerns about how this may affect security assumptions in lightning channels. The author also poses several questions about the feasibility of placing bets on specific time slices and difficulty thresholds using Powswap. Specifically, they inquire about the possibility of betting on the first six blocks after a retarget and whether it is possible to bet on hashrate at specific points in the future.</summary>
