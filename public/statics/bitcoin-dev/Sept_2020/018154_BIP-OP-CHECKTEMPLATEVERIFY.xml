    <summary>The context discusses a proposed feature called "inverse timelock" that incentivizes spending a revocation UTXO after a timeout, making it unspendable. This feature has potential use cases in various covenant schemes like trustless lending and access-revocable vaults. The ability to commit to scriptSig of a non-segwit input could also be used for on-chain control of spending authorization, effectively revoking the ability to spend a certain input via CTV path, and alternate spending paths should be used.The implications of this feature on Bitcoin's behavior during reorgs were discussed, with some arguing that new rules violating certain principles should be introduced cautiously. A draft of changes for CTV was prepared but has not been updated yet, leaving time for further feedback.</summary>
