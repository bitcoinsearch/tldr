    <summary>In this email exchange from the Bitcoin developer mailing list, Mike Brooks presents a solution with 19 prefixed zeros for a blockheight value of 639254 and a fitness score of 1.282. He explains that with Nakamoto Consensus, both his solution and another would be considered equivalent and a given node would adopt the one it received first. However, in Floating-Post Nakamoto Consensus, the fitness scores are compared and the highest is kept, which means that some nodes would have to change their tip immediately. Franck questions why the higher value is considered the fittest instead of following the difficulty algorithm where smaller values prefixed with more zeroes are considered more valuable/difficult. He also asks if anything special would happen if competitive chains were created around a difficulty adjustment.</summary>
