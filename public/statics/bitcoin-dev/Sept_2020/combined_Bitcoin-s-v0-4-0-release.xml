    <summary>Bitcoin-s, a software team behind bitcoin technology, has recently launched version 0.4.0 of the software. The new release contains several significant features such as a wallet overhaul designed to support all common script types, SQLite and Postgres database support for all projects, improved robustness of the Neutrino node, BIP340 Schnorr Signatures implemented in Java (Bouncy Castle), wallet rescans with block filters, and a test kit that contains all new features so developers can re-use the code to test their bitcoin applications. The release notes can be found on their GitHub page or in the 'Getting Started' section on their website. These features will allow bitcoin developers to have more flexibility and control over their applications while also improving the overall security and functionality of the bitcoin network.</summary>
