    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Brooks and ZmnSCPxj, the former suggested that block creation times could be sped up by using proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. However, ZmnSCPxj expressed concern over the risks associated with increasing block creation times due to the potential for mining races. He also noted that efforts like compact blocks and FIBRE are already pushing the limits in terms of propagation time. ZmnSCPxj further stated that inter-block time may need to be increased in consideration of interplanetary communications times, as part of his plans for Earth-based civilization involve sending humans into space. In response to Mike Brooks' suggestion that incremental soft-forks could improve the Bitcoin network, ZmnSCPxj noted that changing inter-block times is not possible as a softfork, unless the timewarp bug is abused, which he believes was proposed by maaku7 before.</summary>
