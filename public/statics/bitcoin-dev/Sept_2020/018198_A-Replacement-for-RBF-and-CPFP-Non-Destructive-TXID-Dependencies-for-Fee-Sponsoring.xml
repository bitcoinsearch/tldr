    <summary>The proposed change to Bitcoin's transaction relay rules includes a mechanism that enables an "inverse timelock" for sponsor transactions. This allows sponsors to broadcast a transaction A and then make a pre-signed sponsor transaction B that sponsors A. The proposal suggests that it is not necessary for a sponsored transaction to be in the same block, but can also be in the last 100 blocks. However, transaction B will become invalid after 100 blocks have passed. If a timelock is placed on B to make it valid after 50 blocks, then it will be valid between blocks 50 and 100 after A has been confirmed.</summary>
