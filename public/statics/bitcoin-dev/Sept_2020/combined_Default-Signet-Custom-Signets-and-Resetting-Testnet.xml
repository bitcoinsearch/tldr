    <summary>The Bitcoin Core team is currently contemplating resetting the testnet, which has not been reset since 2012. This decision comes as Signet, a new alternative to testnet, is being developed and is expected to reduce the number of tests conducted on testnet. However, there are still some use cases that may prefer testnet due to its ability to stress test certain IBD and P2P scenarios.The debate around whether or not to reset testnet has led some to argue that it should remain as a large chain to allow for better stress testing. The Bitcoin Core team is open to hearing feedback, thoughts, and questions from the Bitcoin community to ensure that everyone's testing needs are being considered.Michael, a member of the Bitcoin Core team, encourages discussion outside of the closed issue on the Bitcoin Core repo. Ideally, discussions should take place on the mailing list or on IRC, where additional code review and testing of the first Signet PR in Bitcoin Core is also encouraged.Overall, the Bitcoin Core team is actively seeking input from the community to make an informed decision about the future of testnet and its potential reset.</summary>
