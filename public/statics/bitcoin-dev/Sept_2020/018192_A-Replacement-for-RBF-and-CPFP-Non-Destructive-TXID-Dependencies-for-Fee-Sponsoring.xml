    <summary>The user is questioning the functionality of a sponsored transaction on Bitcoin's mempool if the feerate is too low and has been removed due to fee pressure. The requirement that the sponsor vector's entry must be present in the mempool creates a catch-22 where the sponsor transaction cannot be broadcast because the sponsored transaction is not in the mempool, and the sponsored transaction cannot be rebroadcasted because the fee is too low. The user suggests that this requirement may need to be revised. However, since there is no global mempool, Replace-by-Fee (RBF) would still work by replacing the transaction if it exists and inserting it if it does not.</summary>
