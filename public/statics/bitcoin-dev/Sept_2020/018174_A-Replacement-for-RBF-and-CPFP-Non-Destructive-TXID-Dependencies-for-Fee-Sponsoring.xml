    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Jeremy shared a draft proposal for a mechanism to replace CPFP and RBF. The mechanism aims to increase fees on transactions in the mempool while being more robust against attacks. Dave responded with an interesting idea but had one immediate question regarding preventing garbage sponsors. To prevent garbage sponsors, the proposal requires that the sponsor's feerate must be greater than the sponsored's ancestor fee rate. One sponsor can replace another subject to normal replacement policies, and they are treated as conflicts. Dave points out two potential cases where Mallory can prevent Bob from sponsor-fee-bumping by submitting a sponsor before him or using an existing pinning technique to make it expensive for Bob to fee bump. In the second case, Bob needs to pay the incremental relay feerate, which is 10 nBTC/vbyte more, so 6 mBTC total ($66 at $11k/BTC).</summary>
