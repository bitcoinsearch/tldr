    <summary>On February 19th, 2023 at 6:56 PM, Anthony Towns replied to a message from Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev. In the original message, Pieter discussed the complexity of closing some doors and whether short ids were available prior to VERACK negotiation. Anthony agreed that two negotiation steps were necessary for negotiating the mapping table and choosing a mutually recognized table. However, he argued that if all negotiation of the mapping table took place just once before VERACK and without using short commands, there would be no need for re-negotiating short commands after they are already in use. This could simplify some implementations, though nothing concrete was specified.</summary>
