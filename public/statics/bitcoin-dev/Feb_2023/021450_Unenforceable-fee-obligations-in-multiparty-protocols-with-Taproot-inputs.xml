    <summary>In an email sent by Andrew Poelstra via bitcoin-dev, he addressed some minor issues with his previous email. He provided links to the Taproot specification and stated that CODESEPARATOR opcode could prevent signature migration within a tapbranch or between branches, due to witness malleability in Taproot's design. However, he later corrected himself after reading BIP 341, which did not specify all of the sighash, and referred to BIP 342 where the tapleaf hash is added. Lastly, he humorously quoted Justin Lewis-Webster saying "The sun is always shining in space".</summary>
