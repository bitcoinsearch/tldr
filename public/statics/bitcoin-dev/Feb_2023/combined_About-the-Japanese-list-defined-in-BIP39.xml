    <summary>XEMBook has proposed a new Japanese word list to replace the current one defined in BIP39, which contains insults. The new list is called Japanese Seasonal and includes beautiful words from the Saijiki, known for its word choice and history of over 300 years. XEMBook suggests that BIP39 considers including this new list instead.The current Japanese word list and the proposed new list are provided as links for reference.</summary>
