    <summary>Codex32 is a protocol that enables individuals to perform recollection on paper in private without the use of electronics. The process involves using a pen and lookup tables or a paper device to verify the correct recall of a string. Error correction can be aided by a computer, which requires very little trust. There is no information about the master seed in a single share from a split secret; hence partial information about one share cannot compromise the master key. Codex32 does not provide support for nested SSSS, unlike SLIP39. However, it is possible to use the share for one level as the secret for the next level. Codex32â€™s metadata can store version information for wallets that use implicit BIP32 paths. It is recommended to store descriptor data alongside shares in various locations.Hardware wallets are great for providing practical protection. Once secrets are loaded onto a hardware wallet, it cannot leak any secrets, provided it remains isolated. Three main vectors a hardware wallet can try to communicate include (1) compromise at seed/master secret, (2) lie about public keys at public key generation time, and (3) exfiltrate data through signature data or otherwise during signature generation time. Codex32 addresses issue #1 by taking master secret handling functions out of the hardware wallet. It is difficult for digital hardware to generate randomness. Hardware wallets can exfiltrate data through other attack vectors such as blinking lights, making noise, or radio broadcasts, but these require physical local support, which is a big hurdle to overcome.</summary>
