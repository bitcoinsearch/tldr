    <summary>The discussion on the usage of OP_RETURN in Bitcoin continues among developers. A user on GitHub has asked about the process for someone to do a pull request for an OP_RETURN proposal, as they are not a C/C++ expert and do not want to waste anyone's time with a subpar proposal. Another developer, Russell O'Connor, suggests that there is a crossover point in data size where it will be cheaper to use witness data than script pubkey, making such a calculation the basis of a reasonable OP_RETURN proposal. However, Peter Todd disagrees with trying to argue a specific limit and believes users should decide for themselves how to use OP_RETURN. The original user provides links to their CV and various projects related to Bitcoin, including a universal coin swap system and a Bitcoin NFT system.</summary>
