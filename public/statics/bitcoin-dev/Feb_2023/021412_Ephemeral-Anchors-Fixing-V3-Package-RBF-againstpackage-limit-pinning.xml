    <summary>In a discussion involving Peter Todd and Greg Sanders regarding the use of OP_2 as a means to avoid changing unit tests in Bitcoin Core, Todd expressed his dislike for the idea, stating that it would result in unnecessarily obscure code. He suggested using OP_TRUE instead, which results in a 1 on the stack and plays better with other standardness rules. Todd also noted that the use of OP_2 may require special cases in certain implementations of other standardness rules. Sanders had previously checked the proposal and found that it fails several standardness tests in unit/functional tests in Bitcoin Core. It is unclear what other standardness rules are being referred to in the discussion.</summary>
