    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the issue of storing data on-chain. The participants agree that it is absurd to flood Bitcoin with useless transactions for storage purposes. Some suggest that storing proofs that can be checked using a third-party or sidechain is a viable solution, but it requires more than 80B. To address this, increasing the size of OP_RETURN to support a hash, signature, and metadata could be helpful in many scenarios. However, some argue that an increase in OP_RETURN size may not reduce inscription-style use cases significantly, as they are primarily used for much larger datasets.
