    <summary>The conversation is about data storage in the Bitcoin network. Datacarrier enables storing data in taproot annex with a single transaction, and the script validation extension via PUSH_ANNEX. The proposal to allow publishing data through a single transaction is discussed as an alternative to using witness data. OP_RETURN debate remains relevant, though it is trivially modifiable. If people want to store large data, they can pay for it. Nodes must validate the whole data, but there are concerns about "partial" block validation and skipping witness data. Data carrier entry in the annex would make publishing data cheaper than OP_RETURN. The txid commits to the OP_RETURN output, so downloading all OP_RETURN data is necessary to validate a block's merkle tree. However, partial block validation is possible without downloading witness data.</summary>
