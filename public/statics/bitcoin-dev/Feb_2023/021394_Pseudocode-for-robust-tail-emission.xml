    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user John Tromp clarified a statement made about transaction reward fees. The original statement claimed that the current total reward per transaction was $63, which is three orders of magnitude higher than typical fees. However, Tromp corrected this by saying that the reward is actually only two orders of magnitude higher than current fees, which are typically over $0.50. He emphasized that there was no need to exaggerate the difference.</summary>
