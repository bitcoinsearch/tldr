    <summary>Bitcoin Inquisition has released version 24.0, which includes support for BIP 118 (ANYPREVOUT) and BIP 119 (CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY) on regtest and signet. The release is available on Github, with guix builds also available. The main change since 23.0 is the rebase on top of Bitcoin Core 24.0, but the patch sets for both BIPs have been tightened up a little as well. Additional soft forks or relay policy changes can be proposed by filing a pull request, and work in progress is tracked on a project board. Those interested in more background can read the 23.0 announcement.</summary>
