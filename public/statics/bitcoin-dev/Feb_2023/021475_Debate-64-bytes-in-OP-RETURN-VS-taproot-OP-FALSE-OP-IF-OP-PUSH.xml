    <summary>In a message to Claus Ehrenberg, Aymeric Vitte expressed his confusion regarding a solution proposed earlier. The proposal involved requiring all data to be in the op_return output and adding a required op_return_hash field, which is checked by consensus. This redundancy would enable "content-sensitive" communities to ignore the data they don't like without the need for nodes to store/download/look at the contents of op_return data. Aymeric Vitte also shared a workaround solution to the 80b op_return limitation issue, although it has some drawbacks. He suggested that a 1tx storage solution for the future is urgently required and considered OP_RETURN as a dart in the past but changed his mind as it's adapted to current evolutions. Russell O'Connor had proposed that users decide for themselves how they want to use OpReturn after Peter Todd had suggested that it's not worth the technical complexity trying to argue a specific limit. The message concluded with Aymeric Vitte sharing links to his CV, LinkedIn, GitHub, and various projects involving bitcoin, including a Universal Coin Swap system based on Bitcoin, a bitcoin NFT system, Move your coins by yourself (browser version), Bitcoin transactions made simple, torrent-live, node-Tor, Anti-spies and private torrents, dynamic blocklist, and Peersm.</summary>
