    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Russell O'Connor proposed that there is a point where it would be more cost-effective to use witness data instead of script pubkey. He suggested that a calculation could be made to determine this crossover point, which could be used to create a reasonable OP_RETURN proposal. However, Peter Todd disagreed with the idea of trying to argue a specific limit and suggested that users should decide for themselves how they want to use OpReturn.</summary>
