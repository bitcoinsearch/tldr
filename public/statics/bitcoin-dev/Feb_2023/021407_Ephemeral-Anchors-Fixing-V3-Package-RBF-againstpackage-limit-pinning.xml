    <summary>On January 27, 2023, Greg Sanders via bitcoin-dev proposed the Ephemeral Anchors idea and wrote up a short draft BIP, which can be found on Github. The pull request on Github has been refreshed on top of the latest V3 proposal, but the BIP itself remains unaffected. In response to the proposal, Peter Todd asked for clarification on why OP_2 is used instead of OP_TRUE, as OP_TRUE is often used in test vectors. Greg Sanders responded on February 2, 2023, stating that he had to change test vectors everywhere for principled reasons.</summary>
