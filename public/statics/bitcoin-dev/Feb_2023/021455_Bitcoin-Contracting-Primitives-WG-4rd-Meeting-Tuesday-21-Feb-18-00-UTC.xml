    <summary>The fourth Bitcoin contracting primitives WG meeting has been proposed for Tuesday 21st February at 18:00, which is two weeks from now. The agenda topics can be proposed in advance on an open platform. Two topics have already been proposed for the upcoming meeting. Firstly, ANYPREVOUT / "Eltoo", which is a work in progress during the last year for Eltoo lightning channels. Secondly, if there is sufficient interest, setting up an open meatspace event during S2 2023 or S1 2024. Meatspace events can be a great thing to accelerate the development pace of contracting protocols. If time remaining, everyone blockers in their contracting primitives/covenant research could be listened to. Communication venue is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat IRC. Logs of the previous session are available here.</summary>
