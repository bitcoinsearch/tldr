    <summary>The conversation between Greg Sanders and Peter Todd revolves around the use of OP_TRUE as the canonical anyone-can-spend output. While Sanders feels that OP_TRUE is the obvious way to do this, Todd believes that scripts should leave just a single OP_TRUE on the stack at the end of execution, in order to avoid malleability issues. Currently, this is not implemented as a rule. However, Todd suggests that using OP_TRUE as the canonical output would ensure adherence to this standardness rule and prevent the need for special-cased workarounds. Todd has also fixed up tests for the OP_TRUE case on Github.</summary>
