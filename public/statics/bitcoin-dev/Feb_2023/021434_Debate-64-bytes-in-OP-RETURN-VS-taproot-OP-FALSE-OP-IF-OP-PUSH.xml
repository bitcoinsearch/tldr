    <summary>On February 5, 2023 at 1:11:35 AM GMT+01:00, Russell O'Connor via bitcoin-dev suggested that there is a crossover point in data size where it will simply be cheaper to use witness data since bytes in the witness are cheaper than bytes in the script pubkey. However, he did not think it was worth the technical complexity trying to argue a specific limit and instead proposed that users should decide for themselves how they want to use OpReturn. O'Connor believes that the calculation of such a crossover point could form the basis of a reasonable OP_RETURN proposal, but acknowledges that it would depend on the finer details of the overhead of the two methods. He further adds that while this proposal may not necessarily be persuasive, it would at least be coherent.</summary>
