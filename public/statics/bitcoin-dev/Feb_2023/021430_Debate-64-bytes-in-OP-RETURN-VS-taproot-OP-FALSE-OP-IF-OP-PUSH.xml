    <summary>In an email conversation, Aymeric Vitte discusses the process of submitting a pull request to switch 80 to another number, stating that it seems easy to do. Christopher Allen responds, saying that while the initial PR may be easy, there will likely be a need for assistance with making it turn on/off from when the bitcoin daemon is initialized. The harder part will be writing the initial comment, where they should carefully explain the rationale, link to existing conversations, and address objections. Vitte must also answer outstanding concerns about the change, revise the PR at any time, evangelize the change worldwide, and pay nodes/miners to update at a subtle block height decided by the community. Allen notes that this is more a conversation than collusion and that Vitte will need to demonstrate that miners and full nodes have turned it on for it to become non-optional. Finally, Vitte states that the change is needed to prevent deviant behaviors similar to Ethereum's "messy stuff." Allen gives his concept ACK (acknowledgment) to the proposal.</summary>
