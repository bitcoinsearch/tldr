    <summary>In an email exchange, Greg Sanders predicts that most custodians may be hesitant to whitelist a witness version that they know is insecure. David A. Harding questions whether wallets should only send to outputs they know can be secured or if they should spend to the output indicated by any valid bech32m address. He finds the more restrictive approach to be sad and believes that there is a benefit to testing it when proprietary software is involved. However, he wants the testing to use the address least likely to cause problems for protocol developers in the future. David asks Greg and others on the list if they have any reason to believe that OP_16 OP_PUSH2 0000 would be a problematic script or if they can think of a better one. The email also references BIP350, which recommends ensuring that wallet implementations support sending to v1 and higher versions.</summary>
