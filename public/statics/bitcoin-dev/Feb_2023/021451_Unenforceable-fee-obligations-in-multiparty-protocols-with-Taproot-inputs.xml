    <summary>In a discussion thread on bitcoin-dev, Andrew Poelstra mentioned that uncompressed keys can lead to "surprise" witness inflation. However, since the implementation of segwit, uncompressed keys have been banned, and keys are now fixed at 33 bytes (32 in Taproot). Peter Todd chimed in to clarify that this issue has existed since the beginning of Bitcoin, with compressed pubkeys being supported in v0.1.0. P2PKH addresses, which start with 1, are the pre-P2SH ones. Todd's contact information can be found at https://petertodd.org, and his email address is 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</summary>
