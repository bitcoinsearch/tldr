    <summary>In a discussion on Github regarding the use of OP_RETURN in Bitcoin, Aymeric Vitte suggested that if one needs to store something big and can afford several transactions then they should use witness. However, for small things like signatures, addresses, hashes and metadata, they should use OP_RETURN. They asked how to move forward with several OP_RETURN and no size limit. In response, Peter Todd stated that since OP_RETURN doesn't take advantage of the witness discount and has minimal impact, there is no reason to micromanage exactly how people use it. He believes that people should decide for themselves with the fee market, just like how there are no artificial limits on Taproot. Aymeric Vitte's details including their CV, LinkedIn profile, and Github account were also included in the context. Additionally, links to their Universal Coin Swap system, bitcoin NFT system, node-Tor, anti-spies and private torrents, dynamic blocklist, peersm, and a tool for moving coins were provided.</summary>
