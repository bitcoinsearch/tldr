    <summary>In a discussion about the use of OP_RETURN and Taproot in blockchain, it was pointed out that publishing data using OP_RETURN does not necessarily provide better timestamping than other methods. Efficient timestamps do not require publishing meaningful data, and many timestamps can be combined into a single merkle tree. OpenTimestamps uses OP_RETURN only because the efficiency gain from using a more efficient method is not significant enough to justify the time spent on improving it. Additionally, the use of Taproot to make a script visible is not necessarily better for keeping data private, as the decision to reveal data ultimately lies with the user. It is important to carefully consider the implications of using either method before making a decision.</summary>
