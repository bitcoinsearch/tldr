    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin storage practices, Aymeric Vitte asked about the best practices for storing data in Bitcoin. The response was to avoid putting unspendable data in the UTXO set, but beyond that, it depends on the specific application. When asked about the current rules for OP_RETURN (which allows users to attach data to their transactions), the answer given was a maximum size of 80 bytes and one OpReturn output per transaction. However, this is only a standard rule, and with a miner willing to mine non-standard transactions, anything goes. The discussion was hosted on Peter Todd's website.</summary>
