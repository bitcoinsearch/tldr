    <summary>The Bitcoin Inquisition has recently released version 24.0, which includes support for BIP 118 (ANYPREVOUT) and BIP 119 (CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY) on regtest and signet. The release is available on Github with guix builds also available. The update involves the rebase on top of Bitcoin Core 24.0 with patch sets for both BIPs being tightened up a little as well. Interested parties can propose additional soft forks or relay policy changes by filing a pull request, and the work in progress is tracked on a project board.Those who wish to know more about the previous version can read the 23.0 announcement. With the introduction of these new features, Bitcoin Inquisition is expected to offer better flexibility and convenience to its users.</summary>
