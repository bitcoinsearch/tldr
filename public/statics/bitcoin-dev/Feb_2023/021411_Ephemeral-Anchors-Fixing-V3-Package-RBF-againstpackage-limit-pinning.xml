    <summary>Greg Sanders reported that the use of OP_2 fails several standardness tests in Bitcoin Core. This idea was proposed by Luke Jr in 2017 and later arrived at by Sanders independently. However, the use of OP_2 seems unnecessarily obscure just to avoid changing some unit tests. There is a better way to do this using OP_TRUE which results in a 1 on the stack and plays better with other standardness rules. The use of OP_2 may require special cases in certain implementations of other standardness rules. Peter Todd's signature is attached to the email.</summary>
