    <summary>The post delves into the game-theoretic security of time-sensitive protocols in the scenario where miners are open to censorship for a reward, but don't trust each other and there are no reorgs. The author examines various constructions such as opcode-based, nLockTime-based with OP_CSV output, anchor outputs, and lightning. To enhance the attack bar, the author recommends using nLockTime-based construction with OP_CSV output or anchor outputs, while also enforcing a way to steal or burn external fees in case of an attack. Alternatively, new fee/channel constructions can be designed. The post concludes by providing references to related work in this area.</summary>
