    <summary>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Aymeric Vitte suggested an increase in the size of OP_RETURN to prevent the invention of deviant things. The current size limit of 80B is not enough to store a signature or hash, which could result in inscription-style scenarios. Christopher Allen agreed with the suggestion and added that updating the size of OP_RETURN to support a hash or two, a signature, and some metadata would be helpful in various situations. This would still be a limit but a reasonable one.</summary>
