    <summary>On the Bitcoin development mailing list, Russell O'Connor reported a bug in Taproot that allows for the same Tapleaf to be repeated multiple times within the same Taproot. This could result in incurring different Tapfee rates at different Taplevels. One countermeasure suggested is to always know the entire Taptree when interacting with someone's Tapspend. Another possible countermeasure is to implement RBF on taproot witnesses, allowing transactions with deeper, less efficient, tapleaf scripts to be replaced with shallower, more efficient ones. This could be done through giving peers delta encoded updates, which may offer sufficient bandwidth efficiency to always allow such updates.</summary>
