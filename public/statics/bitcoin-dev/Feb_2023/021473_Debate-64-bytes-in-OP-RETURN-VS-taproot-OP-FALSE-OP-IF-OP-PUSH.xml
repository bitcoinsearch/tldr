    <summary>The context describes a workaround provided in a GitHub gist for the 80-byte OP_RETURN limitation in Bitcoin. The workaround is said to be outstandingly bad but working, and it brings Bitcoin back ten years ago. The need for a 1tx storage solution for the future is discussed, and the urgency of the matter is highlighted. A proposal is made to store data in addresses as a one-transaction solution, but this is considered super bad at the end because it involves burning bitcoins. In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, there is a discussion on the crossover point in data size where using witness data would be cheaper than using script pubkey, which could form the basis of a reasonable OP_RETURN proposal. It's suggested that users should decide for themselves how they want to use OpReturn. Aymeric Vitte shares his CV, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub links, which include a Universal Coin Swap system based on Bitcoin, a bitcoin NFT system, a way to move coins by yourself, Bitcoin transactions made simple, torrent-live, node-Tor, an anti-spies and private torrents dynamic blocklist, and Peersm.</summary>
