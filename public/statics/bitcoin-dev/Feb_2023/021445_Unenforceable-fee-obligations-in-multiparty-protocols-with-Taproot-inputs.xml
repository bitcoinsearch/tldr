    <summary>The email conversation between Yuval and LL discusses a potential attack scenario in multiparty transactions, exploiting the variable size of Taproot spends. The last input signed can use a larger signature to unfairly extract fee contributions from other parties, without affecting absolute fees but reducing the feerate for the transaction. In this scenario, Mallory registers a P2TR output with a large script spend path, such as an ordinal inscription commitment transaction output, and commits to a fee obligation calculated on the basis of a key spend. When all other participants have provided signatures, the script spend path can be used. This attack effectively steals a fee from other participants since their signatures do not directly or indirectly commit to a feerate. There are several mitigations proposed to prevent this attack, including negotiating a lower feerate ahead of time, enforcing minimal weight before signing, using a trusted coordinator, providing publicly verifiable protocol transcripts, increasing costliness, and requiring signature ordering. However, each mitigation has its limitations and trade-offs. For instance, RBF can be prevented by pinning attacks, while minimum confirmation age may not work in the context of lightning channels. Hence, the authors suggest implementing multiple mitigations simultaneously.</summary>
