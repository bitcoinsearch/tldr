    <summary>In the Bitcoin blockchain, if one needs to place a 64-byte message, they might wonder whether to choose a traditional OP_RETURN or a spent taproot transaction. However, anti-OP_RETURN folks may argue against both options. If there is no other choice for a particular protocol, such as a timestamp or a commitment, which option is better? Is there a safer place to put 64 bytes that is more uncensorable but also does not clog UTXO space, only spent transaction `-txindex` space? Christopher Allen believes that the taproot method could be better, but there might be some who disagree. He invites all sides to share their thoughts.</summary>
