    <summary>There is a bug in Taproot that allows the same Tapleaf to be repeated multiple times in the same Taproot, potentially at different Taplevels incurring different Tapfee rates. The countermeasure is that you should always know the entire Taptree when interacting with someone's Tapspend. Some people highlighted some minor problems with Andrew Poelstra's last email. In Taproot, if you want to prevent signatures migrating to another branch or within a branch, you can use the CODESEPARATOR opcode which was redisegned in Taproot for exactly this purpose. In Taproot the tapleaf hash is always covered by the signature (though not in some ANYONECANPAY proposals) so you can never migrate signatures between tapbranches.</summary>
