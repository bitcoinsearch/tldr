    <summary>XEMBook suggests a new Japanese word list to replace the current one defined in BIP39, which includes insults. The new list, called Japanese Seasonal, contains beautiful words from the Saijiki, which has been around for over 300 years and is known for its word choice. XEMBook encourages the consideration of including this list in BIP39. The link to the current Japanese word list and the proposed new list are provided.</summary>
