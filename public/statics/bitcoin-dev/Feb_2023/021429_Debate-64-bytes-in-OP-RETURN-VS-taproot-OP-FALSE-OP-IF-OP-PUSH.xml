    <summary>To request a change to the OP_RETURN size in Bitcoin, an individual must issue a pull request where they switch 80 to another number. They must be prepared to answer any concerns about the change and be willing to revise the pull request at any time. The change could potentially be from 80B to 82.xB, with x coming from a non-understandable crypto formula. After the change is accepted, the individual must pay the nodes/miners to update at a specific block height decided by the community. It is important to note that this change is necessary to prevent deviant behaviors from occurring within Bitcoin.The process of changing the OP_RETURN size typically involves discussions within the community before moving concretely to a pull request on bitcoin-core. The challenge is getting sufficient acknowledgments (ACKs) for the pull request, as well as addressing any negative acknowledgments (NACKs). The maintainers must choose when to merge the change into the codebase based on their sense of the community's interest and consensus.Once the change is released, it can only happen after sufficient miners and nodes update to the release and turn it on.

This type of change can only occur once enough miners and nodes have updated to the new release.</summary>
