    <summary>On February 18, 2023 at 1:35:34 AM GMT+02:00, Andrew Poelstra via bitcoin-dev suggested statically analyzing the IF branch to determine whether it could ever be taken. He proposed that if this method could be reliably and efficiently done, it would force inscription scripts to be "plausible" and increase their space cost by requiring OP_DROP to be added somewhere hundreds of times. In response to this suggestion, the question was raised about the actual percentage increase to adding OP_DROPs as proposed by Poelstra.</summary>
