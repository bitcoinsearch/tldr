    <summary>The author of the post wonders how strict the rules against spamming the blockchain should be. They suggest that creating an official alternative to on-chain storage is necessary, and suggests timestamping data instead of storing it. The author proposes using a commitment to a signature as a solution for timestamping and validating data. They argue that this would be more efficient than using OP_RETURN or witness nodes, as only nodes that explicitly enable commitments would store them. The author then references a quote by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and asks if Bitcoin developers share the sentiment of defending free speech. They bring up concerns about censorship and discuss ways to test censorship resistance. They propose an ideal tool for testing censorship resistance that allows users to construct different types of transactions, broadcast them to specific nodes, verify successful relay or rejection, and ban peers if necessary. Finally, they mention the idea of an external mempool as a potential solution to avoiding censorship in certain cases.</summary>
