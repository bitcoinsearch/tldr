    <summary>On February 3, 2023, Christopher Allen suggested increasing the size of OP_RETURN in order to support a hash, signature, and metadata. This would be beneficial in several situations and would help prevent inscription-style scenarios from becoming more prevalent. Aymeric Vitte agreed that an increase in OP_RETURN could be helpful but believed it would not significantly impact the frequency of inscription-style use cases. These types of use cases are typically used for much larger datasets and receive a segwit discount.</summary>
