    <summary>In an email to bitcoin-dev, Andrew Poelstra discusses the issue of banning specific script fragments in relation to spammers. According to Poelstra, if these fragments are banned, spammers will simply use `IF ENDIF` and provide the `FALSE` as a zero push, which would also ban legitimate use cases. He clarifies that the `FALSE` would be provided as a separate witness element rather than being part of the witnessScript. Poelstra is the Director of Research at Blockstream and can be contacted via email or through his website.</summary>
