    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the use of multisig to encode images in the chain. Elimination of max-witness size in 2017 made it cheaper to use multisig, reducing the number of transactions needed. The inscriptions are designed to be easy to use and specify mime types should be used for interpretation. There is concern about potentially malicious content being stored in the main chain, leading to suggestions for an opt-out feature or using extension blocks like Litecoin. The idea of linking a sat to a deed or other legal construct for proof of ownership in the real world is discussed, but storing the property itself on the blockchain seems nonsensical. One interesting example mentioned is a javascript exploit that can render untrusted blockchain data in a browser, with the script to interpret these inscriptions being trivial and not much harder to add a mime type.</summary>
