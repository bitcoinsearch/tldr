    <summary>In an email thread, Aymeric Vitte expressed concern that the current limitation of not allowing unspendable data in the UTXO set forces users to store their data in witness or adopt deviant behavior. Peter Todd responded that there are no specific rules for storing data in Bitcoin, and users should do what makes sense for their application. Regarding OP_RETURN, the standardness rule allows for a maximum of 80 bytes and only one OpReturn output per transaction. However, miners willing to mine non-std transactions can allow for more flexibility. Vitte also provided links to his CV, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles, as well as his projects related to Bitcoin, NFTs, and a Universal Coin Swap system. He also offered a browser version of a wallet and a Github project for simplifying Bitcoin transactions. Additionally, he shared information about torrent-live, node-Tor, Peersm, and a dynamic blocklist for anti-spies and private torrents.</summary>
