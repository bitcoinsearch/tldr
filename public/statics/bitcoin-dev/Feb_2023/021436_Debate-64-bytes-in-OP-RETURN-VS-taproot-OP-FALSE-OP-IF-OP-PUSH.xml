    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev forum revolves around the use of the OP_RETURN in storing small things like signatures, addresses hashes, and metadata in a single transaction. The current practice is to use witness if you want to store something big and can afford several transactions in your design. However, the issue that arises is when there are several OP_RETURNs with no size limit. Aymeric Vitte proposed a bug/enhancement proposal to allow any number of OP_RETURN outputs. Peter Todd responded by suggesting the removal of the size limit since people can publish data using other means, including a 75% discount, and let the fee market deal with it. Aymeric Vitte provided his CV, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub links for reference. He has also developed various Bitcoin-related systems, which he shared in his GitHub account.</summary>
