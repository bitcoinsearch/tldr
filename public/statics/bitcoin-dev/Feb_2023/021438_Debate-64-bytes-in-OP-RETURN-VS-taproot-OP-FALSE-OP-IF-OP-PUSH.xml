    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Russell O'Connor suggests that there is a crossover point in data size where it will simply be cheaper to use witness data instead of script pubkey due to the fact that bytes in the witness are cheaper. He proposes that a calculation could form the basis of a reasonable OP_RETURN proposal. Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, agrees with Peter's suggestion that since users have found ways to store arbitrary amounts of data on-chain if they really want, we might as well just make OP_RETURN a free-for-all.</summary>
