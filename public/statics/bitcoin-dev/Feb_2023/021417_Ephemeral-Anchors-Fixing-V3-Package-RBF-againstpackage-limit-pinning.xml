    <summary>In an email exchange, Greg Sanders suggests using OP_TRUE as the canonical anyone-can-spend output to ensure scripts leave just a single OP_TRUE on the stack at the end of execution, reducing malleability in certain circumstances where scriptSig provides an OP_TRUE. He notes that although this isn't currently implemented as a rule, it could be in a future upgrade. Leaving an OP_2 on the stack wouldn't achieve this and would require a special-cased workaround. By using OP_TRUE, it plays better with other standardness rules and avoids potential issues.</summary>
