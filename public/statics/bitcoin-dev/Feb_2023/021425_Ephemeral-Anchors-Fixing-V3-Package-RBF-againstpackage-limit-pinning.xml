    <summary>In an email chain, Greg Sanders expresses his lack of persuasion towards certain ideas and mentions that he has fixed tests for the OP_TRUE case. He provides a link to the Github repo where the tests can be viewed. Another individual responds by saying that after looking through the tests, they believe that not all cases need to be changed to OP_2 as they are not related to standardness. The email thread ends with a signature attachment from Peter Todd, whose website is also linked in the email.</summary>
