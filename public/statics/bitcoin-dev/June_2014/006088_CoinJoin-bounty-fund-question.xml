    <summary>Odinn, a Bitcoin enthusiast, is seeking information about the CoinJoin bounty fund address, which he encouraged people to donate to in 2013 after seeing some Reddit discussions. The address is a P2SH/multisignature one. Odinn has observed that CoinJoin has been implemented in various places since then, such as blockchain.info and Sharedcoin by github.com, among others. He is curious about what the CoinJoin bounty fund supports at this point and where it's intended to go, whether it will help fund other things or not. Odinn believes that the bitcoin-development list is the right place for this question, rather than on twitter or similar.</summary>
