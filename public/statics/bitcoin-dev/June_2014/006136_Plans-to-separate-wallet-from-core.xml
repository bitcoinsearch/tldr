    <summary>In an email exchange on 24th June 2014, Tamas Blummer raised a question about the advantage of having services like exchange and payment processors talking via the p2p protocol instead of something more direct when both processes are controlled by the same entity. Wladimir responded positively to the headers-first approach and clarified that nobody would be forced to separate the code in a way they don't like. However, he acknowledged the need for modularity and competing codebases and expressed his reservation about the argument that indexes must be necessarily out of the core. He suggested that the "core full-node" should maintain a minimal and non-optimized mining functionality, even if it is only used for testing purposes. Nevertheless, he agreed with everyone that the wallet code needs to be separated.</summary>
