    <summary>In a message signed with a PGP signature, Kevin questions why pools are being punished. The writer responds that it's part of a trend to look at the misbehavior of specialists in an economy with a division of labor, and instead of fixing the misbehavior, deciding to throw out the entire concept of labor specialization. This hatred of labor specialization has led to scrypt mining, PoS, and MaidSafe. The message ends with a reminder to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible. A non-text attachment is also included.</summary>
