    <summary>In an email conversation, someone questioned why a specific case was chosen for structured data when there are many fields that could benefit from it. Gavin Andresen, the recipient of the email, responded by explaining that protocol buffers are built to be extensible with hundreds of available field numbers. He argued that it would be unnecessary and inefficient to add a generic field when the container format already has mechanisms in place for extensions.</summary>
