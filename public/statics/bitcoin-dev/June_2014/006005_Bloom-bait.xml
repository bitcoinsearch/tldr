    <summary>The context is a response to a proposal for retroactively making Bloom filtering an optional part of the protocol. The author argues that there is no evidence of a problem, and it would be a waste of time and resources to make such a change. They suggest that if better support for archival nodes is needed, block ranges in addr announcements or a new protocol optimized for serving the chain could be implemented instead. Additionally, they refute the idea that a feature using resources for a legitimate reason should be classified as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The author also criticizes attempts to reclassify any feature as an "attack" without justification, calling it silly.</summary>
