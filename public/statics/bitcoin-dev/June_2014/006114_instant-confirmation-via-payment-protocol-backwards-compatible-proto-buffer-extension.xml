    <summary>The discussion revolves around the difficulty in building a decentralised automated reputation system for instant transactions, which is complex and subtle. The importance of maintaining the decentralization of Bitcoin protocol is emphasized, rather than pushing it towards centralization for a quick solution. Mike Hearn suggests that supporting trusted instant providers in the protocol is easy, but building such a system is hard. He also proposes making the trusted_instant_providers list scalable to avoid danger, which can be achieved by creating a new sub-message to wrap the pki_type, pki_data, and signature fields into one and making it repeated. However, he does not feel strongly about whether the field should be optional or repeated. Ultimately, the decision is left up to Lawrence.</summary>
