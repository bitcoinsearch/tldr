    <summary>In a forum thread on Bitcointalk, an announcement was made regarding a bounty. However, as of January 2014, there is no definite information about the current status of the bounty except for the fact that the multisig address continues to accumulate bitcoins. There has been talk on other mailing lists about potentially paying a portion or all of the bounty to the Dark Wallet team. Gregory Maxwell suggests visiting the Bitcointalk forum thread for more information.</summary>
