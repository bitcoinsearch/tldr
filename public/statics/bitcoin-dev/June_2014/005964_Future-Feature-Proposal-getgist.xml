    <summary>The writer has been using getheaders() in their thick client to quickly grab all the headers before downloading the full blocks since they can grab more at a time. They believe there is a case for a getgist() call, where a gist of segment count 50 could be used to request 50 getblocks() each with a block_locator of one hash from the gist, providing 25,000 block hashes. Currently, the process involves calling getblocks(), then getdata(), then getgist(), and finally multiple calls to getblocks() and getdata(). The writer was considering using names like getcheckpoints() but found them too long. In response, someone suggested that getheaders is typically used by SPV clients rather than full nodes, and that performance issues with current SPV clients do not usually involve getheaders speed. The post was made by Richard Moore, the founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc.</summary>
