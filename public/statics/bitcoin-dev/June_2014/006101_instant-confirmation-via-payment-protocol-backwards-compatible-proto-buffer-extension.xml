    <summary>Andreas Schildbach has posted a question regarding the Transactions message and its use, given that the Payment message already contains a transactions field that can be signed. He also requests a brief description of the entire message flow, including the BIP70 messages. The BIP draft has been updated with an example and corrections, which can be viewed on Github. The discussion around BIP changes includes allowing merchants to offer discounts for instant payments and allowing multiple signatures. Andreas invites others to share their thoughts on these changes.</summary>
