    <summary>In an email conversation from June 24th, 2014, Wladimir questioned the need for a "close binding" to a trusted bitcoin core in light of the fact that SPV wallets with Bloom filtering can operate without the aid of special servers. However, ThomasV clarified that while he agreed with the potential of SPV level security, there are still certain limitations that require the use of trusted Electrum servers. Nevertheless, Thomas emphasized his goal to make these servers as trustless as possible without relying on reputation.</summary>
