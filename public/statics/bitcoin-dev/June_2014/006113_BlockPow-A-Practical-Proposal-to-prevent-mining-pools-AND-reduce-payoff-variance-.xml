    <summary>The issue discussed is related to centralized transaction selection policies and the solution already exists in the form of getblocktemplate. However, the reason why people don't use getblocktemplate to decentralize pools is because implementations like libblkmaker do not support connecting one's own node to miners and choosing their own blocks, even though the protocol allows it. The writer has written a blog post with some ideas for miner decentralization which he hopes will go live on the Foundation blog soon.</summary>
