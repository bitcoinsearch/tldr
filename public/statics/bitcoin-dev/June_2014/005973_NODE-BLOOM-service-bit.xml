    <summary>In a discussion about the use of bloom filters, Adam Back expressed concerns about the privacy tradeoffs involved with prefix filters. He stated that prefix filters have the same privacy issues as stealth addresses since they affect everyone, not just the user. Gregory Maxwell suggested that the use of ECDH addresses for all transactions, as seen in Bytecoin/Monero/Fantom systems, has made prefixes unnecessary. Obelisk's indexing is fast enough that Dark Wallet didn't store transaction information between sessions until recently. Prefix brute-forcing isn't yet implemented, but prefix filters are being implemented for lookups, which gives server operators plausible deniability.</summary>
