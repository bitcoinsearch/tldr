    <summary>In a message dated 6/16/14, Mike Hearn warned against the centralization of transactions if the system were to change to highest-fee-always-wins. He suggested that this move would force all instant transactions to pay GreenAddress and its competitors money, which could lead to negative consequences. However, it is important to note that Replace-by-fee does not necessarily mean the use of green addresses. There are other options for 0 conf transactions in this context, such as "scorched earth". Furthermore, it is important to understand that giving up the non-enforceable first-seen default mining policy does not equate to giving up on the Bitcoin experiment altogether. While some may view it as a significant change, it is ultimately up to the community to decide whether or not to adopt these changes and how they will impact the future of Bitcoin.</summary>
