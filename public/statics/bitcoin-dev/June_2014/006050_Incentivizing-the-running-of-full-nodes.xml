    <summary>There is a concern about the potential perverse incentives that may arise from paying for goods and services with Bitcoin through individual transactions rather than consolidated ones. This is because running a full node may incentivize individuals to pay with the greatest number of individual transactions possible. However, peers have the ability to calculate rewards based on the number of inputs or total kilobytes used, meaning that payment is based on coin age or fees regardless of the number of transactions made. Therefore, it is believed that this concern is not a significant issue in practice.</summary>
