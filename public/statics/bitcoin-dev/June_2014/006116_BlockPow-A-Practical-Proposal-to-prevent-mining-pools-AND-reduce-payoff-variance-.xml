    <summary>The cost of mining invalid blocks is high, and it is unnecessary to do so. If an attack were performed, it would be easy to detect during full validation. To protect oneself from incorrect mining software, one could validate a randomly selected sample of shares, as hardware allows. GBT requires more than hashing the block header because the pool cannot rely on client-provided information. This is not just for withdrawal attacks but also for hidden bugs in different miners. Doing full validation for every submitted share is difficult.</summary>
