    <summary>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and another individual, Todd suggests that brute-force prefix selection is not necessary for privacy purposes in blockchain data. He suggests giving peers multiple prefixes, each corresponding to at least one address in a wallet with some false positive rate. Todd claims to have explained this concept in detail in his previous blockchain data privacy writeup. The other individual expresses surprise at the idea of using super public data in the same way as data used between nodes. The conversation then turns to communication, with Todd suggesting that perhaps he needs to communicate his arguments differently. The other individual expresses confusion about the usefulness of prefix filtering for DH-private outputs, claiming that it complicates the security story and isn't necessary for scanning performance. They also express concern about prior information leaks becoming compromising in retrospect.</summary>
