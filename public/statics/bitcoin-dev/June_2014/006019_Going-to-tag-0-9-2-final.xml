    <summary>During a conversation between Matt Whitlock and Un Ix, Un Ix joked about offering a prize for anyone who could spot any "malicious" strings within the next hour. However, Whitlock noted that the translation process is more concerned with accidental breakage than maliciousness. He explained that one character in the wrong place in a language bundle can cause the application to fail at runtime, which may not be immediately apparent when running in unaffected locales. While this kind of problem may not result in data or money loss, it could prompt users to question the dev team's quality control process and require them to scrap the whole release.</summary>
