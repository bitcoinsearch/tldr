    <summary>On June 7, 2014, Jeff Garzik announced the plan to remove "getwork" in the upcoming release. It was noted that most of the pool servers had already switched to "getblocktemplate" and "submitblock" years ago. These methods provide a more flexible and scalable way to do mining. More information on this can be found on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate. Wladimir did not add any additional comments to this thread.</summary>
