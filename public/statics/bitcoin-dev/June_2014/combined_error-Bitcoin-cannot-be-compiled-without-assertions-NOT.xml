    <summary>Jeff Garzik responds to a previous message about the error "Bitcoin cannot be compiled without assertions." In his response, he suggests that check macros can be useful and likes the kernel's policy of enabling and using lightweight assertions for most users. He also emphasizes that no assertions with side effects should be present in production software. Garzik clarifies that he intentionally left the gcc code alone and only the MSC code is assert fixed. He provides an example from main.cpp CTransaction::UpdateCoins() and explains how he changed every assert() in the bitcoind 086 sources to behave in a certain way. He argues his "fix" is better than the one used in version 0.9.x since it allows release mode code to run better.In addition, Garzik links to a resource on consistency checking and asks whether bitcoin-qt should be compiled in release or debug mode. His email shows his expertise in programming and highlights his efforts to improve the functionality of the Bitcoin software.</summary>
