    <summary>Aaron Voisine, the developer of breadwallet, an open-source SPV wallet, expressed interest in implementing a new feature to discourage fee sniping using nLockTime. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, posted a message on the Bitcoin-development mailing list on June 6th, 2014, seeking comments from other wallet implementors about pulling the feature into the codebase. The proposed change can be found on Github as pull request #2340 in the Bitcoin repository. Additionally, Garzik works as an open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc. Lastly, the email includes a plug for NeoTech's "Graph Databases" book, which is available for free download.</summary>
