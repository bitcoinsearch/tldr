    <summary>The conversation is about bloom filters and their potential vulnerabilities. The concern is that creating multiple bloom filters could give away more information about the addresses in a wallet, allowing others to reduce the identity space. Updating bloom filters also increases the load on the network and can reveal new wallet addresses. To address these issues, it is suggested that nodes define a way to let others know whether or not bloom filters are supported, such as through a NODE_BLOOM service bit. Once this is implemented, DNS seeds can be adjusted to only return seeds with bloom filter support. Overall, it is expected that bloom filters will eventually be replaced in the future.</summary>
