    <summary>In this context, Wladimir has argued that full nodes and wallets have different usage scenarios. Wallets should be online as little as possible, whereas full nodes should be online 24/7 to be useful to the network. The author of the post believes that btcd has done this right. The wallet runs constantly in the background, like a full node daemon. However, the GUI (which is distinct from the wallet) runs as little as possible, indicating that there doesn't need to be a 1:1 relationship between wallets and GUIs. Finally, the post encourages supporting online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and provides a link to learn more about it.</summary>
