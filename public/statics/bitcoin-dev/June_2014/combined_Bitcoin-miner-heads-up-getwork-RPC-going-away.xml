    <summary>On June 7th, 2014, a discussion took place regarding the removal of "getwork" in the next release of Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., announced the plan to remove "getwork" in the upcoming release as most of the pool servers had already switched to "getblocktemplate" and "submitblock" years ago. These methods provide a more flexible and scalable way to do mining. Wladimir clarified that they had switched to "getblocktemplate" and "submitblock," which provides a more flexible and scalable way to do mining. The "getwork" method, which generates work for the Bitcoin network, has been mostly unused on mainnet and other platforms for a while. The reason behind it is that the method cannot match up with the demands of the modern network. Therefore, the next release plans to remove "getwork". It's worth noting that most pool servers have already switched away from "getwork" years ago.More information on "getblocktemplate" can be found on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate. As there were no objections, it was decided to merge the code that removes the getwork RPC from Bitcoin's Github repository. Wladimir did not add any additional comments to this thread.</summary>
