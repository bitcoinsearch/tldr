    <summary>In a discussion on June 24, 2014, Justus Ranvier and Wladimir debated the differences between full nodes and wallets. Wladimir argued that full nodes and wallets have different usage scenarios, with wallets being online as little as possible and full nodes being online 24/7. Justus pointed out that btcd had done this right, with the wallet daemon running constantly in the background like a full node. He also noted that there was no need for a one-to-one relationship between wallets and GUIs. Finally, Justus suggested that the wallet should not be running as much as it currently is.</summary>
