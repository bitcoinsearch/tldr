    <summary>In an email exchange on June 24, 2014, Mike Hearn and Wladimir discussed the concept of a single unified program versus a "bag of parts" made up of specialized tools. While Hearn argued for a unified program that would automatically figure out priorities, Wladimir preferred the idea of specialized tools maintained by experts in each area, allowing for experimentation and competition. Wladimir believed that innovation outside of the strict consensus rules of the blockchain should be possible without bottlenecks or widespread agreement, including P2P message extensions. He suggested that successful experiments could be merged into Bitcoin core, but pre-assembled bags could still be offered for user convenience.</summary>
