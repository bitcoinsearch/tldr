    <summary>The attack involves storing an unconfirmed transaction sent by Bob for a few days, which will not be included in the blockchain due to a lack of fees. Alice can then relay the transaction to the network or mine it directly with her own hashpower after Bob has forgotten about the failed trade. This can result in Alice obtaining the bitcoins without Bob's knowledge or consent. The attack may also work with the Payment Protocol. It is unclear if there is a fix for this problem or if the attack is impossible to execute.</summary>
