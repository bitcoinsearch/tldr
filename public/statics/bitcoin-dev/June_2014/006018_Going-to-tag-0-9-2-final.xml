    <summary>In June 2014, a developer named Un Ix raised a question regarding malicious strings in a programming project. The concern was more about accidental breakage than intentional harm. A single character placed incorrectly in a language bundle could cause runtime failure, potentially leading to a scrapped release and damage to the dev team's reputation. Although not likely to result in data or monetary loss, it remains a significant issue for quality control.</summary>
