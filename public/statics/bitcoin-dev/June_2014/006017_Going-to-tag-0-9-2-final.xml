    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, there was a discussion regarding translation updates. Jeff Garzik suggested that there should be a translation freeze point to prevent any malicious changes made at the last minute in a language where maintainers may not be familiar with all the strings. Wladimir responded by saying that translations follow a very different cycle than the rest of the code and that entering and reviewing them happens inside Transifex. He also mentioned that someone could maliciously change strings but it is a small risk. Despite this, he decided not to do the translation update if it would make everyone happy.</summary>
