    <summary>In an email exchange on June 17, 2014, Peter Todd discussed his implementation of a replace-by-fee feature with Wladimir, one of the lead developers of Bitcoin. Todd used service bit 26 to enable preferential peering for replace-by-fee nodes to find each other easily. However, this was intended as a temporary and experimental usage that could be dropped after wider adoption. Todd suggested reserving bits 24-31 for temporary experiments, which Wladimir agreed to. Service bits are not guaranteed, so occasional collisions can and should be tolerated by applications using experimental service bits.</summary>
