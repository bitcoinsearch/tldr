    <summary>On June 2nd, 2014, Toshi Morita reported an uninitialized memory problem in bitcoind using valgrind. The error message stated that a conditional jump or move in the program depends on uninitialised value(s). The error occurred in CWallet::LoadKeyMetadata function, which is responsible for loading key metadata from the wallet database. The error was traced back to ReadKeyValue and CWalletDB::LoadWallet functions, which are used to read data from the wallet database. This error was caught by the memory error detector, Valgrind-3.8.1 and LibVEX.Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, responded to Toshi's email.</summary>
