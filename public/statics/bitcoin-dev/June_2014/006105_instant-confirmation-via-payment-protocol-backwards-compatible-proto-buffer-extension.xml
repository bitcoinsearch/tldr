    <summary>The discussion is about the scalability of trusted instant providers list in a protocol. The current approach of VISA is based on a hand-created list of accepted instant providers which is not scalable and can be dangerous. Building a decentralized automated reputation system to support it in the protocol is complex and subtle. The field for trusted instant providers can be made "optional" or "repeated", although most implementations would just look at the first item and ignore the rest. However, allowing multiple signatures would lead to a simple upgrade path in case the problem is cracked in the future. The suggestion is up to Lawrence.</summary>
