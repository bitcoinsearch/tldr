    <summary>In a discussion about different types of filters, it was noted that sending different bloom filters to different peers is possible, which negates subsetting as a unique advantage of prefix filters. However, the main advantage of prefix filters appears to be faster lookups if the node calculates a sorted index for each block. Additionally, utilizing prefix filters may also benefit utxo commitment processes. However, implementing such indexing schemes could impose additional costs on nodes. The lack of models that allow for understanding tradeoffs involved in various indexing schemes is also mentioned.</summary>
