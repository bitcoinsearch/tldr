    <summary>In an email thread from June 19, 2014, Gavin Andresen discussed the consensus for how soft-forks should bump version numbers and suggested turning a related Github Gist into an informational BIP. He also addressed concerns about malleability being an orthogonal issue to IsStandard and mentioned that detecting scripts that leave extra items on the stack would be done in a different part of the code than the code addressed by a pull request he implemented. The email was signed with a PGP signature from Peter Todd.</summary>
