    <summary>In this email conversation between two individuals, they discuss the challenges that mining pools face in validating transactions. The author raises concerns about how a pool can be sure that a miner is running up-to-date bitcoind to perform full validation of transactions. Additionally, if every miner takes their own set of transactions, the pool must calculate the merkle root for every submission to check its correctness. Although it is not impossible to do full validation, it is extremely difficult and economically unfeasible for a pool to undertake such an effort. The current pools are already riddled with security and stability bugs despite using a straightforward protocol like Stratum. To protect against incorrect mining software and detect invalid blocks, Mark Friedenbach suggests stochastically validating a randomly selected sample of shares as a solution.</summary>
