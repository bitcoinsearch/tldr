    <summary>In an email discussion on the feasibility of a Bitcoin hardware wallet similar to TREZOR, Daniel Rice questioned how trust could be established with potential customers. The response drew parallels between the problem and that of Certificate Authorities (CA) for SSL certificates. The trust starts out narrowly funnelled and grows outwards as things get outsourced. For this, it would go from one merchant to four to five payment processing engines to dozens of hardware manufacturers and then to hundreds of thousands of devices. The point being made is that while there may be many companies trying to release similar products to TREZOR, only a few will manage to establish themselves as reputable in the eyes of customers.</summary>
