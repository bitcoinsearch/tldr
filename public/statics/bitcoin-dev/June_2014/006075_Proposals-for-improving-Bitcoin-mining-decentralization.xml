    <summary>In 2014, Raúl Martínez proposed a new mining protocol to prevent pools from controlling more than 51% of the hashrate. The protocol would require individual miners to collect transactions on their own instead of relying on the pool to send them. This could be achieved by running a full node or an SPV-like node that asks other nodes for transactions. Once developed and standardized, the community could recommend that all pools use this protocol. Pool owners could still send instructions to miners about how many transactions to include per block and other details about the Coinbase field in the block. However, this would make it impossible for a pool owner to perform certain 51% attacks, such as selfish mining or double spending. The proposal would only be invalid if the pool owner owns all the hardware in the pool, or if the pool clients don't use the new protocol.</summary>
