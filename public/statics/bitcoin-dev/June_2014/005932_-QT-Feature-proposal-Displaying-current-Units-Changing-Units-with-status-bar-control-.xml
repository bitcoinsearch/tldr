    <summary>In an email dated June 2, 2014, Wladimir expressed uncertainty about the potential benefits of a global setting in the status bar. He suggested that such a setting might make it more clear to users that multiple units can be selected. However, he also cautioned that any implementation should ensure that a stray keypress could not accidentally switch the setting, as this could result in serious consequences for the user.</summary>
