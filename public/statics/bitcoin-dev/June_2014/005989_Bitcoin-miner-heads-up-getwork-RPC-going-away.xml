    <summary>The "getwork" method, which generates work for the Bitcoin network, has been mostly unused on mainnet and other platforms for a while. The reason behind it is that the method cannot match up with the demands of the modern network. Therefore, the next release plans to remove "getwork". It's worth noting that most pool servers have already switched away from "getwork" years ago. Jeff Garzik, who is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., shared this information.</summary>
