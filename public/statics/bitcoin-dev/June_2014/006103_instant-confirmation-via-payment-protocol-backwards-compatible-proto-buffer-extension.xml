    <summary>The context is a discussion about the usefulness of allowing multiple signatures for transactions. The speaker expresses skepticism about the value of this feature, as trusting someone not to double spend is a binary issue. They question the practicality of requiring three independent parties to sign off on a transaction, noting that the first signature is obvious but the second and third are unclear. They suggest that using special purpose services to obtain these signatures could be a hassle. Ultimately, the decision to use multiple signatures is left up to the listener.</summary>
