    <summary>In a conversation between Angel Leon and Wladimir, they are discussing the addition of a global setting in the status bar for Bitcoin. Angel shares an attachment and asks for feedback on whether this would be valuable in terms of user experience. Wladimir responds that they already allow specifying a unit in all places where the user can specify a BTC amount, and show the unit in all places where amounts are shown except for tables. He suggests adding a [unit] in the table header and is unsure how much a global setting in the status bar would add. Additionally, he notes that it may make it more apparent to the user that multiple units can be selected. There is also a link to an issue on Github related to adding the [unit] in the table header.</summary>
