    <summary>In an email exchange between Jorge Tim√≥n and Mike Hearn, they discussed separating the wallet code from the full node. The qt-wallet currently does not support SPV operation, so complex work should be done after the wallet is separated. The first version of the separated wallet should be functionally equivalent to today's wallet as a full node wallet. Some steps on the path of bitcoind towards SPV are also useful in general. For example, headers-first allows parallel block download, which would solve a lot of sync issues people are having - a much higher priority than the wallet. Additionally, maintaining extra indices for others doesn't fit into the goal of keeping bitcoind as lean as possible, according to Pieter and Jorge. An 'index node' could be a different animal. While they disagree with regard to issue #4351, they both want to keep or at least make bitcoind as lean as possible. They also noted that some use cases may find it interesting to optionally maintain additional indexes in the core, but that's another discussion. Dependencies were brought up as a matter of software distribution, but they don't make the protocol worth any less.</summary>
