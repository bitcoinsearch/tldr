    <summary>Wladimir, a developer on the Bitcoin Improvement Requests (BIP) repository, has announced that he intends to disable issues on the repository. This decision was made after noticing that people have been filing issues on the GitHub page, which is not how it is supposed to work. BIP authors are not required to monitor the GitHub issues, and it is not a suitable place to discuss issues.Instead, Wladimir suggests that people should use the mailing list or contact the authors directly if they have any remarks or want to discuss something regarding a BIP. After discussing it, one can submit a pull request, or for trivial changes like typos, one can submit a pull immediately. In essence, disabling issues on the repository is meant to ensure that all concerns are properly addressed and that the right channels are used for communication.</summary>
