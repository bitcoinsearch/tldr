    <summary>The task is to create a "grafical interface" for bitcoind on Linux servers. This can be done by creating a command like "bitcoind show" that shows a summary in the Terminal with all the necessary data for node administrators. The interface should be made out of ASCII characters, similar to the "top" command. A tool called bitcoind-ncurses has already been created for this purpose and is available on Github. However, it is still in its initial stages and the creator may need help in developing it into a fully-functional node admin tool.</summary>
