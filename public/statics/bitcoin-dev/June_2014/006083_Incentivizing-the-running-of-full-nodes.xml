    <summary>The proposal suggests a design that ensures the voluntary nature of donations, which would include pay-to-play networks and not just free P2P networks. The idea is to limit the number of entries in the proposed 'decentralizing lottery' to one entry per distinct period of time, for anyone who meets the suggested criteria of running full nodes (Bitcoin Core), processing their change and txouts through Core. Those who donate, no matter how infrequently and no matter who they donate to, will be entered into the 'decentralizing lottery'. The smart property qualities of Bitcoin may eventually enable people to represent what sort of time and energy they are putting into maintaining the network. Already, there are many people who have demonstrated a willingness to donate bandwidth and resources to the public by running nodes. Those who are already dedicated to running nodes will likely remain, but any ideas reaching technical development and reality as a result of this concept would be intended to help grow that base by bringing in persons who might not otherwise be as interested to do so. Mixed-mode nodes could be operated with a fraction of the allowed incoming connections reserved for free peers. Free connections might be limited in terms of time duration. Bitcoin-accepting brick-and-mortars would probably allow free access to anyone connected to their internal wifi to facilitate people wanting to pay. Crowdfunded free bridges, assurance contracts, etc. are all other ways to let people get into the network with no upfront cost.</summary>
