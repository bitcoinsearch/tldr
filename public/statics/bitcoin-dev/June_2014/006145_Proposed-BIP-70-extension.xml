    <summary>Mike Hearn, a developer, suggested to extend BIP 70 by allowing merchants to set discounts for purchasing with Bitcoin, which would be shown as a running total of how much money users have saved by avoiding credit cards and bank payments. This minor BIP 70 extension includes an optional uint64 currency_usage_discount_size field to record the size in satoshis of any discount provided by the merchant only because the user chose to pay using Bitcoin or other similar digital currency. Other kinds of discounts, loyalty bonuses, and so on should not be recorded here, rather they could be mentioned in the memo field. Wallets would then be able to persist this data to disk and compete on cool visualizations for how much money users saved over time. Although PR is currently created by payment processors, it is suggested that signature delegation problem needs to be solved so that the merchant can create the request. It is also suggested to make it more clear what's the reference price for the discount as in Germany, people generally don't use credit cards but rather "EC-Cards," which is already much cheaper. Additionally, some merchants may only provide cash as an alternative payment option, and they would still offer a Bitcoin discount. The feature may get abused; however, wallet authors are willing to give it a try. The name of the field should start with something like "marketing," according to Jeff.</summary>
