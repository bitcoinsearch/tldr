    <summary>In this email conversation, slush expresses skepticism towards a marketing claim that suggests users can "save" satoshis through a payment protocol. They argue that these claims have no statistical or practical meaning, and instead suggest that they be put in the memo field of a transaction. Mike Hearn responds by saying that while the claims may not be provable, users would still be able to easily detect if the numbers don't add up. Ultimately, it seems that the claim is meant to be more for fun than anything else. The email thread takes place within the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
