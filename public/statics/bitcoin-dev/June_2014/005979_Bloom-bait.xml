    <summary>In an email exchange in 2014, Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd discussed the issue of data privacy in blockchain. Todd argued that one could give their peers multiple prefixes to correspond with at least one address in their wallet with some false positive rate. This method would not require brute-force prefix selection. Maxwell was surprised by Todd's suggestion, stating that it was surprising that data published in a super public manner is no different than something used between nodes. Todd explained that he designed the system under the assumption that one was highly likely to connect to an attacker logging data, and his desire was to have a standard that could be implemented with existing cryptographic primitives. Prefix brute-forcing was designed to address bandwidth performance concerns for cases where one is bandwidth limited and does not have a trusted peer to do the scanning for them.</summary>
