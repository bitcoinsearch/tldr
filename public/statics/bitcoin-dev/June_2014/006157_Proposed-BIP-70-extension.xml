    <summary>In a discussion, one person expresses their opinion that it would be silly to specify container formats for random features. Another person disagrees and provides a list of features they imagined adding to the payment protocol in the past. They argue that the protocol is meant to contain features and there is no benefit to limiting it strictly. The goal should be to help users and increase adoption. The person also mentions that Gavin asked them to handle more BIP 70 stuff and suggests using a "living document" version of the payment protocol with all extensions folded into it to simplify programming tasks and avoid field number collisions.</summary>
