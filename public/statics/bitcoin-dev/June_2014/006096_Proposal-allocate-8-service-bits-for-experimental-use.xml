    <summary>In 2011-2012, Jeff Garzik wrote a patch for string-based name extensions which he believes is preferable to unreadable bits. However, it was noted that extensions or UUIDs would not be propagated around the network in "addr" messages as service bits are. Wladimir expressed his concern over propagating all the extensions in `addr` messages and suggested an alternative way to discover nodes that offer a certain extension. He further added that this change moves from being a straightforward and common sense change to a significant change to the protocol.</summary>
