    <summary>The issue with the Bitcoin code for 0.9.x regarding assertions that aren't in 0.8.6 or previous releases has been addressed through a commit and code with all side effects removed from the assertions. The code with unit tests working has also been made available, along with a video series on building Bitcoind.exe and the static libraries in NDEBUG (release) mode. Additionally, there is a video on building an alternate coin-qt.exe in release mode (gcc version) and running it. The problem with assert() having side effects is explained in a book titled "Gotcha #28 Side Effects". It is suggested that everyone who thinks they know what they are doing when they write C++ should read this book. It is also questioned why these sub-standard coding practices were not fixed back in version 0.3.0 in 2010 and continued to be expanded in later releases.</summary>
