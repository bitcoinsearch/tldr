    <summary>A discussion thread is taking place among researchers about trusted providers, instant transactions and risk involved in transactions. The list of trusted providers would be limiting and not scalable. A suggestion was made to automate a process where anyone can become an instant provider, but they will not be trusted at first. As they process more transactions, they build up trust and a risk factor can be calculated based on the past history of the particular instant provider. Andreas Schildbach commented that supports_instant is redundant and trusted_instant_providers are needed, especially sometimes when providers charge fees for instant. Users may not want to pay for instant when the merchant may not accept it or care. It was noted that not all transactions from GreenAddress provide double spend protection, there are additional checks on prevout that are normally not done when spending normally, etc.</summary>
