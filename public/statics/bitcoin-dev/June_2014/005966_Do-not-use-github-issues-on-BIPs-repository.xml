    <summary>Wladimir, a developer on the Bitcoin Improvement Requests (BIP) repository, has announced that he intends to disable issues on the repository. He noticed that people have been filing issues on the GitHub page, which is not how it is supposed to work. BIP authors are not required to monitor the GitHub issues, and it is not a suitable place to discuss issues. Instead, Wladimir suggests that people should use the mailing list or contact the authors directly if they have any remarks or want to discuss something regarding a BIP. After discussing it, one can submit a pull request, or for trivial changes like typos, one can submit a pull immediately.</summary>
