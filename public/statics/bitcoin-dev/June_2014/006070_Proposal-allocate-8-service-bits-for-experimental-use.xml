    <summary>The conversation between Wladimir and Matt Whitlock centered around the use of string-based name space for extensions. Matt suggested using UUIDs because they are fixed length, but Wladimir pointed out that it is useful for these fields to be human-readable for statistics and peer list views. Wladimir also mentioned that when encountering a new, unknown extension, it is much more useful to have a google-able string to find out what it is about, rather than a long hexadecimal or dotted-number identifier. The conversation took place on Github topic #4351.</summary>
