    <summary>The author expresses enthusiasm for the separation of the wallet from Bitcoin's core code, which they believe will result in cleaner and more modular software. However, they are unsure if their assumptions about how this separation will occur are correct. The author believed that the wallet would consume data from a trusted bitcoind core node using RPC or an HTTP REST API. They assumed that the core would handle the hard consensus aspects while the wallet would maintain its own database with private keys, addresses, balances, etc., consuming some data from bitcoind's database. The author also assumed that queries to the UTXO and TXO would be part of the interface between the wallet and core. Now, the author is unsure whether these assumptions are true, and asks if the plan is for the wallet to use p2p directly and maintain its own chain database. They express interest in contributing to the discussion and helping with the separation process.</summary>
