    <summary>Andreas Schildbach, a developer, has commented that the supports_instant field is redundant in a spec. He believes that it can be derived from trusted_instant_providers. Additionally, he suggests that users may not want to pay for instant when the merchant may not accept it, so trusted_instant_providers is necessary. Schildbach also notes that sometimes the providers will charge fees for instant. While the software can ignore the fields, users may still waste fees. It's important to note that not all transactions from GreenAddress provide double spend protection, and there are additional checks on prevout that are normally not done when spending normally.</summary>
