    <summary>The proposed BIP 70 extension would allow wallets to be scanned by merchant bar code readers, thus initiating a payment request flow. This mechanism is necessary for mobile wallets to request a bill and start a payment protocol flow. Current mechanisms for initiating BIP70 payment flows require wallets to either scan a merchant barcode or click on a specially formatted URL link. However, successful non-bitcoin mobile wallet apps allow for the wallet app to be scanned by the merchant. To achieve broad bitcoin adoption, a mechanism for wallets to be scanned by merchant bar code readers at brick and mortar shops is needed. The BillRequest message includes a Unix timestamp when it was created and an optional expiration date after which it should be considered invalid. It also includes a bill_request_uri, which can be a URL where a BIP70 payment request can be sent that is being monitored by the wallet, as well as other URI options like "sms:860-555-1212" or "mailto:asdf at gmail.com." It is recommended that wallet apps display a non-QR barcode like a PDF417 barcode to initiate the Bill Request flow to avoid confusion with existing QR code usage in wallet apps. While NFC technology may obviate the need for this extension, it remains uncommon and may not be suitable for smaller wearables entering the market. The proposed BIP 70 extension would greatly ease checkouts at drive-throughs and allow merchants to leverage existing hardware.</summary>
