    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.2 has been released with the latest version of OpenSSL, which has fixed a recently-discovered security flaw. This new minor release comes with several bug fixes and improvements. The upgrade is recommended as it brings back the compatibility of Linux builds with old distributions like Debian 6+, Tails, Ubuntu 10.04 and CentOS 6.5. The release notes contain important changes such as per-peer block download tracking and stalled download detection, lower paytxfee warning threshold from 0.25 BTC to 0.01 BTC, and fixes for various coin control visual issues. The deterministic build system used for Windows and Linux builds is now available for OSX as well. Users are advised to report possible regressions on Github.</summary>
