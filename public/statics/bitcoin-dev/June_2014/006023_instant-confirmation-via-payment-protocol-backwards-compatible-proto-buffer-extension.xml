    <summary>Lawrence Nahum, the founder of GreenAddress, a BIP32 multisignature service and instant confirmation platform, has reached out to the bitcoin-dev mailing list for feedback on a BIP70 payment protocol proto buffer extension proposal. He introduced himself as having a background in computer science with distributed systems, and having worked most of his career in the City on OTC financial services like confirmation and clearing platforms. Lawrence provided links to GreenAddress's white paper and homepage for those interested in learning more about the company's design. The proposal can be found on their GitHub page.</summary>
