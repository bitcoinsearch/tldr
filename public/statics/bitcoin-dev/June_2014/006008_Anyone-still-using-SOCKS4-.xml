    <summary>In a recent message to the Bitcoin Core mailing list, Wladimir announced that they are planning on removing support for SOCKS4-only proxy in the next major release of Bitcoin Core. This decision was made due to the fact that SOCKS5 was introduced in 1996 and there is hardly an excuse not to support it. The removal of support for SOCKS4-only proxy will remove some outdated code paths and improve privacy as SOCKS5 allows DNS redirection.Wladimir also asked if anyone is currently using a SOCKS4-only proxy with Bitcoin Core. If no one raises any concerns or objections, then the removal of support for SOCKS4-only proxy will proceed as planned. It's important to note that this change will only affect those who are still using SOCKS4-only proxy. Users who are already using SOCKS5 will not be affected by this change.</summary>
