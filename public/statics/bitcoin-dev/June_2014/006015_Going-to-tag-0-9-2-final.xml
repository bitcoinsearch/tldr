    <summary>On June 13, 2014, a discussion took place among Bitcoin developers regarding the potential risks of last-minute changes to language imports. Developer Wladimir suggested that if he did not hear anything, he would proceed with a last-minute language import. However, another developer, xor, expressed concern about making any changes between release candidates and releases in high-risk projects like Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, agreed with the principle that such changes could cause severe havoc and suggested implementing translation freeze points to address this issue. The developers also discussed the possibility of someone maliciously changing strings at the last minute in a language maintainers don't know well, which could pose a small holistic risk to the project.</summary>
