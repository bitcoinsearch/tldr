    <summary>Justus Ranvier suggested that there can be multiple independent transport networks for Bitcoin such as ipv4, ipv6, Tor and native_i2p (out of tree patch). However, Matt Whitlock raised concerns that this proposal may increase the likelihood of a network split. Free-market capitalist nodes may want to charge their peers and kick and ban peers who don't pay up, whereas socialist nodes may want all of their peers to feed them transactions out of goodwill and will thus be relegated to connecting only to other altruistic peers. However, Justus Ranvier argued that as long as multihomed hosts act as bridges, information will propagate across all of them. Many people have already demonstrated a willingness to donate bandwidth and resources to the public by running nodes, so those people aren't going to disappear. They could operate mixed-mode nodes, with a fraction of the allowed incoming connections reserved for free peer, though free connections might be limited in terms of time duration. Bitcoin-accepting brick-and-mortars would probably allow free access to anyone connected to their internal wifi to facilitate people wanting to pay. Additionally, crowdfunded free bridges, assurance contracts, etc are all other ways to let people get into the network with no upfront cost. Justus Ranvier signed off by urging people to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and provided a link to learn how to do so.</summary>
