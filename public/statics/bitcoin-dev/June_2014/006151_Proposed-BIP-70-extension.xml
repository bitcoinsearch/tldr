    <summary>The discussion revolves around the inclusion of a numeric memo field in the payment protocol. Some argue that if one cosmetic field is supported, then all fields should be supported with a generic structured data format. Others believe that the textual memo field is already sufficient and that any unnecessary features should be avoided.
