    <summary>The writer of the email likes the kernel's policy, which is to enable and use lightweight assertions for most users and avoid using assertions with side effects. The writer also suggests that these assertions should always be present in production software, even if they can be compiled out. In response to this, Mike Hearn writes that their codebase no longer uses assertions with side effects, but still requires them to be enabled in production software to catch errors. Jeff Garzik responds by suggesting the use of the glog library's CHECK macros, which print stack traces when they fail and can help make software more robust. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
