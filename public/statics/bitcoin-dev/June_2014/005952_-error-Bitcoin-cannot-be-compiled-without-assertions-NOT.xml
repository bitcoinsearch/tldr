    <summary>The codebase no longer uses assertions with side effects as a matter of procedure. The decision to refuse compilation without assertions enabled was made to prevent additional side-effect having assert from being added. Robust software involves defense in depth to handle errors that may occur. The suggestion was made to remove errors entirely by allowing assertions to have side effects and requiring them to be enabled. The glog library provides CHECK macros that print stack traces when they fail, which could also be useful.</summary>
