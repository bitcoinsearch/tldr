    <summary>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and an undisclosed recipient on June 24, 2014, Andresen stated that it would be unnecessary to add a "generic stuff" field to a container format that already has mechanisms for extensibility. He went on to say that specifying container formats for random features that are not essential would be even more absurd. Examples of such features he mentioned included exchange rates, link sharing, and referral information.</summary>
