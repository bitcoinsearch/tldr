    <summary>Richard Moore, a developer, is concerned about future attacks on the BIP38 wallets and suggests including an extra byte in the address that would encode the parameters used. The scrypt pbkdf currently used is (16384, 8, 8) for (N, r, p), but with the latest scrypt mining ASICs hitting the market, hacking wallets to steal funds may become more profitable. Including an extra byte in the address could help secure more important master keys, such as those in cold storage worth millions of dollars that won't be touched for multiple years.Moore's proposal can be found on bitcointalk.org and is considered more well thought out than BIP38. One idea is to use one byte, c, and a formula of N = 2 ** (c + 11), r = 2 ** c, and p = r. This would provide more space that could be used for other things, such as indicating that the address is adaptive or using "6A" instead of "6p". However, the biggest issue would be backwards compatibility, and the decoded length of the address will change, which could pose issues if bounds checks aren't being done. The proposal is still being revised to support secret sharing.</summary>
