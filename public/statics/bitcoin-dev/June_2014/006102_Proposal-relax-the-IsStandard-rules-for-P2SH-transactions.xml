    <summary>Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist of Bitcoin Foundation, suggests that comments made by Peter Todd should be separate pull requests to avoid bike-shedding and make it easier to review. He also notes that up-version transactions are non-standard due to version check and doesn't believe it is worth adding more code to prevent miners from mining invalid transactions under future-new-rules. Andresen believes that there is a rough consensus regarding the lack of immediate negative feedback on the issue.</summary>
