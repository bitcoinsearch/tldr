    <summary>According to a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Alice cannot intercept a transaction made by Bob and prevent the rest of the network from seeing it. The merchant's server must determine whether or not the transactions satisfy conditions of payment and only then broadcast them on the Bitcoin p2p network. A possible attack scenario was presented where Alice stores an unconfirmed transaction for a few days and relays it to the network later, causing confusion for Bob who may have forgotten about the failed trade. This can work with or without using the Payment Protocol, but there is no known fix or confirmation that this type of attack is even possible.</summary>
