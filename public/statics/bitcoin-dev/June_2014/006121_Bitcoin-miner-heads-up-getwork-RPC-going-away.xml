    <summary>On June 7th, 2014, a discussion took place regarding the removal of "getwork" in the next release of Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik mentioned that most, if not all, pool servers have switched away from "getwork" years ago. Wladimir clarified that they had switched to "getblocktemplate" and "submitblock," which provides a more flexible and scalable way to do mining. This information is explained in the link provided, which details how "getblocktemplate" works. As there were no objections, it was decided to merge the code that removes the getwork RPC from Bitcoin's Github repository.</summary>
