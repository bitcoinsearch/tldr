    <summary>In this email conversation, Jorge Tim√≥n and Wladimir discuss the separation of Bitcoin Core's wallet from its full node status. They plan to have the wallet work as an SPV client by default, allowing users to use it without first setting up a core. This requires part of Bitcoin Core to be turned into libraries or a library. The split is necessary because full nodes and wallets have completely different usage scenarios. Full nodes should be online 24/7 while wallets should be online as little as possible. There are no plans to add Electrum-like functionality to bitcoind since SPV wallets with Bloom filtering can work without special servers. Wallets do not need to keep a full chain database but only their own record of the chain, headers-only, and what concerns the keys in the wallet.</summary>
