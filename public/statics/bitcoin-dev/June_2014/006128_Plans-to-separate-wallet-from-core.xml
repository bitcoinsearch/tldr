    <summary>In a recent discussion, Wladimir shared his views on the use of SPV wallets with Bloom filtering and questioned the need for a close binding to a trusted Bitcoin core. He clarified that he did not think the idea of having servers with a reputation of their own was a passed stage, as there are many things that cannot be done at the SPV level security using just the P2P protocol. However, for basic wallet functionality, it isn't necessary to have a close binding to a trusted Bitcoin core. Wladimir believes that having fewer but more trusted Electrum servers is a reasonable compromise.</summary>
