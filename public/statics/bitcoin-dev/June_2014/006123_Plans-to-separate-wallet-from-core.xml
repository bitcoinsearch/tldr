    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n expressed his support for separating the wallet from Bitcoin's core code to create cleaner and more modular software. However, he was unsure about how this separation would be implemented. He assumed that the wallet would consume data from a trusted bitcoind core node using RPC or an HTTP REST API. The goal of using P2P primarily is to enable users to use the wallet without first setting up a core. Jorge suggested that there could be a mode to use a trusted core by RPC for mempool/conflicted transaction validation. However, Wladimir explained that there are no plans for adding Electrum-like functionality to bitcoind as there is already Electrum. The plan is for the wallet to maintain its own database with private keys, addresses, balances, etc., which will consume some data contained in bitcoind's database. The wallet would not need to keep a full chain database but its own record of the chain, headers-only + what concerns the keys in the wallet. There are plans to use UTXO and TXO queries to obtain historic balances between the wallet and core.</summary>
