    <summary>The issue of centralization in Bitcoin mining has been a long-standing concern for the community. While solutions like Getblocktemplate (GBT) have been proposed, they are not widely adopted. This is partly due to miners' lack of interest in setting it up and running a full node, which requires more work and resources than using a stratum server. However, if miners become more educated about the benefits of controlling block contents, they may start choosing mining pools based on their transaction inclusion policy instead of just profitability. This would create market pressure for pools to adopt GBT and other decentralized solutions. In 2014, the Ghash pool controlled 51% of the hashrate, raising concerns about the potential for a 51% attack. Some argued that it was not harmful, but others called for action to prevent future centralization. The author questions why anyone would consider it not harmful when it clearly poses a risk to the security of the network. Ultimately, the solution lies in educating miners and creating economic incentives for decentralized mining practices.</summary>
