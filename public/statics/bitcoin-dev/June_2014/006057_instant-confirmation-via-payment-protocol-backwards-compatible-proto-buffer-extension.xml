    <summary>Daniel Rice, in an email conversation, discusses the issue of encouraging more instant signature providers and avoiding Visa's monopoly. He suggests that X.509 could be used to make secure hardware devices like TREZOR as instant providers. The hardware would be tamperproof and assert using a secret key embedded in it that the transaction came from a genuine, unflashed TREZOR. This would lead to decentralization and anti-double spending. MintChip is cited as an example of an old solution that worked similarly.</summary>
