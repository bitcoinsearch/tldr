    <summary>In an email conversation, the importance of having explicit standards is discussed. The writer believes that having optional fields with ambiguous meanings is worse than not having them at all. They express the need to keep things simple and generalized in order to prevent buggy and poorly standardized implementations. They suggest that any information not required by machines should only exist in human-oriented fields, such as the memo field. Finally, they urge others to avoid creating overly complicated and edge-case-oriented protocols.</summary>
