    <summary>In a conversation dated June 14, 2014, Un Ix joked about the translation process in Bitcoin's development. Wladimir responded that there is post-processing done on the script to remove stray control characters, but there is no check for number and presence of formatting characters. Wladimir usually checks this manually by looking through diffs, but he mentioned that it would be great if someone added that feature. The script mentioned in the conversation can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/update-translations.py.</summary>
