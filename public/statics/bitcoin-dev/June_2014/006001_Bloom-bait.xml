    <summary>A NODE_BLOOM service bit is a simple and reasonable way to implement bloom filters. Nodes without support for bloom filters use this as default. Bitcoinj is the only large-scale user of filtering, and if a peer advertises support for version lower than 70000, it will disconnect itself. Nodes that advertise support for this version or higher should implement BIP37. It seems like some node authors advertised support for a protocol version they didn't implement, which would be a bug.</summary>
