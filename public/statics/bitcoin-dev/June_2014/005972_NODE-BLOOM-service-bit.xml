    <summary>In an email exchange, Adam Back expressed his concerns regarding the privacy tradeoffs of prefix filters in Bloom filters. He stated that prefix filters pose a similar problem as stealth address proposed use of prefixes, and can have a cumulative effect on privacy for all users. While he supports scalability, efficiency, and decentralization, he believes it should not be at the expense of nuking privacy.However, performance of systems such as Bytecoin, Monero, and Fantom which use ECDH addresses for all transactions suggest that prefixes may not be necessary. Doing the ECDH for each transaction seems reasonable under current system rules.</summary>
