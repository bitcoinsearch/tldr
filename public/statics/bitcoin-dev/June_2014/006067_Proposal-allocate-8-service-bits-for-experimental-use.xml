    <summary>In 2014, there was a discussion among Bitcoin developers about the need for a wider notion of an extension namespace. Peter Todd was not convinced of the short-term need for it, but it was worth considering for the long term. Wladimir J. van der Laan suggested adapting a string-based name space for extensions and adding a command 'getextensions' to query the supported extensions, returning a list of extension strings or (extension,version) pairs. This would not require as much central coordination as the 64 service bits and would give more freedom to alternative implementations to experiment with their own extensions. It would also remove the political aspect of P2P network extensions and eliminate the need for bitcoin core to drive what must be supported with increasing network versions.</summary>
