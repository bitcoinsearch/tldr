    <summary>It has been decided that soft-forks bumping version numbers is the way forward and there is a consensus on this. Gavin Andresen, the Chief Scientist of Bitcoin Foundation, suggests turning a GitHub gist into an informative BIP. The issue of malleability is unrelated but related to IsStandard. Detecting scripts that leave extra items on the stack will be done in a different part of the code than the one addressed by the pull request. There is no need to execute the script twice to figure out if it leaves extra stuff. The idea behind IsStandard is to get a quick yes/no before running a potentially expensive Script execution.</summary>
