    <summary>Mike Hearn and Peter Todd discussed the use of bloom filters in Bitcoin transactions. Mike argued that different bloom filters can be sent to different peers, making subsetting not a unique advantage of prefix filters. However, Peter explained that sending different bloom filters for privacy reasons would cost the network significant disk IO resources because bloom filters have an O(n) cost per query. He further stated that this tradeoff between scalability and privacy gets worse if the Bitcoin blocksize ever increases. Therefore, prefix filters do not require this tradeoff and are a better alternative.</summary>
