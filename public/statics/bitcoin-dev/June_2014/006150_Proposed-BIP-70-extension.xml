    <summary>Jeff Garzik and Mike Hearn discuss the idea of wallets being able to persist data which would allow users to compete on cool visualisations for how much money they saved over time. However, Jeff raises concerns about this idea since it is unprovable and may be subject to instant inflation. He suggests offering automatic cashback instead of discounts, where an optional cashback_to field would be added to the Payment message, allowing the wallet to tally up how much cashback is received without having to trust the merchants. This method is harder to game, according to Jeff.</summary>
