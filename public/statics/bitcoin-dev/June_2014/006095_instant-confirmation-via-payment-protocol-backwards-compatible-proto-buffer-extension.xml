    <summary>In an email conversation dated June 16th, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed his thoughts on the practicality of payment processors like Bitpay and Coinbase dealing with the complexity of real-time anonymous payments. He stated that individual cafes using mobile wallets would not be able to handle this complexity, which could result in the loss of this market or it becoming entirely centralized around a few payment processing companies. However, he also had trouble seeing how the real-time anonymous payments market could be separated from everything else. If trusted third parties become the norm for this market, there will be a significant overlap effect on other markets that Bitcoin can serve best even today. In his opinion, no currency or cash can concede this market.</summary>
