    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list post, Raúl Martínez proposes a protocol that allows miners to collect transactions by themselves and mine them individually, rather than relying on a pool sending the list of transactions to include in a block. This would prevent possible 51% attacks from pool owners. However, as pools are not part of the Bitcoin protocol, it is uncertain how this could be enforced or made widely used, especially since most miners do not care about transaction inclusion themselves and prefer just pointing hash power at a stratum server. While there is already a solution for this, called Getblocktemplate (GBT), it is opt-in, and GHash.io does not support it, preventing widespread adoption. If the mining community can find a way to make GBT more widely used, it could solve most of the pooling-centralization problems.</summary>
