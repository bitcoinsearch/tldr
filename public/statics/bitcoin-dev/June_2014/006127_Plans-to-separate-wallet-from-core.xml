    <summary>The Bitcoin community has been discussing whether or not to split the wallet software from the core code, and Wladimir believes this could be a good move. While he doesn't intend to work on it himself, he thinks it's up to those who want to contribute to do so. However, he does caution that maintaining a competitive wallet in addition to the core consensus code would be an additional burden and there is already plenty of work to do. If the wallet were a separate project, it could have a release cycle separate from the node and likely be faster. The main reason to split off the wallet is to get rid of the responsibility (and code) from the bitcoind repo, as maintaining a wallet should not be part of maintaining the core infrastructure. Deleting it altogether would be unreasonable. Wladimir mentions that he may be biased as the maintainer of primarily a wallet library. He also notes that people are missing a quick and easy way to set up a wallet as a daemon with BitcoinJ, and other upcoming wallet projects like CoinVault are worth noting.</summary>
