    <summary>In an email conversation, Raúl Martínez expressed his doubts if it was possible to carry out an attack on Bitcoin transactions that remain unconfirmed and are eventually purged by nodes due to the lack of fees. Andrew Poelstra replied by saying that reusing inputs is important when resending a transaction and that creating a new transaction without doing so would mean spending twice as much money. Once a signed transaction leaves the system, there is no way to undo it. Even if the transaction has low fees or is nonstandard, any UI which suggests a "cancel" feature that is not based on respending inputs is dangerously broken.</summary>
