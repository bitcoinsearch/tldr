    <summary>Wladimir, a developer working on Bitcoin Core version 0.9.2rc1 and 0.9.2rc2, stated that there have been no new issues with either version. As a result, he plans to tag 0.9.2 final soon. He asked users to report any critical issues they haven't reported yet, so he can address them before the release. If no issues are reported, Wladimir will do a last-minute language import and tag the release at the end of the (UTC) day so that gitian builds can be started. Additionally, any corrections to the release notes should be submitted before the tagging process begins.</summary>
