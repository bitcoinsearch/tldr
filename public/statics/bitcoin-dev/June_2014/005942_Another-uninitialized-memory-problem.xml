    <summary>Toshi Morita reported an uninitialized memory problem in bitcoind using valgrind. Both sides of the comparison were uninitialized, and one side was fixed, but the other side had the same problem. Jeff Garzik believes he has identified the issue. Toshi intends to investigate further once he is out of meetings/meetings prep. The error message from valgrind is provided in the email. Additionally, there is information about a new guide to graph databases called "Graph Databases" that can be downloaded for free. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
