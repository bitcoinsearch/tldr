    <summary>The discussion is about how to encourage a maximum number of instant signature providers and avoid monopoly. The concern is that in the future, multiple companies could release similar products to TREZOR and one company could corner the market if there isn't a standard way to bootstrap trust in signatures. Mike Hearn suggests using X.509 so that secure hardware devices like TREZOR could also be instant providers. The hardware would be tamperproof and assert using a secret key embedded in it that the transaction came from a genuine, unflashed TREZOR. This would decentralize anti-double spending. MintChip is cited as an example of a similar solution.</summary>
