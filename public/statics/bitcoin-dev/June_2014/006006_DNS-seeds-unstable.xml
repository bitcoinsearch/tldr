    <summary>Alex Kotenko has announced that his testnet seed is fully operational and available at testnet-seed.alexykot.me. He has dropped the idea of DNS forwarding and is only serving the testnet seed as it is currently more important than a mainnet one. Andreas Schildbach reported that he was unable to reach Alex's seeds from his ISP.</summary>
