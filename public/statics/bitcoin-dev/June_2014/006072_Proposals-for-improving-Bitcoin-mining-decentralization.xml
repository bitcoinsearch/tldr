    <summary>On 6/17/2014, Raúl Martínez wrote a message expressing surprise about the lack of discussion on the topic of Ghash pool controlling 51% of the hashrate. While some see this as a threat, others do not believe it will cause harm. Regardless, Martinez believes that action needs to be taken to prevent this from happening again. The message was sent via email and included an HTML attachment that was scrubbed.</summary>
