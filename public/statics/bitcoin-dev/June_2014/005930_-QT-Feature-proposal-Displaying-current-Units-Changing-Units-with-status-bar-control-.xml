    <summary>In this email exchange, Angel Leon proposes the idea of a status bar component that would show the current unit of display and allow users to easily change it. The context is around the default unit of display for Bitcoin transactions, with debate over whether it should be BTC or mBTC. The dropdown menu for changing the unit of display would be a common part of the layout, but a slight optimization suggested was to also include the unit in the transaction table header so that users don't have to think about the unit of their values. Leon includes an attachment of how the status bar component would look and asks for feedback before submitting a pull request.</summary>
