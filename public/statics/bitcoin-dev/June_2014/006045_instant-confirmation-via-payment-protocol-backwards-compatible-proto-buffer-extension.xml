    <summary>According to the context, it is possible for double-spends to occur within minutes of each other and relying solely on a monitor is not enough to prevent them. The first seen rule, which is the default in Bitcoin mining, is useful in preventing double-spends. However, if miners decide to change to a highest-fee-always-wins system, it could centralize transactions and force instant transactions to pay GreenAddress and its competitors money. The author expresses hope that this does not happen and that the product remains safe. A link to the famous "snack machine" thread from 2010 is also provided as a reference.</summary>
