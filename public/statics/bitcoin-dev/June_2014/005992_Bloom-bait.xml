    <summary>In an email exchange in 2014, Mike Hearn suggested that creating multiple bloom filters could give away more information than necessary. He proposed creating a single bloom filter that includes all intended addresses and only communicating that. This would prevent people from reducing the identity space by looking at the intersection of multiple filters. Additionally, updating bloom filters to include more addresses could also reveal information about new addresses created. The solution proposed was to intentionally select an extra 20% addresses to include in every bloom filter, but this was considered a "hack". Overall, the suggestion was to use a single, comprehensive bloom filter to maintain privacy.</summary>
