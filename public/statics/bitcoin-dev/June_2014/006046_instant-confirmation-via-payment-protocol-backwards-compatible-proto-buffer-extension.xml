    <summary>The conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown person revolves around the issue of double-spending in Bitcoin transactions. They discuss the need for anti-double-spend providers, and how it differs from credit card companies who are trusted third parties that abuse their position. However, they also note that waiting for a block to be confirmed is not practical for merchants or customers. They suggest that perhaps offering discounts for using no-double-spends proof could incentivize the use of such providers. The conversation ends with a call for further discussion on the topic.</summary>
