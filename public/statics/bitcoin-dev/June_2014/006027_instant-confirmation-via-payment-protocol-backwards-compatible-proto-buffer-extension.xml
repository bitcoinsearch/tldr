    <summary>Andreas Schildbach raises some questions regarding the simplicity and effectiveness of BIP70. He enquires about the use of the Transactions message, which he believes is redundant since the Payment message already contains a transactions field that can be signed. The Transactions message solely exists to facilitate easy signing of all transactions. Andreas also asks for an example of the entire flow of messages including BIP70 messages and promises to provide one soon.Furthermore, Andreas wonders if it is advisable to allow adding multiple signatures from different instant providers or while transitioning to another PKI. He thinks that such non-obvious use cases might complicate the BIP and suggests considering a different scheme of "instantness". Additionally, he expresses his uncertainty about the feasibility of maintaining the BIP's simplicity with such scenarios and whether there's a better and more "future proof" way to handle multiple signatures and revocation of certificates.</summary>
