    <summary>In an email exchange between Matt Whitlock and Wladimir on June 17th, 2014, Wladimir proposed using a string-based name space for extensions. Whitlock questioned this approach, suggesting UUIDs instead because they are fixed length and wouldn't waste as much bandwidth in the protocol. Alternatively, he suggested OIDs if a hierarchical namespace was preferred. However, Whitlock ultimately dismissed the need to overdesign the scheme since it would only be sent over the line at connection time at most once. Wladimir responded by pointing out that UUIDs are longer than most human-recognizable strings and are also unattractive, while OIDs require central and hierarchical coordination.</summary>
