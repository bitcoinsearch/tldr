    <summary>The discussion is about the testing of the translation process in software development. The conversation started with a joke about offering prizes for spotting malicious strings within an hour. However, Matt Whitlock explains that it is more of an issue of accidental breakage than any maliciousness. A single character in the wrong place in a language bundle can cause runtime failure leading to issues like scrapping the whole release which could prompt users to question the quality control process of the dev team. Failure is defined as extra text that pushes a UI element down, making the button the user needs to click no longer visible. This kind of failure cannot be tested except by having a human being run through some example workflows, which presumably happens during the release process.</summary>
