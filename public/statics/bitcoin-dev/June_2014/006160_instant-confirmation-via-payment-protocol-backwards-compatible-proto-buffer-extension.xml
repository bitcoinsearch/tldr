    <summary>On June 18, 2014, Lawrence Nahum proposed changes to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would allow merchants to offer discounts for instant payments and enable multiple signatures. Another user expressed support for the merchant discount idea, suggesting that merchants could receive the amount of the wallet fee for instant payment while maintaining transparency. This system would encourage both merchants and buyers to utilize instant payment without compromising privacy. The proposal was discussed on an email thread with participants including Sebastien Requiem of bendingspoons.com.</summary>
