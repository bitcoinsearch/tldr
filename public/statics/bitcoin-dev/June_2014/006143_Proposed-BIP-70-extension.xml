    <summary>The conversation is about a new feature that claims to show how much money you can "save" by using bitcoin for payments. The user slush believes it's just marketing propaganda, and the feature lacks statistical meaning. He also points out that merchants could mislead customers by cutting them on BTC/USD exchange rates while claiming to offer discounts. Another user concurs with slush, saying that merchants might abuse this feature in the same way Amazon manipulates its sale prices. They suggest that the memo field would be a more appropriate place to provide such data.</summary>
