    <title>Proposal: relax the IsStandard rules for P2SH transactions</title>

    <summary>The proposal is to open up the "IsStandard" transaction rules on the main Bitcoin network as multi-signature and other more complicated transaction forms are now being used. There are two risks to this: the risk of a not-yet-discovered chain-forking bug and the risk of a denial-of-service attack via an expensive-to-store-or-verify transaction. The proposal is to allow any Script containing 15 or fewer signature operations as a pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) Script to be relayed and mined by the reference implementation. P2SH Scripts are currently limited to one of the "standard" transaction forms on the main network, but allowing any P2SH Script would limit unspent transaction output set bloat in two ways. The reference implementation's wallet will still only recognize P2SH transactions that use one of the standard transaction forms. To use a new transaction form will require specialized wallets or specialized applications.</summary>
