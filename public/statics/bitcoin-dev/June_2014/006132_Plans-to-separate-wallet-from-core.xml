    <summary>Tam√°s Blummer, the Founder and CEO of Bitsofproof, proposes three different uses for blockchain technology. The first use is building consensus on the blockchain for which the core is used. The second use is single user wallets where Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) alone is effective. The third use is for services such as exchange and payment processors where core and indexing server talking SPV to core is the best choice. Bitsofproof provides blockchain infrastructure solutions for businesses and organizations.</summary>
