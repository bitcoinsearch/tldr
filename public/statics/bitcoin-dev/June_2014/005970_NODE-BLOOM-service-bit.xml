    <summary>The idea of advertising NODE BLOOM as a service is attractive, but the use of prefix filters raises privacy concerns. While scalability, efficiency, and decentralization are important, they should not come at the expense of privacy. The effects on privacy are cumulative and affect everyone, not just the user. This is similar to the issue of reused addresses, where local decisions can have global effects. Bloom filters have high IO loads, which have led to DoS attacks and are not ideal for nodes that are IO constrained rather than bandwidth constrained. VPS setups could help the network better by serving full blocks.</summary>
