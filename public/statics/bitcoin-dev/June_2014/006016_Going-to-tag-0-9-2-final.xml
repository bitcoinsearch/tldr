    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Wladimir on June 13, 2014, a discussion was had about translation freeze points. The concern raised was that someone could maliciously change the strings at the last minute in a language maintainers don't know well. Wladimir stated that translations follow a different cycle than the rest of the code and are entered and reviewed through Transifex. He also mentioned that if it makes everyone happy, he won't do the translation update. The topic of discussion was considered as bikeshedding and attracted much attention.</summary>
