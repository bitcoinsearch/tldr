    <summary>The latest Bitcoin Core version 0.9.2rc1 is now available for release containing bug fixes and minor improvements. Release candidates are wide-scale testing releases, so non-technical users may want to wait until 0.9.2 final before upgrading and downgrading. The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous releases. Also, the deterministic build system that was already used for Windows and Linux builds is now used for OSX as well. Although the resulting executables have been tested quite a bit, there could be possible regressions. This version of Linux is built against Qt 4.6, and filter the symbols for libstdc++ and glibc. RPC has added `getwalletinfo`, `getblockchaininfo` and `getnetworkinfo` calls which will replace hodge-podge `getinfo`. The command-line options have fixed `-printblocktree` output and show an error message if ReadConfigFile fails. The block-chain handling and storage has added upgrade leveldb to 1.17. The protocol and network code has added per-peer block download tracking and stalled download detection and added new DNS seed from bitnodes.io. The wallet has made GetAvailableCredit run GetHash() only once per transaction, lowered paytxfee warning threshold from 0.25 BTC to 0.01 BTC and has logged BerkeleyDB version at startup. The build system has added OSX build descriptors to gitian and upgraded miniupnpc version to 1.9. Miscellaneous changes have replaced non-threadsafe C functions (gmtime, strerror and setlocale), added missing cs_main and wallet locks, avoided exception at startup when system locale not recognized and changed bitrpc.py's raw_input to getpass for passwords to conceal characters during command line input. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.</summary>
