    <summary>In a discussion related to the use of assert() function in programming, it was suggested that assert() should have no side effects. It was then clarified that all the side effects of assertions have already been removed before version 0.9.0. Despite this, assertion checks are considered important for maintaining proper sanity of the client and network. Hence, building with them enabled is still required according to the opinion expressed by Wladimir.</summary>
