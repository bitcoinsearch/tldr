    <summary>The email conversation between Adam Back and Peter Todd discusses the privacy tradeoffs of using prefix filters as opposed to bloom filters. While prefix filters offer better scalability and efficiency, they also compromise user privacy. However, prefix brute forcing is an engineering tradeoff that can be implemented with existing technology. The conversation concludes by suggesting that if someone can come up with a better solution and write code for it, it would be welcomed. Additionally, stealth addresses have been designed in a way that allows future blockchain filter upgrades to be added in a backwards compatible manner.</summary>
