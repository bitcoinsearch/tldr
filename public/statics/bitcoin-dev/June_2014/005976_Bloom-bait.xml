    <summary>In an email conversation on June 6, 2014, Peter Todd discussed the differences between bloom filters and prefix filters. While both are used for transactions, they differ in scaling - bloom filters have O(n) scaling while prefix filters have O(log n) scaling with slightly higher k. However, without using brute forcing, prefix filters do not provide any additional transactional graph privacy compared to bloom filters. A response to this statement questioned how something that is included in transactions and permanently recorded on the blockchain can be considered "no different" in terms of transactional privacy compared to something shared directly with trusted peers. The implication is that the use of bloom filters or prefix filters alone may not be enough to ensure complete privacy in transactions.</summary>
