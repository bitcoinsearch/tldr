    <summary>The writer believes that both BIP70 and Bluetooth payment mechanisms can coexist. A QR code next to a cash register can be fixed and printed on paper when using BIP70. The PoS would upload payment details to the server, which would then serve it when the user scans the QR code. Alternatively, Andreas' work on Bluetooth may be more appropriate; the QR code can contain the BT MAC of the device, and the payment request is downloaded that way. This approach is already implemented. The writer believes that if a seller can scan a user's phone, the user's phone can scan some rectangle that's physically near the sales counter. The QR code can also be an NFC tag with a little icon in the middle of the QR code to indicate that touching works as well as scanning. The writer has a project in mind, making NFC-QRcode hybrids and a simple PoS app to go with them, but does not have the time to pursue it.</summary>
