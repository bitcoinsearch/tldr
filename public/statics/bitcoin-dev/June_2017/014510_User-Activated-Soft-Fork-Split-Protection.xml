    <summary>The proposed calendar for the SegWit2x agreement is too slow to activate SegWit mandatory signalling ahead of BIP148 using BIP91. James Hilliard has proposed an option that miners can use to prevent a chain split ahead of the Aug 1st BIP148 activation date called Split Protection. This allows for a majority of miners to activate mandatory SegWit signalling and prevent a potential chain split ahead of BIP148 activation. The splitprotection soft fork is essentially BIP91 but using BIP8 instead of BIP9 with a lower activation threshold and immediate mandatory signalling lock-in. This document specifies a coordination mechanism for a simple majority of miners to prevent a chain split ahead of BIP148 activation. Due to time constraints, unless immediately deployed, BIP91 will likely not be able to enforce mandatory signalling of segwit before the Aug 1st activation of BIP148. This BIP provides a method for rapid miner activation of SegWit mandatory signalling ahead of the BIP148 activation date. Since the primary goal of this BIP is to reduce the chance of an extended chain split as much as possible we activate using a simple miner majority of 65% over a 504 block interval rather than a higher percentage. While this BIP is active, all blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1&gt; existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected. This deployment is compatible with the existing "segwit" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016 and midnight November 15th, 2017. This deployment is also compatible with the existing BIP148 deployment. This BIP is compatible with BIP91 only if BIP91 activates before it and before BIP148.</summary>
