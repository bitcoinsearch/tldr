    <title>BIP149 timeout-- why so far in the future?</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Timón proposed that BIP 149 should not activate unless BIP 141 has expired unsuccessfully. This would be implemented by not removing the BIP141 deployment with bip9. If SegWit activates pre-nov15, BIP149 nodes can detect and interpret it just fine. However, if it activates post nov15, a separate service bit in the p2p network will be required for pre-BIP149 to know whether SegWit has activated or not while post-BIP149 nodes would know it has activated. If BIP 149 is released only after nov15, testing compatibility between the two cases will not be necessary.</summary>
