    <summary>Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod have proposed a new light client BIP, which can be found on GitHub. However, there are concerns about non-constant divmod in the inner loop of construction and lookup. This could make implementations slow, even on modern x86_64 processors. A solution has been proposed that has the same non-uniformity as mod but only requires a multiply and shift. If this is not done, fast implementations will need to compute bit twiddling hack exact division code, which is complicated. The golomb parameter and false positive rate may also be wrong in the spec unless all cases where N=transactions are changed to n=indexed-outputs.</summary>
