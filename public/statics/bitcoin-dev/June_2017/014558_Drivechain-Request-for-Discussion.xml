    <summary>Paul Sztorc and Sergio Demian Lerner each designed their own implementations of drivechain. This provided an opportunity for mutual improvements, with one improvement being the use of ACKs in sidechains. These would require zero network bytes to be sent in honest cases. Paul's implementation was optimized for infrequent withdrawal attempts, while Sergio's was optimized for frequent ones. Additionally, Paul integrated 'blind merged mining' into his version as a result of earlier peer review. Sergio proposed a hybrid model where both a federation and miners provide acknowledges of sidechain state, which he believes his drivechain proposal enables better than Paul's. However, Paul disagrees, citing overwhelming support for sidechains among users, businesses, and other developers.In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion, Paul Sztorc and Peter Todd debate the use-cases for drivechains. Todd supports the idea of drivechains, arguing that miners should have as little influence as possible in the consensus. He also sees altcoin-competition as an existential threat to Bitcoin, and believes that permissionless innovation is important for discovering cool ideas. Todd suggests that Core's review process has two opposite problems, being both slow and grueling on one hand, and fraught with the possibility of catastrophic error on the other. Drivechains would allow people to try their own experiments without having to go through the review process.Sztorc asks what use-cases Todd actually sees for drivechains, and whether or not those use-cases could be done in a much safer client-side validation fashion. Todd replies that drivechain is within the category of client-side validation, and that with BMM, validation is only performed by those users who opt-in to the new features. He also requests the Github link for Sztorc's most up-to-date client-side validation work so that they can compare the safety and other features.The discussion ends with Todd posting a link to his article on closed seal sets and truth lists for privacy, and the mailing list information. Ultimately, it is up to users to decide if they are comfortable with semi-trusted methods supplementing miner decisions and potential risks associated with depositing to a sidechain.</summary>
