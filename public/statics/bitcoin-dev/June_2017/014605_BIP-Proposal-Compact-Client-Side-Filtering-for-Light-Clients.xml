    <title>BIP Proposal: Compact Client Side Filtering for Light Clients</title>

    <summary>According to statistics from the Bitcoin Wallet app, there are at least 2 million wallets depending on BIP37. While not all of these wallets require instant notification, daily support inquiries suggest that instant notification is the most requested feature for Bitcoin. However, collected data suggests that there is currently little use of BIP37, based on incoming connections to nodes ending up in DNS seed responses. Andreas Schildbach pointed out that the proposal for a new light client BIP does not provide a filter for unconfirmed transactions like BIP37 does. Therefore, most light clients will continue to use BIP37 even if they may use this new BIP as a supplement, as users would not receive timely notifications of incoming payments otherwise. The proposed new light client BIP can be found on Github.</summary>
