    <summary>In an email exchange between Erik Aronesty and Paul Sztorc, Aronesty proposes the idea of a secure sidechain that issues a mining reward in sidechain tokens, which can be aggregated and redeemed for bitcoins. However, Sztorc expresses concerns regarding the security and economic value of the block in a mining network, stating the correlation between these factors can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where users avoid an insecure network causing txn fees to fall towards zero, erasing the network's security. Sztorc recommends merged mining over Aronesty's proposal. Additionally, Aronesty suggests that a drivechain should not have the same POW as Bitcoin to ensure it does not destabilize the main chain and push more power to miners who already have too much power.</summary>
