    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty asked whether the BIP91 or a -BIP148 option should be merged to core for inclusion in the next release or so. He raised concerns about forcing miners to choose to run non-core code in order to activate a popular feature, as currently miners have to choose between BIP148 and Segwit2x if they want to activate Segwit. In response, a commenter noted that it wouldn't be a huge deal if miners need to run a non-Core node once the BIP91 deployment of Segwit2x happens, as the shift will most likely be temporary. The commenter did agree that the -bip148-option should be merged.</summary>
