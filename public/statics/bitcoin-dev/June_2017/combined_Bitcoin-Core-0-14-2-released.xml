    <summary>Bitcoin Core has released version 0.14.2 which includes multiple updates and bug fixes. The release notes state that the update features an upgrade to miniupnpc to fix an integer signedness error that allows remote attackers within the LAN to cause a denial of service or other impacts. This only affects those who have explicitly enabled UPnP through the GUI setting or through the `-upnp` option, making the new version recommended for users who use this option. Known bugs include the approximate transaction fee displayed on Bitcoin-Qt for those using coin control and smart fee estimation not reflecting any change in the target from the smart fee slider. However, the fee calculated using the correct target is still applied to the transaction and shown in the final send confirmation dialog.The release is compatible with multiple operating systems including macOS 10.8+, Windows Vista and later, and Linux kernel. Although Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on April 8th, 2014, the software can still be installed and run on it at users' own risk, but there are known instabilities and issues. No attempt is made by Bitcoin Core to prevent installation or running on Windows XP, and users are advised not to report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.Contributors to the release include Alex Morcos, Cory Fields, fanquake, Gregory Sanders, Jonas Schnelli, Matt Corallo, Russell Yanofsky, Shigeya Suzuki, and Wladimir J. van der Laan, as well as everyone who assisted with translations on Transifex. Overall, this release brings significant improvements in performance, updated translations, and various bug fixes.</summary>
