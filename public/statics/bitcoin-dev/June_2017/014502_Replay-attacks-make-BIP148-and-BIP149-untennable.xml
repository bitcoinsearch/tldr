    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, replied to Tao Effect's claim that the severity of replay attacks is going unvoiced in the Bitcoin community. Luke stated that replay is a solved problem and that it occurs only when the sender is either negligent or intending it. He then addressed the two coin-splitting techniques given by the proponents of BIP148. Luke disagreed with Tao Effect's claim that double-spending to self with nLockTime txns is complicated and risky. According to him, it is very simple to implement and guaranteed to work eventually. On the issue of mixing with 148 coinbase txns destroying fungibility, Luke questioned what kind of "fungibility" does this FUD claim it destroys? Destroying cross-chain fungibility is the very intent of replay protection and it does not destroy same-chain fungibility any more than any other miner spending. Luke also pointed out that lack of replay protection does not mean there is no coin, and that replay protection is equally a concern for the main (BIP148) chain and any legacy chains malicious miners might choose to split off.</summary>
