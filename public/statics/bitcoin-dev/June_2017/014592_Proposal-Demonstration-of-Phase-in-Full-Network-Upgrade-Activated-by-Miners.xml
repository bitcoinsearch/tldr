    <summary>The conversation between Zheming Lin and Jameson Lopp revolves around the issue of consensus rules and how users can show their opinions. Lin highlights the importance of user enforcement of the system's rules, as described in the Bitcoin white paper, for the security of Bitcoin. He argues that users should have the choice to follow the miners or not when it comes to consensus changes. Lopp clarifies that Bitcoin is not a democracy and that users always have a choice with regard to what consensus rules to enforce and what software to run. However, he also points out that the white paper refers to majority hashpower needing to be honest with regard to determining the correct chain within the context of many possible valid chain forks, not using hashpower to determine the correct chain amongst an infinitely variable number of currently invalid chain forks. The two discuss the concept of a "soft fork" and what changes would qualify as such. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of user choice and enforcement in maintaining the security of Bitcoin.</summary>
