    <summary>In 2015, Ken Shirriff proposed adding the common B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol to Unicode to make it easier for people to use. He wrote a proposal on the matter and asked for endorsement from Bitcoin developers to help convince the Unicode Committee to add the symbol. Danny Thorpe suggested using the B-with-horizontal-bar symbol instead as it is already in the Unicode glyph set and easily accessible on most Unicode enabled devices. However, Ken pointed out that this symbol is not ideal as it can cause confusion with the Thai Baht currency symbol. In June 2017, a working group successfully added the bitcoin symbol to Unicode version 10.0. Theo, who seems to be involved in the process, expressed frustration with reporters making false claims about the situation and urged the team to keep them in check.</summary>
