    <summary>In a conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tao Effect claimed that the severity of replay attacks in Bitcoin is not being fully understood by the community due to their lack of experience with them. However, Gregory Maxwell took issue with this and pointed out that the Bitcoin community had already raised concerns about replay attacks with Ethereum before they occurred. He also accused Tao Effect of insulting the Bitcoin community. In response, Nick Johnson clarified that despite the controversy surrounding the DAO hard fork, the Ethereum ledger was not edited.</summary>
