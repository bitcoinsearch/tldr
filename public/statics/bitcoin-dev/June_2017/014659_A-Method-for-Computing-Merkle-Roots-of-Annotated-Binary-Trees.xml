    <summary>In an email conversation between Russell O'Connor and Peter Todd, O'Connor raised concerns about the security of SHA-256 compression function with chosen initial values in regards to pruned trees. Todd replied thanking O'Connor for bringing up the issue and stated that there is no reason to believe that the compression function will be secure with chosen initial values. In a related link provided, it is mentioned that fixed points can be found for the SHA256 compression function if the attacker can control the IV.</summary>
