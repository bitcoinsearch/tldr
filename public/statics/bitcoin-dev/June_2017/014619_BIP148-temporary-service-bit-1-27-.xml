    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a developer of Bitcoin Knots has recommended that other software implementing the BIP148 should set and use the service bit to avoid network partitioning risks. He also added that this recommendation is aimed to ease the transition to BIP148 and minimize risks in the event miners choose to perform a chain split attack. The temporary service bit will be used until the transition is complete and afterward, it will be manually returned for reuse. Tom Zander, another developer asked about what action can be taken on finding a peer with this bit set or not and requested for the Github commit link where this implementation was done.</summary>
