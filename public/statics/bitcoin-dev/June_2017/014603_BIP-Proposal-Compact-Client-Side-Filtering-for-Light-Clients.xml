    <summary>There has been a debate on whether unconfirmed transactions are necessary, with suggestions made for more private filtering and not filtering them at all. According to collected data, there is little use of BIP37 currently. In a thread on bitcoin-dev, Andreas Schildbach raised a concern that the proposed GCS light client BIP does not provide a filter for unconfirmed transactions unlike BIP37. This means that most light clients will continue to rely on BIP37 even if they use the GCS light client as a supplement. Olaoluwa Osuntokun proposed the new light client BIP in collaboration with Alex Akselrod and it can be found on Roasbeef's GitHub page.</summary>
