    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email, Tao Effect warns that the severity of replay attacks is going unvoiced and is not understood within the Bitcoin community due to lack of experience with them. However, replay has been solved, though it can be improved upon and made simpler. Both coin-splitting techniques proposed by BIP148 are untenable. Double-spending to self with nLockTime transactions is complicated, risky, not guaranteed to work and time-consuming. Mixing with 148 coinbase transactions destroys fungibility. Lack of replay protection does not mean there is no coin; replay protection is equally a concern for the main chain and any legacy chains malicious miners might choose to split off. Miners will be unable to sell their legacycoins at Bitcoin market prices, because whether other transactions are replayed or not, their coins won't be valid on the main chain.</summary>
