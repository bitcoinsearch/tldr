    <summary>In an email thread dated June 1, 2017, Gregory Maxwell expressed concerns over privacy issues with the use of bloom filters. However, he clarified that bloom filters are not inherently bad for privacy as they only reduce the anonymity set. The issue lies in how bip37 uses and abuses the filters. He also mentioned that data for transactions at the tip is only 14kb/s, potentially less if segwit is in use. When someone suggested running it on mobile, Maxwell responded by saying "You're not running that on mobile."</summary>
