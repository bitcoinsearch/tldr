    <summary>The author is looking to set up a self-contained sandboxed network of Bitcoin peer nodes for testing and experimentation. The existing "main" and "test" modes are not feasible as they rely on the publicly shared blockchain state. This leaves the "regtest" mode, but connecting peers together in this mode is currently a manual process. To address this issue, the author has made changes to the "regtest" mode's consensus settings. They have changed the "fPowNoRetargeting" setting to false, which allows for difficulty adjustment in the sandboxed network. Additionally, they have adjusted other settings such as the confirmation window and PoW target spacing to better simulate the real network. The author suggests that these changes make the "regtest" mode behave similarly to the real thing, but within an isolated sandbox network.</summary>
