    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread discussing the Omnibus Proposal, some users expressed concerns that LukeJr's suggested 2MB cap is not compatible with the NY agreement. One user noted that with the current 1MB+SegWit, normal usage results in around 2 or 2.1MB blocks and that increasing the Base Size to 2000000 bytes and Total Weight to 8000000 bytes would result in a linear increase to ~4 or 4.2MB blocks. The user questioned LukeJr's 2MB limit and asked for clarification on the reasoning behind this decision.Another user suggested incorporating a gradual blocksize increase beyond the initial 2MB cap included in Luke-Jr's proposal, similar to BIP103, to satisfy the conditions of the Scaling Agreement while ensuring maximum safety, minimum code discrepancies, and minimum controversy among the community. The purpose of the Omnibus Proposal is to achieve the goals of the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement in the most maximally-compatible way, preventing chain-split risks in the meantime.The proposal locks in automatic hard fork rules once SegWit is activated and sets it to activate six months later, representing compatibility with existing SegWit-activation deployment approaches. The Segwit2x Team has begun work on an implementation of the Consensus Scaling Agreement, and the author calls upon its developers and maintainers to consider and honor the Omnibus Proposal as the guiding approach to their development effort. The author believes that committing to this proposal will ensure unity and prevent costly fractures in the Bitcoin community.</summary>
