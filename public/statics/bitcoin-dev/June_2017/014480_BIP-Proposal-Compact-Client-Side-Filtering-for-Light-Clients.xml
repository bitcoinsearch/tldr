    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Olaoluwa Osuntokun proposed direct support for unconfirmed transactions as an important UX feature for mobile phones. However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that BIP-37 filtering for unconfirmed transactions would be really bad for privacy and that the data for transactions at the tip is only 14kb/s which is not burdensome. Laolu's proposal of streaming more tx data than existing inv messages but less than existing tx messages was found to be cheaper for light clients. A possible solution could be to make a bit field of things to include in every inv-with-metadata message such as witness data, scriptSig data pushes, scriptPubKey, hash of scriptPubKey (unnecessary if full scriptPubKey is sent), scriptPubKey data pushes, to enable a full node to tell what application (or type of application) a light client is running, without revealing the client's addresses or outputs except when the client originates transactions.</summary>
