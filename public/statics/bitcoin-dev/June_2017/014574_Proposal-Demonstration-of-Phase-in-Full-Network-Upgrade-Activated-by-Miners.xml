    <summary>The proposed protocol upgrade will not affect non-mining nodes, as they have enough time to upgrade their software. Versionbits included in block header do not influence the SPY mining. After two grace periods, all nodes must be upgraded, otherwise they cannot send transactions or get any confirmations. However, compared with forming new consensus among nodes, this situation is no worse than before, and the ledger in non-mining wallet nodes is honored and reserved.Users of off-chain wallet services can decide whether or not to follow the service providers after receiving public notification from them. Protocol upgrades in the future can be bonded with node upgrades, and the upgrades activate through miners vote independently. There would be enough time for nodes to be upgraded to support new protocols. Even if there is a failure in miner activation, the situation will not worsen and the status quo will remain. The fluctuation of hashing power will affect the result of the longest chain, so higher activating requirements mean lower risks of temporary forks.Miners could signal falsely to avoid being orphaned, but from the perspective of non-mining wallet nodes, they cannot distinguish between false and true signals. Non-mining wallet nodes should upgrade with the assumption that all signals are true, and miners signalling false signals should follow once all non-mining nodes have upgraded. Non-mining wallet nodes could also false signal without supporting the new protocol, but genuine nodes should follow the proven result provided by miners' votes.Miners and non-mining nodes could conspire to fork using old protocol consensus, but this possibility can't be eliminated, just like in the past. Through most passive non-mining nodes being upgraded, their benefit is reduced. Transactions from non-mining nodes will not be affected and there will be enough time for them to upgrade their wallet software. Future protocol upgrades can be independently activated by binding protocol upgrade codes with the upgraded client version and conducting a separate activation vote. This will reserve enough time for nodes to upgrade their software to support the new protocol, even if the miner vote fails to activate it.</summary>
