    <summary>Miners are reluctant to change any settings unless it is necessary because they do not want to reduce their income by spending time restarting or crashing. Mark Friedenbach commented on the situation in which miners may feel forced to run non-reference software if Bitcoin Core does not support them in preventing a chain split, and he thinks that this could be a one-way street. Hampus Sj√∂berg believes that the shift to running a non-Core node will most likely be temporary and there is no need for concern. Erik Aronesty is questioning whether BIP91 should be merged or a -BIP148 option included in the next release of core so that miners can activate Segwit without running non-core code. The context was taken from a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
