    <summary>In his email, Greg Slepak formally objects to BIP148 and BIP149 based on his experience with the ETH/ETC hard fork. He notes that the situations are very different, as ETC/ETH resulted in two incompatible chains while BIP148 and other soft-forks do not. However, both possibilities face replay attacks. Slepak urges caution and suggests that those uncomfortable sharing information with the NSA should refrain from emailing him sensitive information.</summary>
