    <summary>In this context, the need for filtering of unconfirmed transactions has been debated with regard to SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients. It is noted that users of these clients require such filtering from a usability perspective. However, it is suggested that some users may be willing to trade higher privacy for the lack of an "incoming transaction" feature if client side filtering is used. Additionally, for those who desire 0-conf transactions, all incoming transactions would need to be fetched.</summary>
