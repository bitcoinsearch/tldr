    <summary>On 20 June 2017, bfd--- via bitcoin-dev raised concerns about the privacy leaks in bitcoin protocol on the mailing list. Tom Zander responded by calling the claim that bloom filters are a "total loss of privacy" baseless. However, Jonas Nick gave a presentation on privacy leaks in bitcoin protocol which covered SPV and bloom query problem specifics. The video link for the presentation is provided. Additionally, a research paper titled "On the Privacy Provisions of Bloom Filters in Lightweight Bitcoin Clients" was referenced which shows that existing SPV clients leak considerable information about the addresses of Bitcoin users by relying on Bloom filters. The paper highlights that an SPV client who uses a modest number of Bitcoin addresses can reveal over 60% of his addresses.</summary>
