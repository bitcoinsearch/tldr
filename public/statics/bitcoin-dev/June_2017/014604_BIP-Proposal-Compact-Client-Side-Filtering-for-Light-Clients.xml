    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, the topic of filtering unconfirmed transactions was discussed. It has been debated if it is necessary or not. To address this issue, Tom Zander provided his opinion that it is needed for simple usability point of view. He noted that any SPV client used as a payment-receiver requires unconfirmed transaction filtering to function properly.
