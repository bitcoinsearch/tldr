    <summary>The proposal suggests an idea to activate BIP149-like segwit in November, which is easy to test and deploy before any revisions are made. The UASFs need inevitability rather than time for legacy nodes to upgrade. The courtesy time for soft forks has always been provided to allow legacy nodes to upgrade to full participation. The aim is to provide semi-legacy nodes with immediate participation in a successful segwit activation by deploying it separately for legacy and semi-legacy nodes. This proposal does not include any deployment specifics but leaves it to future proposals. If the idea proves broken or of no benefit during testing, DEPLOYMENT_SEGWIT_ALT1 can be avoided until it expires. Without this proposal, BIP149ish requires debates, tests, and a courtesy timeout, making it slow and difficult to plan for activation. With this proposal, the courtesy begins as soon as it goes live, simplifying the debate on how BIP149ish should deploy, and helps make quick segwit activation possible if BIP141 and BIP148 do not succeed earlier. This intermediate step allows quicker BIP149ish activation, aiming for activating segwit on November 16th. Even if all key nodes don't upgrade, the UASFs merely require inevitability.</summary>
