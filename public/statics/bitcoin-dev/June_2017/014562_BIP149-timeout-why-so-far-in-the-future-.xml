    <summary>The proposal for bip149 assumes that it will only be merged and released after Nov 15, meaning there is not enough time to do it in one day. However, some individuals believe that bip149 should be merged and released immediately while others argue that more testing is required. The concern is that if bip149 is deployed before the activation of segwit pre-Nov 15, then bip149 nodes should use the old service bit for segwit, as opposed to the new one. There has been some work done on modifying shaolinfry's code to account for this scenario, but interest in releasing bip149 before Nov 15 seems low. A query was raised on bitcoin-dev mailing list about whether there would be any problem with activating bip149 on November 16th.</summary>
