    <title>BIP Idea : DDoS resistance via decentrilized	proof-of-work</title>

    <summary>A proposal was made to modify the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm of Bitcoin in order to make the network more secure, decentralized and resistant to DDoS attacks. The proposed mechanism will give a handicap to every miner who includes a mined transaction into the next block, thus increasing the probability of them receiving a block reward. Currently, miners decide which transactions to include in blocks based on the transaction fee, but this solution is vulnerable to DDoS attacks, where an adversary can impair the ability to transfer value for everyone by creating and broadcasting a lot of transactions carrying small value. By modifying the PoW algorithm, it is possible to incentivize all the miners to include high-value transactions in the blockchain, making such attacks non-viable. The proposed idea has been shared as a BIP idea on Linux Foundation's bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
