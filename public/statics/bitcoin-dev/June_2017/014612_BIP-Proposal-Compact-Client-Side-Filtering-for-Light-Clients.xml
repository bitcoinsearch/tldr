    <summary>The writer raises concerns about the lack of attention given to privacy issues in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 37. They argue that developers should prioritize user privacy and that SPV wallets should make users more aware of the potential implications. The writer questions whether users know that their data can be collected by shop-owners, ISPs, and cellular providers, who may link Bitcoin wallet information with credit card data and sell it to data mining companies. They also note that using BIP37 means giving transaction history to everyone. While regular users may not prioritize privacy due to a lack of awareness, the writer suggests that client-side filtering is not yet a suitable replacement for current smartphone SPV models.</summary>
