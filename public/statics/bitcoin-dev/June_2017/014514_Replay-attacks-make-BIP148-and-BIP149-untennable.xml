    <summary>The writer of the email mentioned that they were not sure about the meaning of "render the replay threat moot", to which the recipient replied that without replay protection, the threat of replay attacks is always present and very serious. The email also included a request to not send anything that is uncomfortable to share with the NSA. The writer then responded with their interpretation of the difference between using "post-chainsplit coinbases from the non-148 chain" to taint coins unilaterally in extreme-adversarial cases versus other methods. They argued that this method is more secure as it can be done without action on the 148-chain and the only large-scale reorganization the non-148 chain would face should be a resolution of the chainsplit, thus rendering the replay threat moot.</summary>
