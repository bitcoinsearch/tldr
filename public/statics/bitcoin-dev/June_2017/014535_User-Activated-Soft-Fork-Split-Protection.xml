    <summary>A coordination mechanism has been proposed for miners to prevent a chain split ahead of BIP148 activation. The biggest risk associated with BIP148 is an extended chain split, and hence the new BIP provides a way for a simple majority of miners to eliminate that risk. This BIP provides a way for miners to coordinate activation of the existing segwit deployment with less than 95% hashpower before BIP148 activation. Since the primary goal of this BIP is to reduce the chance of an extended chain split as much as possible, it activates using a simple miner majority of 65% over a 504 block interval rather than a higher percentage.All blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected. The reference implementation of the BIP has also been provided.The proposed splitprotection BIP is designed to activate the existing "segwit" bit 1 deployment while lowering the signaling threshold of a soft fork in a backwards compatible way. By orphaning non-signaling blocks during the BIP9 bit 1 "segwit" deployment, this BIP can cause the existing "segwit" deployment to activate without needing to release a new deployment.The deployment is also compatible with the existing BIP148 deployment, and miners are required to upgrade their nodes to support splitprotection. This BIP uses a BIP8 style timeout to ensure it is compatible with BIP148 and that BIP148 compatible mandatory signaling activates regardless of miner signaling levels.Users who do not upgrade to splitprotection should wait for additional confirmations when accepting payments. The BIP is intended to provide a method for a majority of miners to ensure there is no chain split as we approach BIP148 activation.References for the proposal include mailing list discussions, P2SH flag day activation, BIP9 version bits with timeout and delay, BIP16 Pay to Script Hash, BIP91 Reduced threshold Segwit MASF, BIP141 Segregated Witness (Consensus layer), BIP143 Transaction Signature Verification for Version 0 Witness Program, BIP147 Dealing with dummy stack element malleability, BIP148 Mandatory activation of segwit deployment, BIP149 Segregated Witness (second deployment), and the benefits of segwit.The document is dual licensed as BSD 3-clause and Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal.</summary>
