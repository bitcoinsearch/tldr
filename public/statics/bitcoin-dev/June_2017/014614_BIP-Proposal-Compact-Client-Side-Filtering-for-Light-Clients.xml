    <summary>The issue of privacy losses due to BIP37 has been raised multiple times in the past, with concerns being shared about users' lack of awareness regarding the same. Jonas' comments are agreed upon by the writer of the message. Additionally, the concept of SPV is not relevant to unconfirmed transactions and this fact has been mentioned before but not in the current thread. The assurance of a valid transaction being provided to the user by miners committing to it through work is what SPV relies on. However, mempool transactions have no such guarantee and can be easily forged by anyone, including the user's ISP. The writer does not understand how mempool filtering got into the discussion around BIP37, as it has never made sense to them. The problem with many lite clients using this approach is that it gives users false hope that a valid transaction is yet to be confirmed.</summary>
