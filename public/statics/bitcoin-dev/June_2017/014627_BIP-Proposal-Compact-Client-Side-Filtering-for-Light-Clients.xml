    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer mailing list, Tom Zander argues that calling Bloom filters a "total loss of privacy" is baseless and doesn't need debunking. However, a research paper titled "On the Privacy Provisions of Bloom Filters in Lightweight Bitcoin Clients" shows that relying on Bloom filters within existing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients leaks considerable information about Bitcoin users' addresses. The research results show that an SPV client using a modest number of Bitcoin addresses (e.g., almost all of his addresses) can reveal more than 60% of the remaining addresses used by the same user. The study concludes that Bloom filters provide only weak privacy protection in lightweight Bitcoin clients.</summary>
