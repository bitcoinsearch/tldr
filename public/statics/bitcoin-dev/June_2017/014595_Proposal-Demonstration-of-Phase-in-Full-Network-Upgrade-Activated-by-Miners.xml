    <summary>The discussion between Zheming Lin and Jameson Lopp centers around the concept of users having choice in the Bitcoin community. Lin argues that users should have the choice to follow miners or not, while Lopp explains that users always have a choice with regard to what consensus rules to enforce and what software to run. The conversation also touches on the idea of a "Do nothing" soft fork, which would allow all nodes to upgrade to use tx version 2 and avoid a chain split. Lin asks if Lopp is supportive of this idea and whether adding a valid version 2 would still constitute a soft fork. Lopp explains that if you are only restricting validation rules, it should be a non-breaking change. Overall, the conversation raises questions about how consensus forms in the Bitcoin ecosystem and whether users should have faith in miners when it comes to choosing consensus rules.</summary>
