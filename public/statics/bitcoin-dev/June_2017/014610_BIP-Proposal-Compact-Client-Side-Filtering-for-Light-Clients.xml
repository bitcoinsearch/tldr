    <title>BIP Proposal: Compact Client Side Filtering for Light Clients</title>

    <summary>According to statistics from the Bitcoin Wallet app, there are at least 2 million wallets depending on BIP37. Instant notification is the most requested feature of Bitcoin based on daily support inquiries. However, client-side filtering cannot replace BIP37 as node-operators offer this service for free, though this may change in the future. Additionally, BIP37 consumes a significant amount of resources from nodes and has no direct long-term value for Bitcoin. Relying solely on BIP37 availability appears fragile, and exploring other methods is reasonable.</summary>
