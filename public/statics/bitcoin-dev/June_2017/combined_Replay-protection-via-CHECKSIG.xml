    <summary>A new proposal has been introduced to prevent transaction replay in case of a chain split. The proposed approach involves updating OP_CHECKSIG, MULTISIG and VERIFY variants to allow signatures to specify an additional integer block-height. This would make the signature invalid if used on a chain that does not have that particular block in its history. The proposal adds four bytes to a signature and some extra sha ops when verifying the signature but is considered lightweight and can scale to an arbitrary number of forks without any coordination between chains. It is considered superior to what Johnson Lau proposed in January or BIP 115 from last year. If a signature doesn't specify a block height, the genesis block hash could be used for consistency, which would lock a given signature to "bitcoin," "testnet" or "litecoin," which might be beneficial. The proposal suggests using a relative reference ("-206") instead of a four-byte absolute reference ("473000") to reduce the size of the signature.</summary>
