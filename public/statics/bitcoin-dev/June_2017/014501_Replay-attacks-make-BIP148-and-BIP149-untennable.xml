    <summary>The author of the email denies intending to insult anyone and suggests that there is a recurring criticism of Core that they do not communicate issues outside of their list. They claim that outside of the list it has been all about the 148 coins and almost zero mention of replay attacks. The author asks if there are other feasible ways of addressing replay attacks in Bitcoin/BIP149 scenario. Gregory Maxwell responds to the email stating that the lack of extensive discussion on these issues is symptomatic of engineers not taking BIP148 seriously. He cites network partitioning as a much larger technical issue than replay and mentions that BIP149 has a time-frame that allows for dealing with replay and other issues, potentially avoiding a meaningful fork at all.</summary>
