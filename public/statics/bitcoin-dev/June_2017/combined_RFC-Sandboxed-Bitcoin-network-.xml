    <summary>The author is attempting to create a self-contained sandboxed network of Bitcoin peer nodes for experimentation purposes. The current "main" and "test" modes are not suitable as they rely on the publicly shared blockchain state. The only viable option is the "regtest" mode, but connecting peers in this mode is currently a manual process. To solve this issue, the author has made changes to the "regtest" mode's consensus settings. By changing the "fPowNoRetargeting" setting to false, difficulty adjustment in the sandboxed network becomes possible. The author has also modified other settings such as the confirmation window and PoW target spacing to better simulate the real network. The author believes that these modifications make the "regtest" mode behave similarly to the actual Bitcoin network within an isolated sandbox network. With this setup, testing and experimenting with different scenarios can be done without affecting the real network. This approach provides a safe environment to test new software or potential upgrades before implementing them on the main network. By having a sandbox network, developers can have greater confidence in their code before deploying it to the actual network.</summary>
