    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list, hosted by Linux Foundation, is currently discussing the Drivechain proposal. This proposal enables a hybrid model where both a federation and miners provide acknowledgements of the sidechain state. The proposal has received support from users, businesses and developers and is tailored to enable a specific use case. It allows for a few days delay in the "poll" time, which is sidechain-configurable, but longer times have been suggested.The proposed security model and incentives are similar to those of Bitcoin itself. Miners can abstain from voting or delegate their vote to an aggressive miner. Users are free to ignore sidechains, so it can only benefit them. A tentative project list for drivechains is available on the website.Bitcoin's altcoin market represents an existential threat to Bitcoin as only one form of money can exist per currency area. Another economic model being discussed is BMM (Bitcoin Meta Transactions) which is similar to Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work. The model believes that the highest-bid chain should be the healthiest one. There is a request for a Github link for the most up-to-date client-side validation work to compare the safety and other features. However, the context does not provide any further information about the link request. A link to a website discussing closed seal sets and truth lists for privacy is provided alongside this context.</summary>
