    <summary>Jacob Eliosoff has been analyzing the expected interaction between James Hilliard's BIP91, splitprotection or Segwit2x and the BIP148 UASF. He concludes that it is unlikely that BIP91-type logic can activate segwit in time to avoid a BIP148 chain split, therefore ensuring the BIP148 split is as painless as possible. The deadline of BIP148 is already deployed and thus unlikely to be postponed, which means it starts orphaning non-segwit blocks on midnight (GMT) the morning of August 1. If Segwit activates on adjustment date #5 or later (August), it will be too late to avoid BIP148's split, which will have occurred the moment August began. To avoid the split, &gt;50% of hashpower needs to be BIP91 miners, signaling bit 1 and orphaning non-BIP91 by June 30th.</summary>
