    <summary>In this discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Conner argues that any cryptocurrency's state should only be defined by its ledger. If the system can be altered outside of the rules governing its ledger, then it isn't secure. He believes that an "irregular state change" is equivalent to modifying the underlying ledger and is essentially a bailout, regardless of who makes the changes. Nick Johnson responds by clarifying that the Ethereum ledger was not edited during the DAO hard fork, but rather an "irregular state change" was added at a specific block height. He explains the difference between the ledger and the state and why it's significant that the ledger wasn't modified. Gregory Maxwell takes issue with Tao Effect's statement about the lack of experience in the bitcoin community regarding replay attacks and urges them not to insult the community. Overall, the discussion centers around the security and integrity of cryptocurrencies' ledgers and how they should be defined and maintained.</summary>
