    <summary>A discussion on whether to merge BIP91 or a -BIP148 option to core for inclusion in the next release has been underway. Erik Aronesty is questioning whether it's necessary to force miners to choose to run non-core code in order to activate a popular feature. A large percentage of miners are indifferent, so right now they have to choose between BIP148 and Segwit2x if they want to activate Segwit. Hampus Sj√∂berg thinks that it's not a huge deal if the miners need to run a non-Core node once the BIP91 deployment of Segwit2x happens because the shift will most likely be temporary. However, someone else believes that this could be a one-way street which may cause problems getting miners to proactively upgrade to recent versions of the reference bitcoin daemon. If miners interpret the situation as being forced to run non-reference software in order to prevent a chain split because of a lack of support from Bitcoin Core, they may not go back to running the Core version.</summary>
