    <summary>José Femenías Cañuelo has been working on creating a specification for Bitcoin pointers. These pointers can be used to point to transactions, inputs, outputs or internal items within them. Three proposals have been made, with each building upon the previous one. The first proposal is Canonical Pointers, which looks like "btc at 170.1/179-631-520". The second proposal is Mnemonic Pointers, which uses words from the BIP39 dictionary instead of numbers. For example, "best.ability /biology-exclude-donate" replaces the previous Canonical pointer. Finally, Domain Pointers build on the Domain Name Registration system to encode a pointer to a Canonical Pointer as in "btc at example.com". José Femenías Cañuelo welcomes any feedback from the community as he hasn't had any peer review yet.</summary>
