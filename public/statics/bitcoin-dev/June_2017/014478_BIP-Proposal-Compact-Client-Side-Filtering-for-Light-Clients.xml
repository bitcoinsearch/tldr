    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on 06/01/2017, Olaoluwa Osuntokun raised the issue of direct support for unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) draft. Such a feature could be useful for mobile phones and is an important UX-experience when on-boarding new users to Bitcoin, according to Osuntokun. Another contributor to the thread agreed, suggesting that bip37 filtering be kept optional for unconfirmed transactions, as it is only necessary to filter incoming transactions in this case. They proposed creating one big filter with all wallet addresses to reuse. Bip37 privacy issues mainly arise when trying to match both incoming and outgoing transactions, which is not required in this scenario. However, if a user downloads the block from the same peer that they gave a bip37 filter, the peer could potentially test the transactions in the block against both filters.</summary>
