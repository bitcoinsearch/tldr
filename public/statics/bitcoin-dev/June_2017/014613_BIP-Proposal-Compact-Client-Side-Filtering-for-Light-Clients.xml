    <summary>The discussion revolves around the trade-off between privacy and transaction notification in the context of Bitcoin. The original poster suggests that users may be willing to sacrifice privacy, using client-side filtering, in exchange for not having an "incoming transaction" feature or fetching all received transactions only when they need 0-conf. However, a commenter argues that immediate feedback on transactions being broadcasted is necessary for basic usability, as it allows users to see how much they are being paid and whether the transaction is RBF-able. The commenter also notes that while there are use cases where immediate notification is not necessary, this could be addressed without sacrificing privacy by parsing all transactions and running in the background. Finally, another commenter points out that they would trade higher bandwidth consumption or slower notification time for preserving privacy, citing their experience with receiving bank wire transfers without immediately knowing about them.</summary>
