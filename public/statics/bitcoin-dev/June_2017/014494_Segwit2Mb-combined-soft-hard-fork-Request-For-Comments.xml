    <summary>Bitcoin has seen an increase in its transaction capacity through the implementation of segwit. In August, the cryptocurrency's capacity was raised to 2.1MB with a weight of 4MB. This allowed for more transactions to be processed on the network at once. However, this was just the beginning as Bitcoin's capacity was further increased in December. The capacity was boosted to 4.2MB with a weight of 8MB. This means that even more transactions can now be processed on the network at a faster rate. These improvements have been welcomed by the Bitcoin community and are seen as a step towards making the cryptocurrency more scalable.</summary>
