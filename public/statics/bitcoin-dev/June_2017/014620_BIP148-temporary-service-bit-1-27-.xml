    <summary>In order to prevent a network partition on August 1st, it is crucial that BIP-148 nodes connect with at least two other BIP-148 nodes. The temporary service bit allows these nodes to detect one another and ease the transition to BIP148 while minimizing risks in case miners choose to perform a chain split attack. Bitcoin Knots will be using this service bit, and other software implementing BIP148 are encouraged to do the same. Once the transition is complete, returning the bit for reuse will no longer be necessary. Tom Zander asked about how to act on the finding of a peer with or without the set bit. It is unclear where the implementation can be found, but the discussion was held on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
