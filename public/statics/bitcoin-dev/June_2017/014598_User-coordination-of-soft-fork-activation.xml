    <summary>Martin has shared a proposal on improving UASFs (User Activated Soft Forks) through the use of smart contracts. The proposal aims to incentivize users to enforce the soft fork with lower risk of support being too low, while also ensuring that a significant part of the economy agrees to it. The contract would signal the intent to miners and other users in a way that would be expensive for sybil attackers. Additionally, the proposal suggests a unique way to pay developers for the development of the soft fork code.
