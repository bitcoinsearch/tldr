    <title>BIP Proposal: Compact Client Side Filtering for Light Clients</title>

    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, a new light client BIP has been proposed by Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod. The link to the proposal can be found on GitHub. However, this proposal does not seem to completely replace BIP37 as it lacks a filter for unconfirmed transactions that BIP37 provides. As a result, most light clients will continue to use BIP37 as a supplement to ensure timely notification of incoming payments.</summary>
