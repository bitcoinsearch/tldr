    <summary>Zheming Lin and James Hilliard have been discussing a proposal to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol for non-mining wallet nodes. The proposal is aimed at providing additional incentives to upgrade the protocol for wallet nodes, while ensuring asset security of those nodes. The proposed method involves incorporating any upgrades that affect non-mining nodes, with miners orphaning the minor to ensure all miners upgrade. Nodes must then upgrade in order to work, and the final miner vote over protocol upgrade takes place with all nodes having the same upgraded codes. This will help activate only majority miners signal, and after 51% signalling, all miners will upgrade during the first grace period. Soft forks can be implemented at 55% hash power already without an orphaning period.However, there are concerns about this proposal. One concern is that the proposed activation method for future protocol upgrades involves a two-grace period where non-mining nodes are not affected, followed by a mandatory upgrade for all nodes. This may not be backwards compatible since non-upgraded nodes cannot send transactions or get confirmations. Another concern is the issue of false signalling by miners and non-mining wallet nodes. There is also the possibility of miners and non-mining nodes conspiring to fork using old protocol consensus. Despite these risks, the proposal suggests that miners should vote unbiasedly under the condition that most users are not affected by protocol upgrading. Overall, the proposed implementation method is yet to be determined.</summary>
