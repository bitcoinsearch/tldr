    <summary>The email thread discusses the benefits of soft fork and creating a separate digest chain to verify that peers aren't lying to light clients. Soft fork seems a bit overkill but worth considering, according to the author. The simulations are based on random data within given parameters. However, there is an increase in false positives when using real data sampled from real scriptPubKeys and such. Filters for empty blocks take only a few bytes or sometimes zero when the coinbase output is a burn that doesn't push any data. The author created digests for all blocks up until block #469805 and ended up with 5.8 GB which is 1.1 GB lower than what another author had. Creating digests takes roughly 30 minutes and can be pruned if desired.</summary>
