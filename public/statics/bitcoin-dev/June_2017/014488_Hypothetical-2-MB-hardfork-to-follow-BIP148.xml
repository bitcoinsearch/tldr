    <summary>A proposal has been made to set a maximum block size limit of 1MB, which would be sufficient to solve the issue of quadratic hashing. However, there are arguments for various maximum sizes. The idea was also proposed to initially set the limit to 1MB and then drop it to 500kb or 100kb at a later block height. This would give people with existing systems or pre-signed transactions several years to adjust to the change. There was some concern that changing the rules could invalidate any pre-signed transactions currently out there. James MacWhyte suggests adding a transaction-size limit of, say, 10kb, which would make the quadratic hashing problem a non-issue.</summary>
