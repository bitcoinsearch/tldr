    <summary>In a recent email exchange between Kekcoin and Anthony Towns on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Kekcoin questioned the use of "post-UASF coinbase coins" or 148 coinbases over legacy coinbases for tainting coins. Anthony clarified that using post-chainsplit coinbases from the non-148 chain is more secure in extreme-adversarial cases such as secret-mining reorg attacks. The only large-scale reorganization that the non-148 chain faces should be a resolution of the chainsplit, which renders the replay threat moot. Anthony's response highlights the importance of secure measures to prevent attacks on the Bitcoin network.</summary>
