    <summary>On June 28, 2017, Chris Stewart via bitcoin-dev shared about the BRIBEVERIFY opcode which redefines the existing NOP4 opcode. When executed, if the given critical hash is included at the given vout index in the coinbase transaction, the script evaluates to true. This feature allows sidechains to be merge mined against bitcoin without burdening bitcoin miners with extra resource requirements. However, it was questioned how this would enable any kind of sidechain since there are different kinds of sidechains like Federated peg, SPV/SNARK peg, and Drivechains which are not enabled by this BIP. Additionally, a new block rule is added which requires that the miner's coinbase reward be at index 0 in the coinbase transaction's output vector. It also fixes the witness commitment output to be at index 1 of the coinbase transaction's output vector. Lastly, it was pointed out that placing this document in the public domain is not acceptable for BIPs anymore.</summary>
