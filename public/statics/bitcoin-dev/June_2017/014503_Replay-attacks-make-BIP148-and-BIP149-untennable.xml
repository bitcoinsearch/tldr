    <summary>CoinJoin method is used to improve fungibility and mixing with coinbase transactions. Unlike mixing to coin-split, CoinJoin doesn't create a high demand exclusively for coinbase transactions. However, of the proposed methods, coin-mixing seems a better option as it might be easy for exchanges to obtain 148 coinbase coins and mix their coins with them. This will extend coin-splitting capability beyond just miner coins and then use that to split incoming coins. It is not sure whether exchanges would be willing to do that or not. Another method to split a coin is by sending a transaction with a standard fee which gets confirmed in normal time on the higher hashrate chain, but won't confirm as quickly on the lower hashrate chain. When it's confirmed on one chain, but not on the other, you can then "double-spend" on the lower hashrate chain with a higher fee, to end up with different coins on both chains. However, this method is time-consuming and not guaranteed to work. CPFP can be used by an attacker to get your original txn into the 148 chains.</summary>
