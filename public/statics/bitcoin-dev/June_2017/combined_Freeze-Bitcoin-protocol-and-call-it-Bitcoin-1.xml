    <summary>The proposal is to freeze the Bitcoin protocol as it is now, with no SegWit and no bigger block, creating Bitcoin 1 (BC1). To evolve and scale Bitcoin, a conservative sidechain called Bitcoin 2 (BC2) could be used. BC2 would have no experimental changes and only support the bare minimum to facilitate general two-way sidechains, transaction verification time, and transaction malleability. Miners could choose to mine a BC2 block alongside a BC1 block for free once a BC1 block is found. The economic adoption of BC2 would be independent and voluntary and not require the strong consensus of SegWit. If a simple enough two-way sidechain over BC1 is feasible, that is good. If not, the economic value of BC1 will always be at least that of BC2 but never lower. The two major risks of hampering adoption are fear and technological inertia. Fear may cause only enthusiast adoption initially, and implementing this payment system as any other altcoin may cause technological inertia.It is desirable for the address format in BC2 to be incompatible with BC1, and both chains must be distinguishable. Due to the impending activation of SegWit with a promise to hardfork in three months, the proposal may be too late and will likely go largely ill-received or ignored. However, BC2 may have a lower price than BC1 at first, but since it will have every feature of BC1 plus the possibility of massive scalability and instantaneous transactions with a lightning network built over BC2, it will most likely surpass the value of BC1. Everyone migrating should be fully conscious about the risk of immediate devaluation if they choose to migrate to BC2.</summary>
