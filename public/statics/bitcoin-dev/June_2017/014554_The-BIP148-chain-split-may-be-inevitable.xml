    <summary>The expected interaction between James Hilliard's BIP91, Splitprotection and Segwit2x, which use variants of BIP91 activation, and the BIP148 UASF has been under discussion. It is unlikely that BIP91-type logic can activate segwit in time to avoid a BIP148 chain split, therefore ensuring the BIP148 split is as painless as possible is necessary. BIP148 starts orphaning non-segwit blocks on midnight (GMT) the morning of August 1. Segwit MUST activate by adj #4 (~July 27) to avoid BIP148's split, assuming compatibility with old BIP141 nodes. Therefore, &gt;50% of hashpower needs to be BIP91 miners, signaling bit 1 and orphaning non-BIP91 by adj #2 (June 30). To avoid the BIP148 split, either 95% of hashrate must start signaling bit 1 by June 30 or BIP91 is deployed and &gt;50% of hashrate is activated BIP91 miners by ~June 30. The BIP148 split is inevitable and few parts of the ecosystem are expected to join the fork, so disruption will be bearable.</summary>
