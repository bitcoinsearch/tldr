    <summary>The email conversation discusses the concept of sidechains and their reorganization. The sender is confused about a particular aspect of sidechains and how they can reorganize. The receiver explains that in their scheme, a sidechain cannot reorganize without the mainchain reorganizing. However, they acknowledge that the Ethereum mutability feature may allow for this. The goal of sidechains is to allow for reorgs without affecting the mainchain. The ratchet system would enable sidechain miners to move the sidechain forward or start a split at previous block heights while the mainchain moves forward normally. The ratchet system links the h* data from bribes to sidechain blocks by adding the sidechain block hashes to the ratchet system. A sidechain can request verification of headers downloaded from peers and form the side chain through their local mainchain node.</summary>
