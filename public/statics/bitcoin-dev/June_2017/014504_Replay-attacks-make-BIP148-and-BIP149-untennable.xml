    <summary>The conversation discusses different methods for improving fungibility and mixing with coinbase transactions. CoinJoin is mentioned as a method, but it's noted that it doesn't create a high demand exclusively for coinbase transactions. Instead, coin-mixing appears to be the better option. However, it's unclear if exchanges would be willing to obtain 148 coinbase coins to extend the coin-splitting capability beyond just miner coins. The method of double-spending on the lower hashrate chain with a higher fee is also discussed, but it's considered time-consuming and not guaranteed to work. Additionally, CPFP can be used by an attacker to get the original transaction into the 148 chain. Finally, there is a note about spelling errors and the suggestion to avoid emailing anything that one wouldn't feel comfortable sharing with the NSA.</summary>
