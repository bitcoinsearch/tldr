    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n, a Bitcoin Core developer, proposed the implementation of bip149, which some people have expressed concerns about due to testing requirements. If bip149 is deployed and then the sw gets activated before Nov 15, bip149 nodes would use the old service bit for segwit instead of the new one. A suggestion has been made to prevent the activation of BIP 149 unless BIP 141 expires unsuccessfully to ensure that BIP 149 nodes remain in consensus with BIP 141 nodes indefinitely. Although this may be slightly less convenient for BIP 149 users to upgrade again, it will allow for the deployment of BIP 149 sooner.</summary>
