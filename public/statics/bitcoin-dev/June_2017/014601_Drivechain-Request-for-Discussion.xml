    <summary>The context discusses the use of OP_RETURN and the sidechain ID in relation to drivechains. The author suggests that the sidechain ID is redundant since the fixed set of drivechains can assume what it is. They also propose a way for the sidechain to specifically request LD data relevant only to that sidechain, thus avoiding unnecessary network use. The addition of a version byte is recommended to allow for commitment structure upgrades in the future. The conversation then turns to the topic of OP_BRIBE_VERIFY and block height validation. It is clarified that the mainchain miner does not need to validate the actual block height on the sidechain. The discussion shifts to the commitment structure of the coinbase tx, with the suggestion of having outputs that are ANYONECANSPEND and then have miners spend these outputs to themselves for every block mined. There is some uncertainty about how OP_RETURN outputs work with the UTXO set. Overall, the group agrees that the commitment structure needs improvement.</summary>
