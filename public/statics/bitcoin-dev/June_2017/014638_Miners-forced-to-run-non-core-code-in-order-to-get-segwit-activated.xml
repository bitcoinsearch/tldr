    <summary>In an email sent on June 20, 2017, Hampus Sj√∂berg expressed concerns about the potential for orphaned miners as a result of the Segwit2x, BIP91, and BIP148 updates. Without running a Segwit2x or BIP148 node, miners would not have the new consensus rule of requiring all blocks to signal for segwit, resulting in their potential orphaning. However, all versions of Bitcoin Core since 0.13.1 signal segwit, even when downstream mining software does not support it. The author suggests that a patch against current (0.14.2) software should be created to engage in the BIP91-like orphaning. This is similar to what people have provided for BIP148. However, the lack of specification of the behavior makes it unclear what exactly would need to be implemented to ensure consistency.</summary>
