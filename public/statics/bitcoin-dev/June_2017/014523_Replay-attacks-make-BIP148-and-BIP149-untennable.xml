    <summary>In an email thread between Nick Johnson and Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev, the severity of replay attacks in the Bitcoin community was discussed. Tao Effect via bitcoin-dev had raised concerns about the lack of understanding of these attacks within the Bitcoin community. However, Johnson asked that the community not be insulted as the issues with replay were already pointed out to Ethereum in advance and cited specifically in prior hardfork discussions. Maxwell then responded by accusing Ethereum of editing their ledger for the economic benefit of its centralized administrators, to which Johnson stated that whatever one may think of the DAO hard fork, it is a fact that the Ethereum ledger was not edited. He also requested that misinformation not be spread and that the conversation remain productive.</summary>
