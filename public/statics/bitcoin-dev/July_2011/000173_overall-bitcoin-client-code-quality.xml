    <summary>The idea of starting over from scratch with a better client for Bitcoin is tempting, but Gavin Andresen believes that incremental improvement of the current system is the best course of action. He suggests focusing on making sure different Bitcoin implementations work well together and is working on network-protocol-level testing to achieve this. Gavin has concerns about Michael's suggestion to use lots of threads and mutexes, as it could create deadlocks that are difficult to debug and fix. He proposes switching to asynchronous IO or modifying the CRITICAL_SECTION code to detect and report deadlocks.</summary>
