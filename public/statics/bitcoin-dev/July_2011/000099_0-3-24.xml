    <summary>In an email exchange on July 1st, 2011, Matt Corallo mentioned that bitcoind is prebuilt in the daemon folder on the download archives. However, he was unsure if this was the case for OSX. In response, Douglas Huff confirmed that it was not available on OSX, apologizing for the confusion. The email also included a PGP signature as a digitally signed message part.</summary>
