    <summary>Many active members on the Bitcoin forum are thought to have a significant impact on the direction of the project, causing concern among developers that they are being viewed as political extremists. However, the forum should ideally be used as a means of communicating with actual users, such as soliciting feedback on UI features. While most active contributors on the project ignore the forums, there are many newcomers who still hold this view, creating a negative perception for developers.</summary>
