    <summary>The active members of the bitcoin forums have a major influence on the project's direction, leading people to think that developers want to bring down world governments and unleash a global anarchistic doomsday scenario. The forums should instead be used as a way to communicate with actual users, such as soliciting user feedback on UI features. Jeff Garzik agrees with John Smith and suggests that they de-link or change the forum link on the main www.bitcoin.org home page since the owner of the forums and bitcoin.org is missing in action and hasn't responded to emails for over a week.</summary>
