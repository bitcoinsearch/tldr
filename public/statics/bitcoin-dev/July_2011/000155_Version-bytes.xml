    <summary>On July 8, 2011, Stefan Thomas and JS discussed the possibility of resetting testnet's addresses or using the XOR hack to differentiate between odd (testnet) and even (realnet) network addresses. Stefan suggested using the lsb as a flag instead of the XOR hack in order to maintain compatibility with older addresses, but JS argued that backward compatibility was important for building an image of stability. Ultimately, JS voted in favor of using the XOR hack for the time being.</summary>
