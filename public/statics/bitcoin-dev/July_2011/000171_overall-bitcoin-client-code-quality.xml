    <summary>In a discussion on July 10, 2011, Michael Offel questioned the use of Berkeley db 4 in Bitcoin's official client. It was pointed out that this version is used because it is a good tool for the job and is available in various stable distributions such as Debian, Gentoo, and Ubuntu LTS. Offel also expressed concerns about Boost being a heavy non-standard dependency that could discourage new developers, but it was noted that Boost is now considered standard C++. Offel further suggested a coding style with one file per class, no methods, and single code lines not longer than a screen page, which he believed should be natural to write and would require fewer rules. However, some participants in the discussion disagreed with this style, seeing only an issue with the use of spaces instead of tabs.Regarding the overall state of the codebase, Offel recommended a complete rewrite, taking inspiration from the old code rather than just moving around functional parts. Others confirmed that many rewrites were already in progress, often with better designs. There was also a debate over whether the Bitcoin client should be an official reference project or if it should remain an authorityless project. Finally, participants suggested fixing any issues with the code and submitting changes or forking if necessary.</summary>
