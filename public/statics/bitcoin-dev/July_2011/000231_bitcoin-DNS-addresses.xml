    <summary>In a discussion about the security of DNS resolution for Bitcoin addresses, it was suggested that HTTPS would be a better solution due to its ability to provide different addresses to each client based on IP. The advantages of HTTPS over DNS were acknowledged as being small, but since DNS has no advantages, it was deemed preferable. DNSSEC was also discussed as not being a viable solution as it would require its own DNSSEC-enabled stub resolver. The use of HTTPS has already been implemented and coded, whereas a DNS recursion library with root trust anchors and servers built-in would need to be created.</summary>
