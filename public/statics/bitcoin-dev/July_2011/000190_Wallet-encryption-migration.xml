    <summary>In an attempt to secure-delete an old, unencrypted wallet.dat file, one suggestion is to write over it a couple of times with pseudo-random data. Another suggestion involves marking all keys imported from an unencrypted file as "potentially compromised" and never using them for new addresses. This means avoiding the use of the old keypool for getnewaddress, change, and other related functions. These suggestions aim to improve the security of cryptocurrency wallets and prevent potential hacks or thefts.</summary>
