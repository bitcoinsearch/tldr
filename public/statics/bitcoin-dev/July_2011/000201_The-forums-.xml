    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list in July 2011, John Smith expressed concerns about the perception of Bitcoin and its developers by some users of the Bitcoin forum. Smith argued that newcomers to the cryptocurrency might assume that the most vocal members of the forum had significant influence over the direction of the project, which could make the developers appear as if they were trying to undermine governments and create chaos. Jeff Garzik agreed with Smith's concerns and suggested that the forum should ideally be used as a way for developers to communicate with actual users and solicit feedback on user interface features. However, due to the owner of the forums and bitcoin.org being absent and unresponsive to emails, Garzik proposed de-linking the current forum or killing the forum.bitcoin.org DNS entry altogether. Douglas Huff supported Garzik's suggestion to kill the forum.</summary>
