    <summary>Jan Vornberger provided an update regarding the issue with the "sendfrom" function. He discovered that the function triggers a rebuild of the cache, which couldn't return before the rebuild was complete. He changed the approach slightly, where a complete rebuild of the cache will only happen on new blocks, and on new wallet transactions, the cache will be adjusted incrementally. He checked the cache by running a full calculation every 4000 calls and found no mismatch so far. The changes have been pushed to the Github branch Jan linked to. Jan also mentioned that the cache will not work correctly with the RPC command "move" as he hasn't implemented the necessary adjustments yet.</summary>
