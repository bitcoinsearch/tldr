    <summary>In a discussion thread on July 4, 2011, Matt Corallo proposed renaming wallet.dat for encrypted wallets, which generated both positive and negative feedback. He suggested that this change would have advantages such as improved security, while also causing problems such as breaking backup scripts. However, others pointed out that backup scripts should simply make a copy using the JSON-RPC call.Another suggestion was made to change the format of wallet.dat to something that would trigger an error in older clients, indicating that they should use ewallet.dat instead. This proposal aimed to avoid breaking backup scripts while still allowing for improved security measures. Overall, the discussion addressed various concerns and potential solutions related to securing encrypted wallets.</summary>
