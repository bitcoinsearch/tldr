    <summary>In an email conversation on July 1, 2011, Matt Corallo discussed the preference for a broad-based test of CWallet in version 0.3.24 before the release of crypto and 0.4. While some members such as sipa and gmaxwell favored cherry-pick, Corallo believed that a thorough test of CWallet was necessary to identify potential bugs. However, he also suggested that this should not delay the release process too much since it was just a minor update. Corallo expressed relief that this would be an -rc before full release, which alleviated his concerns. He had already conducted extensive semi-automated testing of cwallet+crypto in both encrypted and non-encrypted states and did not want to redo this for cwallet alone.</summary>
