    <summary>In a discussion about how to encourage more bug-fixing and testing of existing functionality in the Bitcoin project, John Smith suggests creating a list of bugs and offering BTC bounties for fixing each one based on their severity and difficulty. This would incentivize people to get interested in the current source base and work towards closing open bugs before implementing new features. Another suggestion is to offer bounties for finding new security holes and serious bugs, similar to the policies of Mozilla and Chrome projects. Joel adds that perhaps there could be a way for anyone to add to the bounty attached to a bug on the bug tracker, and a listing page for bugs with their bounties would be useful. Overall, the group recognizes the importance of prioritizing bug-fixing and testing in order to improve the stability and security of the Bitcoin platform.</summary>
