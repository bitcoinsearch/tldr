    <summary>Rick Wesson recently joined a list with the goal of producing a patch to sendtoaddress in rpc.cpp that would support DNS lookups. This would allow individuals to publish a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to facilitate sending of coins. However, using URIs is much simpler and can be more useful, as it allows for different addresses and values per user. Additionally, while DNSSec may be available, DNS is still insecure for transmitting something that will result in a money transfer. Using a simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support works better in the end for name-to-address mapping.</summary>
