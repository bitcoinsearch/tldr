    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential release of Bitcoin version 0.3.24 and whether to cherry-pick specific fixes or use the upstream git. There is concern about the testing of pull 358, which was only found the previous night. Matt Corallo suggests a broad-based test of CWallet in 0.3.24 before crypto and 0.4. The disadvantages of cherry-picked branches are throwing away testing on upstream git, zero testing on the new branch, and bug reports for such a release might not apply to other versions. Jeff Garzik explains that the cherry-picked 0.3.24 release wouldn't have to worry about shipping CWallet, which needs a fix or two from pull #358. His preference is current upstream + pull #358, but this will be a community decision.</summary>
