    <summary>In a recent communication, Gavin Andresen has suggested enabling UPnP on Windows/Mac but keeping it off-by-default on Linux. Additionally, he opined that adding another block-chain checkpoint would be a wise decision. In agreement with his suggestions, there has been a bugfix for segfault and DNS seed has been turned on for block send.</summary>
