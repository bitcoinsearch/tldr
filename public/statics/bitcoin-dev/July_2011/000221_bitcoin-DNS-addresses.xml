    <summary>In an email sent on Monday, July 25, 2011 at 11:35:34 PM by Rick Wesson, he proposed a solution to the issue of remembering Bitcoin addresses. He suggested that while it's difficult for people to remember a Bitcoin address, they can easily recall an email address as an identity label. Wesson used the IPv4 address as a metaphor and stated his belief in the security of DNSSEC for transactions.Currently, each Bitcoin transaction requires a unique Bitcoin address which can be difficult to remember. Additionally, DNSSEC, a security protocol for the internet infrastructure, is facing potential illegality in the US. However, Wesson's proposal aims to solve this problem by allowing users to resolve foo at bar.net to a SRV lookup for _bitcoinaddressresolution._tcp.foo.bar.net. This would expect a cert for bar.net, make a HTTPS request for /bitcoinaddressresolution?foo at bar.net, and also send an email to foo at bar.net with keys used for the transaction.</summary>
