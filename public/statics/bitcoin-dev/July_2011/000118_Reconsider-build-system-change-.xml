    <summary>Cmake is compared with autotools, stating that there is no advantage to it over autotools unless the user is unfamiliar with both. It requires a dependency that isn't installed by default anywhere and finding people who are familiar with it and willing to maintain it is more difficult. Autotools is considered better as it follows the standard build procedure of "./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install." Although Cmake can be emulated with a script, the sequence would change to "cmake . &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install". The email ends with a signature from Douglas Huff.</summary>
