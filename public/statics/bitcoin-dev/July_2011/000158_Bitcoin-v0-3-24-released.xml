    <summary>Bitcoin v0.3.24 has been released and is available for download from SourceForge. This release focuses on bug fixes as existing clients were having problems with block downloads and a loss of network connection. The team had hoped to have wallet encryption ready for release, but it will be included in the next version, v0.4. Notable changes in v0.3.24 include default DNS seeding, UPnP enabled by default in the GUI client, initial unit testing framework, and internal wallet code cleanup. For a full changelog, visit the GitHub page. The release also includes PGP signatures for verification.</summary>
