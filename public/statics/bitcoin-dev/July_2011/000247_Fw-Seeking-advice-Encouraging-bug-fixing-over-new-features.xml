    <summary>Amir Taaki tried offering $4000 worth of bounties but received very few responses before it dropped off the page. He concluded that the only way to incentivize bug-fixing over new features is to bring in projects and pay people to work full-time on Bitcoin under an organization. Joel Joonatan Kaartinen suggested adding a way for anyone to add to the bounty attached to a bug on the bug tracker and a listing page for bugs with their bounties. John Smith agreed and suggested a roadmap to plan a few "bug fix only" releases before scheduling the addition of new features, which would also be helpful for people wondering about the project's direction. The biggest problem will be organizational, in getting the BTC together for bounties; only a high profile member such as Gavin will have enough trust to ask for support.</summary>
