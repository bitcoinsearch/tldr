    <summary>The conversation between Matt Corallo and Gavin Andresen on July 27, 2011, discussed the possibility of offering bounties for fixing bugs in Bitcoin. While Andresen expressed concerns about awarding bounties for minor bug fixes, Corallo believed that it could motivate some people to fix bugs, although it may not encourage long-term contributors. He pointed out that sometimes fixing a bug only requires a few hours of debugging and changing a few lines of code. While competition to fix bugs could be good up to a certain level, it is unlikely that many people would want to fix the same bug. Corallo also noted that open-source communities have smart students who are interested in working on high-impact projects. However, Bitcoin is not well-known among developers, so they need some encouragement to get involved. The push does not necessarily have to be bounties, but rather a nice page on bitcoin.org that explains why someone should work on Bitcoin and provides some form of attribution if they manage to fix a bug. A scoreboard with the number of bugs fixed could be a start. The discussion indicates that while bounties may not be the best solution, there are other ways to attract more developers to work on Bitcoin.</summary>
