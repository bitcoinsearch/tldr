    <summary>In this email exchange, Pieter suggests resetting the testnet addresses to differentiate them from realnet ones. Stefan proposes using XOR hack for now, but removing it when they reset the testnet. John agrees that XOR hack is cleaner, but breaking compatibility with older addresses is not a good idea at the moment. He argues that it is important to maintain backward compatibility and build an image of stability. Pieter points out that the 111 hack makes testnet codes visually different from realnet ones, which is probably why it was chosen. However, he also mentions that a modification to nVersion of less than 5 in absolute value can cause the first base58 character to remain equal. Additionally, Pieter notes that +/- 111 is also possible instead of XOR 111.</summary>
