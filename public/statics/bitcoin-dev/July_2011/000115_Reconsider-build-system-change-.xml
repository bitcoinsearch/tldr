    <summary>In a discussion on July 2, 2011, John Smith questioned why the decision was made to use autotools as the future build system instead of cmake. While he didn't have a strong preference either way, he noted that cmake doesn't follow the standard build procedure of "./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install." However, he suggested that it could potentially be emulated with a script.</summary>
