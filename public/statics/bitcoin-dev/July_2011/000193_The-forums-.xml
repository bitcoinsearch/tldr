    <summary>The Bitcoin forums have been a source of annoyance for John Smith, who proposes that the link to them be removed from bitcoin.org and replaced with a forum whose aim is to help users, merchants and developers. He suggests that such a forum should avoid discussions about economic or political futures, philosophical arguments, FUD about exchanges or companies, as well as redundant conversations. Instead, the forum should focus on helping people adopt Bitcoin technology. Matt expresses his agreement but explains that they lack the manpower to moderate such a forum.</summary>
