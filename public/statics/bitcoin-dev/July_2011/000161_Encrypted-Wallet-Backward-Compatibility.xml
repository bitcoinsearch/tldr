    <summary>After some digging, a data structure was found in wallet settings that should cause all versions of Bitcoin to crash on load instead of opening in a bizarre half-state. An empty object was put in addrIncoming, which is not used anywhere else in the code aside from its definition. The commit for this can be found on Github. This solution resolves all known issues and suggestions for newenc, except for invalid mlock calculations which will be fixed. Matt asks if anyone has any remaining suggestions or blockers on newenc and if not, final ACKs can be obtained.</summary>
