    <summary>In a discussion on IRC, several suggestions were made for improving Bitcoin. Multithreading the RPC and implementing Keep-Alive were seen as beneficial to everyone, with no downside to adding them. However, native long polling support was considered unnecessary due to its limited use by pool providers. A fix from Luke Dash Jr. was recommended for merging, as it has been tested and found stable. Hub mode was deemed unnecessary since there are already not enough nodes listening, and opening ports would generate even more connections. Lastly, RPC Turbocharge was seen as necessary, and there is another ASIO pull request on GitHub that may be worth comparing. Overall, the improvements suggested were focused on increasing speed and efficiency, while minimizing unnecessary network usage.</summary>
