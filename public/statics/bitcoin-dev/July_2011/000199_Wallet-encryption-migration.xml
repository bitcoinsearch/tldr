    <summary>In an email conversation between Luke-Jr and Arthur on July 14, 2011, Luke-Jr suggested writing over the old, unencrypted wallet.dat a couple of times with pseudo-random data in an attempt to secure-delete it. However, Arthur responded by stating that writing zeros just once should be sufficient. Arthur provided a link to a tutorial on data sanitization from the University of California, San Diego to support his claim.</summary>
