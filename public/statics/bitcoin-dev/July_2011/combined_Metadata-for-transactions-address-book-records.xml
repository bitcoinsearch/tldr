    <summary>The developer is seeking to add metadata to transactions and address book records for UI purposes. This metadata will be client-side only and not visible on the blockchain. They are considering adding a description field to transactions, which users can fill in after sending or receiving a payment, such as "ordered eggs". For address book records, there is a proposal to include a boolean field indicating if the address should be visible in the interface, useful for hiding old addresses without removing them from lookup purposes.The developer wants an extensible system and is open to adding more metadata in the future, such as accounting categories and links to 3rd party services. They are looking for ideas on where to implement this while minimizing core changes. While it could be implemented within the UI code, the developer prefers to avoid putting database handling there and creating additional data files for users to manage.</summary>
