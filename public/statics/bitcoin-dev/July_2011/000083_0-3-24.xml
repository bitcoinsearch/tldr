    <summary>Matt Corallo, a developer of Bitcoin, suggested a 0.3.24 release due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The idea was to have sipa's flood limit fix implemented in the release. He also recommended enabling DNS seed and possibly UPnP by default. Corallo found the flood disconnects problematic as they contributed to network partitioning. With the flood fix, nodes that had the full blockchain were not disconnected, and there were no more flood disconnects. Syncing a local node with the new code took 34.5 minutes compared to over an hour with the old code. Increasing the nLimit from 500 to 5000 reduced the syncup time by about 1.5 minutes.Corallo has been using DNS seed for some time, and he sees no reason not to turn it on now. He suggested updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24 as difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in there. Regarding UPnP, Matt estimated that there are around 4000 stable listening nodes. Linear extrapolation from the two-day lfnet growth showed that they would run out of sockets in a little more than a month. Therefore, getting more listening nodes is somewhat urgent.</summary>
