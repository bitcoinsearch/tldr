    <summary>On July 10th, 2011, Matt Corallo dug a bit deeper into wallet settings, with Luke's suggestion, to find a data structure that would cause all versions of Bitcoin since it was in Github to crash on load instead of creating an empty wallet or opening in a half-state. Corallo added an empty object in addrIncoming, which is not used anywhere in the code aside from its definition. This solution resolved all known issues and suggestions on newenc except for the invalid mlock calculations, which Corallo planned to address promptly. Despite the mostly incomprehensible/unrelated error, this solution ensures the user is not left wondering where their wallet went by failing soon and avoiding corrupt wallets. Pieter gave an ACK on newenc, thanking Corallo for the work already put in.</summary>
