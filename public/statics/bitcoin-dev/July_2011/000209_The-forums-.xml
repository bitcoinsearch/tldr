    <summary>In a discussion that took place on July 17, 2011, John Smith suggested that the development project of Bitcoin should move to a new URL. However, he was met with resistance as renaming the project could result in loss of recognition and confusion for users who have associated "Bitcoin" with the network. The conversation also clarified that the "Satoshi Client" did not have a formal name yet and it was important to distinguish between the implementation and the network itself.</summary>
