    <summary>On June 30, 2011, Jeff Garzik shared a link to a new version of Bitcoin called "bitcoin-3diff.txt" that had HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support among other features useful to big pools. Later, a new version, "bitcoin-4diff.txt," was also shared. Garzik extracted and created git branches for each logical part of the "3diff" version, including hub_mode, threaded_rpc, signal_blk_notify, bugfix_CreateThread_leak, and getwork_dedupe. He also considered several other branches as valid candidates for merging, such as coinbaser, gitignore, minfee_modes, eligius_relay, eligius_sendfee, txinfo, and bitcoinuri, all available from git://gitorious.org/~Luke-Jr/bitcoin/luke-jr-bitcoin.git.</summary>
