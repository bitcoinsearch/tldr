    <summary>The writer expresses concerns about code quality in Bitcoin and suggests a plan for cleanup. The lack of code documentation, poor use of threads, hardcoded values, and long build times are among the issues highlighted. The writer also points out that module isolation is necessary to make it easier to understand parts of the code. They suggest that a complete rewrite of the code would be needed, inspired by the old code but with better documentation and cleaner implementation. The official Bitcoin client should be a reference project for other clients, so it must be extra clean and well documented. The writer emphasizes that they are not blaming anyone for the current state of the code and are willing to spend time on the project.</summary>
