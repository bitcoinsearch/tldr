    <summary>Alan Grimes expressed his desire to implement his own version of the peer and wallet boxes in a Bitcoin diagram because he considered the existing code as unreliable, poorly written, and almost completely uncommented. In response, a member of the Bitcoin community stated that many individuals were writing or planning to write their own client from scratch, and that Bitcoin's code could be segmented into necessary pieces with comments being added progressively. The member advised against creating new client libraries and encouraged Grimes to search for an existing one to assist with or to aid in the development of the original client.</summary>
