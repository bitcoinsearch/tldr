    <summary>In an email conversation dated July 4, 2011, Gavin Andresen discussed the priority level of certain pulls for version 0.3.24. He stated that he did not believe these pulls were necessary, and fixing the downgrade-to-0.3.24 was low on the list. This is because downgrading to something before version 0.3.24 is just as likely and has a reasonable solution. The conversation ended with an attachment of a digitally signed message part. No further information was provided.</summary>
