    <summary>In an email exchange, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen suggested adding a way for anyone to contribute to the bounty attached to a bug on the Github bug tracker. He also suggested creating a page listing bugs with their bounties. The suggestion was well received, but there are concerns about organizing the BTC together for bounties. It was noted that only a high profile member like Gavin will have enough trust to ask for support. Additionally, publishing a roadmap and planning "bug fix only" releases before scheduling new feature additions may help people understand the direction of the project.</summary>
