    <summary>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin forum, Mike Hearn suggested that appearing deep in the blockchain should be considered as proof of validity. This trust is essential for Lightweight/SPV clients and cannot be achieved any other way. He shared an article from the Bitcoinj wiki that supported his argument. However, another member of the forum pointed out that it could be done another way with a protocol change. The link shared by the member leads to a discussion on how a protocol change could help address the issue of trusting the blockchain for Lightweight/SPV clients.</summary>
