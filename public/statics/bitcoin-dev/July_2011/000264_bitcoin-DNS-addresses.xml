    <summary>On a forum thread dated Sat, 2011-07-30, Rick Wesson asked if anyone had offered to write an HTTPS address resolver for bitcoind. However, someone replied that it had already been written twice. The thread ends with an attachment named "signature.asc," which is a digitally signed message part.</summary>
