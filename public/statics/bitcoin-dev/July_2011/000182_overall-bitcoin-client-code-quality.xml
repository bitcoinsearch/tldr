    <summary>BitCoinJ has a useful NetworkParameters abstraction that groups constants together. This approach was implemented primarily to make unit testing easier, as it allows for the creation of small chains and other structures with minimal difficulty. The NetworkParameters abstraction also facilitates the building of test chains of any length desired. It's likely that a similar abstraction will be implemented in the Satoshi client as the test suite expands.</summary>
