    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mike Hearn shares his thoughts on how to prevent the project from failing. He suggests that anyone who touches a piece of code should introduce unit tests, and patches won't be accepted without some new tests. Seeding the test suite with simple tests for each part can make it easier for people to add more, as people usually don't want to write tests if there's nothing there already. Building up testing infrastructure and planting those seeds will make it easier for others to flesh it out. A manually written test plan is a good start to avoid gigantic breakages like the wallet encryption bug. Big test suites take a long time to grow, especially in codebases developed without them, so insisting that a patch be signed off as passing the test plan is a good way to slow down development but avoid major bugs.</summary>
