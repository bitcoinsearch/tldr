    <summary>In a 2011 email exchange, Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn and Dr. Andy Parkins discussed the possibility of allowing lightweight clients to calculate balances for specific addresses without requiring the entire blockchain. Hearn argued that it was impossible to prove that a transaction was not a double spend without an index of all transactions, but Parkins clarified that he was only interested in calculating balances for certain addresses and would be willing to trust a full node to return whatever block it thinks contains a particular transaction. Hearn suggested implementing filtering to match against transactions and only relay those, which would allow clients to learn about new transactions without needing to download the entire memory pool.</summary>
