    <summary>The author of the email suggests two changes to the Bitcoin protocol that would improve the functionality of lightweight clients. The first change involves allowing the getblocks message to accept inventory items of type MSG_TX as well as MSG_BLOCK. This would allow a lightweight client to request only the block that contains a specific transaction, rather than having to download the entire blockchain. The second change involves the creation of a special virtual block request using an all-zero hash. This virtual block would list all current pending transactions and could be used by a lightweight client to check if a transaction sending coins to one of their addresses is pending. The author believes these changes would give any client many of the facilities available in blockexplorer.com and bitcoincharts.com.</summary>
