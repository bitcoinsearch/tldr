    <summary>After reading the pull/417, it has been noticed that generation transactions appear twice in the listtransaction output. The first item has an account of "" and category "generate"/"imature"/"orphan", while the second has the account associated with the destination address and category "received". Both items have the same txid. The author wonders if this is intended behavior or if the second item should be removed. Additionally, the author questions why account "" is enforced in the first item.For coinbase transactions, one "generated" item may be listed per txout that corresponds to an owned address. Accounts would be associated accordingly, in the same way as for usual "received" amounts. Account balances would also take into account these generated amounts in the obvious way. This change would not only simplify the code but also make few people happy who rely on specific details.Furthermore, the author notes that {list,get}receivedby{address,account} commands do not list or take into account generation transactions, despite the help message suggesting otherwise. As a user, the author would assume that generated transactions are included in these listings/amounts. It is not clear whether all of this is related to issues encountered by E-wallet providers.</summary>
