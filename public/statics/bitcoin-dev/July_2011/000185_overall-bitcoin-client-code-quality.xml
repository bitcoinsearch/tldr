    <summary>In an online discussion on July 13, 2011, Luke-Jr questioned the value of the TCoinsElement MAX_MONEY in bitcoin's source code. Another user, Andy Parkins, had declared this value without providing any explanation. Luke-Jr argued that the value of 21,000,000 was arbitrary, based on the fact that it was the result of a calculation. However, Andy Parkins defended the value and suggested that Luke-Jr might have misunderstood its purpose. The value of MAX_MONEY is a constant in bitcoin's main.h file, set at 21000000 * COIN.</summary>
