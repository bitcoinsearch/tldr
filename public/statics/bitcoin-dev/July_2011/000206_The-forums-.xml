    <summary>In a forum discussion on Sun, 2011-07-17, Robert McKay suggested that the development project should move to a new URL. This was in response to a suggestion made by Douglas Huff to kill the forum.bitcoin.org DNS entry. Jeff Garzik hoped that Sirius would handle moving forum.bitcoin.org to forum.bitcointalk.org but he was the only one with keys to bitcoin.org DNS. The issue with the forums was not that people disliked them or having them, but rather that they were giving Bitcoin a bad name by containing illegal content that could create legal risk in the future. Thus, it was best to mark the forums as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper. Matt added his opinion to the discussion.</summary>
