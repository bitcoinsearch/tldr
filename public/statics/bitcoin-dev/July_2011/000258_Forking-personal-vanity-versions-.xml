    <summary>In a forum discussion about the number of vanity versions of Bitcoin, Alan Grimes responded with a brief message that said "'nuff said." Another participant in the discussion expressed frustration with this type of communication, stating that it doesn't contribute anything useful and is part of the reason why people are no longer using forums. They suggested that such messages should be kept to oneself.</summary>
