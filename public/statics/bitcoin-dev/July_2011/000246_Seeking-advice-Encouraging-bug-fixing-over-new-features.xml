    <summary>In an email conversation between several members involved in the development of Bitcoin, Gavin Andresen expressed concerns with the idea of awarding bounties to fix bugs. While he acknowledged that it might motivate some people to fix a bug or two, he believed it would not encourage long-term contributors and could result in hastily patched together fixes. The group also discussed the idea of creating bug-fix-only-releases and branching for releases. Although not everyone was on board with the idea of branching, it was suggested that they start with version 0.4 and branch for bugfixes to an 0.4 branch, then add new features to a head branch to be eventually called 0.5. Finally, Gavin Andresen announced that he had arranged to get paid to work on Bitcoin full-time before leaving for Australia.</summary>
