    <summary>On July 4, 2011, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik discussed the need to agree on either https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/378 or https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/381. However, Andresen did not believe that either pull was necessary for version 0.3.24, as fixing the downgrade-to-0.3.24 issue was low on the priority list. Garzik agreed with this assessment, stating that he had only pulled https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/379 "Do not use comma as thousands separator" and had pulled a block-chain lock-in at block 13444. They tagged -tip as -rc2 and hoped to release it before Andresen's departure.</summary>
