    <summary>Autotools have been questioned as a future build system choice over CMake. CMake generates native build scripts for Make on all platforms, XCode, and Visual Studio whereas Autoconf only does Make. The syntax of m4/autotools has been deemed convoluted while CMake is much clearer and faster. Many people have discouraged the use of autotools for new projects. Furthermore, CMake is supported natively in Qt Creator in the QT SDK and is used by many other KDE/QT as well as other open-source applications. Lastly, a CMake build system for Bitcoin has already been integrated into rpcminer and is available for download.</summary>
