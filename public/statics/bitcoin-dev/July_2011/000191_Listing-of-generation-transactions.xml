    <summary>After reading pull/417, it has been noticed that generation transactions appear twice in listtransaction output. One item appears with account "" and category "generate"/"imature"/"orphan" along with some transaction data. The second one appears with the account associated with the destination address and category "received" along with the same transaction data. However, the issue with account "" remains.For coinbase transactions, one "generated" item may be listed per txout that corresponds to an owned address. Accounts would be associated accordingly, in the same way as for usual "received" amounts. Account balances would also take into account these generated amounts in the obvious way. This change would not only simplify the code but also make few people happy who rely on specific details.It has also been observed that {list,get}receivedby{address,account} commands do not list or take into account generation transactions. It is unclear how the help message associated with those commands should be understood. As a user, one would assume that generated transactions are included in these listings/amounts. It is not clear whether all of this is related to issues encountered by E-wallet providers.</summary>
