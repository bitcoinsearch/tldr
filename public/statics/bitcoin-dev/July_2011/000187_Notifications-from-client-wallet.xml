    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposal of adding notifications to the client and wallet, making UI and core communication decoupled. Boost::signal mechanism is proposed for this purpose. Various specific notifications are suggested for the wallet such as balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, transactionRemoved, addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved, notification, and askFee. The discussion also includes a suggestion to define high-level information request functions for transactions so that GUI/RPC doesn't have to inspect wallet data structures themselves anymore. The proposal also covers network client notifications such as numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, and notification for warning/error occurring in network processing. Implementation details and suggestions are discussed in detail throughout the thread.</summary>
