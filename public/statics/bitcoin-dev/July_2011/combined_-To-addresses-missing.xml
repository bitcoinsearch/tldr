    <summary>The author of the message faced an issue with their UI after syncing to the latest git version. They later discovered that addresses were missing in the detailed transaction view. Upon further investigation, they found that the problem was in a section of script.cpp that only returned "true" for keys in the keystore. After commenting out a line of code, the display was fixed. However, the author expressed concern over potential unintended consequences from this solution.</summary>
