    <summary>The flood control limits are becoming an issue again and so a 0.3.24 release is needed. The release will include sipa's flood limit fix, dnsseed on by default and UPnP enabled by default. A DNSSeed has been set up with reliable hosting which dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections (and on port 8333 and on version 0.3.19 or higher) (dnsseed.bluematt.me). This was added to master in 44d16327. Since it is no longer a static list, it is time to enable dnsseed by default. UPnP by default would also be a good idea as it could increase the percent of nodes which accept incoming connection. Additionally, other P2P applications which depend on the ability to accept incoming connections have it on by default as well, such as Skype. Jgarzik has also suggested this. A fix for the no-connections-up segfault should also be included.</summary>
