    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed several changes to the Bitcoin code. He suggested enabling DNS seed and block send while fixing a segfault bug. Regarding UPnP, he recommended enabling it on Windows and Mac but keeping it off by default on Linux, although he wasn't sure about OS differentiation. Andresen also proposed adding another blockchain checkpoint. The email was sent with a PGP signature attachment.</summary>
