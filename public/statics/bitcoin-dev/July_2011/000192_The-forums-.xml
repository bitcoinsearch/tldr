    <summary>The writer of this post is annoyed by the forums and suggests removing the link to them from Bitcoin.org. They propose a new forum that focuses solely on helping users, merchants, and developers with Bitcoin-related issues without engaging in political or economic speculation. The author believes that official forums for an open-source project should remain neutral, and if linked at all, should be used to help people adopt and understand the technology.</summary>
