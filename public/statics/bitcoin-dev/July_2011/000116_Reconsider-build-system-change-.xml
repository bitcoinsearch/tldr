    <summary>In an email conversation between Luke-Jr and John Smith on July 2, 2011, John questioned the decision to choose autotools over cmake as the future build system. Luke-Jr expressed that he did not have much preference but pointed out that cmake does not follow the standard build procedure of './configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install'. However, he suggested that a shell script named 'configure' that starts 'cmake .' could be created and it would need to pass through some command line args, such as --prefix. The new sequence for building would then be 'cmake . &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install'.</summary>
