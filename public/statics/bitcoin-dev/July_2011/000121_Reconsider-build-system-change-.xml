    <summary>In an email conversation between Douglas Huff and John Smith, they discuss the limitations of autotools in generating makefiles for other platforms. While John argues that gmake can build/run basically everywhere, Douglas points out that it doesn't work for native build systems on at least Windows and OSX and is a hack to get it to run. They also discuss the use of a GUI for selecting build options in cmake, with John arguing that it's just a convenience and the command line can be used instead. Finally, they touch on the implementation of a cmake build system for Bitcoin.</summary>
