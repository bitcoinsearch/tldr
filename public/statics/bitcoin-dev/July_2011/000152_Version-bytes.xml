    <summary>Pieter Wuille initiated a discussion on standardizing the version bytes used by Bitcoin for multiple applications. The aim was to establish a convention before everyone starts defining their own. The proposal presented applies to non-alternate chains and is compatible with all currently-used version bytes that he knows of, such as testnet, realnet, addresses, private keys, namecoin, and multicoin. The proposal suggests using the following functions for base58-encoded data structures and addresses: - address = 0- privkey = 4- masterkey = 6- extended = 7An 'EncodeVersionByte' function would be used to encode the class (dataclass_t), nVersion and fTestNet values. This function returns an integer value which can be used as a version byte while encoding data in Base58.</summary>
