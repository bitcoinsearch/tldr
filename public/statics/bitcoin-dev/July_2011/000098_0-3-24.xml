    <summary>The discussion revolves around turning on UPnP by default in the GUI and leaving it off in bitcoind. While some argue that UPnP is bad for individuals due to increased bandwidth usage, it is good for the network. However, the decision ultimately lies with someone who needs to make a tough call and turn it on. A poll conducted showed that 55% of people voted against it, while 25% voted for having it on in the GUI but off in bitcoind. The remaining 20% voted for having it on by default. One participant in the discussion believes that this should not be a vote at all. It is necessary to ensure network stability over the next 90 days, especially given the numbers presented by Greg/Matt. Additionally, the default will only apply to pre-built binaries, which bitcoind isn't one of, so for people running bitcoind, this default doesn't matter at all. They can continue building without UPNP support as they're already doing.</summary>
