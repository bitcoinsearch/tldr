    <summary>The author of pull/417 has noticed that generation transactions always appear twice in the listtransaction output. The first item has an account of "" and category "generate"/"imature"/"orphan", while the second has the account associated with the destination address and category "received". Both items have the same txid. The author wonders if this is intended behavior or if the second item should be removed. Additionally, the author questions why account "" is enforced in the first item. Furthermore, the author notes that {list,get}receivedby{address,account} commands do not list or take into account generation transactions, despite the help message suggesting otherwise. As a user, the author would assume that generated transactions are included in these listings/amounts. The author questions if this is related to issues experienced by E-wallet providers.</summary>
