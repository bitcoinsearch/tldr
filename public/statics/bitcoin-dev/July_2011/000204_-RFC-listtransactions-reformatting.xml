    <summary>Gavin Andresen suggests that it would be a good idea to fix listtransactions so that coin generation transactions can be credited to a particular address or account. However, he acknowledges that changing the output of listtransactions may not be a high priority for web service operators as it could potentially force them to change their code. Instead, Gavin believes that fixing performance problems with getbalance and listtransactions when dealing with large amounts of transactions and accounts should be a higher priority. Additionally, he recommends implementing push-notification of coins received to accounts to eliminate the need for constant polling for changes.</summary>
