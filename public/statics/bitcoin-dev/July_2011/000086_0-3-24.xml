    <summary>On July 1, 2011, Pieter proposed the idea of releasing version 0.3.24 of Bitcoin due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. He suggested including sipa's flood limit fix and enabling DNS seed and UPnP by default. Matt Corallo cleaned up the commit and created a pull request for it. Additionally, he got a DNS seed up with reliable hosting, which dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. This was added to master in 44d16327. Pieter agreed with enabling DNS seed and UPnP as he believes it could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections. The group discussed Jgarzik's suggestion on enabling UPnP, and they see no reason not to add it to the release. They also agreed to include the commit to fix the segfault bug. Finally, Pieter proposed an emergency release with block send limit, no-connect segfault bugfix, and enabled UPnP and DNS seed by default.</summary>
