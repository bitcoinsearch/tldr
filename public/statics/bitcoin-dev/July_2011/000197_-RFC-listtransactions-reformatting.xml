    <summary>In this email, Stéphane proposes a new approach to associate generation txouts with the correct addresses and accounts. He includes a link to his previous mail detailing the proposal. Additionally, he suggests that additions to wallets should always be categorized as "receive" regardless of the transaction type, or alternatively, a "type" field could be added with values of "credit" or "debit" to allow for more categories in the future. Stéphane notes the importance of an official API guide and agrees that generated amounts should be included in {list,get}receivedby*. However, he acknowledges that his patch does not yet address this issue.</summary>
