    <summary>During a discussion on the bitcoin-development list, Matt agreed with someone and suggested that they should have sent their message directly to Alan instead of posting it on the mailing list. The bitcoin-development list is meant for constructive discussion of bitcoin development, so Gavin Andresen urged everyone to ask themselves whether their message will help move the bitcoin project forward or just make someone angry before posting. He also advised them to assume that at least one person on the list is in a bad mood due to personal reasons.</summary>
