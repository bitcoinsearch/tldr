    <summary>The Bitcoin community is considering making UPnP default on Bitcoin but not on Bitcoind. The decision is still being debated, with Gavin Andresen being the key player in making it. Two strong arguments for upnp are that other p2p apps, notably Skype, use it, and it will make a significant positive impact in the number of nodes supporting incoming connections. Other minor updates include added translations, updated Visual C++ makefile, Boost unit-testing framework, rpc server, DNS seeding, bug fixes, and more. The full list of updates and contributors can be found in the context above.</summary>
