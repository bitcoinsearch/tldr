    <summary>In a discussion thread, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen proposed the addition of a feature which would allow anyone to add to the bounty attached to a bug on a bug tracker and suggested that a listing page for bugs with their bounties might be nice too. John Smith agreed with the idea and proposed using the GitHub bug tracker to implement the feature. However, Luke-Jr expressed concern over agreeing to GitHub's steep demand for potentially unlimited money in their terms of service and suggested setting up a bug tracker unrelated to GitHub if they can't support the feature.</summary>
