    <summary>A conversation between John Smith and Luke-Jr on July 2, 2011, showed that they were discussing future build systems for a project. John asked why autotools was chosen instead of CMake. While Luke-Jr did not particularly care about the choice, he mentioned that CMake does not follow the standard build procedure, though it could be emulated with a script. John suggested using a shell script named 'configure' to start 'cmake .' and passing through command line arguments such as --prefix, --datadir, --mandir, etc. He also mentioned the importance of having a --help option listing all useful options, which he missed with CMake-stuff.</summary>
