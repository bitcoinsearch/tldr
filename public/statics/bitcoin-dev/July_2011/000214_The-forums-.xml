    <summary>In an email dated July 18, 2011, Chris Acheson proposed using Bitcoin Stack-Exchange as the main user and merchant support site. He believed that the Stack Exchange format was ideal due to its predefined acceptable/unacceptable topics and user moderation/reputation system. The site would be for technical and conceptual questions only and would not allow politics, philosophy, buying, or selling, making it unattractive to trolls and hucksters. At the time of writing, 64 more people needed to commit to using the site before it would launch, with 48 of those needing to be established Stack Exchange users. Acheson hoped to launch the site by the end of August and encouraged people to join up.</summary>
