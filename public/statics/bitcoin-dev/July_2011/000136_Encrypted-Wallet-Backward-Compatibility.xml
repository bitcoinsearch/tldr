    <summary>The aim of Gavin Andresen is to get 0.3.24 rolling as quickly as possible for enough lead time on 0.4. The approval of Github pulls #378 or #381 is required for this purpose. However, fixing downgrade-to-0.3.24 is low on the priority list as it is just about as likely to be downgraded to something before 0.3.24 which will still do something mostly reasonable. Only two issues need to be addressed in 0.3.24 which are the pull request "Do not use comma as thousands separator" and a blockchain lock-in at block 13444.</summary>
