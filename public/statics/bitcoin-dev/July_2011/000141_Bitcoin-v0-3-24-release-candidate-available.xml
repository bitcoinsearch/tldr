    <summary>Bitcoin 0.3.24rc3, the latest version of the software for the digital currency, has been uploaded. Changes since 0.3.24rc1 include block-chain lock-in at 134444 and a fix to synchronization of default key, among others. Fixes appeared after -rc2 was tagged, so the developers went straight to -rc3. There is speculation that this may be the final release on Friday. The new version is available for download on Linux, Windows, and source, with links provided in the announcement. It includes fixes to UPnP settings and to comma usage as thousands separator.</summary>
