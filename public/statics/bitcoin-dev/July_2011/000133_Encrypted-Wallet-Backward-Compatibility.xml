    <summary>In an email exchange on July 4, 2011, Gavin Andresen and Douglas Huff discussed the potential for backup scripts to be broken as a result of merging import/export. Huff stated that intentionally breaking unsafe and poorly designed backup mechanisms would be desirable since import/export was planned to get merged around the same time. Andresen agreed with Huff's statement and added that backup scripts using the backupwallet RPC command should still work. The email includes a PGP signature.</summary>
