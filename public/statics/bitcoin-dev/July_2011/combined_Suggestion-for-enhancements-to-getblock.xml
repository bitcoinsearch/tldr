    <summary>Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn and Dr. Andy Parkins discussed the possibility of allowing lightweight clients to calculate balances for specific addresses without requiring the entire blockchain. However, it was clarified that an index of all transactions is needed to prove a transaction's validity. Every incoming transaction has to be examined because there is no way for a client to know in advance whether any broadcast transaction contains a send to an address in its wallet. Furthermore, there is no way to know if transactions for an address in your wallet were contained in blocks missed while offline. Hearn expressed interest in supporting a split wallet feature where the private key is held elsewhere but the current balance in a particular address can still be reported.To improve the functionality of lightweight clients, the author of an email exchange suggests two changes to the Bitcoin protocol. The first change involves allowing the getblocks message to accept inventory items of type MSG_TX as well as MSG_BLOCK, which would allow a lightweight client to request only the block that contains a specific transaction, rather than having to download the entire blockchain. The second change involves the creation of a special virtual block request using an all-zero hash. This virtual block would list all current pending transactions and could be used by a lightweight client to check if a transaction sending coins to one of their addresses is pending.In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin forum, Mike Hearn suggested that appearing deep in the blockchain should be considered as proof of validity. This trust is essential for Lightweight/SPV clients and cannot be achieved any other way. The author believes these changes would give any client many of the facilities available in blockexplorer.com and bitcoincharts.com.Regarding the issue of requesting the current pending transaction list, implementing filtering suggestions would be more scalable than downloading the entire memory pool. Downloading the entire memory pool does not scale well, so it would be best to give remote nodes a filter to match against transactions and only relay those. Probabilistic filters can be set on different nodes to reduce privacy implications.In an email thread, Andy Parkins discussed a situation where he is only interested in the history of his wallet addresses and stores block headers only. When he receives a block broadcast with a transaction that sends coins to one of his addresses, he wants to request those transactions and ensure their validity and presence in blocks.</summary>
