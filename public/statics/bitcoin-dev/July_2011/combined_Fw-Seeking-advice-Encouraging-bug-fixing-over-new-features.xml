    <summary>Amir Taaki attempted to incentivize bug-fixing over new features by offering $4000 worth of bounties, but received minimal response before it dropped off the page. To address this issue, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen suggested allowing anyone to add to the bounty attached to a bug on the bug tracker and creating a listing page for bugs with their bounties. John Smith supported this idea and proposed creating a roadmap to plan "bug fix only" releases before introducing new features. The biggest challenge in implementing these changes will be organizational, specifically acquiring enough BTC for bounties. It is suggested that a high profile member like Gavin could ask for support and garner trust. Ultimately, the proposal is to bring in projects and pay individuals full-time under an organization to prioritize bug-fixing over new features.</summary>
