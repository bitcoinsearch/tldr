    <summary>In an email conversation on July 27th, 2011, Rick Wesson suggested that offering a bounty for finding the right technical lead would be beneficial in improving the software and ultimately the value of Bitcoin. However, it was clarified that the bounties would be less than a developer salary and more of a symbolic gesture to attract developers and get them some coins. The idea behind this is that people with coins are more motivated to make the project more valuable, thus avoiding the "tragedy of the commons" problem. It was also noted that while the idea of getting a salary for developers was not disagreed upon, it was a separate issue.</summary>
