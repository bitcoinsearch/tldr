    <summary>In an email conversation on July 26, 2011, Rick Wesson discussed some issues related to Bitcoin addresses and DNSSEC. It was mentioned that there is a requirement of using a unique Bitcoin address per transaction, which can be problematic for users. Wesson proposed a solution of emailing a signed message to alleviate the issue but acknowledged the privacy concern associated with it. Another point of discussion was DNSSEC becoming illegal in the US. Wesson inquired about this claim and requested some evidence to support it. In response, he was given a link to a search result about the PROTECT IP act and DNSSEC. However, there wasn't any further discussion about this matter. Lastly, they talked about how emails aren't just domains and an "address" that used the same or similar formatting but didn't use the SMTP protocol could be different from a typical email address. It was clarified that foo.bar.net is not the same formatting as foo at bar.net.</summary>
