    <summary>On July 16, 2011, Stéphane Gimenez proposed a solution that associates generated txouts with the appropriate addresses and accounts. He suggests adding wallet categories for all transactions, which could be expanded in the future. However, his GitHub link is broken, and he agrees that the generated amounts should be included in {list,get}receivedby*.Gavin Andresen suggested fixing listtransactions to credit coin generation transactions to a specific address or account, but acknowledges that this may not be a priority for web service operators as it could require changes to their code. Instead, he recommends prioritizing performance improvements for getbalance and listtransactions when dealing with large amounts of transactions and accounts.Additionally, he suggests implementing push-notification of coins received to accounts to eliminate constant polling for changes. In their conversation, an unknown person suggests either categorizing the wallet as "receive" or relying on the sign of the amounts and adding a "type" field with values "credit"/"debit" to allow for more categories to be added in the future. They also note that "move" is a positive amount but does not change the actual value in the wallet.The proposed changes include adding new keys to transactions to keep a standard format for similar entries, categorizing all additions to wallets as "receive" transactions, and adding a "status" key with five values to fix issues with webservices being ignorant of generated transactions. Stéphane notes the importance of an official API guide and agrees that generated amounts should be included in {list,get}receivedby*. However, he acknowledges that his patch does not yet address this issue. Gavin Andresen suggests fixing performance problems with getbalance and listtransactions when dealing with large amounts of transactions and accounts, implementing push-notification of coins received to accounts to eliminate the need for constant polling for changes, and using listreceivedsince instead of accounts for receiving funds on merchant sites due to numerous bugs and problems associated with it.</summary>
