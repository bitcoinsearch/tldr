    <summary>The writer of the email is requesting the removal of a forum link due to it being associated with illegal activity, including someone offering to sell a bitcoin mining virus. The forum link is not necessary as there is already a link to the wiki which links to the forum and other unofficial forums. The issue is considered a new level of bad PR as comments on the forum show support for the illegal activity.</summary>
