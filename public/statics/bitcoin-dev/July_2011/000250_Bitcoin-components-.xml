    <summary>In an email sent on July 28, 2011, Alan Grimes expressed his thoughts about the Infrastructure page on Bitcoin's wiki. He noted that while it provides a high-level overview of the current Bitcoin concept, it still needs more explanation. Grimes said that he had put the page together a while ago with logical segregation of the Bitcoin concept. Initially, wxBitcoin implemented the entire thing as one big blob until miners got moved out first, then Spesmilo took the next step of separating out GUI. Currently, Wallet and node are tightly tied together in bitcoind, although it can function as only one of the two just as well.Grimes also asked about the relationship between the wallet and the miner. In response, the miner only needs an address from the wallet to generate coins. However, he raised a general concern over the lack of documentation on how today's operating systems are properly multi-user systems, where each user would keep their wallet in an encrypted store in their home directory. He, therefore, asked if there were any standards yet for users to set up their personal wallet daemon that connects to a system-wide peer node and provides an interface for only their GUI.Finally, Grimes suggested that one could run a system-wide bitcoind (or equivalent) to handle p2p connectivity and have each user run a dedicated wallet bitcoind with a unique JSON-RPC port or wx GUI. However, he noted that there was no automated setup for this kind of arrangement and personally foresees the p2p being implemented on a SOHO router as the end goal, or even better, multicast.</summary>
