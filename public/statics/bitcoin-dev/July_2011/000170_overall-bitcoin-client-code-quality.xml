    <summary>The Bitcoin codebase is in need of significant cleanup and reorganization to improve readability, reduce bugs, and make it a reference project for other clients. The code lacks documentation and clear module interfaces, uses threads poorly, has long build times, and hardcoded values. While a complete rewrite is not necessary, the code needs to be gradually changed over time through clearly-defined methods and classes. Boost is an unnecessary dependency that should be replaced with lightweight alternatives. Although there are more important issues to address at the moment, improving the code quality is vital for the long-term success of the project.</summary>
