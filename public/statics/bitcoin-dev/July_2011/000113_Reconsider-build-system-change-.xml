    <summary>The discussion regarding the future build system for Bitcoin was raised in an email thread in 2011. John Smith questioned the choice of autotools over CMake as the future build system. Matt, a contributor, explained that there was no conscious decision made and that someone had submitted an autotools patch which led to the conversation. However, he also mentioned that the autotools needed to be redone before merging. John Smith argued in favor of CMake citing its ability to generate native build scripts for all platforms including Make, XCode, and Visual Studio, clearer syntax, faster speed, and native support in Qt Creator in the QT SDK. He also mentioned that many discourage the use of autotools for new projects. John Smith shared a link to a CMake build system for Bitcoin already integrated into rpcminer. In a follow-up email, John Smith highlighted that CMake supports cross-compiling with a link to the CMake Cross Compiling wiki page. The context ended with an advertisement for Splunk, a tool that makes sense of IT infrastructure data.</summary>
