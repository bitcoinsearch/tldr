    <summary>In this email exchange, Pieter is asked if anyone is interested in writing a cmake configuration for Bitcoin. Pieter responds that he is willing to do it but it is not a high priority at the moment. He goes on to explain that he is currently using qmake and has had no issues with it, aside from boost library name auto-detection. While he acknowledges the potential benefits of using cmake, such as better cross-platform compatibility, he is content with qmake for now since it works well enough for the size of the Bitcoin project.</summary>
