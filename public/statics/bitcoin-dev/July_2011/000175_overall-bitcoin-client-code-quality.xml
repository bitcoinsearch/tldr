    <summary>In an email conversation, Alan Grimes discussed how the one class-per .h/.cpp rule is being ignored in main.h/cpp and net.h/cpp. Jeff Garzik objected to refactoring all the classes into separate files because putting logically similar code together is often more impactful and meaningful than splitting up files into many small files. He mentioned that strict, unthinking rules do not buy anything and can cost us much. Instead, he suggested finding a balance since bitcoin is hard to learn.</summary>
