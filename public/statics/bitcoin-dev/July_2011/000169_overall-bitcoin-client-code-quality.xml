    <summary>Michael Offel, in an email conversation with Jeff Garzik, listed several areas that needed improvement in the Bitcoin client. These included a lack of code documentation, poor use of threads, and hardcoded values. While Offel was willing to contribute to the project, he believed that a complete rewrite was necessary in order to create a clean, well-documented reference project for other clients. However, Garzik responded by saying that there were limited development resources available and that the team was already swamped. He encouraged others to contribute to the project if they had suggestions for improvements.</summary>
