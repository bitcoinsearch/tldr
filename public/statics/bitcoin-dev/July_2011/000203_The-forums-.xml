    <summary>The conversation between Jeff Garzik and Douglas Huff took place on 7/17/11. The discussion was about removing the forum.bitcoin.org DNS entry. It was suggested that Sirius would do this when he moves forum.bitcoin.org to forum.bitcointalk.org. However, it was mentioned that only Sirius has the keys to bitcoin.org DNS. Rob suggested that the development project should move to a new URL instead.</summary>
