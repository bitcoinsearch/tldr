    <summary>Gavin Andresen and Jan discuss the default settings for UPnP in Bitcoin. Gavin links to a poll which shows that 55% of voters preferred UPnP to be off by default, while 20% preferred it on by default and 25% wanted it on in the GUI but off in bitcoind. Jan notes that the current vote is evenly split between off and some form of on. He argues that UPnP exemplifies the security problems with computer systems today, with convenience often trumping security. However, he believes that enabling UPnP is necessary for Bitcoin as a P2P application to work behind NATs. He suggests turning it on by default in the GUI, but leaving it off in bitcoind.</summary>
