    <summary>The release candidate build 0.3.24 RC1 for Bitcoin is available in a tar.bz2 file format and can be downloaded from the given URL. The builds are gitian signed and email signed as always. However, there are a few engineering issues that need to be addressed before the release. One issue relates to testing the results of Win98 using a VM, and the other issue requires building on Ubuntu 8.04 instead of 10.04 so that older libcs can work. A thorough test of the resulting binary on newer libcs, specifically openSUSE 11.04, needs to be conducted. Despite these unfixed issues, Jeff Garzik has tagged v0.3.24rc1, indicating a preference for moving forward with bug fixes in the current tip.</summary>
