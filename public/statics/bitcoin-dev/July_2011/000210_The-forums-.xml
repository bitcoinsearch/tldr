    <summary>In an email conversation on July 17, 2011, Matt Corallo expressed his negative opinion about forums. When someone mentioned that people don't dislike forums or having them, Corallo responded by saying "speak for yourself." He went on to state that he believes forums are a cesspool. The email was sent in the context of a larger conversation, but this specific exchange highlights Corallo's personal feelings towards online forums.</summary>
