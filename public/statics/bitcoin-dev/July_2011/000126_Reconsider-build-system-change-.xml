    <summary>On July 2, 2011, Pieter, a developer of Bitcoin, responded to John Smith's email asking why they chose Autotools instead of CMake as the future build system. Pieter stated that he had no particular preference for any project build system and would be open to using a different one if it met certain criteria. These criteria included being easy to set up, allowing for building on multiple Linux distributions, supporting cross-compilation to Windows and OSX, being easy to maintain, and not too difficult to adapt other GUIs to use it. If a system met all these requirements and was tested to support them, Pieter would have no problem choosing it for future versions of Bitcoin.</summary>
