    <summary>On July 30, 2011, Matt Corallo discussed the boost testing framework implementation and suggested adding more tests. Rick Wesson suggested putting a bounty on the test framework to add more value to it. He also recommended using googletest as his choice of the C++ frameworks and provided a Wikipedia link that lists various unit testing frameworks. In the same thread, JS pointed out an issue with the unit test framework, which did not build by default. Two ways to fix the issue were suggested: adding #define BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK to the top of test_bitcoin.cpp or linking boost_unit_test_framework statically.</summary>
