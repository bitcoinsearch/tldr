    <summary>Rick Wesson, who has worked on parts of DNSSEC, believes that using email addresses as an identity are easier to remember than bitcoin addresses. He argues that DNS is designed for name to thing mapping and has done a decent job, as it is frequently leveraged as a proxy for identity. Rick suggests that if Bitcoin was used in the DNS, it would make DNSSEC more popular, which he believes is a good thing. However, when Matt Corallo questions Rick's proposal to use DNS lookups to publish a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to facilitate sending of coin, Rick responds by stating that he believes DNS offers reasonable security for transactions. He acknowledges that DNS is not well suited for transmitting something that will result in money transfer due to the risk of MITM attacks on DNS. Matt suggests that using URIs is much simpler and can be more useful in terms of being able to give different addresses and/or values per user. He also points out that despite DNSSEC being "out there," DNS is still very insecure. Instead, he proposes that a simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support works much better in the end. Lastly, the email thread includes a link to a research study exploring the data loss prevention market, specifically analyzing the changes within the DLP market and the criteria used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these DLP solutions.</summary>
