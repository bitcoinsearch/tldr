    <summary>In this email thread, Wladimir expresses his disagreement with the idea of removing the overview page or moving it to the wiki. He believes that other open-source clients deserve a mention on the Bitcoin.org page, as many new users are looking for a good Android client or a lighter client than the Satoshi one. Following links from the Bitcoin.org page is much safer than randomly searching on Google or the app store. Wladimir also agrees with Jim that it may be better for users to follow links "audited" (or at least discussed) by the community, rather than following random links on a search engine or wiki. Wladimir believes that the reference client should remain first on the main page of Bitcoin.org, as it is the most proven. While the position in the alt clients list is less important, he is not a big fan of randomized order because it can be confusing. Wladimir suggests that some other neutral ordering is possible. In response to Alan's suggestion of adding a feature matrix, Gregory Maxwell expresses his dislike for feature matrices as they encourage "checkbox decision making" and are seldom good for the decider. He believes that significant differences between clients get reduced to equal comparison with unimportant features, and it further biases development towards features that make nice bullets rather than important infrastructure. Gregory prefers text over a feature matrix as it contextualizes the complete feature set and helps users understand why different clients exist, what problems they attempt to solve, and what compromises they make.</summary>
