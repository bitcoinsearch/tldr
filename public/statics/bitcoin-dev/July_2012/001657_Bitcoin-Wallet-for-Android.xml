    <summary>The topic being discussed is the trustworthiness of proprietary software bitcoin clients. It is questioned if people should trust them and if the web should promote them, as they may contain a backdoor or other vulnerabilities. Andreas Schildbach suggests adding two links for each client - one for getting the binary and the other for getting the source code. Mats provides a link to the source code for Bitcoin Wallet for Android. Amir Taaki had previously suggested that all clients on the clients page must have the entire source code available for review, otherwise there should be a separate section for non-opensource clients. The email chain ends with Jorge Timón's name.</summary>
