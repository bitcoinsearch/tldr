    <summary>Stefan Thomas, a member of the bitcoin-development mailing list, raised a query regarding a valid script. He explained that the script tested whether the first value is between the lower and upper bound values. To his understanding, this test should evaluate to true, placing a single byte on the stack. However, the NOT function inverses it to a 0 byte false value. Thomas sought clarification on what he was missing in this evaluation. Meanwhile, an exclusive live event was advertised on the mailing list for IT managers to learn about the latest security threats and how to respond to them.</summary>
