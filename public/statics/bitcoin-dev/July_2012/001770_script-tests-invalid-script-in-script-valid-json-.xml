    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Gavin Andresen expressed his interest in porting more tests to data-driven format. He stated that he would like to help if pull requests in that direction are welcome. Andresen welcomed the idea of having more tests, particularly block verification tests. However, he mentioned that check*sig tests are tricky because they require a particular block chain to test against and refer to previous unspent transactions and private keys. He requested any brilliant ideas on how to simplify and make this possible. On the other hand, Matt Corallo wrote about a simple block chain tester he created as part of the Bitcoinj test suite. The tester is capable of forking, checking invalid blocks, and sanity-testing reorgs. It is more targeted at testing Bitcoinj directly, but some tweaks can be made to make it more generic. Matt provided a link showing the first two commits of the tester.</summary>
