    <summary>The email conversation between Mark Friedenbach and Wladimir highlights the development of Virtualbox and its importance in gitian builds. According to Wladimir, Virtualbox has fewer CPU requirements and is usable on older CPUs when compared to KVM, which is slower without hardware virtualization. Additionally, KVM and Virtualbox do not work well together. Mark's email discusses his difficulty in setting up and maintaining his own gitian build system. To solve this problem, he created a makefile that makes doing a gitian build as simple as "cd contrib/vagrant &amp;&amp; make" on any platform, provided that necessary dependencies are installed. He submitted these scripts as pull-request #1597 on Github. The email thread ends with a link to an exclusive live event that will discuss today's security and threat landscape, including endpoint security, mobile security, and the latest in malware threats. It also provides links to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
