    <summary>The conversation on the Bitcoin-development mailing list on July 29, 2012, involved a query by Amir Taaki regarding whether the script ["1 0 1", "WITHIN NOT"] was valid. Stefan Thomas responded that it wasn't valid as OP_WITHIN is lower-bound-inclusive and upper bound exclusive, so 1 0 1 WITHIN is false. The discussion also touched upon adding data-driven test cases to bitcoin scripts, which Gavin had done earlier, and how useful they are. There was interest in porting more tests like P2SH, checksig, checkmultisig, block verification, and maybe even DoS rules into data-driven format. The person discussing this expressed their willingness to help if the pull requests in that direction are welcome.</summary>
