    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 30 (BIP 30) mandates that a new block must refer to the first unspent transaction output. This helps to ensure security and address potential problems in the future. The change would also allow developers to test using block/transaction version numbers for smoothly rolling out changes. This could be helpful in case of any crisis, as it would provide time to fix problems that might arise. Additionally, the change is expected to make it easier to determine whether an orphan chain can possibly be part of the main chain. Overall, this change would provide both added security and long-term benefits for the Bitcoin network.</summary>
