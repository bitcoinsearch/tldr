    <summary>Thiago is requesting Michael to release a new version of Libcoin as close as possible to the mainline Bitcoin without adding any extra code or changing any stdout/stderr messages. Thiago has requested that the extra code should be such that he can run the "blockchain side" as Linux user called "blockchain" and each of his regular Linux user will have its own wallet.dat file (without the blockchain). Thiago has not mentioned anything about the cost of this request.</summary>
