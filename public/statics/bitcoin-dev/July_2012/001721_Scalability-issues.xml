    <summary>In a message from 2012, a user named grarpamp expressed concern about the time it takes to build a new blockchain and keep up with incoming blocks. They suggest that there may be something wrong with the software stack and that a full sync should only take around an hour. The user acknowledges that there are scalability issues, but believes that regular hardware should still be able to keep up without any major changes to the protocol. It is unclear what specific system or software they were referring to.</summary>
