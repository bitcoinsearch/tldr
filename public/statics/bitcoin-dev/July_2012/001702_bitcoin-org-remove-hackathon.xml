    <summary>Amir Taaki requested to remove the hackathon from bitcoin.org and replace it with a conference instead. Vladimir raised a fair point that the hackathon is appropriate for bitcoin.org as it is focused on dev-related activities, but the conference might or might not be. However, Jeff Garzik said that the conference is community-focused, so he doesn't object to it being on bitcoin.org. He also suggested using pull requests which are preferred over mailing list email and git push when working on the satoshi client.</summary>
