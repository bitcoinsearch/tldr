    <summary>The author of the message is seeking input from others regarding a proposal to split BIP 22 into three separate proposals, due to concerns about the original BIP being too unfocused and covering too many topics. The author acknowledges that this discussion took place on IRC rather than the mailing list as specified in BIP 1. The author is unsure if there was any discussion of BIP 22 on the mailing list, but seeks input before granting permission for the proposal to be pared down. The author admits to having limited knowledge of mining and invites others to share their thoughts on the proposed split. The link provided points to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 22 on the Bitcoin wiki.</summary>
