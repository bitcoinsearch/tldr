    <summary>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and operates on a peer-to-peer network. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.To use Bitcoin, one must first download a wallet program to their computer or mobile device. There are many different wallet programs available, each with its own set of features and security measures. Some popular wallet programs include Bitcoin Core, Electrum, and Armory.Once a user has downloaded a wallet program, they can then acquire bitcoins through various methods, such as purchasing them from an exchange, receiving them as payment for goods or services, or mining them through their computer's processing power.Users can then send and receive bitcoins to other users around the world, without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Transactions are typically processed within minutes and are irreversible once confirmed by the network.Overall, Bitcoin offers a fast, secure, and decentralized way to transfer value globally. Its open-source nature and lack of central authority have made it a popular choice for individuals seeking financial autonomy and privacy.</summary>
