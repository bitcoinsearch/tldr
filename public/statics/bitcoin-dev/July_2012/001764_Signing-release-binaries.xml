    <summary>The author expresses concern over the security of the binaries available on the bitcoin.org site. They suggest that all binaries should be signed with gpg in order to provide an extra layer of protection against potential hacks and wallet theft. Despite the fact that all developers seem to have gpg keys, the author questions why detached gpg signatures are not already being provided for the binaries. The author emphasizes the importance of this extra security measure in protecting users' funds from malicious attacks.</summary>
