    <summary>On July 9, 2012, Amir Taaki raised concern about a recent addition to the clients page. The condition for any client to be listed on the page was that its source code should be available for review and users must be able to run it from the source code. However, Amir could not find the source code for the new client. As a result, the addition was reverted. The author of the email expressed strong opposition to including any non-reviewable client options or centrally operated web services on the page. He believed that this issue needed to be discussed alongside establishing requirements.</summary>
