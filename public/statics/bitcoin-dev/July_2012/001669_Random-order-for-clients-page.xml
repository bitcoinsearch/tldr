    <summary>It appears that there has been an ongoing argument regarding the suggestion for a Clients list. The original suggestion was to have objective information listed in alphabetical order. It is unclear what exactly the argument is about, but it seems to have caused some disagreement among those involved. Despite this, the suggestion for an objective and alphabetized list remains on the table. FWIW, or 'for what it's worth', implies that the speaker feels their opinion may not hold much weight in the argument. However, it is important to consider all suggestions in order to come up with the best solution. By focusing on objective information in alphabetical order, the Clients list can be organized and easily accessible for anyone who needs it. It is not clear who the Clients list is for, but it can be assumed that it is for a company or organization. Keeping track of clients is essential for any business, so having a well-organized list can only be beneficial. It is important to remain focused on the objective information rather than personal opinions or biases. This will ensure that the list is accurate and reliable. Overall, the suggestion for a Clients list that is objective and alphabetized remains a viable option despite ongoing arguments. It is crucial to consider all suggestions and work towards a solution that benefits everyone involved. By keeping the focus on objective information, the list can be a valuable resource for any business or organization.</summary>
