    <summary>In an email conversation thread, Peter Vessenes questions the proposal which suggests adding height in coinbase to ensure unique transactions. He worries about overburdening the coinbase and calls for more discussion on the topic. Jeff Garzik responds by pointing out that without the inclusion of height in coinbase, there might not be unique transactions. Additionally, he provides a link to Gavin's notes on upgrades and BIP16 lessons-learned.</summary>
