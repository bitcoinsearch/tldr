    <summary>The fear of advertisers' influence on the neutral content is why Wikipedia does not have advertisements. The corrupting influence is inevitable, which is why a good fun conference like the hackathon they just held should not have sponsors. Amir Taaki mentioned that he does not wish to sell a speaker slot, but if he has to pay the bills, it will be obvious due to scheduling and disclaimers that speakers are sponsors. Andreas Petersson responded by saying that he doesn't mind sponsored speakers as long as they have somewhat relevant topics to keep the event from becoming a "circlejerk." He would like to hear about payments innovation outside of Bitcoin. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
