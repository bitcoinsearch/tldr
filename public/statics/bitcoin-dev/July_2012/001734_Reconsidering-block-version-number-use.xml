    <summary>Peter suggests having more nonce space with less merkle calculation to ease the pool server work and reduce the number of unique transaction/coinbase sets to hold on to for checking old work when a solution is returned. Mike questions the necessity of more nonce bits and asks if it is working around a performance bottleneck somewhere else. In response, Peter provides details on the amount of nonce required and changes for version 2 blocks, which would have "has height in the coinbase, and has a 1-byte version number with a 3-byte extranonce." The email also includes contact information for Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab.</summary>
