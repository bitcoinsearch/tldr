    <summary>The Bitcoin developers were discussing the addition of two links for each client - one for getting the binary and one for getting the source. On July 9, 2012, Amir Taaki saw that there was a section added for proprietary clients and asked if anything looked disagreeable. Mats provided the sources for the Bitcoin Wallet for Android on Google Code. Amir then asked if the source code for this client was available for review since it needed to be available for all clients on the website. Otherwise, a separate section for non-opensource clients should be created. The email also includes a link to a Live Security Virtual Conference which will cover topics related to security and threat landscape changes.</summary>
