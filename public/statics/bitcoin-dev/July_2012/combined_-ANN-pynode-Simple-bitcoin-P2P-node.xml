    <summary>Pynode is a bitcoin P2P client that maintains a blockchain database and TX memory pool. It is based on ArtForz' half-a-node and serves as a useful base for other projects like network monitoring nodes. However, it is primarily intended for developers and not end-users. The client lacks features such as RPC, key management (wallet), script verification, or chain re-org.Despite its limited capabilities, Pynode can maintain an indexed blockchain database, an initial blockchain download, and a transaction memory pool. The alpha quality release is expected to become more capable over time, and contributions are welcome. The intention is to evolve into a full wallet-less node eventually.Jeff Garzik of exMULTI, Inc. is the creator of Pynode and can be contacted at jgarzik@exmulti.com.</summary>
