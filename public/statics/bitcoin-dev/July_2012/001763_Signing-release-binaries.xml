    <summary>The email is part of a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list from 2012, with the subject "Vendor code signing for Windows". The author mentions that they have a code-signing key for Windows and could sign the Windows installer and binary. Luke-Jr responds to this suggestion by saying that Gavin would be the final signer but since he is not interested in participating in any way in the stable versions, he would prefer to see someone else responsible for OS-vendor signing. The email also includes a promotional message about a Live Security Virtual Conference which will cover all the ways today's security and threat landscape has changed and how IT managers can respond. Discussions will include endpoint security, mobile security and the latest in malware threats. The email ends with a PGP signature using GnuPG v2.0.19 (MingW32).</summary>
