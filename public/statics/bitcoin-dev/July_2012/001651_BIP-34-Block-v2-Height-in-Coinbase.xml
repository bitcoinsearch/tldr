    <summary>In an email exchange between Mark Friedenbach, Jeff Garzik, and Peter Vessenes, the concern was raised over the issue of non-unique transactions in Bitcoin. The existing setup without height in coinbase could lead to problems that would need to be solved through workarounds and special cases. However, Mark suggested a solution to mandate that a transaction refers to the first such pair that is not already spent. Overall, the email thread highlights the challenges and potential solutions to dealing with non-unique transactions in Bitcoin.</summary>
