    <summary>MacOS X 10.8 mandates application signing, requiring the use of a certificate issued by Apple's "identified developer" program to run unsigned apps. Windows, on the other hand, does not require signing but anti-virus systems tend to whitelist signers with good reputation. Signing Bitcoin releases may improve performance if AV engines ignore file reads/writes by Bitcoin and also shield from false positives. The importance of this is highlighted by the mess in the mining tools world. The author cannot help out directly with the release process but is willing to contribute towards buying the signing certs for both platforms. Gavin would be the final signer.</summary>
