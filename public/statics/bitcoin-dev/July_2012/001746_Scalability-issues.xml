    <summary>The writer has an 1.8 GHz P3 Celeron machine with 128k cache running vintage 2.6.20 Linux which should be slower than the recipient's machine. The writer forgot to turn on timestamp logging, so they don't know how long it took to sync the chain but it was less than two days. The writer is keeping current and suggests that the recipient investigate their software configuration. Someone suggested the writer investigate turning off features such as sha256 integrity trees for all bits and AES-128-XTS/CBC disk encryption. However, the writer finds the loss of these features undesirable and is investigating what more GHz and cores will do. The writer believes that keeping data both intact and private is important, just like one's checkbook.</summary>
