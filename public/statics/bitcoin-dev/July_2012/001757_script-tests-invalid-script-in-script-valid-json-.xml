    <summary>The post is discussing OP_WITHIN, which is lower-bound-inclusive but upper bound exclusive. It evaluates to false when using 1 0 1 WITHIN. The script mentioned in the post ["1 0 1", "WITHIN NOT"] tests to see if the first value (1) is between the lower (0) and upper (1) values. This evaluates to true, resulting in a single byte of [01] being placed on the stack. The NOT operator then inverses this to a 0 byte false value of []. The author of the post is confused about something and asks for clarification. The post ends with information about an upcoming Live Security Virtual Conference and a link to register, as well as a link to join the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
