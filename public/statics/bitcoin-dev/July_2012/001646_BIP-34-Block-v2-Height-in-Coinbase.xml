    <summary>On July 6, 2012, Jeff Garzik and Peter Vessenes discussed a proposal related to miners. Vessenes expressed concern about adding too many requirements to the coinbase and asked for more discussion on the topic. Garzik responded by explaining that without the proposed change, there might not be unique transactions. He also provided a link to Gavin's notes on upgrades and BIP16 lessons-learned. Vessenes thanked Garzik for the information, and the conversation ended.</summary>
