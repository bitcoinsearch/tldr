    <summary>One pragmatic solution for Bitcoin users is to try running the Multibit client. Although it is uncertain if the Linux/Java based installer will work, building it from source may be necessary. Compared to bitcoin-qt, Multibit is much faster and updating only took 15 seconds after installation. Importing a private key or rescanning the blockchain can be completed in under 30 minutes. Java 6 is required and there is even a distro available for freebsd. However, Multibit cannot be used for solomining since it uses SPV.</summary>
