    <summary>The conversation is about whether or not to promote bitcoin web wallets. The concern is that the wallets could contain a backdoor or other vulnerabilities, which could lead to hacking and negative media attention. The mention of "two-inch newspaper titles" suggests that the potential impact of such an event could be significant. It seems that the participants in the conversation are aware of past shortcuts taken by journalists, indicating some mistrust of media coverage regarding bitcoin security.</summary>
