    <summary>A concern has been raised regarding a client page that was recently added. The condition set for the page was that all clients must have the entire source code available for review, and users should be able to run it from the source code. However, it seems that the source code for this particular client is not readily available, and the person inquiring about it could not find it. As a solution, it has been suggested that a separate section be made for non-open source clients. This would help differentiate between clients that meet the requirement of having open source code and those that do not. It would also make it easier for users who are specifically interested in open source clients to find what they are looking for. It is important to adhere to the set conditions for the client page in order to maintain transparency and ensure that users have access to all relevant information. By making a separate section for non-open source clients, we can still showcase their work while being transparent about the availability of their source code.</summary>
