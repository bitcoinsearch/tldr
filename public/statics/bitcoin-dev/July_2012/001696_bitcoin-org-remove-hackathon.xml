    <summary>In an email dated July 15th, 2012, Amir Taaki reached out to the Bitcoin-development mailing list asking if they could remove the hackathon from the bitcoin.org website and replace it with a conference. This email was part of a chain that included a previous inquiry by Vladimir Marchenko about promoting Bitcoin Magazine on the bitcoin.org homepage. It is unclear whether or not either request was granted.Bitcoin.org is a website that provides information on Bitcoin, including news, wallets, and exchanges. However, it appears that the website also promotes private enterprises, such as Bitcoin Magazine. It is unclear why some enterprises are promoted on the site and not others. The email from Taaki includes a link to a Live Security Virtual Conference, which covers topics related to security and threat landscapes in IT management. This suggests that Taaki may have been interested in promoting this conference on the bitcoin.org website in place of the hackathon event.</summary>
