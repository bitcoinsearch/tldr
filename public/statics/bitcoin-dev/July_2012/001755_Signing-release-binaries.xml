    <summary>MacOS X 10.8 has made application signing nearly mandatory, as it does not allow unsigned apps to run unless settings are changed in the control panel. Signing with a certificate issued by Apple via their "identified developer" program is necessary. Windows allows but doesn't require signing; however, antiviruses tend to use signers with good reputations as a whitelisting signal. Anti-virus engines ignoring file reads/writes by Bitcoin can lead to higher performance and shield from false positives, making it important to sign Bitcoin releases. Mike Hearn thinks buying the signing certs for both platforms is essential and is willing to contribute money towards the cause. Gavin will be the final signer. The email also includes a link to an exclusive live security virtual conference covering today's security and threat landscape changes and IT managers' responses.</summary>
