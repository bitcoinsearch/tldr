    <summary>The discussion is about the Bitcoin clients page on Bitcoin.org. Some users suggest moving it to the Wiki, as it can handle controversies better, while others believe that it should remain on the website. The issue of randomization is also brought up, with some arguing that it does not serve users and that a sensible choice should be recommended instead. Suggestions are made to order clients by number of downloads or Alexa rank. One user suggests using JS randomization instead of Jekyll for more even coverage. Another user argues that the cost of dealing with the clients page outweighs its benefits and suggests removing it altogether. However, this suggestion receives pushback from those who believe that the ecosystem is diversifying, with alternative clients becoming stable and mature.</summary>
