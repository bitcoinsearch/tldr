    <summary>In this email thread, Alan expresses his agreement with Greg's views on the Bitcoin clients page. He believes that the current page is an acknowledgement of the existence of alternative clients and a link to more information would suffice. However, he also prefers the current page as it makes alt-clients more accessible. Alan suggests that consensus among developers with competing priorities and products is difficult to achieve and proposes the appointment of a "czar" to make responsible decisions or moving the page to a less strictly controlled location. The discussion also touches upon JS randomization and the need for peer review of changes through pull requests. Greg clarifies that his opposition to the current page does not stem from a lack of support for diversity in the Bitcoin network and acknowledges the importance of the reference client. He suggests moving the content to the Wiki, which already contains questionable advice and has lower expectations of vetting.</summary>
