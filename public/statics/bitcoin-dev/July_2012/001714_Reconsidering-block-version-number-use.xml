    <summary>It has been suggested that the block version number could be used as an "extra nonce" due to the anticipated increase in ASIC miners. The proposal is to use the block version for this purpose, and while the current block height in coinbase addition proposes using block version 2, the protocol change is to the coinbase transaction itself. Therefore, it has been suggested to bump the coinbase transaction version number to 2 instead.There is also an issue with block 190192 having a version of 2 without a valid block height in the coinbase, which may be due to combining the current blockheight-in-coinbase pullreq with P2Pool. This would require an exception if the version==2 marker is used, and moving the version==2 to the coinbase transaction version would allow whoever makes the transaction to set the version number instead of it coming from bitcoind and the coinbase transaction coming from P2Pool or other software.</summary>
