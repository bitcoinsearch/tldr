    <summary>Amir Taaki, a contributor to Bitcoin development, has raised questions about the availability of source code for a client on the clients page. He notes that one of the conditions for being on that page is that all clients must have their entire source code available for review and users should be able to run it from the source code. He was unable to find the source code for this particular client and suggests creating a separate section for non-open source clients if the source code cannot be made available. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
