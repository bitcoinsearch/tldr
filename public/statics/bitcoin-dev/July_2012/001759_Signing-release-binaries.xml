    <summary>In an email exchange on July 29, 2012, Mike Hearn expressed his preference for someone other than Gavin to be responsible for OS-vendor signing. Gavin had been suggested as the final signer, but Hearn stated that he was not interested in participating in any way in the stable versions. It is unclear from the provided context who or what organization Hearn is referring to when he mentions "OS-vendor signing", but it can be inferred that this refers to the process of certifying software for use on a particular operating system. The email exchange suggests that Hearn has concerns about Gavin's involvement in this process, although the specific reasons for this are not given.</summary>
