    <summary>Peter Vessenes has raised a question regarding the proposal for Block v2, Height in Coinbase and asks for more discussion and cases for making this change. He worries about adding too many requirements on the coinbase and wants to know what benefits will be gained through this proposal. Jeff Garzik had sent out a mail with a link to the wiki page for BIP 0034 which introduces an upgrade path for versioned transactions and blocks. The motivation behind this proposal is to clarify and exercise the mechanism of network consensus for upgrading transaction or block binary structures, rules, and behaviors. It also aims to enforce block and transaction uniqueness and assist unconnected block validation. The specification includes treating transactions with a version greater than 1 as non-standard, adding height as the first item in the coinbase transaction's scriptSig, and increasing block version to 2. The 75% rule dictates that if 750 of the last 1,000 blocks are version 2 or greater, invalid version 2 blocks should be rejected and the 95% rule suggests that if 950 of the last 1,000 blocks are version 2 or greater, all version 1 blocks should be rejected. This proposal is backward compatible and miners are recommended to upgrade to version 2 blocks.</summary>
