    <summary>Mark Friedenbach, a developer, faced challenges while setting up and maintaining his own gitian build system. To simplify the process, he documented the necessary steps into a makefile. Now, doing a gitian build is as simple as running "cd contrib/vagrant &amp;&amp; make" on any platform with the required dependencies installed. The scripts have been submitted by Mark as pull-request #1597 on github. He hopes that others will find this useful.</summary>
