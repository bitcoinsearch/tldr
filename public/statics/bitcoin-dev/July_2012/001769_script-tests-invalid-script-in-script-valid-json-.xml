    <summary>In an email exchange on July 30th, 2012, Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen expressed the difficulty in testing check*sig functionality due to its reliance on previous unspent transactions and private keys. He welcomed any ideas for a simple data-driven format for testing. Ultraprune, which changes the block validation mechanism to only use a set of coins and the latest block pointer as state, was introduced. This state is represented by an abstract class with multiple implementations. A memory-backed coin set as state can be utilized for a testset run, with the list of coins and blocks loaded from a file.</summary>
