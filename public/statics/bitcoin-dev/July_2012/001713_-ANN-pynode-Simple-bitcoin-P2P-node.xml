    <summary>Pynode is a simple bitcoin P2P client that maintains a blockchain database and TX memory pool. It is based on ArtForz' half-a-node and can be used as a useful base for other projects such as network monitoring nodes. However, at present, it is mainly intended for developers and not end-users. Pynode does not provide RPC, key management (wallet), script verification or chain re-org. Pynode has limited capabilities such as an outgoing TCP connection to a single remote P2P node, initial blockchain download, maintaining a transaction memory pool, and maintaining an indexed blockchain database. The alpha quality release is expected to become more capable over time. Contributions are welcome, and the intention is to become a full wallet-less node eventually. Jeff Garzik of exMULTI, Inc. is the creator of Pynode and can be contacted at jgarzik@exmulti.com.</summary>
