    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin development from 2012, Mike Hearn expressed his curiosity about the use of OP_DEPTH and OP_CODESEPARATOR in Bitcoin scripts. He requested transaction IDs that were using these opcodes. It was later discovered that all instances of OP_DEPTH were errors in P2Pool blocks. The software had been making small payments to scriptpubkey "script" due to a bug. This went unnoticed for some time because it was assumed to be an intentional action by a user utilizing p2sh.</summary>
