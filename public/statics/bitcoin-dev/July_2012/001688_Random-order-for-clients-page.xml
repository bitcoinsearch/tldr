    <summary>In an email exchange, Alan Reiner suggested that a feature matrix would be helpful for quickly finding specific features or criteria without having to read through all of the text. However, a feature matrix can encourage "checkbox decision making" which is not always good for decision-makers. The marketing department often loves matrices because they allow them to set biased agendas. Even if something retrospectively cost people a lot, it might still come out on top in the matrix comparison. The problem with tables like this is that significant differences such as a remote hacker being able to rob you get reduced to equal comparison with a chrome spoiler. This further biases development motivations towards features that make nice bullets even if they're seldom used instead of important infrastructure that improves usage every day or keeps the network secure and worth having. Important features that don't have complicated compromises attached to them are unlikely to be omitted from all clients for long. Matrixes make bad decision-making fast, and by making it fast, it's more attractive than careful decision-making that always takes time. Textual information contextualizes the complete feature set, helps understand why different clients exist, what problems they attempt to solve, and what compromises they make, without making unrealistic demands of users to weigh the value of technical and sometimes subtle issues.</summary>
