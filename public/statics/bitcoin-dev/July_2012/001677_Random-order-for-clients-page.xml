    <summary>The article discusses the complexities of Bitcoin for new users and how the clients page on bitcoin.org does a good job of explaining the different software options available. It also addresses the issue of trust and how having the clients linked from the "mothership" of bitcoin.org gives credibility to all alternative clients. The author suggests that open source clients should be the only ones included. They also mention a layout change for MultiBit, as it had previously been in a prominent position on the page. The article concludes with the tagline "Money, reinvented" and a link to multibit.org.</summary>
