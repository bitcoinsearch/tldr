    <summary>On July 23, 2012, Gavin Andresen proposed to bump the coinbase transaction version number to 2 instead of the block version. However, this would require every new block to compute the percentage of the last 1,000 blocks that support the new version, and it might be a problem if aggressively pruning spent transactions started. Luke-Jr suggested using the block version as an extra nonce, which could be used by ASIC miners running at 1 TH/s per rig before the end of 2012. Jeff noticed that block 190192 has version==2 without a valid block height in the coinbase, but since it's in a part of the chain with zero other version==2 blocks, the height-in-the-coinbase rule will not be enforced.</summary>
