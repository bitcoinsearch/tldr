    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Andreas Schildbach expressed concern about Ben's use of QRcodes that social networks can't parse without :// in them. While he initially asked Ben to fix this issue and received no response, Schildbach went ahead and added support for reading these types of URLs to bitcoinj, hoping that others might follow suit. However, Schildbach worries that an "accept everything even if broken" approach could lead to a fragmented de-facto standard, and believes that there should be a promise that any broken URLs will be fixed at the source. Given the potential consequences of encouraging broken windows, some have suggested emailing Ben to encourage him to fall into line with Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) compliance. While it's unclear whether this would have any effect, it highlights the importance of adhering to community standards in order to avoid fragmentation and maintain interoperability.</summary>
