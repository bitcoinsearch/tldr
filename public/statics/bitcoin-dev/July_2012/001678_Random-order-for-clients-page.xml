    <summary>In an email from Jim on July 9, 2012, he admitted to being secretly pleased with the original layout of MultiBit's position randomisation. The "eye candy" position was located at the top and centre of the layout. However, Jim also believed that it was only fair to switch around the positions. It is important to note that this ordering was not accidental.</summary>
