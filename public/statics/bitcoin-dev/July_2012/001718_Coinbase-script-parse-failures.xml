    <summary>The writer of Pynode, a script engine, ran a test to verify the tokenizer script. This script did not execute anything but broke down the data elements and opcodes in ScriptSig and ScriptPubKey. After scanning the entire blockchain, the tester discovered more than 8,000 tokenization failures, all of which were found in the coinbase transactions' ScriptSig. The scripts used for generating this result can be accessed at https://github.com/jgarzik/pynode.The details of the first few and latest invalid scripts found in the blockchain are presented in the following data dump. These include various block numbers, unique transaction IDs, and the parse failure of one input of these transactions. Some blocks contain many failed transactions, while others only have one. Jeff Garzik, the author of the test, works for exMULTI, Inc., and his email address is jgarzik@exmulti.com.</summary>
