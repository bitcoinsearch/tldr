    <summary>A user expresses gratitude for useful tests and plans to combine simpler ones to make more complex tests. In an email exchange, Gavin Andresen expresses interest in porting more tests into a data-driven format, including P2SH, checksig, checkmultisig, block verification, and DoS rules. However, he notes that check*sig tests are challenging because they require specific unspent transactions and private keys for testing. He welcomes brilliant ideas on a simple data-driven format. Block verification tests would be beneficial, with a collection of good and bad block chains starting from a common chain being very useful for regression testing. Gavin Andresen's signature ends the message.</summary>
