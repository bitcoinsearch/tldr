    <summary>In an email conversation, Amir Taaki questioned the inclusion of a client without its source code available for review on the Bitcoin clients page. He asked if the code was available and suggested non-open-source clients be added to a separate section. Mats Henricson responded with a link to the source code for the client. A new section has been added to the Bitcoin.org website for proprietary clients. The site owner plans to randomize the order of clients within sections upon refresh. Additionally, a security virtual conference discussing endpoint security, mobile security, and malware threats will take place soon.</summary>
