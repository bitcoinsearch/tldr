    <summary>After some effort, the issue of randomly ordered entries on the clients page has been resolved. The link provided to Github shows the commit made to resolve this issue with the page generation process. However, it is important to note that even with this fix, there is a need to regenerate the page every two days for fair exposure to all clients listed. Overall, the clients page should now show more consistent and organized listings.</summary>
