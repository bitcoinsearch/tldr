    <summary>In an email thread, Jeff Garzik raised a point about the appropriateness of having a hackathon on bitcoin.org and how it seems more community-focused. However, Luke-Jr argued that the site is more community-focused anyways since developers don't use it as much as other sites like GitHub. In the same email thread, Luke-Jr suggests that Bitcoin Consultancy/Amir's contributions to development for the conference should be sufficient to ask for-profit organizations like Bitcoin Magazine for some form of pitching in. It was also discussed that material for pull requests would be preferred over mailing list emails and git push when working on the Satoshi client since it is more efficient. Additionally, it was mentioned that they lost money on the previous year's conference and are hoping to break even this year. Any profit made will go towards next year's conference and paying for things to make a better conference. They want to keep sponsorship and community parts highly separated, and speakers won't be sold a slot unless they have to pay the bills.</summary>
