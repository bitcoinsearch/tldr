    <summary>The context discusses the need for additional nonce bits in the Bitcoin block header. The author calculates that 7 bytes of nonce would be required, which is equivalent to 72 petahashes or 72,000 terahashes. The proposed changes for version 2 blocks include adding the block height to the coinbase and a 1-byte version number with a 3-byte extranonce.However, the author questions the necessity of adding more nonce bits. They wonder if a multi-core CPU can handle the merkle root re-calculation while keeping an ASIC miner fed or if there is another performance bottleneck that needs to be addressed.</summary>
