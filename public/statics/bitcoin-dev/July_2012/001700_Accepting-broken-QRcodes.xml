    <summary>The discussion revolves around the issue of Bitcoin URIs starting with 'bitcoin://' which does not make much sense as there is no hierarchy in Bitcoin, and it's flat with only an address being a mandatory element. The problem with accepting broken URLs is that people may never fix them resulting in fragmented de-facto standards. There is a suggestion to post on the main developer forum after sufficient evidence to support the suspicion has been gathered for cleanup. It is pointed out that introducing a false hierarchy breaks the specification since it presumes the existence of a relative URI. The conversation includes email exchanges between various individuals requesting Ben to fall in line with the BIP. Andreas Schildbach stated that the "accept everything even if broken" approach can lead to fragmented de-facto standards, but he is not against accepting broken URLs if there is a promise that they will be fixed at the source.</summary>
