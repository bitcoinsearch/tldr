    <summary>A user named Ben Reeves requested the inclusion of blockchain.info iPhone app on the clients page. The source code for this app is available under an lGPL license, which can be reviewed using https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-iPhone. Additionally, the JavaScript web front end could be reviewed by using a combination of https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet and https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-Integrity-Checker. However, Gregory Maxwell objected to including any non-reviewable client options, including centrally operated web services, on the clients page. He reverted the additions to the page and suggested that it needs to be discussed along with establishing requirements. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The context mentions a link to a live security virtual conference that covers all the ways today's security and threat landscape has changed for IT managers.</summary>
