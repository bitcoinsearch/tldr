    <summary>In an email conversation, Stefan Thomas shared his opinion on the recommendation of a sensible client as opposed to a random one. This was in response to a wiki page discussing the topic. In his view, having a more "official" page with a "stamp of approval" would be beneficial. This official page would include criteria such as functionality, active development, code review, known authors, and private key accessibility by the webservice. The list of clients should be in alphabetical order with short, unbiased descriptions. The idea of an official page received support from Harald.</summary>
