    <summary>The sender of the email, Gavin Andresen, discusses the consensus in the #bitcoin-dev chat regarding a 0.8.2 release. Several important bugs have been fixed, and they aim to get a final release before the May 15th hard fork deadline. Pieter has already started going through the issues list, and help is welcome in testing, debugging, and fixing high-priority issues. If translation work needs to be done, now is a great time to do it. They still don't have a basic QA checklist for testing of release candidates, and Gavin commits to spending some of the remaining "Bitcoin Testing Project" bitcoins to whoever contributes to creating one. In other news, Arklan Uth Oslin shares two quotes expressing his views on life. The writer of the email apologizes for being unable to help due to significant life events taking up their free time.</summary>
