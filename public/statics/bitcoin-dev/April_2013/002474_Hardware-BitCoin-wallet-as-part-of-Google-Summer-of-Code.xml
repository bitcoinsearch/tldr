    <summary>Crypto Stick, an open-source USB key for encryption and authentication, has been accepted as a mentor organization for Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2013. One of their project ideas is to develop a physical Bitcoin wallet based on the Smart Card Wallet concept. Interested students can apply for the project, and if accepted, mentors will work with them over the summer while Google sponsors with USD 5000 during that time. Students can check out the ideas page or suggest their own idea and join the mailing list to discuss it. Applications should be submitted through Google Melange by May 3rd. Participation requires being a student in an accredited institution or university. Additional information and comments can be submitted into the system after the initial application submission. Links to Crypto Stick project, Ideas Page, GSOC Program F&amp;Q, and Crypto Stick Mailing List are provided.</summary>
