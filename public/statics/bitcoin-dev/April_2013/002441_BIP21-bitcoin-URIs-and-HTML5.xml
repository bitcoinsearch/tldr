    <summary>Ian has identified errors in the BIP21 specification and there is a discussion about the process for amending it. Some suggest creating a new BIP to replace the old one, while others propose fixing the errors in place due to their relatively exotic nature. However, Gavin Andresen suggests adding a new meta-data item in the BIP header labeled "Corrected" to address these issues. There is no consensus yet on how to proceed.</summary>
