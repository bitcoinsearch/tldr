    <summary>On April 10, 2013, a proposal was made by Peter Todd to change the transaction (tx) hash algorithm to extend the Merkle tree into the transaction outputs/inputs. This would allow for pruning of transactions bit by bit and still being able to serve nodes requesting proof of their unspent transaction output (UTXO) without making life difficult for anyone trying to spend old UTXOs. The idea was also part of UTXO proof stuff anyway. Jorge Timón expressed agreement with the proposal and inquired about potential controversy or opposition to it.</summary>
