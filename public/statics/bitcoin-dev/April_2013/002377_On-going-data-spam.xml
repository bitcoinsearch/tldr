    <summary>In April 2013, a Reddit user reported that someone had uploaded a file upload tool into the blockchain and tried to put the entire amibios source code in it. The same person also uploaded 2.5MB of Wikileaks data, GPG encrypted files, and hidden wiki cp/jb sections. A link was provided to the address used to encrypt the data. Also during this time, vog.github.io/bitcoinproof/ was timestamping data in the blockchain using a simple and efficient method. Despite concerns about harming everyone, people tend to opt for what is easiest.</summary>
