    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient, Hearn made a correction to his previous statement regarding the processing speed of ECDSA on modern cores. He stated that with the sipaspeed patches, ECDSA could potentially be processed at 20,000 signatures per second with full usage of a hyperthreaded quad core CPU. This would mean that it would take just over 4 seconds to process all of them in terms of CPU time.</summary>
