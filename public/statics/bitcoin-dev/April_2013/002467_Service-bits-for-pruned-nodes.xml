    <summary>The message is discussing the importance of Bitcoin being splittable into ranges to ensure that there are enough copies of historic data available. However, this poses a problem as nodes may be willing to contribute 4-39 GB storage, but without structure in place, there will be no good way for them to do so. The solution proposed is to integrate a DHT capable BitTorrent client or call out to some library to solve the issue of finding each other to obtain the data. It is suggested that the Bitcoin network can still be used to bootstrap the BitTorrent DHT.</summary>
