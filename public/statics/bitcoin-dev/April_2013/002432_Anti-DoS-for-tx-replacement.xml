    <summary>In an email conversation between John Dillon and Jeff Garzik, Dillon expresses his concern regarding Gavin's dismissive attitude towards the threat of large attackers. Garzik responds by pointing out that large attackers require a different approach than small-scale attackers. He gives examples of how the community can defend itself against a super-ASIC miner or a large DDoS attack. However, he points out that defense strategies are unlikely to be developed due to a lack of funding for network defense. As a result, the community will have to rely on mutual defense actions in the event of an attack or crisis.</summary>
