    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter Todd discusses the potential issues and limitations with transaction replacement on the Bitcoin network. He notes that while an attack can shut down useful transaction replacement, it is not a problem if the defender is online as they can block further broadcasts by the attacker. However, there still needs to be a way of distinguishing between legitimate and non-legitimate transactions, which can be difficult given the varying settings used by different nodes. Todd suggests that any protocol requiring more than one or two replacements may not be reliable, but acknowledges that some protocols may still be doable. Ultimately, Todd suggests waiting for working code before making any definitive conclusions.</summary>
