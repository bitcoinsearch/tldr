    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, suggests that weakening the non-standard test to give a window of, say, 3 blocks would be fine. However, he believes that there are more pressing technical issues that need to be addressed first before memory pool transaction replacement is considered. These include implementing a memory-limited memory pool with relay policy matching block-creation policy, child-pays-for-parent fees, and auto-computed fees based on transactions moving from the memory pool into blocks. Gavin also notes that he believes there is already a wider memory pool limiter policy in place that would encompass such a thing.</summary>
