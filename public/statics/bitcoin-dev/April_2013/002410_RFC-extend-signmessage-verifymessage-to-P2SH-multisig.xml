    <summary>In a message thread between Luke-Jr and Peter Todd, Todd suggests extending the functionality of signmessage/verifymessage to support messages signed by n-of-m keys or P2SH multisig addresses. However, Luke-Jr suggests that HD wallet changes should be figured out before attempting to extend messaging signing in order to avoid signing with the same private key twice. He suggests creating a new address format to represent a chain of keys rather than one key or combination of keys. Todd agrees and mentions that he has an application where multisig signmessage would be useful.</summary>
