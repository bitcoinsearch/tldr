    <summary>In an email exchange on April 14, 2013, Peter Todd suggested extending the signmessage/verifymessage feature to support messages signed by n-of-m keys, or P2SH multisig addresses. However, in order to ensure privacy and safety, Todd also suggested figuring out HD wallet changes before making any such extensions. This is because it is important to avoid signing with the same private key twice under any circumstances. As a solution, Todd suggested creating a new address format that represents a chain of keys instead of one key or combination of keys.</summary>
