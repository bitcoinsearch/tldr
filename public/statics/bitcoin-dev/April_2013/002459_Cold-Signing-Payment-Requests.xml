    <summary>In an email thread dating back to 25th April 2013, Jeremy Spilman mentioned his plan of writing a prototype using a single cert with a fingerprint of PubKey in the Subject Alternate Name. He also asked Gavin about the best way to work on this by forking his code on Github. However, Gavin reminded him that their bottleneck was code review and testing, which needed to be done before they could ship v1 within the next several months.</summary>
