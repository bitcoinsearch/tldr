    <summary>In an email exchange on April 10th, 2013 between Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd, they discuss the difficulty of paying further funds to a random txout seen on the blockchain. Peter Todd notes that this could lead to a strange situation but it may not be a bad thing. Gregory Maxwell thinks that it is actually a good thing and a property he has wanted for a while. However, Peter Todd warns against getting too hopeful as he fully expects blockchain.info to keep a publicly accessible database of inner-digest -&gt; P2SH addresses, which could potentially still allow for payments to random txouts.</summary>
