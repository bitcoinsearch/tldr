    <summary>In an email thread discussing Bitcoin's susceptibility to denial of service (DoS) attacks, Mike Hearn suggested including bandwidth in the contract. Another member of the conversation pushed back against this idea, arguing that it is not acceptable to require Bitcoin nodes to buy unlimited bandwidth and that prioritization could be a solution. The thread also delved into the possibility of DoS attacks on testnet nodes and the potential for schemes using multiple inputs. One proposal put forth was tx-replacement by fee, which allows unconfirmed transactions to be deemed untrustworthy and enables adjusting fees after the fact. Another suggestion was the implementation of fidelity bonds to provide security guarantees for inter-bank settlements.</summary>
