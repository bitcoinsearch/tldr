    <summary>The discussion revolves around the problem of uneconomical outputs and how to address it using metrics and heuristics. The consensus among developers, except for Mike, is that such outputs should be made non-standard. A patch has been proposed, but there are concerns about its lack of a clear definition for what constitutes an uneconomical output. Gavin highlights a potential backwards compatibility issue with implementing the patch. It is suggested that this issue should be revisited once the payment protocol work is completed, so that users of micropayments-as-messages can migrate off them.</summary>
