    <summary>The user is trying to set up pushpool with bitcoind, but when they connect to pushpool with cpuminer, they receive an error message saying that the JSON-RPC call failed. Upon checking the pushpool server log, they see that there was an upstream RPC error. The user has provided their bitcoind config and pushpool config files. They have tried to change ports and rebooted the server, but nothing seems to be helping.</summary>
