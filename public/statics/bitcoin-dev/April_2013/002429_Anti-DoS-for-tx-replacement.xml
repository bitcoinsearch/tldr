    <summary>The writer of the email argues that nodes can be assigned bandwidth limits to prioritize their usage and thus there is no way convergence can fail. The calculations were based on 10mbit, which is not unlimited. The wider point being made is that attackers use other people's bandwidth for DNS reflection and/or botnets attacks and the attacks on Mt Gox are supposedly 80 gigabit+ which is enough to take out all of the main network simultaneously. The writer agrees that new DoS attacks should be avoided but also emphasizes the need to be realistic about what can be accomplished given that those trying to manipulate Mt Gox could destroy the entire P2P network off the face of the internet with the flick of a switch. Finally, the writer agrees that weakening the non-standard test to give a window of, say, 3 blocks would be fine and Gavin wants some kind of wider memory pool limiter policy that would encompass such a thing already.</summary>
