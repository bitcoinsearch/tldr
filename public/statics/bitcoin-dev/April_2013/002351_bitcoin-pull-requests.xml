    <summary>The context discusses the impossibility of eliminating the risk of downloading a trojaned client for Bitcoin. Even with a secure passphrase, a hacked Windows box will allow the hacker to spend the coins as easily as the owner. Additionally, secondary remote spendauth sigs into the network chain will be similarly compromised. Securely hashchecking the trojaned client is also difficult from cracked userspace on a hacked dll/kernel with uefi backdoor and a trojaned hasher. The author suggests that it's easier for a few developers to meet in person to init and sig a new repo than to try fixing the world's userland and users. This way, something verifiable can be obtained back to the root.</summary>
