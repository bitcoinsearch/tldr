    <summary>The thread is discussing a method to bring Bitcoin and RSA key pairs together, allowing for the unification of digital payments of Bitcoin and other services such as Payswarm and WebID. The proposed solution involves using Bob's WebID to create entropy, producing a BTC address with an ECDSA key pair, sending coins to this address, and encrypting the seed with Bob's public key so he can decrypt it and use it to recreate the wallet and spend the coins, potentially creating a giant ecosystem. Another proposal suggests exporting a private key for a new address generated by the Bitcoin client and sending it encrypted with GPG to Bob, who can then import it into his wallet. However, this method still requires trust between the parties and does not provide a payment mechanism.Alice wants to send 1 BTC to Bob, but they have RSA key pairs and no public Bitcoin addresses. To solve this issue, Alice takes Bob's WebID and encrypts it with her private key to create entropy. She then uses that message as the seed to produce a BTC address with an ECDSA key pair. Alice sends coins to this address and then encrypts the seed again with Bob's public key. Bob decrypts the seed using his private key and can now use the seed to recreate the wallet and spend the coins.A forum user named Craig suggests that generating a new address and exporting the private key is a simpler and more straightforward mechanism than the proposed method. The user further explains that no need exists to send an entire wallet as only one key is needed. Moreover, the method suggested in the original proposal is not a payment mechanism but rather a way for two trusting parties to send Bitcoins without using the Bitcoin network. Both procedures result in joint custody of the BTCs until Bob uses them to spend on another address he controls. The goal is to automate the process of bootstrapping the RSA key community with Bitcoin to make it more accessible to GPG users who may not have a Bitcoin wallet or address. The two different types of digital payments, with Bitcoin using ECDSA and GPG while Payswarm/WebID mostly use RSA, can be brought together to enable Bitcoins to be sent over WebID or Payswarm. Melvin Carvalho believes that this unites the crypto-currency paradigm and web paradigm into one system potentially.</summary>
