    <summary>In an email thread dated 14th April 2013, Peter Todd suggested that signmessage/verifymessage should be extended to support messages signed by n-of-m keys or multisig addresses. He proposed extending the existing header byte format with a new format for multisig signmessage signatures in which each signature or key can be one of three forms: sig, compressed key or uncompressed key. The format is backwards compatible, and the leading byte can be incremented if there is a need for another signature format in the future. Incomplete signatures on messages can be handled by converting pubkeys to signatures, and the RPC signmessage command can be extended with an optional "existing signature" option.In response to this, Alan suggested adding a proper ASCII-armored format for message signing, which would encode the signed message next to the signature to avoid ambiguities about what was signed. This would allow users to copy an ASCII-armored block of text into a client or use a URI-extension and then receive a pop-up window displaying the message along with the valid signature from a particular address. Alan acknowledged that some people may prefer to move away from raw addresses and copy-and-paste, but argued that there is still significant demand for Armory to become compatible with Bitcoin-Qt signing.</summary>
