    <summary>As part of a roadmap for block downloading, the idea of providing an HTTP/HTTPS protocol for block downloading is being considered. This would not only allow web proxies to cache blocks, making it more accessible, but also cater for resumeable downloads. The implementation of this protocol could enhance the overall experience of block downloading and make it more user-friendly.</summary>
