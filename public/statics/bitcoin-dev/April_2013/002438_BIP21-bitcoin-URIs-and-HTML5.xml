    <summary>HTML5 now allows web apps to register themselves for handling URI schemes, such as the bitcoin: URI that is already in use and being extended as part of the payment protocol. However, there is a whitelist of acceptable schemes in the specification for security reasons. The good news is that bitcoin has been added to the whitelist by Hixie, and browser makers should notice the change soon. Ian pointed out some errors in the BIP21 spec, questioning how to amend it, and provided feedback regarding several issues with the syntax. Additionally, the IETF URL specs are being obsoleted by http://url.spec.whatwg.org/, at least for Web purposes.</summary>
