    <summary>The risk of merchants missing payments or having their web servers compromised and refunds redirected are two primary concerns, with the former outweighing the latter if payments are more frequent. However, reliable payment processing with refund handling should be secure but comes at a cost. The failure rate and manual intervention required for recovery impact the cost of missed payments. If wallets broadcast before POST, there is a potential issue of coins being marked as spent but not received. Transmit-After-ACK offers automatic detection and recovery, potentially making it a supported use case in the future. Merchants can choose whether to have a POST URL and decide if the cost of keeping their server up is worth it. Stephan's post on payer-encoded metadata is an example of how newcomers are utilizing Bitcoin technology.</summary>
