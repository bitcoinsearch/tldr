    <summary>Hardware encryption is only effective if it's integrated properly. Fingerprint readers, for example, are often insecure because they present raw fingerprint scans to software instead of hashing them internally for better security. Multisig addresses are a step in the right direction, requiring transactions to be signed off by a hardware security module (HSM). Although repository integrity is important, Bitcoin specialists should focus on improving Bitcoin security measures while other experts work on improving repository security overall. One way to improve repositories is with oddity detection and alerting. Some repos have weak internal verification structures and are susceptible to bitrot. However, some people are working toward better tools and migrating things to create a more secure and auditable open-source world.</summary>
