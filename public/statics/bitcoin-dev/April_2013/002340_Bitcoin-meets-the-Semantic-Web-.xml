    <summary>In an email exchange between Harald Schilly and Melvin Carvalho on April 1, 2013, the discussion centered around creating a "vocabulary" for Bitcoin. Schilly suggested checking existing databases like OKFN and searching for existing vocabularies for payments rather than reinventing it. He provided links to various payment protocols such as http://schema.org/PaymentMethod, http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#PayPal, and http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/search/#s=payment. Carvalho was already familiar with most of this work and planned to reuse as much as possible, but some terms would be Bitcoin specific. He found https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_glossary and wondered where to host it. Schilly gave three ideas for hosting: bitcoin.org, w3id.org, and bitcoin.it wiki.</summary>
