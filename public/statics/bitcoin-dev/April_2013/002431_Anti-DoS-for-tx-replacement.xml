    <summary>In a conversation between John Dillon and Peter Todd, the former questions Gavin's seriousness towards Bitcoin security, specifically against large-scale attackers. Peter responds by saying that Gavin has worked on efforts to ensure Bitcoin is resistant to DoS attacks and spearheaded a move towards better testing, which is particularly helpful against chain-forking bugs. He also led the development of P2SH and current efforts to implement a payment protocol. However, Peter is less convinced about Gavin's stance against attackers that pose a threat to the system as a whole. John Dillon clarifies what the reward is for exactly on the Bitcoin forums. He is willing to pledge $500USD to anyone who writes the core functionality for replacement by fee and a simple 'undo' RPC command. However, he mentions that his programming skills are rusty and asks for someone to clarify whether or not the patch should compute fees recursively. Luke-Jr has written a patch to do this without replacement. Finally, Peter Todd advises John Dillon to clarify if he wants unit-tests and similar things included in the implementation.</summary>
