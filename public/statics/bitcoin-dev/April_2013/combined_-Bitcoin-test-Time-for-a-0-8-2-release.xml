    <summary>The email sender, Gavin Andresen, discusses the consensus in the #bitcoin-dev chat regarding a 0.8.2 release. The team aims to get a final release before the May 15th hard fork deadline, and Pieter has already started going through the issues list. The team welcomes help in testing, debugging, and fixing high-priority issues. They also encourage translation work as it is a great time to do so. However, they still lack a basic QA checklist for testing of release candidates. Gavin commits to spending some of the remaining "Bitcoin Testing Project" bitcoins to whoever contributes to creating one.In other news, Arklan Uth Oslin shares two quotes expressing his views on life. The email writer apologizes for being unable to help due to significant life events taking up their free time.</summary>
