    <summary>Bitcoin uses DER-encoded signatures in its transactions, however, OpenSSL accepts more than the strict DER specification. As a result, a rule is being introduced to make such non-standard signatures invalid. To accomplish this, all clients on the network must stop creating these. In an effort to monitor transactions containing non-standard signatures, 1.4 million transactions were observed and it was found that 9,641 of them contained at least one non-standard signature. A list of the top addresses that had coins used as inputs in such transactions can be found in the provided link. The author of the post requests that anyone recognizing any of these addresses or having information about their owners or software usage should contact him.</summary>
