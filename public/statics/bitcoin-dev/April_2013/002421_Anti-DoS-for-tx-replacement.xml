    <summary>In an email thread, John Dillon questions Gavin Andresen's stance on Bitcoin security, suggesting that if he doesn't take it seriously, people should know. However, another member of the thread points out that Gavin has spent a lot of time and effort ensuring Bitcoin is resistant to DoS attacks and spearheaded moves towards better testing and payment protocol implementation. There is some disagreement about Gavin's stance against attackers posing a threat to the system as a whole. Finally, someone offers $500USD to anyone who implements strict replacement by fee functionality and a simple 'undo' RPC command. Clarification is needed regarding whether the patch should compute fees recursively and include unit tests.</summary>
