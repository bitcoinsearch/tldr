    <summary>In a discussion between Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell in 2013, they discuss the possibility of using P2SH to provide the full 256 bits. However, it is noted that no one uses P2SH addresses yet anyway. They discuss keeping the length at 160bits and propose a new scriptPubKey: OP_HASH160 OP_HASH160 OP_EQUALVERIFY. It is suggested that there is no need to change the address type if new software is written to check for both forms of txout. This means that a P2SH address could actually mean one of two scriptPubKey forms, much like a normal address can mean either the hashed or bare OP_CHECKSIG form. However, this may make it difficult to pay further funds to a random txout seen on the blockchain.</summary>
