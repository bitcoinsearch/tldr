    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed the idea of pruning nodes, which would fully validate and relay blocks and transactions but not keep historic blocks. To ensure new and old nodes can find peers to synchronize from, two extra service bits were suggested: NODE_VALIDATE and NODE_BLOCKS_2016. The former would relay and validate blocks and transactions but only answer getdata requests for recently relayed blocks, transactions, and mempool transactions. The latter could be queried for the last 2016 blocks without guaranteeing relaying/validating new blocks and transactions. NODE_NETWORK would imply NODE_VALIDATE and guarantee the availability of all historic blocks. Pieter plans to write a BIP to formalize this proposal.</summary>
