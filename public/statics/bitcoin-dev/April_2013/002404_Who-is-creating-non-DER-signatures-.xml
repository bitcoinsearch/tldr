    <summary>In an email dated April 7, 2013, Pieter Wuille informed the Bitcoin community that he had monitored all transactions for the past few weeks and found that 9641 of them contained at least one non-standard signature. He provided a link to a list of the top addresses that had coins used as inputs in such transactions and requested anyone with knowledge of these addresses or their owners to let him know. Wuille acknowledged that reducing this number without significant effort would be difficult. He stressed that making these non-standard encodings invalid on the network would require pretty much every full node implementation to depend on OpenSSL to guarantee compatibility or make assumptions about which deviations are allowed. The question then arises as to at which transaction frequency it is acceptable to move forward with this. Wuille suggests that the first step is to not accept these transactions into memory pools but leave them valid inside blocks. Actual network rules will need to be established later. However, even just not accepting them into memory pools will make it very hard (if not impossible) for the buggy clients that create transactions to get any confirmations.</summary>
