    <summary>Jeff Garzik, the founder of Bitcoin Watch and a software engineer at BitPay, has expressed his openness towards a blacklist for Bitcoin transactions, but only if it's done in an open manner. He believes that storing big data transactions is not the primary purpose of Bitcoin, and the community would agree with him on this. The developer consensus seems to be that uneconomical outputs should be made non-standard, and there should be metrics and heuristics to tackle this problem. One approach suggested by Garzik is to block uneconomic UTXO creation. He hopes to see a stopgap solution to data spam in 0.8.2 as it is a clear and present problem.</summary>
