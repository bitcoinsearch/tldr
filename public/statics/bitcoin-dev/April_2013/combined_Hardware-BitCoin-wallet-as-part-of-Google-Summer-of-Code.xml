    <summary>Crypto Stick has been accepted as a mentor organization for Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2013, with one of their project ideas being the development of a physical Bitcoin wallet based on the Smart Card Wallet concept. Interested students can apply for the project and if accepted, mentors will work with them over the summer while Google sponsors with USD 5000 during that time. However, Peter Todd cautions that hardware Bitcoin wallets would require a display so the wallet can show where the coins being signed are being sent. He also noted that support for the upcoming payment protocol would be necessary so the wallet can verify that the address is actually the intended recipient's address.The current Crypto Stick hardware does not have a button for user interaction, which makes it unsuitable for this purpose. PGP smart cards and USB keys already face this problem, but the consequences of signing the wrong document are usually less severe than sending funds to a thief. Todd further explained that hardware security for private keys is important, but its protections are limited. Despite his caution, Todd expressed excitement at the possibility of ECC key support being added to the Crypto Stick in the future.The original post included a link to the opencryptotoken project, which offers ECC capabilities and is based on an Atmel microcontroller. The poster suggested that adding a display to it would be straightforward. The email thread also included a promotion for New Relic, a SaaS-based application performance monitoring service. Students interested in applying must be enrolled in an accredited institution or university and submit their applications through Google Melange by May 3rd. Links to Crypto Stick project, Ideas Page, GSOC Program F&amp;Q, and Crypto Stick Mailing List are provided.</summary>
