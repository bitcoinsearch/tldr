    <summary>On April 13, 2013, Gregory Maxwell expressed concern that Bitcoin's network might eventually be unable to handle transactions due to non-standard encodings. A patch was merged into git head to enforce strict encodings for accepting transactions into the memory pool, but it is likely that some such transactions will still make it into blocks until miners and other nodes upgrade. When the rate of non-standard encodings in the block chain has dropped sufficiently, a soft forking change may be scheduled to make strict encodings required, at which point the network rules will no longer depend on OpenSSL's parsers.The rules currently enforced for acceptance into the memory pool are as follows: evaluated scripts will undergo strict encoding rules, while public keys must be either compressed or uncompressed - the non-standard "hybrid" encoding supported by OpenSSL is not allowed. Signatures are also strictly DER-encoded, with no padding allowed before or after the hashtype byte. These rules apply to testnet as well.</summary>
