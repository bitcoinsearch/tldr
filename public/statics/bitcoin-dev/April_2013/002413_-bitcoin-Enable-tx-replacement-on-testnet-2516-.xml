    <summary>On April 15, 2013, Pieter Wuille proposed keeping a counter in the mempool to remember the sum of the sizes of all replacements a transaction has had. However, this approach only counts network and processing overhead but not blockchain or UTXO burdening. The author further discusses the flaws in zero-conf transactions, such as consensus failure due to limited mempool size or bandwidth, and emphasizes the need to change relay rules so that transactions are replaced based on fees regardless of how that changes transaction outputs. This would allow for secure applications of transaction replacement and also solve the issue of users getting their transactions stuck with few options to fix them. The author also mentions working on a trusted-third-party ledger design that would allow tx-replacement by nSequence.</summary>
