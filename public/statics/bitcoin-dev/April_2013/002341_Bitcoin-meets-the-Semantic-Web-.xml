    <summary>During a discussion on April 1st, 2013 about hosting schemas for Bitcoin on the internet, Melvin Carvalho suggested using bitcoin.org, but noted that it lacked https and Github does not allow for setting mime types. Another participant in the discussion suggested using a subdomain such as schema.bitcoin.org to point to an independently run server for the files. The suggestion was made to address the issue of security and effective management of the files.</summary>
