    <summary>In a discussion about using BitTorrent to download the Bitcoin blockchain, John Dillon suggests that building the system incrementally would be more efficient than having one in a thousand nodes serve up the needed part of the chain overnight. He also notes that BitTorrent's DHT provides access to tens of petabytes worth of data while the Bitcoin blockchain cannot grow beyond 57GiB per year. In regards to the initial download, a website called blockchainbymail.com is recommended as an option.</summary>
