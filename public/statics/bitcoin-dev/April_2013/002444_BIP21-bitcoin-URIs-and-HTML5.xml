    <summary>On April 24, 2013, Mike Hearn wrote about HTML5 allowing web apps to register themselves for handling URI schemes, such as the bitcoin: URI that is already in use and being extended as part of the payment protocol. However, there is a whitelist of acceptable schemes in the spec for security reasons. The good news is that bitcoin was added to the whitelist by Hixie, and within a few months, most users should have browsers that can accept bitcoin as a web-app handleable protocol scheme. Furthermore, Ian pointed out some errors in the BIP21 spec. The process for amending the BIP was questioned, whether to create a new one and mark the old one as replaced or just fix it in place given the relatively exotic nature of most of the issues. The IETF URL specs are also being obsoleted by http://url.spec.whatwg.org/, at least for Web purposes. It was noted that the IANA application will be improved if there is evidence of bitcoin being used. Additionally, work on improving the URL spec is always welcome, as it is the value proposition of the Web.</summary>
