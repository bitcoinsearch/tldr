    <summary>In an email conversation on April 24, 2013 between Gavin Andresen and Ian, some errors in the BIP21 spec were pointed out. Gavin inquired about the process for amending the BIP and whether a new one needed to be created or if they could just fix it in place. He suggested that the issues were bugs in the BIP and should just be fixed without creating a new one. He also mentioned that corrections are fine, especially those that are not gratuitously incompatible.</summary>
