    <summary>In a message sent by Alan Reiner, he mentioned the need to add an ASCII-armored format for message signing. He suggested that anything that encodes the signed message next to the signature would be more efficient in eliminating ambiguities about what was signed. He also suggested that the bare signatures could still be kept as an option for backward compatibility but offer the ASCII-armored format as the primary one. The desired result was to have the user copy an ASCII-armored block of text into the client, and the app pops up with a window that says "The following message has a valid signature from address 1XKjf32kJbf...". Another contributor, Peter Todd, responded to the thread stating that he had already looked into ASCII-armoring PGP style for a different project. He suggested following RFC2440, section 7 "Cleartext signature framework." He provided an example of how it could be done in the message attachment and mentioned that there might be an issue passing \r's through the RPC interface; the RFC specifies CRLF line endings.</summary>
