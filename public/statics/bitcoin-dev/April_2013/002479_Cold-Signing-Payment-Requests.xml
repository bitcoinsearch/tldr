    <summary>The company offers automatic refunds, whereby bitcoins that arrive after an offer has expired are returned to a specified bitcoin-address. This is particularly useful for web wallets that do not immediately broadcast transactions. The process happens a few times every day and can amount to several hundred bitcoins per offer. There is concern about the potential impact on merchants who offer large, automatic refunds, but it is unclear how common this would be in reality. Timo's protocol is considered an interesting solution, but due to the locked-down feature set for version one, it is unlikely to be implemented at this point.</summary>
