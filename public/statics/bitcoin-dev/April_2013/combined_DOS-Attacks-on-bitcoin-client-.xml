    <summary>Oliver Egginger, a user of the Bitcoin-qt client version 0.8.1, has reported to developers that other nodes are producing an enormous amount of traffic on occasion while using the client. The developers have responded by saying that new users of the reference client downloading the whole blockchain from peers are causing this issue due to the lack of a throttling mechanism. They suggested trying QoS on your router or using the -nolisten command line flag as solutions. Jeff Garzik, former employee at Bitcoin Core and current CEO of enterprise blockchain company Bloq, suggests using the blockchain torrent found on the Bitcointalk forum as a way to reduce download bandwidth used from P2P networks.On April 7th, 2013, a user named Scott Howard also raised concerns about the lack of a throttling mechanism in the reference client. He suggested trying QoS on your router or using the -nolisten command line flag as solutions to avoid consuming too much bandwidth. Oliver expressed his gratitude towards Scott Howard for his quick help and said that he had successfully downloaded the blockchain again after making a clean start due to the new database structure.Oliver, experiencing large amounts of traffic from other nodes on occasion, has briefly viewed the issue with tshark but has not had time to investigate thoroughly. Inquiring if anything is known about DOS-Attacks, he has been restarting the client in hopes of avoiding the node causing the traffic.</summary>
