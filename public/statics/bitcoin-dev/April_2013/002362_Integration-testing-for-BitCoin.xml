    <summary>A user has recently purchased some Bitcoins and noticed that there are no integration tests for Bitcoin, which he feels is important for the future of the cryptocurrency. He has written a short document outlining what he believes would be the safest way to test the code base and has shared it on GitHub. The proposed integration testing aims to make the code easier to refactor while increasing the guarantee that it doesn't break the overall behaviour of the client. It will also make it easier to have multiple coins in the codebase without breaking the original BitCoin protocol and allow easy testing of attack scenarios. The proposed implementation will use the JSON-RPC interface to build up as much verification of the BitCoin network as possible. This implementation will be written in C++, making it easier to move to the second implementation. The second implementation will use the same interface, but will use the BitCoin code directly and require the refactoring of the client as a library to get rid of global variables. Dependency injection will be used for time and verifying a mined block to enable faster running of tests without using real CPU power for mining.</summary>
