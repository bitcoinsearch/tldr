    <summary>In an email conversation from 2013, Peter Todd and an unknown individual discuss the odd side-effect of making it difficult to pay further funds to a random transaction output seen on the blockchain. Despite this being strange, it is not necessarily a bad thing. The unknown individual expresses their agreement with Peter Todd and notes that they have previously lamented not knowing how to achieve this property. No further information about the context or reason for their discussion is provided.</summary>
