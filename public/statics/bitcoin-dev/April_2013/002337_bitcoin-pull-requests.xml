    <summary>Upon reviewing a discussion on bitcointalk.org, it was brought up that there may be a potential attack vector in Git due to its use of SHA1. There is concern that an innocuous pull request could potentially generate a file with a backdoor/nonce combination that goes unnoticed. The poster acknowledges that this issue may have been discussed before and is seeking further insight.</summary>
