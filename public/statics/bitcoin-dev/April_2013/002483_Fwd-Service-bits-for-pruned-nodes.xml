    <summary>Rebroad from sourceforge suggested an HTTP/HTTPS protocol for block downloading as part of a roadmap for block downloading. This would allow web proxies to cache blocks and make it more accessible while also catering for resumeable downloads. Jeff Garzik, in response, has always supported finding new and creative ways to store and transmit blocks. However, he did mention issues with large files when using HTTP and the need for a well-defined HTTP-retrievable layout with proper headers for web caches to function properly. He emphasized the need for HTTP byte range support, HTTP 1.1 keep-alives, and other features for resuming large, interrupted downloads. Garzik suggested using the format currently used by bitcoind for raw data, limiting the size to below 1GB, and adding a small metadata download to serve the raw block files.</summary>
