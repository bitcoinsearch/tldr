    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in April 2013, Gregory Maxwell expressed his opinion about the idea of using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) blockchain or Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) list for clients. He stated that while he liked the idea, he did not think that the reference client was the appropriate place for it. Instead, he suggested that it would be an interesting experimental project. John Dillon had raised the possibility of using BitTorrent to address the issue of offering storage capacity, but Maxwell disagreed with this approach for several reasons. He argued that tracker-less torrents do not work well in practice and that it's crucial to avoid making the process of offering more storage any more complicated. Additionally, bittorrent is blocked on many networks and is often associated with illegal copying. Instead, Maxwell believed that nodes should be able to advertise what parts of the chain they have and that adding the ability to add ranges to address messages would be a better solution. There were concerns about network exposed attack surfaces if a DHT capable BitTorrent client was integrated, and Maxwell recommended revising the address message format to support I2P peers.</summary>
