    <summary>The author's hope for bitcoinj based wallets is to have automatic updates with threshold signatures, combined with regular audits of initial downloads for new users. This would result in a safe system that is immune to rogue developers. The use of hardware security modules (HSM) for multisig addresses is suggested, but the author notes that it is only effective if the crypto is done within the hardware and the hardware can be trusted. Repository integrity is also discussed as a general problem applicable to many things, and the need for strong repo structures is highlighted for better auditing of the BTC codebase. The lack of verification structures in some repos is noted, along with issues of filesystems that accept bitrot. The need for oddity detection and alerting in repository security is also emphasized. Finally, the author suggests that improvements in these areas could bring about a stronger audit trail for the open-source world in the future.</summary>
