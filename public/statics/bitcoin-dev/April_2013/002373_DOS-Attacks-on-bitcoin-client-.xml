    <summary>On April 7th, 2013, a user named Scott Howard raised concerns about the lack of throttling mechanism in the reference client used for downloading the whole blockchain from peers. Due to this issue, users could consume their bandwidth quickly. However, he suggested that users can try QoS on their router or use the -nolisten command line flag to avoid this problem. Oliver, another user, responded that he had made a clean start due to the new database structure and had successfully downloaded the Blockchain again. He expressed gratitude towards Scott Howard for his quick help and said that he would return if the issue occurred again.</summary>
