    <summary>In a message from 2013, Pieter Wuille discussed the matter of network rules regarding transaction generators. He stated that not accepting them into memory pools would make it difficult for buggy clients creating transactions to get confirmations. Although 0.6% of transactions affected by these rules may not seem like much at 9600 transactions, without knowing how they are created, it is unclear what the damage is. Wuille speculated that if these transactions were being created by hardware wallets with unchangeable keys, then the harm would be more significant. However, he believed this was unlikely at the time. If the network doesn't stop relaying these transactions, Wuille believes it is inevitable that harm will occur.Despite this, all of these transactions can still be mutated to an acceptable form. Malleability is one argument for removing support for non-canonical encodings. Therefore, Wuille suggested posting a transaction normalizer tool that people could use to fix their transactions without having to ask developers for help.</summary>
