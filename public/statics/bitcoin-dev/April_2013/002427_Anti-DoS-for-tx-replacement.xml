    <summary>In a discussion about the possibility of double-spending in Bitcoin, a user suggests that if a defender is online, they can broadcast the highest sequence numbered transaction, which blocks further broadcasts by the attacker. The transactions can be ordered by the highest version seen before signature checking. The user intends to make a prototype for themselves using bitcoinj, and has successfully replaced a transaction on their own testnet. They are also planning to submit a patch to make it easier for others to play with it, but haven't got the whole thing working yet.</summary>
