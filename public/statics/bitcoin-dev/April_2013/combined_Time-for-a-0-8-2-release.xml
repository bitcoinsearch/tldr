    <summary>The Bitcoin developer community has agreed to release version 0.8.2 of the software, aimed at addressing important bugs before the May 15th deadline for a hard fork. Pieter is currently going through the issues list and welcomes assistance with testing and debugging. Gavin Andresen will also be reviewing the issues list and marking any that he thinks need fixing with the '0.8.2' milestone. The community is looking for translators to help with the new version. However, there is currently no basic QA checklist for testing release candidates. Gavin has pledged to use some of the remaining "Bitcoin Testing Project" bitcoins as a reward for anyone who contributes towards creating one.</summary>
