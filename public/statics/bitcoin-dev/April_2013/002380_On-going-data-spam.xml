    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Mike Hearn on April 9th, 2013, the two discussed potential hacks to the Bitcoin protocol. Hearn suggested a way to prevent spamming by allowing nodes to serve up blocks encrypted under a random key that is only given upon finishing the download. However, Todd noted that this would make bringing up a new node dependent on other nodes having consistent uptimes, which could be problematic for those with low-bandwidth connections. The conversation then turned to Bloom filtering and the possibility of blacklists for "abusive" transactions, but Todd was against the idea of blacklists altogether. The discussion ended with both parties acknowledging the potential problem of spammers finding ways to encode harmful content within the blockchain, which could pose a threat to law enforcement. They agreed that mitigation efforts may be necessary in the future.</summary>
