    <summary>Mike Hearn proposed a hack to change the protocol, where nodes could serve blocks encrypted under a random key. However, bringing up a new node would depend on other nodes having consistent uptimes, especially for those with low-bandwidth connections. Peter Todd rejected the idea of using blacklists for Bloom filtering, which would require users to fully download a block rather than select transactions with a filter. He emphasized that there should be no blacklists. A digital signature was attached to the email.</summary>
