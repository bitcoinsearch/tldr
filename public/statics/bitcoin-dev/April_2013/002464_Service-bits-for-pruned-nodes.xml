    <summary>The discussion is about the representation of a policy of keeping the last N blocks for any given node. Disconnecting in case something is requested that isn't served seems like an acceptable behavior, and a specific message indicating data is pruned may be more flexible but complex to handle. The splitting of storage/bandwidth nodes that just keep the blockchain around from others that validate it is discussed as these may be handled by different implementations over time. These are independent functions that could be thought about as such. The suggestion is that with a "last N blocks" in addr messages, such nodes could set their advertised history to zero and not have to deal with serving blocks to nodes. However, if you have a node that serves the chain but doesn't validate it, how does it know what the best chain is?</summary>
