    <summary>On April 15, 2013, Pieter Wuille proposed a new approach to keeping track of transaction replacements in the mempool. This approach involved keeping a counter that remembers the sum of the sizes of all replacements a transaction has had. However, this proposal only counts network and processing overhead but not blockchain or UTXO burdening.The author also discussed the flaws in zero-conf transactions, which can lead to consensus failure due to limited mempool size or bandwidth. To address this issue, the author emphasized the need to change relay rules so that transactions are replaced based on fees regardless of how that changes transaction outputs. This would allow for secure applications of transaction replacement and also solve the issue of users getting their transactions stuck with few options to fix them.Additionally, the author mentioned working on a trusted-third-party ledger design that would allow tx-replacement by nSequence. Overall, the proposed changes aim to improve the efficiency and security of transactions on the blockchain.</summary>
