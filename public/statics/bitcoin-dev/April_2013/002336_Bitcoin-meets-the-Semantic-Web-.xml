    <summary>The individual is currently involved in transferring crypto currencies to the semantic web. By doing so, pages can be made machine-readable, which will enable new types of innovation and allow for the dissemination of bitcoin knowledge to a broader audience. The first step towards this goal is to establish a vocabulary specific to bitcoin, similar to a dictionary, that can be written in a machine-readable format known as RDF. The person is seeking help from others who may have experience creating a glossary for bitcoin or know of a human-readable glossary that they can use as a reference. A link to a relevant forum thread has also been provided.</summary>
