    <summary>In an email thread dated April 7th, 2013, Mike Hearn requested more information on how signatures were invalid. Pieter replied stating that the majority of invalid signatures (~90%) had negative R or S values which are interpreted as unsigned by OpenSSL. However, if the top byte has its highest bit set, it must be preceded by a 0x00 according to DER. A smaller number of invalid signatures used excessively padded R or S values with a 0x00 in front when it's not necessary. Additionally, there were four signatures with an incorrect length marker in the beginning which likely means they contain some garbage at the end.</summary>
