    <summary>In a discussion about Timo's proposal for protecting refund addresses, Gavin Andresen outlined two risks. The first is the possibility of a merchant's web server being compromised, allowing an attacker to redirect refunds. The second risk is that merchants may miss payments because they miss a POST to the payment_url. If payments are more common than refunds, the second risk will outweigh the first. Andresen also noted that if an attacker were to compromise the front-end web server, they would probably just generate plain-old pay-to-bitcoin-address payment requests and hope for customers to pay them directly before discovery.</summary>
