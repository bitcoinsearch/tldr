    <summary>On 24th April 2013, Mike Hearn wrote that HTML5 allows web apps to register themselves for handling URI schemes, such as the bitcoin: URI that is already in use and being extended as part of the payment protocol. A whitelist of acceptable schemes exists in the spec for security reasons. Yesterday, he talked to Hixie about it and he added bitcoin to the whitelist. Within a few months, most users should have browsers that can accept bitcoin as a web-app handleable protocol scheme. Regarding BIP21 spec, Ian pointed out some errors in the BIP21 spec. The BNF doesn't say what its character set is (presumably it's Unicode). Bitcoin params production doesn't define the separator. In theory, the syntax is ...?label=foomessage=fooother=foo (rather than ...?label=foo&amp;message=foo etc). The syntax allows ?amount=FOO&amp;amount=1.1, since other param matches any name followed by any value, including "amount" followed by a bogus value. "pchar" is referenced without definition. The simpler syntax is just wrong. The IETF URL specs are being obsoleted by http://url.spec.whatwg.org/, at least for Web purposes.</summary>
