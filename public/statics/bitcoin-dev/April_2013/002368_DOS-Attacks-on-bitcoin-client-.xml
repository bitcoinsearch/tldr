    <summary>Oliver, a user of the bitcoin-qt client (version 0.8.1), has been experiencing large amounts of traffic from other nodes on occasion. Though he has not had time to investigate thoroughly, he has briefly viewed the issue with tshark. To address the problem, Oliver has been restarting the client in hopes of avoiding the node causing the traffic. He reaches out to inquire if anything is known about DOS-Attacks.</summary>
