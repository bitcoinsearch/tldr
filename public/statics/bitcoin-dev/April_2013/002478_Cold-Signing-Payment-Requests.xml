    <summary>The threat of a malware-compromised host with a wallet capable of signing transactions and understanding the payment protocol is a real one. In such a scenario, a virus on the host could swap the refund address for one owned by the attacker and attempt to make the merchant issue an automatic refund, resulting in funds bouncing back to the attacker. This could be a concern if merchants offer large automatic refunds, though it's unclear how common that is. While Timo's protocol offers a potential solution, the feature set for v1 is currently locked down.</summary>
