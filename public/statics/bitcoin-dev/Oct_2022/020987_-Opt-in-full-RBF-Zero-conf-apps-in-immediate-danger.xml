    <summary>Dario from Muun wallet has raised concerns regarding the latest Bitcoin Core release candidate and its opt-in full-RBF deployment. While opt-in full-RBF was a welcomed addition, Dario argues that it poses a problem for zero-conf apps like Muun, which accept on-chain payments from untrusted parties. Under full-RBF, all incoming transactions will be subjected to an opt-in RBF flag, meaning they could be replaced at any time, making zero-conf applications susceptible to attack. Dario suggests delaying the opt-in deployment and finding a safer way to deploy full-RBF. Full-RBF adoption works on three different layers: transaction application layer, transaction relaying layer, and transaction mining layer. An application cannot control whether a replacement to an incoming transaction is relayed via full-RBF.Full-RBF breaks other more subtle things in many wallets, including mental models for unconfirmed incoming transactions and block explorers as payment receipts. Muun is still several months away from being production-ready and would have to turn off outgoing lightning payments for +100k monthly active users, which is a good chunk of all users making non-custodial lightning payments today.</summary>
