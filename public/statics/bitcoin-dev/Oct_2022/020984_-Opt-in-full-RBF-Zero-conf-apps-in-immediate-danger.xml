    <summary>Dario from Muun Wallet is reviewing the latest Bitcoin Core release candidate and noticed that zero-conf apps like Muun must immediately turn off their zero-conf features. David A. Harding responds to Dario's email, pointing out two RBF-related items in the current release notes draft. The first item allows a transaction without a BIP125 signal to be replaced but is disabled by default. The second item makes the wallet default to opt-in RBF on transactions it creates. The "activation" of full-RBF after deployment works when enough relay nodes are running full-RBF. While there have been forks of Bitcoin Core running full-RBF for a while, most nodes are running Bitcoin Core, so adding an opt-in flag (ie. off by default) would increase adoption. However, if the opt-in flag doesn't gain enough adoption, then it won't meet its objective of allowing nodes participating in multi-party funding protocols to assume they can rely on full-RBF. If it does gain enough adoption, then zero-conf applications will be at severe risk.</summary>
