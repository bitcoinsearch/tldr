    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev thread, there was a discussion about the removal of the option for full replace-by-fee (RBF) in Bitcoin Core. Some arguments against full RBF were presented, but it was noted that they were debatable and not fully convincing reasons to remove the option entirely. The discussion then turned to whether users should have the ability to prevent someone else's transaction from propagating using datacarrier, datacarriersize, and permitbaremultisig options. It was pointed out that while others may propagate the transaction, users don't want to waste their own bandwidth doing so. A distinction was also made between the two policies - with RBF, resources have already been spent propagating the first transaction.</summary>
