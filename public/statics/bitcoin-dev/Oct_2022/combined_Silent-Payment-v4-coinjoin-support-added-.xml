    <summary>Silent Payment v4 has been released with significant improvements. The latest version aims to increase privacy and compatibility with coinjoin. One of the major improvements is that the new version uses all inputs to create transactions, unlike the previous version which only used the first input. This change was made to enhance privacy. Additionally, the `getspaddress` RPC has been renamed to `getsilentaddress` for clarity.Furthermore, support for silent payment in PSBT via the `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPC has been added. A new index scheme has also been introduced which stores the sum of input public keys for each transaction. The new version also uses a different scheme for silent payments that allows for Taproot inputs. However, this introduced a new issue as `bitcoin-core/secp256k1` does not support x-only public key sum, possibly due to a missing prefix byte. To resolve this issue, a new PR (#1143) has been opened to add a function to convert from x-only to compressed public key with even y. The tutorial has been updated accordingly, and a warning has been included in the output for `getsilentaddress` RPC when used with a label. These changes are expected to enhance privacy and compatibility with coinjoin. It is recommended that users update to Silent Payment v4 to take advantage of these improvements.The message thanking the recipient for their work on silent payments and improvements made in each version was sent with Proton Mail secure email. A link is also provided for reference.</summary>
