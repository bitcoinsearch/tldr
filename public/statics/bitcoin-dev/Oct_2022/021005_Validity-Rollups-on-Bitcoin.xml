    <summary>In an email conversation on October 12, 2022, Greg Sanders asked if there was a one-page cheat sheet of "asks" for transaction introspection/OP_ZKP and their uses for different rollup architectures. However, it was mentioned that they did not have such a cheat sheet yet. Trey Del Bonis had written a more detailed technical post about how those components would be used in a validity rollup, which was cited in a report and can be found at https://tr3y.io/articles/crypto/bitcoin-zk-rollups.html. It was mentioned that it would require more research and design work to suss out the details asked by Sanders and put them into a concise cheatsheet. Nonetheless, the idea was appreciated.</summary>
