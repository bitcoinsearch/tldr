    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin standards, Eric Voskuil suggested that BIPs were created to ensure that Bitcoin development is discussed out in the open. However, ajtowns argued that posting development ideas to the list is not sufficient these days and proposed collaborating on a proposal to update Bitcoin's P2P protocol versioning, which he had been working on for some time. Eric criticized ajtowns' proposal, saying that it seemed like he had only put 10 minutes of thought into it, but ajtowns defended his public proposal and argued that more courtesy and arrogance could be useful. Overall, the discussion highlighted the value of public collaboration and the need for improved Bitcoin standards.</summary>
