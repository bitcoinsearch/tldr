    <summary>In a recent email exchange between Eric Voskuil and Anthony Towns, Eric argued that protocol cannot be defined on an ad-hoc basis as a "courtesy." However, Anthony reminded him that Bitcoin standards were being discussed and developed behind closed doors, so the BIP process was created to preempt such centralization. Eric also expressed his dissatisfaction with Bitcoin's P2P protocol versioning, but did not prioritize working on a proposal to update it. When Anthony suggested a potential solution, Eric criticized it for being poorly thought out. Anthony then accused corporate and state-funded Bitcoin Core developers of aggressively and self-servingly working to put a stop to community efforts, and cited MIT Digital Currency Initiative's partnership with the Bank of England on a central bank digital currency research project as a potential conflict of interest. He also mentioned that Joichi Ito, the former director of MIT's Media Lab who established the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT, resigned in 2019 after The New Yorker published an investigation into his attempts to conceal financial contributions from Jeffrey Epstein. Despite acknowledging Eric's contributions to Bitcoin development, Anthony criticized his arrogance.</summary>
