    <summary>On October 7th, 2022, Dario Sneidermanis contacted the bitcoin-dev group regarding an opt-in flag for full-RBF from #25353. However, it was not clear to Pieter why Dario believed that merging this particular pull request posed an immediate risk to him. Others explained that it was only a configuration option that is default off and the possibility of running full-RBF policy nodes on the network have been trivial for anyone who wanted to for a long time on the network. Pieter did not want to dismiss Dario's concerns but was not convinced that he was actually aware of what this PR does and doesn't do.</summary>
