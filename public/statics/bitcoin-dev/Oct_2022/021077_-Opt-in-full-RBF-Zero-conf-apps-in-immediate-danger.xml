    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave proposed incremental steps between opt-in only (BIP125) and replace anything full RBF. By treating any transaction with a txid ending in `0x1` as replaceable, they could see if miners are willing to enable unsignaled RBF. This would also allow them to gather more evidence on how the change affects zeroconf businesses and everyday users without requiring immediate and huge changes. Wallet authors opposing unsignaled RBF can opt-out by grinding their txids until full RBF is accomplished. The percentage of transactions subject to unsignaled RBF can be increased in later releases of Bitcoin Core, steadily moving towards full RBF without sudden leaps. However, this proposal does not directly solve the problems with non-replaceable transactions suffered by contract protocols since adversaries can opt-out of this scheme by grinding their txid. Dave believes that transitioning slowly when people are still depending on previous behaviors has its advantages. Anthony Towns and Sergej Kotliar were part of the email thread and acknowledged the numbers presented by AJ in a previous email. They suggested that 25% of payments already get a sub-par experience, going full rbf would bump that from 25% to 85%, which would be pretty terrible.</summary>
