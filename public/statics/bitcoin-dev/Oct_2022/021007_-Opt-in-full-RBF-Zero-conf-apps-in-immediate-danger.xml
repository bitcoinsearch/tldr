    <summary>Pieter Wuille commented on the opt-in flag for full-RBF from #25353, stating that adding the flag is a likely step towards the full RBF policy becoming more widely adopted on the network. However, he also believes that it is unlikely that the opt-in flag alone would be enough to migrate the network at large to full-RBF and that a full-RBF network is not only inevitable but also desirable. Pieter proposed a deployment strategy for full-RBF that takes into account experimentation and gives a clear timeline for any affected application to adapt. He suggested activating opt-in full-RBF on testnet now and committing to a block height in the future at which opt-out full-RBF will activate on mainnet. This proposal allows for experimentation, testing, and socializing the notion that developers believe it is time. If adoption of the flag does occur, it poses a threat to zero-conf applications as users will be at substantial risk.</summary>
