    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ruben Somsen proposed a method for recipients to sign their public keys as a form of authentication, which would make communication of addresses more secure. However, Bryan Bishop pointed out that it is still necessary to ensure the public key itself is securely communicated. Ruben suggested that the only meaningful distinction is whether or not Bob runs the Trustless Address Server himself, and that in either case, Bob should deposit a batch of signed keys to the server to prevent malicious addresses from being handed out. Ruben referred to his earlier discussion on the Trustless Address Server design in a podcast and presentation at Tabconf. In response to Ruben's proposal, Bryan questioned if copy-pasting pubkeys instead of an address would pose the same problem.</summary>
