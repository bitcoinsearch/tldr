    <summary>Muun wallet has been reviewing the latest bitcoin core release candidate and realized that zero-conf apps like theirs must immediately turn off their zero-conf features. Dario from Muun wallet mentioned that they had at least a year from the initial opt-in deployment until opt-out was deployed, giving them enough time to adapt Muun to the new policies. However, there seems to be some confusion regarding two RBF-related items in the current release notes draft. The first item allows a transaction without a BIP125 signal to be replaced but is set to disabled by default. The second item only affects Bitcoin Core's wallet and transactions created with it through the RPC interface. Those transactions will now default to signaling BIP125 replacability. This option has been default false for many years for the RPC, but for the GUI it's been default true since Bitcoin Core 0.16. All the release does is give Bitcoin Core RPC users by default the same settings long used for GUI users and introduce an option that those who object to non-signalled RBF will later be able to use to disable their relay of non-signalled replacements. Therefore, nothing in Bitcoin Core 24.0 RC1 significantly changes the current situation related to transaction replacability.</summary>
