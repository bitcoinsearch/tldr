    <summary>The email discusses research conducted on nLocktime and nVersion used by open source Bitcoin wallets. The author states that most wallets use nVersion 2 and that nLocktime for Bitcoin Core, Knots, Electrum, Sparrow, and Specter is nearest block height. However, nLocktime for Bitcoin Core/Knots is zero by default if the transaction is created manually using RPC commands like createpsbt or createrawtransaction. The blog post emphasizes wallet fingerprinting with nLocktime and nVersion, which can be used to identify the wallet used for a transaction. The author suggests that more wallets should have the same nVersion and nLocktime to make it difficult to identify the wallets used for a transaction. The email includes links to relevant tools and resources, including a tool built by Andrew Chow to check if a transaction was created using Bitcoin Core or Electrum, and a blog post by '0xb10c' about wallet fingerprinting with fee rate. The author acknowledges the contributions of achow101, 0xb10c, and nothingmuch- RedGrittyBrick.</summary>
