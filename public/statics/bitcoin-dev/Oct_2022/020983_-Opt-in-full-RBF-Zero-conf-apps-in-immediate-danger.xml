    <title>[Opt-in full-RBF] Zero-conf apps in immediate danger</title>

    <summary>The email thread from Dario Sneidermanis via bitcoin-dev discusses the recent realization that zero-conf apps, such as Muun, must immediately turn off their zero-conf features due to policy changes. Full RBF has been available for users on an opt-in basis since at least 2013, and de facto viable for use on the network even longer. However, policies are a per-node decision and cannot be relied upon in general. The term "zero-conf applications" is used for entities that accept on-chain payments from untrusted parties and sometimes deliver the paid-for product or service without waiting for the transaction to be included in a block. Despite performing a risk analysis to decide whether they are ok with accepting the payment without confirmation, this practice is unsafe, and RBF does not make it any less unsafe. The email also raises the question of finding a safer way to deploy full-RBF.</summary>
