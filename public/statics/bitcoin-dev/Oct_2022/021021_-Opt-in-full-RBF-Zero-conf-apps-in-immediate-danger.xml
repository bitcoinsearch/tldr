    <summary>In this communication from the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the discussion revolves around the deprecation of accepting unconfirmed on-chain payments, and whether to switch mainnet mining and relay nodes over to full RBF. There are three approaches: continue supporting and encouraging accepting unconfirmed "on-chain" payments indefinitely, draw a line in the sand now but give people time to update their software and business model, or encourage mainnet miners and relay nodes to support unconditional RBF immediately. The first option is problematic because it makes it easy to disrupt decentralised pooling protocols, while the second can be suboptimal due to the lack of commitment and difficulty in testing apps against the new world order. The third option seems like the goal that people are actually working towards, although some argue that patch complexity is a real concern and that a fullrbf-signalling PR has a harder road to deployment and gets pushback from fullrbf-default-now folks who correctly argue this. Some suggest an approach where full-RBF is activated on testnet now, and a block height in the future is committed to at which full-RBF will activate on mainnet, giving businesses time to adapt. This approach gives plenty of time to update code and teach customers and customer support about the new behaviour. People can begin testing with their node software on an opt-in basis (but not the required ~10% of nodes), 25.0+ nodes will flag-day, then a year from now, the community can start testing if miners have picked up said changes. It's suggested that there's no virtue in dragging on the discussion to "prove a point" to "merchants"/"Core devs" when we could be spending our time more wisely fixing the many other issues with our mempool and wallet ecosystem. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the need for clear commitment and a deadline for businesses to adapt while making sure that testing is easier and more well-supported.</summary>
