    <summary>John Light has published a report titled "Validity Rollups on Bitcoin" as part of the Human Rights Foundation's ZK-Rollup Research Fellowship. The report examines validity rollups from different angles, including their history, how they work on a technical level, how they could be built on Bitcoin, and what the benefits, costs, and risks of building them on Bitcoin might be. The report concludes that validity rollups have the potential to improve the scalability, privacy, and programmability of Bitcoin without sacrificing its core values or functionality as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The full report can be found at bitcoinrollups.org. John Light welcomes comments and questions from the Bitcoin dev community regarding the report.</summary>
