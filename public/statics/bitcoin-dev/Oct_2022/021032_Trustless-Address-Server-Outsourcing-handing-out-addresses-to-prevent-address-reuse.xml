    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bryan Bishop raised concerns about copy-pasting public keys. However, Andrew Poelstra clarified that the "public key" held by the wallet is only used to authenticate addresses and never leaves the wallet. If the wallet's memory is compromised, it can be tricked into accepting bad addresses, but this is much harder than compromising data on the clipboard. The proposal could even be used on a hardware wallet with an out-of-band way to obtain and authenticate public keys. Andrew Poelstra is the Director of Research at Blockstream.</summary>
