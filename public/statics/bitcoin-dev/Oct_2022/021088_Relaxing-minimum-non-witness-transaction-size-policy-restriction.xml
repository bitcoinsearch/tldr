    <summary>The Bitcoin policy limit for transactions currently stands at 85 non-witness serialized bytes, which was introduced as a covert fix to policy fix for CVE-2017-12842. Greg Sanders via bitcoin-dev has proposed relaxing this limit to effectively the value BlueMatt proposed in the Great Consensus Cleanup: 65 non-witness bytes. This would allow a single input, single output transaction with 4 bytes of OP_RETURN padding rather than padding out 21 bytes to get to p2wpkh size. The alternative proposal is to allow anything below 64 non-witness bytes, although this may have potential issues. Peter Todd suggests that spending a single input to OP_RETURN with no payload could be a valid use to get rid of dust in the UTXO set.</summary>
