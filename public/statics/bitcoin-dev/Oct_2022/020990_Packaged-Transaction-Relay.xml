    <summary>In a mailing list conversation on the bitcoin-dev group, Eric Voskuil and Anthony Towns discussed the importance of following public standards development processes in defining protocols. Eric had stated that protocols cannot be defined on an ad-hoc basis as a "courtesy", to which Anthony responded that BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) are a courtesy in the first place. Eric clarified that he did not dismiss the importance of courtesy in public processes and encouraged Anthony to participate in public standards development by making technical comments on proposals or creating his own. He also expressed amusement at the unlikelihood of success with Anthony's current approach.</summary>
