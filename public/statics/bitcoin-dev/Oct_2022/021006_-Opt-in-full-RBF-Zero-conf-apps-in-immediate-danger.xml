    <summary>On October 11th, 2022, Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev mentioned that adding an opt-in flag for full-RBF would be a step towards getting full RBF on the network. However, he believed it was unlikely to immediately change anything on the network at large. On October 7th, 2022, Dario Sneidermanis via bitcoin-dev had expressed concern about the potential risks involved in merging pull request #25353. This PR added an opt-in flag for full-RBF and could pose a risk to zero-conf applications if the adoption of this feature is widespread. In response, Pieter Wuille acknowledged the soundness of Dario's logic but also pointed out that the addition of the flag is necessary to allow experimentation and socialize the notion that developers believe it is time to adopt full RBF policy. Overall, Pieter Wuille believes that adoption of full RBF policy is inevitable, but the speed at which this is achieved is dependent upon software adoption.</summary>
