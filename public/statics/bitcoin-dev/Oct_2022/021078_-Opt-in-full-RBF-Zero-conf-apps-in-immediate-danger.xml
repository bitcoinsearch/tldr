    <summary>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses various issues related to Bitcoin payments, including Lightning network adoption, the use of RBF (replace-by-fee) in on-chain transactions, and the challenges faced by payment processors. The thread highlights the fact that while Lightning is showing promise, it still represents a small percentage of total Bitcoin payments, and extrapolating future growth trends is difficult. Additionally, concerns were raised about the impact of RBF on payment processor businesses, with one user arguing that it would result in a subpar user experience for the majority of Bitcoin transactions. Despite these challenges, there was a call for collaboration between wallet developers, merchant developers, and protocol developers to address these issues and improve the overall Bitcoin payment experience.</summary>
