    <summary>In an email sent on October 19th, 2022, a member of mm-studios via bitcoin-dev discussed the concept of a fully filled brick B0 with a hash that does not meet the difficulty rule. The proposal suggests that this brick would be broadcasted and nodes would have it on in a separate fork as usual. The email includes a link to previous "weak block" proposals, which can be found at https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/bitcoin/weak-blocks-links.2016-05-09.txt. The email is signed by Bryan, whose Twitter handle is @kanzure.</summary>
