    <summary>The Bitcoin Core project is currently discussing the best approach to enable full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) on the Bitcoin network. There are various options being considered, including continuing to support unconfirmed "on-chain" payments indefinitely, drawing a line in the sand now but giving businesses time to update their software and models, or encouraging miners and relay nodes to immediately support unconditional RBF.While enabling full RBF would align miner incentives, it could disrupt decentralized pooling protocols and pose risks to existing businesses that still accept unconfirmed transactions. To address this, developers are considering adopting a "micro" release practice that offers the option to node operators and lets them vote with their respective economic traffics.Although some people are already running full RBF relay nodes, there is no real commitment as to when the change will happen. To provide a clear deadline for businesses to adapt, Dario suggested an approach where they activate full-RBF on testnet now and commit to a block height in the future at which full-RBF will activate on mainnet. If developers agree to this proposal, it will give zeroconf businesses some time to adapt, making testing easier, and allowing protocols to quickly start relying on this method of tx pinning no longer being applicable.In addition, a proposal has been made on Github to enable experimentation with zeroconf deprecation on test nets before implementing it on mainnet. This approach is seen as a way of informing businesses that they have a deadline for migrating away from accepting unconfirmed transactions if they are concerned about the risk of being defrauded. The author of the proposal suggests that this approach is similar to activating soft forks on test nets prior to activating them on mainnet. The proposal was shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, and the author signed off his message with "Cheers, aj".</summary>
