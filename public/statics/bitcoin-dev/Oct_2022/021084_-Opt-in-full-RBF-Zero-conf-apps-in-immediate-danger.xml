    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Sergej Kotliar suggested that if the RBF mechanism was systematically exploited, then other methods like crediting the amount in BTC to a custodial account would be necessary. However, this option isn't available to normal payment processors. It was also mentioned that while "zeroconf works great" for some businesses, they achieve this by sybil attacking the network to measure propagation. This is not sustainable nor decentralized, and it's important for these companies to stop doing that and no new companies should start. The discussion also noted that lightning works great, but it is still small.</summary>
