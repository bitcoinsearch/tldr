    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin developers, Greg Sanders proposed relaxing the policy limit for transactions to be 85 non-witness serialized bytes. He suggested that the value should be effectively lowered to 65 non-witness bytes, which would allow a single input, single output transaction with 4 bytes of OP_RETURN padding, rather than padding out 21 bytes to get to p2wpkh size. This proposal was made after looking at some possible transaction types. The current policy limit was introduced as a covert fix to policy fix for CVE-2017-12842, and the motivation behind the "reasonable" constant chosen was later revealed. Sanders wanted to ensure that his proposal did not die in case people found it odd that 61, 62, 63, but not 64 bytes ended up being broadcastable. Peter Todd replied to Sanders' proposal, asking what footguns exactly there were, and suggesting that spending a single input to OP_RETURN with no payload is a valid use to get rid of dust in the UTXO set. Sanders was willing to change his proposal and pull request if people had no strong objections.</summary>
