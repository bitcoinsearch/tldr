    <summary>Lightning network has provided convenient mobile apps used by millions of people and other solutions for fast payments, which have mitigated the need for a 0conf. The core lightning and other solutions are easily installed and configured for use in fast payments. Peter Todd's concerns about merchants managing their own 0conf risks being harmful to Bitcoin as it leads to connecting to large numbers of nodes to try to risk-manage propagation which is an attack, albeit a mild one. It is very unfair/centralized if only a few merchants can do it. In the past, this has led to merchants trying to make deals with miners directly, even going as far as to suggest reorging out double-spends.</summary>
