    <summary>In an email dated October 20, 2022, Peter Todd shared that he had tested a "Cancel Transaction" feature in the Electrum wallet on Android. He cancelled a payment and noted that there should be a pending payment from this email while he did not receive his gift card. He also informed that BlueWallet, Simple Bitcoin Wallet, and Specter Wallet were among the wallets that implement transaction cancellation. Todd's email signature included a link to his website, petertodd.org.</summary>
