    <summary>Recent developments in Eltoo Lightning channels have led to the suggestion of using the Taproot annex to store specific protocol payloads. However, certain use-cases require an extension of transaction fields beyond the nSequence field's 32 bits of space. The Taproot soft fork introduced the annex, which is a tagged element within any SegWit v1 spends that is reserved for future extensions.To address this issue, a proposal has been put forward that introduces a Type-Length-Value format for the annex field. This format is backward-compatible and easy to parse, and the proposal seeks feedback on its direction. It also raises questions concerning policy/consensus rules to prevent potential DoS attacks.The annex field could be accessible to Script programmers through PUSH_ANNEX_RECORD, allowing several potential use-cases to be served, including per-input lock-time, commitment to historical block hash, groups of inputs/outputs, and vectors of scriptPubkeys/amounts. However, further research and development work is needed before the annex can be considered ready for activation.The proposed Type-Length-Value format for the annex field could harmonize its usage by applications only leveraging policy-only enforcement of the field without having ulterior consensus validation nullifying or interfering with its use. Those interested in learning more about this proposal can find a WIP implementation and a BIP available on Github.</summary>
