    <summary>The conversation discusses a proposal to increase transaction throughput without increasing block size, by allowing fully filled bricks called B0 to be included until the block is filled. This would result in increased bandwidth and volume of data to process, but could reduce congestion. The proposal raises concerns around how to ensure miners are not being lazy and the difficulty in determining whether an old brick was valid if it had low difficulty at a busy mempool time. However, the proposed system could still maintain the strength of PoW as the brickchain is accepted or rejected by a miner in an atomic way, similar to a block with an aggregated PoW. There are also questions around how rewards would work, but it is suggested that the coinbase transaction could go in the first brick. The proposal also raises issues with storage requirements and risks of double-spends if the brick chain is not merged into the main blockchain. The conversation concludes with the acknowledgement that this proposal is interesting to think about and discuss further.</summary>
