    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dario Sneidermanis from Muun wallet expressed concern about the latest Bitcoin Core release candidate, version 24.0, which mandates zero-conf apps to immediately turn off their zero-conf features. David A. Harding responded, clarifying that there is no significant change related to transaction replaceability in the latest release. He explained that the new mempoolfullrbf option added in the release allows transactions without BIP125 signaling to be replaced, but it is disabled by default and not planned for activation in version 24.0. The -walletrbf startup option has been set to true by default, which signals BIP125 replaceability. This option has been default false for many years for the RPC, but for the GUI, it's been default true since Bitcoin Core 0.16. The latest release just gives Bitcoin Core RPC users by default the same settings long used for GUI users and introduces an option that those who object to non-signalled RBF will later be able to use to disable their relay of non-signalled replacements.</summary>
