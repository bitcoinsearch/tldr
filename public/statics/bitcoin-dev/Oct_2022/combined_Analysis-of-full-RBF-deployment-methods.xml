    <summary>During a recent Bitcoin Core IRC meeting, the topic of deploying full-replace-by-fee (RBF) was widely discussed. While some stakeholders opposed it on principle, Antoine Riard argued that deferring the deployment of full-RBF could be risky for contracting protocols and multi-party applications affected by the pinning denial-of-service (DoS) vector.Dario Sneidermanis shared five different deployment options, comparing them based on dimensions of analysis such as zero-conf apps immediately affected, predictability of deployment, code complexity, smooth deployment, and time needed to figure out the right deployment method. Dario suggested option 5 in the original post (#26323) would be the best approach to achieve a reliable full-RBF network while not threatening zero-conf applications until activation time.Antoine agreed with this approach but suggested that May 1st, 2023, could be too early for full-RBF deployment, and 10-12 months sounds more reasonable. Antoine also highlighted the need for more communication channels between business/service operators and protocol developers to better clarify functional responsibilities between protocol and application layers.However, he does not believe that it should be the responsibility of developers to solve every operational risk encumbered by a Bitcoin business. Dario counters that asking for a predictable deployment timeline for a change that would put some applications at increased risk should not be described as burdening the developers with solving every operational risk. The goal of the deployment method comparison was to soften the burden on core devs. The discussion revolved around different alternatives for the deployment method of full-RBF, considering various dimensions of analysis to make a decision, such as code complexity, smooth deployment, and time needed to figure out the right deployment method.</summary>
