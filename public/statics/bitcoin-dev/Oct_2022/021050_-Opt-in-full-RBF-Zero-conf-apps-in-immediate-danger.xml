    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev community is currently discussing the responsibility of Core contributors and maintainers to provide options and recommendations regarding mempool policies. The decision to remove the option to disable RBF policy has been met with criticism, as it does not take into account feedback from users and businesses who are affected by the change. Some members believe that technical experts should provide a specific recommendation, while others argue that users should be able to run different software or configurations to adapt to changes.There are also concerns about the lack of engagement and outreach to businesses affected by the change. The decision to support unconditional RBF immediately is seen as disingenuous, as it increases risk for existing zero-conf businesses without making those risks clear. This has led to calls for clearer communication regarding risk and a timeline for deployment.While full RBF is acknowledged as a long-term solution, there is disagreement on how best to implement it and whether it should be done immediately or phased in over time. The email thread discusses the potential impact of delaying the implementation of zeroconf and the availability of full RBF. There is a debate between the benefits of making it easier for those who rely on zeroconf versus the potential harm to bitcoin businesses and users if there is immediate risk.The discussion emphasizes the importance of considering feedback and avoiding harm to users, even if it means delaying a release or engaging in "bikeshedding" to ensure that the right decision is made. The thread ends with aj calling for action to be taken in order to avoid endangering zeroconf apps and ensuring that negative feedback is not ignored.</summary>
