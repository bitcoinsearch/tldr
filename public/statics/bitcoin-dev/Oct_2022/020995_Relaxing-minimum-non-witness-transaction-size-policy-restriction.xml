    <summary>A proposal has been made to relax the current policy limit of 85 non-witness serialized bytes for Bitcoin transactions to 65 non-witness bytes. This change would allow for a single input, single output transaction with 4 bytes of OP_RETURN padding, instead of having to pad out 21 bytes to reach p2wpkh size. The current limit was introduced as a covert fix for CVE-2017-12842, but the "reasonable" constant chosen was not optimal. Allowing anything below 64 non-witness bytes is also being considered, but this option may come with risks for only a small gain in bytes. A link to the relevant pull request and alternatives can be found on GitHub. Feedback and concerns regarding this proposal are welcomed.</summary>
