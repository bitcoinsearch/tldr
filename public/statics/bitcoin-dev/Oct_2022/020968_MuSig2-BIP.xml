    <summary>The BIP draft has undergone significant improvements since its initial publication, thanks to feedback from the mailing list and development git repository. There are now multiple implementations in place, and no major changes or features have been requested in recent weeks. This suggests that it is a good time to proceed with the next step of the BIP process. The MuSig2 BIP has been submitted as a pull request to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) repository on GitHub. The authors of the BIP would like to express their gratitude to numerous individuals who provided valuable feedback during the drafting process. These include Tim Ruffing, Elliott Jin, Adam Gibson, Anthony Towns, arik-so, Bastien Teinturier, Brandon Black, Greg Sanders, Jesse Posner, Lloyd Fournier, mplsgrant, nickfarrow, niftynei, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Pieter Wuille, Riccardo Casatta, Russell O'Connor, and Rusty Russell.</summary>
