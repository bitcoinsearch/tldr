    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, participants examined the impact of nodes adopting a more permissive policy on transaction propagation. Using napkin math, they estimated that if 30% of nodes had such a policy and only one transaction per year failed to initially propagate, lightweight clients would need to connect to over 50 randomly selected nodes. They also discussed target failure probabilities and the implications of non-taproot supporting nodes. One participant analyzed "receive version message" log entries and found that out of approximately 3000 outbound connections over three weeks, over 600 identified as non-taproot supporting, suggesting a 6.44-in-1-million chance of only connecting to peers that don't support taproot.</summary>
