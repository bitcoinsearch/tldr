    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille proposed an idea for improving the protocol. The proposal is to start with approach (1), although he admits that there is room for debate on whether this is the best approach. Wuille believes that this is more of a community and process question than a technical one, and invites others in the community to share their opinions.Vasil Dimov responded to the email stating that the proposal makes perfect sense to him. He also included a quote from Edsger W. Dijkstra about how important it is to consider the long-term implications of our actions.</summary>
