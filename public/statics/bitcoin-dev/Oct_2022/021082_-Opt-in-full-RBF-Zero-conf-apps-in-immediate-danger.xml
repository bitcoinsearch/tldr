    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list, concerns were raised about developers making assumptions about businesses rather than actually speaking to them. The discussion revolved around opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and its potential impact on businesses that rely on zero-confirmation transactions. The lack of input from the developers of the three main coinjoin implementations affected by opt-in RBF was noted. However, Max Hillebrand from Wasabi confirmed that full-RBF does not affect their platform significantly and that they handle replacements/reorgs gracefully. Although he pointed out that it could be a denial-of-service vector if any input double-spent, which will be relayed after successful signing. He also mentioned that they have much bigger/cheaper DoS vectors that don't get exploited. Meanwhile, the impact on Joinmarket's implementation should be similar, but no comment has been made yet.</summary>
