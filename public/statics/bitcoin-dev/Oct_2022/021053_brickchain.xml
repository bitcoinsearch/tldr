    <summary>The proposal suggests 'bricks' as short-lived sidechains that get merged into blocks to reduce the difficulty required for a block to be valid if the mempool contains more than 1 block's worth of transactions so we get transactions confirmed faster. However, this would increase the rate of growth of storage required for a full node, and nodes have to be able to run through the entire history of the blockchain and check everything is valid. Transactions don't contain a 'created-at' time that you could compare to the block's creation time. The proposal has various issues in determining the validity of bricks. In addition, there are concerns about where the block reward goes, how brick miners get the reward, and who gets the fees. The brick sidechain has to become part of the main blockchain, and it seems like a roundabout way of increasing the blocksize.</summary>
