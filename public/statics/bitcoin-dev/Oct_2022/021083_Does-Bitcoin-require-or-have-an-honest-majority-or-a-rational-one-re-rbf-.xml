    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Russell O'Connor argued that mining off the tip is not necessarily harmful to the network as it is indistinguishable from high latency. However, Peter Todd disagreed, stating that a large high latency miner who does not receive the most work block in time could cause significant disruptions to the network and potentially render other miners unprofitable. Todd suggested updating mining policies to reduce the chances of such situations arising, but also noted that this could result in larger miners becoming significantly more profitable than smaller ones.</summary>
