    <summary>The context discusses the countermeasures implemented by Bitrefill to ensure transaction security. The company has only implemented a subset of available countermeasures, mainly waiting for conflicting transactions to propagate on the network. They have well-connected nodes with basic redundancy. Sometimes external block explorers are used for certain enhancements, but they are not required for zeroconf since they are frequently down. Bitrefill's custom-built setup is presumed to be similar to other setups used by those who accept payments with Bitcoin. Sergey Kotliar, CEO of Bitrefill, responded to Peter Todd's inquiry about how they detect people sending conflicting transactions and stated that it isn't necessary for them to do so. Bitrefill can be found on Twitter, their blog, and Angellist.</summary>
