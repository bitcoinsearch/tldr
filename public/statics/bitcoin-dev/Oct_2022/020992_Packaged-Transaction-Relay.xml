    <summary>The conversation is regarding the packaged transaction relay in Bitcoin development. Anthony Towns had made a comment saying that BIPs are a courtesy in the first place. The other person seemed to think that Anthony was dismissing public process, but Anthony clarified that he was not dismissing courtesy or public process. He believes that courtesy is an important factor in public standards development and should not be ignored.Anthony suggested that the person should participate in public standards development by making technical comments on proposals, making their own proposal, or participating on Github or other platforms. He also added that he is not the boss and would be "entertainingly surprised" if any progress was made with their current approach. The conversation ends with a curt remark from the other person telling Anthony to grow up.</summary>
