    <title>Combined summary - Does Bitcoin require or have an honest majority or a rational one? (re rbf)</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has been the site of several discussions on various aspects of Bitcoin, including security, game theory, incentives, and mining stability. Participants in the discussion have referenced the Bitcoin white paper's statement on proof-of-work (PoW) solving the problem of determining representation in majority decision making, as well as the importance of relying on economically rational rules that are not likely to change in order to avoid arbitrary changes in Bitcoin's system.The distinction between honest majority and longest chain is also explored, with some arguing for prioritizing economically rational majority over honest majority for system security guarantees. There are debates over the stability of mining in a low subsidy environment and the incentives to mine on the most work chain. Additionally, there are concerns about the risks associated with reliance on zeroconf and how people trying to do so have repeatedly taken big losses when their risk mitigations turned out not to work.The discussion centers around the concept of honesty in Bitcoin mining, particularly in relation to the proof-of-work system. The controversy over Replace-by-Fee (RBF) arises from the desire to make honest behavior also rational behavior, which may weaken the assumptions of selfishness maximizing a parameter. It is important to note that defining an honest behavior can create a higher utility system because most people are "law-abiding citizens" who might not be short-term rational.Jeremy Rubin argues that Satoshi's original whitepaper serves as a "social contract" for what Bitcoin is and what can be agreed upon. However, he believes that it's misguided to simply accept the assumption of an honest majority without considering incentives. The stability of mining in a low subsidy environment is a significant concern since it has never been tested before. While there are worries about this issue, Rubin speculates that with a thick mempool or miners rationally leaving behind transactions, mining will remain stable. Although one can construct situations where not mining on the tip is preferred, it's not enough to collapse the protocol, but rather a question of rarity and reducing the chances of such situations arising through mining policy updates or leaving an explicit ANYONECANSPEND transaction output.Russell O'Connor suggests that building a secure blockchain based on arbitrary rules is not reasonable. He argues that users need an incentive to follow the rules of the system, and that rules ought to form a Nash Equilibrium. O'Connor notes that honest behavior assumptions are acceptable as long as they are time-bounded and observable. Jeremy Rubin adds that Satoshi claimed that for Bitcoin to function properly, a majority of honest nodes are required. However, honesty is not clearly defined, and there are multiple behaviors one can describe as honest, which may or may not be economically rational.The controversy surrounding Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and the assumptions of honesty versus rationality in Bitcoin are also discussed. While Satoshi did not suggest that Bitcoin operates under a rational majority assumption, it is important to define honest behavior to create a higher utility system. There are differing views within the Bitcoin community regarding the importance of incentive compatibility and the assumptions underlying the system's security.It might be useful to document Bitcoin's assumptions and their implications for the network's properties to ensure the network's safety while not compromising user expectations. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of understanding and balancing the interplay between honesty and rationality within the Bitcoin ecosystem.It is important to consider the impact of weakening assumptions on different subsystems of Bitcoin and how this could affect the fee market's longer-term viability. It is essential to document Bitcoin's assumptions in practice and its properties, as well as pathways to weakening these assumptions without compromising the network's expected behaviors. The safety of 0conf isn't assured given the potential of race conditions in the mempool, even in the presence of an honest majority. Therefore, it's not clear whether 0conf working well is something that can be driven from the Honest Majority Assumption.Overall, it may be nice to more tightly document what Bitcoin's assumptions are in practice and what those assumptions do in terms of properties of Bitcoin, as well as pathways to weakening the assumptions without compromising the behaviors users expect the network to have. It's somewhat clear that we shouldn't weaken assumptions that only seem local to one subsystem of Bitcoin if they end up destabilizing another system. The importance of reducing the chances of situations arising where not mining on the tip is preferable is discussed, such as leaving some transactions out based on current mempool conditions or leaving an explicit ANYONECANSPEND transaction output as a tip for the next miner to build upon mined blocks.The discussion also explores the concept of honest behavior in Bitcoin and how it relates to rational decision making. They discuss scenarios where miners may choose to repack transactions from previously mined blocks for greater profit, rather than following the "honest tip mining" strategy of building on the longest chain. The two exchange views on whether an assumption of an honest majority or a rational majority is necessary for the network to function properly. Overall, the discussion centers around the importance of</summary>
