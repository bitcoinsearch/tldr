    <summary>In a discussion led by Gavin Andresen in 2011, the idea of forking changes in blockchain was brought up. Some members expressed concerns about its high risks and little benefits. The suggestion was made to save this idea for when it is absolutely necessary or bundle it with other potential future blockchain-splitting changes. The idea was ultimately shelved until needed but was written as a contingency plan just in case.</summary>
