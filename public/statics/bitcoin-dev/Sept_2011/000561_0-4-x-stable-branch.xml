    <summary>In an email from September 19, 2011, Luke-Jr brought up the issue of bugfixes being done alongside improvements in the current development model. He argued that code changes always have the potential to introduce new bugs, even if everyone is careful. Therefore, fixing bugs while also introducing new features runs the risk of creating more bugs than were originally present. The email also suggested that most recently introduced bugs were likely a result of fixes rather than new features, given the relatively small number of new features added. This highlights the difficulty of balancing the need for bugfixes with the potential risks associated with introducing new code into a system.</summary>
