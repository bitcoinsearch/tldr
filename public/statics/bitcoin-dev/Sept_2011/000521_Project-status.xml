    <summary>In this context, the discussion revolves around the security concerns regarding the storage of private keys. Luke-Jr recommends submitting transactions to a staff member with proper authority who will then sign it on an offline transaction-signing wallet stored on a USB key and return it to a third wallet. The idea is agreed upon by another participant in the discussion, who highlights the data recovery issues associated with storing sensitive data on nand, making it almost impossible to reliably delete such data. The participant also notes that recommending absolute physical destruction for secure deletion is not justified.</summary>
