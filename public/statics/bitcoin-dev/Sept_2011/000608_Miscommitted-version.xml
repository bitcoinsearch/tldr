    <summary>On September 26, 2011, Luke-Jr bumped the version to 0.4.1 for a pre-0.5.0 release, which was corrected by Jeff Garzik stating that the most recent release was actually 0.4.0. The stable version would be based off the most recent release which would be 0.4.0.1. Jeff Garzik also reminded about the "upstream must have merged this fix first" rule.</summary>
