    <summary>Gavin Andresen, the lead developer of Bitcoin, has tagged a new git tree with v0.4.00rc2. This is an update from the previous release candidate 1 and includes several fixes. One of the significant changes in the new release candidate is the optimization of database writes for transactions that have a large number of inputs. Additionally, a deadlock issue that could occur while adding addresses from 'addr' messages and irc has been fixed. Moreover, the latest version also addresses a potential problem related to duplicate and un-spendable coinbase transactions. This issue could arise when individuals generate bitcoins, have a locked wallet, and run out of keypool keys. These fixes are part of the ongoing efforts by the Bitcoin community to improve the functionality and reliability of the cryptocurrency network.</summary>
