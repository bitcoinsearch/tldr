    <summary>The post discusses the possibility of renaming the "BEP" acronym for Bitcoin Enhancement Proposals to avoid potential confusion with BitTorrent EPs in the future. The author expresses concern that searching for "BEP003" in two years could lead to results for BitTorrent instead of Bitcoin. However, they argue that anyone who needs to access BEP documents would likely be technically-minded enough to search for "bitcoin bep003" specifically. Ultimately, it is suggested that there may not be a significant issue with keeping the current acronym.</summary>
