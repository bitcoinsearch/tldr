    <summary>The Bitcoin version 0.4 release candidate 2 looks stable and OSX binaries have been built and uploaded to GitHub. Windows and Linux binaries will appear as soon as "gitian-capable" builders can create them. The next release is expected to have minimal-to-no changes between release candidate 2 and the final 0.4 release, and it will include a switch from wxWidgets to qt for the GUI client. There are several issues that need attention in separate discussions. Firstly, there is a bug/design flaw in bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm, and there have been nagging issues surrounding how bitcoin handles time. Secondly, pull requests for an implementation of the "don't talk to misbehaving peers" idea will be submitted to proactively prevent potential denial-of-service attacks. Finally, there needs to be consensus on one or more 'multi-signature' standard transactions to enable much better wallet backup and security.</summary>
