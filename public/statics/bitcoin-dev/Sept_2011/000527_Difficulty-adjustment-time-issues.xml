    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a software developer and one of the earliest Bitcoin contributors, has suggested delaying the forwarding of blocks and their extensions until they are extended one more time. This idea could lead to better incentives for miners, though it has not been agreed upon yet. However, Andresen also believes that a forking change, which would require significant changes to the Bitcoin protocol, is too high risk and should only be done with a compelling reason. One such reason could be removing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE limit while preventing potential attacks by rogue miners.</summary>
