    <summary>Michael Gr√∏nager reported a finding on September 5, 2011, stating that he did not use the UPNP feature. He discovered that in the makefile.unix file, he had to change USE_UPNP from USE_UPNP:=0 to USE_UPNP:= in order for it to be defined as disabled by default. The default setting is "UPnP supported, disabled by default" and not "UPnP not supported." This information is documented in build-unix.txt.</summary>
