    <summary>ArtForz has submitted a patch to the GitHub repository of Bitcoin after discovering an issue that occurs when large transactions are chained together. This problem causes the berkeley db transaction log to become very big due to the dependencies (TxIns) of a transaction being rewritten multiple times. However, with the new fix, each transaction referred to by TxIns is only written once, which should alleviate the issue. Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has requested feedback and review on the patch. This demonstrates the collaborative nature of the Bitcoin community, where individuals work together to improve the technology and address any issues that arise. The use of GitHub as a platform for submitting patches also allows for transparency and accountability in the development process.</summary>
