    <summary>Michael Grønager apologized for the mistake he made in the first clean checkout that he had not changed before. In an email, he shared his findings regarding compile and noted that he does not use the UPNP feature. He mentioned that in the makefile.unix, he had to change the USE_UPNP from 0 to nothing as it was defined if it is "0". Luke-Jr replied to his email, confirming that the default is "UPnP supported, disabled by default" (USE_UPNP=0), not "UPnP not supported" (USE_UPNP=). This is documented in build-unix.txt. Michael Gronager's contact details are also provided.</summary>
