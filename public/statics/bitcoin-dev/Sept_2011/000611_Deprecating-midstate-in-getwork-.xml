    <summary>In an email exchange, Nils Schneider proposed to simplify the internal reference miner and remove all dependencies on cryptopp. The only place where cryptopp is used instead of OpenSSL is in calculating the "midstate" for getwork. However, Nils suggests that this field is redundant and the miner could easily calculate it from the blockheader, thus allowing for the removal of cryptopp. JS agrees with Nils but is doubtful about losing compatibility with miners. JS asks if there is a way to compute midstate with OpenSSL. Nils' proposal raises questions about how such a change should be announced so all miners can be upgraded. Meanwhile, the email includes an ad for Splunk, which takes data generated in IT infrastructure and makes sense of it. The email exchange occurred on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
