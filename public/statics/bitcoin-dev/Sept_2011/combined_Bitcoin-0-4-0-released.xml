    <summary>Bitcoin version 0.4.0 is now available for download with the main feature being wallet private key encryption. Users can set a passphrase that must be entered before sending coins, and if forgotten or lost, all bitcoins are lost. Bitcoin supports native wallet encryption to prevent thieves from accessing all of a user's bitcoins. To enable this feature, users should choose "Encrypt Wallet" from the Options menu, enter a passphrase, and store it in a secure location. The encryption built into bitcoin only encrypts the keys required to send bitcoins, not the full wallet. Someone who steals the wallet file will still be able to see all the addresses belonging to the user, as well as relevant transactions. Users are recommended to backup their wallet files before encrypting them, and once encrypted, they will never be able to go back to a version of the Bitcoin client older than 0.4. If upgrading to version 0.4 and then reverting back to an earlier version of bitcoin, it may be unable to start because bdb 4.7 cannot read bdb 4.8 "log" files. Notable bug fixes from version 0.3.24 include fixing several bitcoin-becomes-unresponsive bugs due to multithreading deadlocks and optimizing database writes for large transactions to address potential denial-of-service attacks. It is important to note that bitcoin version 0.4 uses a newer version of Berkeley DB (bdb version 4.8) than previous versions (bdb 4.7).Bitcoin wallet security is the responsibility of the user; if a passphrase is lost, the bitcoins in the wallet cannot be recovered. The encryption built into bitcoin only encrypts the keys required to send bitcoins, not the full wallet. This means someone who steals a wallet file can see all addresses and relevant transactions. To protect against this, it is recommended that users backup their wallet file before encrypting it in order to delete the backup and enjoy an encrypted wallet. Good security practices are essential, including running up-to-date antivirus software, entering a wallet passphrase only in the Bitcoin client, and using the same passphrase only as a wallet passphrase.A list of technical details for wallet encryption can be found in the doc/README file in the bitcoin source. The changelog for version 0.4.0 includes bug fixes, updated translations and checkpoints, improved debugging tools, optimizations for database writes, and more. It is crucial for users to remember that they are responsible for their own security when using bitcoin. All it takes is a slightly more advanced wallet-stealing trojan that installs a keylogger to steal a user's wallet passphrase as it is entered, and they could lose all their bitcoins. Wallet encryption cannot keep users safe if they do not practice good security, such as running up-to-date antivirus software, only entering their wallet passphrase in the Bitcoin client, and using the same passphrase only as their wallet passphrase.</summary>
