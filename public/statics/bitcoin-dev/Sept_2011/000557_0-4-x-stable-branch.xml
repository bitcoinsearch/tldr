    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development process, Luke-Jr proposed creating a git repository and tags for the development of new releases. However, Gavin Andresen, one of the core developers, expressed concern about the practicality of maintaining two release lines as it would slow down testing and bug-fixing. Furthermore, he believed that the use of the word "stable" would be misleading until a version 1.0 was agreed upon. Instead, he suggested that if Luke-Jr and others wanted to create 0.4.* releases, they could build binaries, QA test them, and release them while linking to their binaries from bitcoin.org. Finally, Gavin Andresen envisioned a future where various Bitcoin implementations existed, and bitcoin.org served as a forum for developers to discuss the direction of Bitcoin.</summary>
