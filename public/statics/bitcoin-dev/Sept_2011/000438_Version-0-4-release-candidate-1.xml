    <summary>The Bitcoin version 0.4 release candidate 1 is available for initial testing, and users are requested to download the source code from GitHub and test it thoroughly. The latest version features wallet private key encryption, which is not enabled by default. Additionally, internal critical section mutexes have been reworked to address chronic problems with the system becoming unresponsive due to deadlocks. For a detailed list of changes, users can run the command "git shortlog --no-merges v0.3.24." The development team has thanked all contributors who submitted patches, although not all were included in this release.</summary>
