    <summary>In this email exchange, Chris suggests implementing a BitTorrent-like snubbing and dropping protocol to deal with misbehaving peers. However, he cautions against sharing blacklist decisions as it could be dangerous. He also proposes including some sort of choking/unchoking method to warn peers that they may be dropped if they continue to misbehave. Chris believes that any rules for misbehavior should be conservative to start with and extended over time. He warns that making the rules too restrictive may make future development difficult, including for alternative clients. In response to a pull request from Gavin Andresen regarding non-standard transactions or those with insufficient fees being penalized, Luke-Jr argues that these are relay/miner policy decisions and not protocol violations. He suggests that such decisions should be made more easily configurable rather than punished for configuration. The email concludes with a link to an article discussing the obstacles that mid-market businesses face in deploying virtual desktops and how next-generation virtual desktops can provide a more affordable and easier-to-manage solution.</summary>
