    <title>Bitcoin Enhancement Proposals (BEPS)</title>

    <summary>The author proposes that new 'standard' transaction forms would be ideal for Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). The author also suggests creating a formal proposal to separate the protocol version from the client version to avoid confusion. They express concern about using the acronym "BEP," as it may lead to confusion with BitTorrent EPs in the future. Instead, they suggest potentially using "BIP" for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal or "PEB" for Proposal to Enhance Bitcoin. The author acknowledges that planning ahead could prevent issues later on and wants to avoid potential conflict with BitTorrent.</summary>
