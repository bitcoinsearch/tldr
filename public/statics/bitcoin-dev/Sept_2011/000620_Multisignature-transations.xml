    <summary>In a recent email, Gavin Andresen shared his thoughts on making 2 of 3 transactions more useful. He suggested creating a clean pull request, unit tests, and test plan for an "IsStandard" 2-of-3 transaction, using either CHECKMULTISIG or groffers proposal. To support this, he provided code that he used to send three multisig transactions on testnet. The low-level support is relatively easy, but reporting these transactions in listtransactions and figuring out how to report them in your wallet balance is tricky. The code provided by Andresen is not intended for mainline bitcoin, but rather as a way to test the new transactions.</summary>
