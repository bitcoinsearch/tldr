    <summary>On September 9, 2011, Luke-Jr posted on a forum about two bitcoind running on the same system on Eligius. One is a hub node that relays network activity between hundreds of nodes Eligius peers with, while the other is a work node that manages mining and only connects to the hub node. Recently, the hub node has been dying, but the cause is yet to be determined as there have been no recent changes made. Another user jokingly requested a stack trace for proof.</summary>
