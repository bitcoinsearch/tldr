    <summary>A patch has been submitted to the GitHub repository of Bitcoin by ArtForz, who discovered a problem. The problem occurs when large transactions are chained together and causes the berkeley db transaction log to become very big. This happens because the dependencies (TxIns) of a transaction might be rewritten multiple times. However, with the new fix, each transaction referred to by TxIns is only written once, which should alleviate the issue. Gavin Andresen has requested feedback and review on the patch.</summary>
