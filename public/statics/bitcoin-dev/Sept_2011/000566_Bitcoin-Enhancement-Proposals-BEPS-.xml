    <summary>In an email conversation amongst developers in September 2011, Gavin Andresen suggested the creation of a formal proposal for new 'standard' transaction forms. He also proposed that the protocol version should be separated from the client version and stated his concern about using the term 'BEP', as he feared it might lead to confusion with BitTorrent EPs. Instead, he suggested alternative names such as 'BIP' for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, 'PEB' for Proposal to Enhance Bitcoin or 'BER' for Bitcoin Enhancement Request. Andresen emphasized the importance of planning ahead to avoid future confusion.</summary>
