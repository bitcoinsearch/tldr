    <summary>The author of a least authority based set of filesystems named MinorFs, Rob Meijer, is looking to update the system for use by bitcoin on systems that support AppArmor. Although there has been little interest in an updated version, Meijer has created a set of proposed specifications for a rewrite of MinorFs and is open to suggestions. The current granularity level of MinorFs is hard fixed to that of the 'pseudo persistent process'. Meijer believes that the next version should take an approach that better suits common development languages and practices. He is seeking input from bitcoin developers to create an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity of persistent private storage for bitcoin. Meijer wants to accommodate bitcoin developer needs so that code to use MinorFs where available can be added to bitcoin.</summary>
