    <summary>In a forum discussion on September 15, 2011, Bitcoin developers debated whether "non-standard" transactions with insufficient fees should be penalized. Luke-Jr argued that such transactions should not be penalized, as they are properly relayed and mined at the discretion of individual nodes, rather than being protocol violations. However, kjj argued that some non-standard transactions might not be legitimate, and suggested assigning a small penalty to peers sending them. Ultimately, another developer pointed out that penalizing non-standard transactions based on personal policies could end up banning legitimate nodes. The discussion highlights the need for configurable policies that can evolve with the network.</summary>
