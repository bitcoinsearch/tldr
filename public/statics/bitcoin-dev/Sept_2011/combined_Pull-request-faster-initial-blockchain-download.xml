    <summary>The Bitcoin project has recently made a change to its code that allows for faster downloads of the blockchain during the initial download process. This change skips ECDSA signature verification and includes all blocks up to 120 blocks before the last blockchain lock-in point. The rationale behind this alteration is to prevent attackers from feeding clients bad transactions during the initial download. Any such attempt will be rejected at the first blockchain lock-in due to changes in the merkle tree. However, transactions are still checked for orphan blocks and mined blocks during the download process.Interested parties can review the proposed change on Github and provide feedback.</summary>
