    <summary>The alert system is crucial for handling critical issues in the network, especially when facing an attacker with over 50% computational power. Alerts are used to inform people to stop accepting transactions during such instances. However, the current alert message is not prominent enough and needs improvement.The GUI client should be modified to prevent people from viewing received or sending new transactions while an alert is in effect. An opt-in feature that puts RPC into safe mode in response to an alert should also be added. This will ensure that the network is secure during critical situations.Although alerts can be a DoS attack vector, they are still safer than typical HTTPS since there are no CAs that can break its security. It's worth noting that the writer has a copy of the alert key.</summary>
