    <summary>On September 6, 2011, Luke-Jr reported a fix for the encrypted-wallet mining issue. The suggested fix is to use unique_coinbase. The code was reviewed but it has not been tested yet. A test plan was created which includes running a clean testnet-in-a-box bitcoind with -keypool=1 and encrypting the wallet. Additionally, running bitcoind getnewaddress until keypool is exhausted, generating blocks via internal miner, verifying coinbase transactions have unique txids even though they pay-to default key, and generating blocks via getwork RPC call are also part of the test plan. This information can be found on a Github pull request created by Luke-Jr which Gavin Andresen commented on.</summary>
