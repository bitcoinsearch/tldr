    <summary>It has been clarified that the PULL will not support dispute mediation with 2-of-3. The focus of this pull is on wallet security and backup which is seen as a critical feature. There was also a plan to allow CHECKMULTISIG for small numbers of keys, but it might cause problems when transaction volume increases. groffer pointed out that each CHECKMULTISIG counts as 20 sigops and there is a limit to the number of sigops one can put into a block. Since it is not needed for wallet security and backup, it has been dropped. However, accepting this does not preclude adding more 'standard' transaction types in the future.</summary>
