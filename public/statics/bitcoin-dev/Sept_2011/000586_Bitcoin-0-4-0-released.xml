    <summary>In a discussion regarding the importance of GPG signatures, Gavin Andresen agrees with Daniel's statement that as long as it is GPG-signed, the location of the post does not matter. However, Andresen also mentions that he uploaded the signatures to Github, but did not announce it due to unreliable downloads from the platform. A link to the Github downloads is provided for anyone interested in accessing them: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/downloads.</summary>
