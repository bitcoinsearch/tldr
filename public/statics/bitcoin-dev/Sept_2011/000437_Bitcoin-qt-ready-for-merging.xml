    <summary>In an email conversation between Luke-Jr and John Smith, the former asked how build options can be set with qmake. John replied that assignments can be put on the command line and these variables can be used for conditionally enabling or disabling libraries or other options in the .pro file. He also added that qmake is a simple tool optimized for conveniently building Qt applications in a cross-platform way and it is enough for building bitcoin-qt on the supported target architectures. However, for "bitcoind" and "bitcoin-wx", keeping around the makefile is recommended. The qmake manual provides further information on this topic.</summary>
