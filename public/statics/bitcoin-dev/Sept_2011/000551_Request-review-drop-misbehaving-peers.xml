    <summary>In a discussion about protecting Bitcoin's connection, the question of whether it would be better for protection to fail hard or fail soft was raised. The argument for failing hard is that it would immediately alert people to the problem and allow it to be fixed quickly. Failing soft, on the other hand, could lead to bugs splitting the network and the blockchain. The commenter concludes that their preference would be for failing hard with detection of the problem and notification to the user if there is a GUI connected and/or running.</summary>
