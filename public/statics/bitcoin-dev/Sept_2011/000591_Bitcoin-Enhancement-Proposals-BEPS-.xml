    <summary>In September 2011, a member of the Bitcoin Development mailing list suggested naming the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) something other than BEP due to potential confusion with BitTorrent EPs. However, another member of the group responded by stating that anyone who is interested in BIPs would be able to easily search for "Bitcoin BEP003" and find what they are looking for. The message also includes a sponsorship message from Splunk, which specializes in making sense of IT infrastructure data.</summary>
