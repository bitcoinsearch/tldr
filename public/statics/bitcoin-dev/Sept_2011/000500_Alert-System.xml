    <summary>The writer suggests that the alert system should relay messages, regardless of the key used, to avoid being biased towards specific clients. However, they warn that if everything is relayed, it could potentially lead to DDoS attacks. The writer proposes requiring proof-of-work for alerts but acknowledges that it defeats the purpose if it takes too long. Instead, they suggest leaving the alert system in place but relaying messages even if they don't use the correct key. This ensures that older clients will still be able to relay new keys added to the alert root trust.</summary>
