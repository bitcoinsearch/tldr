    <summary>In an email exchange on September 26, 2011 at 5:53 PM between "Luke-Jr" and an unknown recipient, they discussed the current allowance of certain transactions in blocks. Luke-Jr's node has always relayed these transactions, and he believes that it shouldn't be punished. The limit of these types of transactions seems pointless to him, especially since people will just add more data. Regarding the coinbase maturity DoS limit, Luke-Jr believes that it should not have a chance of immediately kicking the node as this could happen normally in rare cases. Rejecting these transactions is also relatively cheap, according to Luke-Jr. He does believe that a small DoS score would be reasonable.</summary>
