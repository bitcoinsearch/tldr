    <summary>In a forum post from September 8, 2011, user theymos discussed the importance of an alert system in Bitcoin's network. Theymos stated that the alert system would be crucial in the event of any critical problems within the network. The example given was if there were ever an attacker with over 50% of the computational power, the alert system would be used to notify people to stop accepting transactions. Despite this potential scenario, the user mentions not recalling it ever happening, even though Deepbit has had over 50% of the computational power multiple times.</summary>
