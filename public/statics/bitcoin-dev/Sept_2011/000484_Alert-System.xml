    <summary>There has been discussion regarding the alert protocol in the Bitcoin StackExchange, with concerns raised about potential abuse (spam/DoS) and whether it is necessary. David Perry forked bitcoin/bitcoin and removed the code from main.cpp that makes the questionable call, submitting a pull request for discussion. Gavin Andresen argued that the feature was still more useful than dangerous and suggested consensus should be reached before acting on the pull request. The alert system could be altered so it only carries a notification of an alert, with individual clients checking a central trusted server for actual content. Alert content servers could implement a json api to provide alert content with meta data like target client version and priority. The alert system may be valuable at this stage but could be removed in the future.</summary>
