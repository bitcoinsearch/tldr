    <summary>On the Bitcoin development mailing list, Nils Schneider proposed simplifying the internal reference miner by removing all dependencies on cryptopp, which is used to calculate getwork "midstate". John Smith questioned the loss of compatibility with miners and asked if there was a way to compute midstate with OpenSSL. In response, Schneider suggested that marking midstate (and hash1) as deprecated would allow for cleaner code and provided a pull request at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/538 for this purpose. The change would make the miner calculate midstate from the blockheader instead. Schneider also asked where such a change should be announced so all miners can be upgraded.</summary>
