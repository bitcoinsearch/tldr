    <summary>A new bitcoin pull request has been made to prevent a denial-of-service attack by orphan blocks. Orphan blocks are valid blocks that are not part of the main blockchain. Before this patch, the bitcoin client would store an arbitrary number of them in memory, waiting for them to become part of the main chain. The attack that this new feature prevents is to generate "orphan" blocks and send them to a bitcoin node. Two checks have been added. Firstly, orphan blocks before the last blockchain lock-in are rejected, and if the node sends enough of those obviously-not-part-of-the-main-chain blocks it will be disconnected and banned. Secondly, orphan blocks must have a plausible proof-of-work, as it's impossible for a difficulty 1.0 block to follow a difficulty 1-million block. Orphan blocks with too-low proof-of-work are ignored, and if a node sends ten of them, it is disconnected/banned. Gavin Andresen, who made the pull request, believes that requiring plausible proof-of-work for orphan blocks will make the attack too expensive to attempt.</summary>
