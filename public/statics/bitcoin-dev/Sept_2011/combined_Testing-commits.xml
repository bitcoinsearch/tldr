    <summary>In September 2011, Alex Waters was working on creating a stable build environment for testers. The tasks included building Bitcoin 4.0 source in Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11, creating a package of the build dependencies, and uploading them to SF. Additionally, instructions were to be written for the build process.Alex Waters is working on creating a stable build environment for testers by building bitcoin 4.0 source in both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11, creating a package of build dependencies, and uploading them to SF. He is compiling a list of commits that need testing in both environments, and he encourages users to link pull requests in response to https://github.com/alexwaters/bitcoin/issues/2. Although it is not a requirement for pull requests, it will be helpful to prioritize them. Alex is open to discussing other ways of prioritizing pull requests, but for now, this method appears to be sufficient.The first task on his to-do list is building bitcoin 4.0 source in Windows 7. He expresses concern about the user-facing quality of the software and notes that it is still very beta in quality. He plans to create a package of the build dependencies and upload it to SF, using an outdated but still functional guide provided on bitcointalk.org. Updated instructions for the build process are also available on the same forum. The second task on his list is building bitcoin 4.0 source in Ubuntu 11. Unlike the Windows build, he believes no package is needed, as relevant packages can be apt-getted. There's already good documentation available on doc/build-unix.txt, albeit somewhat ubuntu-specific.Alex is requesting help from others to prioritize pull requests. Linking pull requests to https://github.com/alexwaters/bitcoin/issues/2 with any priority commits for testing or test cases will help in processing important and easy ones quickly. Automated testing scripts could be easily hacked up to automatically sanity-test pull requests as they come in and catch common errors (or just sanity failures). While not a requirement for pull requests, this prioritization system will help process the important/easy ones a lot faster. Waters is open to discussing other ways of prioritizing pull requests, but for the time being, this system seems effective.The author of the context has been trying to keep a low profile and get better acquainted with the project, while doing research on the main contributors. The author is available via various communication channels and promises not to be offended if he is being annoying or stepping on toes. Additionally, the author is working on an idiot proof solution for commit testing to get as many people testing as possible.</summary>
