    <summary>On September 7th, 2011, Gavin Andresen reported that someone had been inserting transactions with a large number of outputs into the main Bitcoin blockchain. The address in question can be viewed on Blockexplorer. The next step for the attacker is to create transactions with thousands of inputs from those transactions, which will result in an excessive use of disk space.Andresen provided a patch for the issue, which can be found on Github. He also requested suggestions on how best to inform merchants, miners, and pools about the potential problem. While he didn't want to take time away from the 0.4 release to re-spin 0.3.24 with the patch, it may be necessary.</summary>
