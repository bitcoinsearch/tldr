    <summary>In a message dated September 30, 2011, Gavin Andresen discusses the possibility of adding more "standard" transaction types in the future. He suggests that using the prototype for a normal escrow transaction, which involves two out of three parties agreeing on a transaction, is more useful than using (a or b) as an example. This prototype still only results in three addresses and at most two signatures, similar to the (A and B) or C case. Andresen also notes that it is possible to replicate the functionality of (a or b) using the two of three model, but this would be inefficient and require the use of a public known key as one of the roles.</summary>
