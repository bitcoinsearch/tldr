    <summary>In September 2011, Alex Waters was working on creating a stable build environment for testers. The tasks included building Bitcoin 4.0 source in Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11, creating a package of the build dependencies, and uploading them to SF. Additionally, instructions were to be written for the build process. It was assumed that Alex was building upon the existing Gitian build stuff.</summary>
