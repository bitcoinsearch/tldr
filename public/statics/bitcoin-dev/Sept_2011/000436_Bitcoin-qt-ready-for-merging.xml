    <summary>In an email thread on August 31, 2011 at 10:20:48 AM, John Smith inquired about how to set build options with qmake for a project that builds on Windows, MacOSX, and Linux. Qmake is a build tool used to generate Makefiles for building Qt-based projects. It is designed to automate the generation of Makefiles so that developers can focus on writing code. When using qmake, build options can be specified in the project file (.pro) using variables and conditionals. The qmake documentation provides detailed information on how to use these features to customize the build process. Additionally, command line options can be passed to qmake when invoking it to override options specified in the project file. Overall, qmake simplifies the build process for multi-platform projects by generating platform-specific Makefiles automatically. By leveraging its customization capabilities, developers can tailor the build process to their specific needs.</summary>
