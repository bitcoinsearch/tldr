    <summary>In this context, the speaker agrees with Jeff's suggestion for a stable 1.0 or 1.1 release of a kernel, but believes that the desire to maintain a 0.4.x stable branch is indicative of a larger quality assurance (QA) problem. The speaker emphasizes the importance of testing and documenting testing procedures for any code submitted via the pull button in order to address the issue tracker backlog. The speaker acknowledges that this stage of development can be tumultuous with code being broken or outpaced easily, and stresses the need for a robust QA process to work out bugs and handle pull requests efficiently. They invite anyone interested in contributing to the bug hammering effort to reach out, promising to make it an interesting and challenging experience. Additionally, the speaker mentions working on a "zapper" tool.</summary>
