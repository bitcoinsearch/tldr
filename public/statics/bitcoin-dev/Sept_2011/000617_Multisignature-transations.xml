    <summary>A developer named Mike Hearn sent an email on September 30, 2011, discussing the initial support for three new types of transactions. The types included (a and b), (a or b), and (a and b) or c. However, one individual questioned if this meant dispute mediation (2-of-3) would not be supported and if CHECKMULTISIG for small numbers of keys would still be allowed. To prevent omitting useful cases, Mike Hearn strongly supported the full Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) boolean validation, despite it being more difficult to obtain good testing confidence.</summary>
