    <summary>In an email exchange on September 14, 2011, Aidan Thornton expressed concern about the potential harm to miners who adopted a scheme that increased the odds of the next block they mined becoming invalid. He suggested delaying the forwarding of such blocks and extending them one more time, which puts miners at risk if they don't follow the policy. However, he also agreed with Luke's suggestion to fix the root cause of the problem, even though it forks the chain. Thornton believes that not fixing the issue makes the bitcoin security model harder to explain and analyze. He stated that "Here is a vulnerability, but its offset by this workaround" is inferior to "the system is secure against this kind of attack".</summary>
