    <summary>On Monday, Gavin Andresen plans to pull changes for the Bitcoin 0.5 release into tip-of-git which may result in chaos and instability. The shift from wxwidgets to qt for the GUI may create issues that need to be resolved. Andresen aims to have a release candidate available in one or two weeks to allow for testing before the 0.5 release is made available approximately a month from now. However, this timeline is subject to change if any major show-stopper bugs, network stability problems, security vulnerabilities, or denial-of-service attacks arise in the interim.</summary>
