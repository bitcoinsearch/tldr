    <summary>In a conversation on September 15, 2011, a user identified as kjj discussed the patterns of transactions on a network. They noted that most transactions follow a standard pattern, and if a transaction deviates from this pattern it may raise suspicion but is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, if a node emits dozens or hundreds of non-standard transactions, it may be reasonable to disconnect them in order to investigate further.However, another user pointed out that it may not be fair to assume that the emitting node is the originator of these transactions. If the node is simply relaying transactions from other sources, disconnecting them may not be an effective solution.</summary>
