    <summary>In an email conversation on September 15, 2011, Gavin Andresen responded to a comment he made about ignoring bandwidth DoS attacks, stating that they already had the -maxreceivebuffer option to handle those. However, another participant disagreed, claiming that the current implementation was a memory exhaustion DoS waiting to happen and did nothing to prevent network flooding. When asked if they submitted a patch to fix it, they replied that it would require the entirety of the p2p network code to be reworked, and large patches were not accepted. This issue had been acknowledged on IRC numerous times and was in public channel logs. The email was signed by Douglas Huff with a PGP signature.</summary>
