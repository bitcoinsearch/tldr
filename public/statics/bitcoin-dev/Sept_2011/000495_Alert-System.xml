    <summary>In an email exchange between Bitcoin developers on September 8, 2011, Luke-Jr suggested that the alert system should relay messages regardless of the key used to avoid favoring one client over another. He noted that if everything is relayed through the alert system, it could have DDoS potential. Mike Hearn had previously expressed concern about Bitcoin's lack of automatic updates or notifications, stating that the network relies on people upgrading for stability, scalability, and new features. Without a way to communicate upgrades to end-users, he believed it would be difficult for Bitcoin to achieve mass market penetration.</summary>
