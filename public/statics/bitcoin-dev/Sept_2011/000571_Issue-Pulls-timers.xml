    <summary>The team wants to avoid abruptly closing pull requests without warning to contributors. The current wording and process needs refinement. Contributors might not track the state of the tree on a daily basis. To solve this, an automated warning email could be sent for outdated issues, similar to bugzilla.redhat.com and other tracker applications. These emails would describe the policy, why it exists and how to avoid automated report closure. The author will write up a message with a link to a rebase walkthrough for contributors before starting the timer. The reason for this move is to clear out some of the older pulls/issues that exist. In the future, the QA process should be good enough so that pulls/issues don't fall behind from lack of testing. Timers should only be used sparingly to sort out pulls/issues the majority doesn't want included in the client.</summary>
