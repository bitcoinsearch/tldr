    <summary>Bitcoin, a software that is crucial for the network, currently lacks an alert system for automatic updates or notifications. The network relies on users upgrading for stability, scalability, and to enable new features. Therefore, it's recommended that the alert system be upgraded to pop up a dialog box every 30 minutes while using the software. In case the alert system goes away, it would just end up being replaced by polling something over HTTP, which is less decentralized than before. Having zero way to communicate upgrades to end-users is a non-starter for anything serious about mass market penetration.</summary>
