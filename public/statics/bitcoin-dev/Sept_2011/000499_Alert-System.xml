    <summary>In an email conversation on September 8, 2011, user "Luke-Jr" expressed skepticism regarding Deepbit's reported control over more than 50% of Bitcoin mining power. Although Deepbit had supposedly reached this level of control multiple times in the past, Luke-Jr claimed to have never seen it happen. The implication was that even if Deepbit did have such control, they had not abused their position to manipulate the market or otherwise harm other users. It is worth noting that an alert would have been issued if Deepbit had demonstrated any problematic behavior while exercising this level of power.</summary>
