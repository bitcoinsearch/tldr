    <summary>On September 2, 2011, Gavin Andresen announced the release of Bitcoin version 0.4 release candidate 1 and requested initial testing. The source code was available on Github for users to try and break it. The most significant visible change in this release was wallet private key encryption, which was not turned on by default. Additionally, internal critical section mutexes have been reworked to address chronic problems with the system becoming unresponsive due to deadlocks.One user congratulated Andresen for the update and noted that the mutex overhaul was much needed. They expressed their happiness to see the project moving quickly all of a sudden. For a detailed list of changes, users can run the command "git shortlog --no-merges v0.3.24." The development team has thanked all contributors who submitted patches, although not all were included in this release.</summary>
