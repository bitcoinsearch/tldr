    <title>Bitcoin Enhancement Proposals (BEPS)</title>
    <updated>2023-06-04T19:55:09.128634+00:00</updated>

    <summary>In this email thread, Gavin Andresen suggests that new transaction forms would be perfect candidates for BEPS and proposes a formal proposal to separate the protocol version from the client version. He also raises concerns about naming the project “BEP,” fearing confusion with BitTorrent EPs in the future. Instead, he suggests alternative names such as "BIP" (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal), "PEB" (Proposal to Enhance Bitcoin), or "BER" (Bitcoin Enhancement Request). Gavin concludes by stating that planning for the name now could save some confusion later, and he does not want BitTorrent folks to get pissed off at them for stealing their acronym.</summary>
