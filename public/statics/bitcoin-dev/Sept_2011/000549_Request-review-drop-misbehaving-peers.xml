    <summary>In a recent message on bitcoin-dev, Gavin Andresen explained why he removed an item from the list. He stated that snarky comments are not appropriate for this platform and admitted to being snarky. He requested that all comments stay on-topic and if someone wants to discuss fixing -maxreceivebuffer, then they should start a new topic. This request was made in response to phantomcircuit's "here's a python script that will kill any bitcoin node on the network" 0-day exploit.</summary>
