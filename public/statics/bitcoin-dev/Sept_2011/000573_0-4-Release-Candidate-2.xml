    <summary>ThiagoCMC, a user on bitcointalk, expressed his appreciation for the automatic generation of new addresses in his "AddressBook" every time he receives Bitcoin. He also likes to track these addresses, but this feature was broken in version 0.3.24. Although it is working again now, Thiago has heard rumors that the feature may be disabled. He pleads with the developers not to disable any features but instead to add an option to turn them on and off. Gavin Andresen announced the release of v0.4.00rc2, which includes optimizations for transactions with lots of inputs, fixes for deadlocks and potential problems with duplicate, un-spendable coinbase transactions.</summary>
