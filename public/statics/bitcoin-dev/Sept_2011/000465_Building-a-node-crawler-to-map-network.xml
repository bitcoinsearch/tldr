    <summary>The conversation is between two individuals, Steve and Mike. Steve is asking Mike if he can direct him to a post or resource that he is looking for but unable to find. Meanwhile, Steve mentions that he doesn't have anything useful to do at the moment as his project PoolServerJ is waiting for several pools to finish testing and move into production. On the other hand, Mike informs Steve that someone has already built what he was looking for and it's running. He also mentions that data is accumulating at the moment, and it will be announced more widely soon. Mike suggests that there's no need to duplicate work.</summary>
