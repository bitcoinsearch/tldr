    <summary>On September 7th, 2011, Gavin Andresen reported that a user had been inserting transactions with multiple outputs into the main Bitcoin blockchain. The address in question can be viewed on Blockexplorer. This could lead to excessive disk space usage due to creation of transactions with thousands of inputs from those transactions. To resolve this issue, Andresen provided a patch for the problem which can be found on Github. However, there are concerns about how merchants, miners, and pools can be informed about the issue.Andresen requested suggestions on how best to inform merchants, miners, and pools about the potential problem. While he didn't want to take time away from the 0.4 release to re-spin 0.3.24 with the patch, it may be necessary. Re-spinning 0.3.24 with the patch may be necessary, but this would delay the release of version 0.4. It is important to note that excessive use of disk space can cause problems when nodes need to access the blockchain data, as it slows down the system. In conclusion, there is an issue with the insertion of transactions with multiple outputs into the main Bitcoin blockchain, leading to excessive disk space usage. A patch has been provided on Github by Gavin Andresen to solve the problem. However, there are concerns about informing merchants, miners, and pools about the potential issue. Re-spinning 0.3.24 with the patch may be necessary, even though it would delay the release of version 0.4.</summary>
