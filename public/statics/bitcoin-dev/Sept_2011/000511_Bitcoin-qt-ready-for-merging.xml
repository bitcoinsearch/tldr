    <summary>In an email conversation on September 11, 2011, John Smith stated that he would only put up a pull request when it is clear that it will actually be integrated. He found it challenging to keep the pull request up-to-date if it lingers for months like many others have. However, Gavin Andresen has not heard any objections to pulling it as soon as 0.4 is officially released, and a couple of people have a chance to read over the differences and ACKnowledge that nothing sinister snuck in somewhere.</summary>
