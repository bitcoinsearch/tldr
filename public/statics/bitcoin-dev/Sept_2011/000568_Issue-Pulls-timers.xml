    <summary>Alex Waters proposed adding timers to the pull requests and issues on GitHub. Outdated pulls that are no longer automatically mergeable will be closed after 15 days, which can be avoided by rebasing the commit. Corresponding issues with no commits will be closed 15 days after their last activity. Closed pull requests and issues will be labeled stagnant and stale, respectively. Requests to reopen them should be submitted to QA at BitcoinTesting.org. To avoid abruptly closing a pull request or issue, contributors will be sent an automated warning email in broad terms with links to rebase a commit and standard expectations. Jeff Garzik recommended avoiding closing without prior warning.</summary>
