    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a key figure in Bitcoin's history, gave a quick status update on version 0.4 in an email sent on September 3rd, 2011. He reported that he wouldn't have time to tackle some issues before Tuesday. Among the problems mentioned were a deadlock between addr-handling and IRC-join-handling code found by sipa, and a deadlock problem on a bitcoind handling getwork requests reported by UukGoblin. Andresen suggested tracking down deadlocks as a way to become more familiar with Bitcoin's code, though it requires patience.Another issue was found by ArtForz, who discovered a performance bug concerning transactions with thousands of inputs and outputs on the solidcoin test network. Though not as significant for Bitcoin, this still posed concerns due to fees being based on transaction size.Lastly, Andresen took responsibility for Gitian not building properly, stating that it was his fault.</summary>
