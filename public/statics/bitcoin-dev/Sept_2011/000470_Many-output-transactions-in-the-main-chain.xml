    <summary>It has been reported that a user has been inserting transactions with multiple outputs into the main bitcoin block chain, which may lead to excessive disk space usage due to creation of transactions with thousands of inputs from those transactions. The suggested solution is a patch provided in Github. However, there are concerns about how merchants, miners, and pools can be informed about the issue. Re-spinning 0.3.24 with the patch may be necessary, though it would delay the release of 0.4 version.</summary>
