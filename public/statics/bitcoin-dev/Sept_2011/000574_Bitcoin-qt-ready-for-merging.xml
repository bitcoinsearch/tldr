    <summary>Bitcoin-qt's qmake build system is still facing various issues. Some regressions remain on the bitcoin-qt branch such as building without DBus still tries to use dbus symbols which results in failed linking, there is no way to disable SSL support for JSON-RPC and UPnP is no longer built or enabled by default. Although, these issues were also present in the old makefiles, it was easier to workaround with DEBUGFLAGS.However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed such as the inability to specify include path or library names for bdb and boost, resulting in a failure to build since bdb C++ includes aren't default on many operating systems. Additionally, there is no way to build with out-of-tree/system cryptopp or json.</summary>
