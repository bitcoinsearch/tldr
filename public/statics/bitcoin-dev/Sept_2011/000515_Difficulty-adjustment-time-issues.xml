    <summary>Bitcoin's code for checking the time, also known as "what time is it" code, is considered a hack. The issue can be fixed by incorporating an NTP library or removing the bitcoin mining code from the client and requiring accurate system clocks within a minute for miners' blocks to be accepted. Gavin Andresen suggests running NTP on systems to produce blocks that the network will accept. As for miners, the community generally supports fixing the issue, and those who intentionally mess with their clock will have to comply.</summary>
