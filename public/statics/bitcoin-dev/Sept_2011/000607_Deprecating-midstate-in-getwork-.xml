    <summary>Nils Schneider wants to simplify the internal reference miner by removing all dependencies on cryptopp. Cryptopp is only used to calculate getwork "midstate", which is redundant and can easily be calculated from the blockheader, so Nils wants to remove it. He asks where such a change should be announced so that all miners can be upgraded. Jeff Garzik responds that one of the pools was already working on something like that and he thinks it can be removed as somebody has already field-tested that guess.</summary>
