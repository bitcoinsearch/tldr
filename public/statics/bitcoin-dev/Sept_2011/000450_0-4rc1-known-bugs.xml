    <summary>In an email to Gavin Andresen, Michael Gronager reported his findings after performing a quick compile and run of bitcoind on Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS. He mentioned that he did not use the UPNP feature and had to make changes in the "makefile.unix" file by defining USE_UPNP:=0 as USE_UPNP:= to avoid any issues. However, he did not encounter any apparent issues while running it. Michael appreciated Gavin's work but suggested a quick cleanup of interfaces and classes, where each file has one class and all interfaces should be defined in headers. He offered to do it himself to enhance the code's flexibility and move towards a more library/interface-like split.Gavin Andresen gave a status update on the 0.4 version of Bitcoin. Sipa found a deadlock issue between addr-handling and IRC-join-handling code. UukGoblin reported a deadlock problem on a bitcoind while handling getwork requests. ArtForz discovered a performance bug with transactions that have thousands of inputs and outputs on the solidcoin test network. Finally, the email signature contained Michael Gronager's contact information, including his mobile number, email address, and his position as the owner of Ceptacle and Director of NDGF at NORDUnet A/S.</summary>
