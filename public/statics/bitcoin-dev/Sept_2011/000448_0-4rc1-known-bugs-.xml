    <summary>On September 3, 2011, Gavin Andresen posted a quick update on the status of version 0.4 of Bitcoin. He mentioned that he might not have time to address certain issues before Tuesday. One of these problems was a potential deadlock between the address handling and IRC join handling code, which had been identified by sipa. Pieter compiled bitcoind with Gavin's DEBUG_LOCKORDER and fixed two potential reported deadlock issues. However, despite no longer receiving deadlock warnings, the problem persisted. Starting up bitcoin with an empty addr.dat seemed to cause the issue every few attempts. Pieter wondered if there was locked code waiting for an event that never occurred. The context suggests that there were technical challenges in developing Bitcoin at this stage.</summary>
