    <summary>In a discussion thread, a user named Steve brought up the possibility of an alert being sent by Satoshi, and how it might be the only way to ever hear from him again. This raised concerns about who has the ability to send such alerts, and whether the system should be changed to ensure that only current developers have such privileges. The idea is to prevent a malicious source from sending an authoritative-looking alert if Satoshi's key has been compromised. These concerns were raised in the context of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, who has not been heard from since 2011.</summary>
