    <summary>Gavin has tagged a 0.4 release and Matt has provided gitian builds for it, which are in gitian-download format and can be automatically downloaded and pgp-verified using the gitian-updater script. However, the current build only contains Matt's signature, so other developers are encouraged to gitian build and re-roll the same zip with other signatures added as well. This would make updating via gitian scripts easy and secure. The gitian builds are available for Linux and Windows platforms, and their download links are provided below: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/bitcoin-0.4.0-linux-gitian.zip http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/bitcoin-0.4.0-win32-gitian.zip. The SHA1 values for these builds are: 3794ec0ce8a3ea96200b3970937c5f224313267d bitcoin-0.4.0-linux-gitian.zipa4857b2238a102d8f4ba9a2bdfed74ddd985ad3d bitcoin-0.4.0-win32-gitian.zip. It is important to note that Matt's email is PGP signed, and developers are encouraged to add their own signatures to the gitian builds to make updating via gitian scripts easy and secure.</summary>
