    <summary>In a discussion thread on September 8, 2011, David Perry questioned whether anyone besides Satoshi had the ability to send an alert regarding Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen confirmed that he did have this ability. Perry then suggested changing the alert system to give this privilege to current developers in case Satoshi's key was compromised and a malicious alert was sent. However, another user argued against this, stating that it would be unnecessary for the key-holder to send two alerts and expressing doubt that Satoshi would allow his key to be compromised. The conversation concluded with the reminder that these alerts are just messages and do not actually affect the functionality of Bitcoin.</summary>
