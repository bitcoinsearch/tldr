    <summary>A proposal has been made to add timers to the pulls/issues on the GitHub repository of Bitcoin. The proposal suggests that if a pull request becomes outdated and is no longer automatically mergeable, it will be closed after 15 days, unless the commit is rebased. The corresponding issue will be labeled as "stagnant". Non-bug issues without any commits will also be closed after 15 days from their last activity, and will be labeled as "stale". Requests to reopen closed pull requests or issues can be submitted to QA at BitcoinTesting.org. The proposed addition of timers is aimed at reducing the number of abandoned and stagnant pulls and issues while focusing attention on priority items and phasing out unwanted changes. It is important to note that QA at BitcoinTesting.org is working unlike QA at Bitcoin.org, which is a sidenote mentioned in the context.</summary>
