    <summary>A group of developers is interested in maintaining version 0.4 as a stable branch with only bug fixes. They have proposed to name the next mainline version after 0.4 as 0.5, so that they can release versions like 0.4.1 and 0.4.2. The developers are asking Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, and others if they would be willing to make the actual release builds and source code available on websites they administrate. Luke and various others in #bitcoin-stable are involved in this proposal.</summary>
