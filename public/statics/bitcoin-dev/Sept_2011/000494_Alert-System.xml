    <summary>In 2011, Mike Hearn expressed his concern about Bitcoin's lack of automatic updates or notifications. He stated that the network heavily relies on user upgrades for stability, scalability, and the enabling of new features. Hearn also argued that if the alert system were to be removed, it would decrease decentralization. He believed that having zero communication with end-users regarding upgrades was unacceptable for anything serious about mass market penetration.To address this issue, Hearn proposed that the alert system should relay messages regardless of the key used, so it wouldn't give any client special status and could be used for other clients as well. Hearnâ€™s suggestion aimed to maintain decentralization while allowing for efficient communication between users and upgrades.</summary>
