    <summary>In an email exchange on September 14, 2011, Gregory Maxwell emphasized the importance of periodic upgrades for general network health and user security. He believed that old versions of Bitcoin should stop working in order to ensure stability and security. However, he also acknowledged the value of backward-compatibility, stating that even the 2-year-old version 0.1 would still work on the current network. This, according to Maxwell, was a selling point for Bitcoin, as it demonstrated the solid foundation of the code. Additionally, Maxwell noted that many users were still using pre-.24 listeners, indicating a need for continued upgrades in the future.</summary>
