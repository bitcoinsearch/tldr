    <summary>The post discusses the idea of automatically disabling DoS protection if a Bitcoin node has less than a certain minimum number of connections. The author suggests that it would be better for the protection to "fail hard" and leave people complaining rather than failing softly. The post also debates whether the node should send a message to the banned peer with a code indicating the reason for the ban, concluding that this could become another potential attack vector. Finally, the discussion raises the question of whether sending lots of messages that don't pass the protocol-level checksum test should be a bannable offense or generally sending garbage data.</summary>
