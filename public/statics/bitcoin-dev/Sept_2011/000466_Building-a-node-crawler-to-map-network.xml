    <summary>The person commenting is looking for a post that they cannot seem to find. They mention having some free time and are waiting for several pools to finish testing and move into production. They express an interest in contributing patches to BitCoinJ or experimenting with writing a proxy to sit in front of bitcoind and multiplex connections, something Gavin has been concerned about recently. The commenter notes that BitCoinJ uses thread-per-connection and allowing it to use a mix of async io and multi-threading would be a nice improvement, but changes would need to be made to bitcoind as well. The commenter offers to discuss the topic further on the bitcoinj list if desired.</summary>
