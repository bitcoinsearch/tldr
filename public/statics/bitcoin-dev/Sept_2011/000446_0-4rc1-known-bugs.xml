    <summary>Gavin Andresen, the lead developer of Bitcoin, gave a quick update on version 0.4. He shared that he won't be able to tackle the issues found by sipa and UukGoblin before Tuesday. Sipa discovered a deadlock between the addr-handling and IRC-join-handling code while UukGoblin reported a deadlock problem on a bitcoind handling getwork requests. Gavin suggested that those interested in getting more familiar with the Bitcoin code should try tracking down deadlocks. Additionally, ArtForz found a performance bug with transactions that have thousands of inputs and outputs on the solidcoin test network. This issue is not as significant for Bitcoin due to fees being based on transaction size, but it's still concerning.</summary>
