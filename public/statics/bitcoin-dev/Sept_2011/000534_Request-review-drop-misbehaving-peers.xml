    <summary>In September 2011, Gavin Andresen requested a review of a pull request on GitHub related to non-standard transactions. He expressed his opinion that these transactions should not be penalized for having insufficient fees. Instead, they should be considered relay/miner policy decisions, which should be made more easily configurable rather than punished for configuration. This approach would help improve the overall protocol of the system.</summary>
