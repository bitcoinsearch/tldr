    <summary>In a recent conversation, Gavin Andresen has confirmed that relaying transactions with fewer than 99 confirmations is currently allowed in blocks. However, the decision to relay or accept such transactions is entirely up to individual discretion. Andresen admits to having made an error in his previous thoughts on the matter, where he mistakenly thought in terms of blocks rather than transactions. Regardless, Andresen seems to have learned from this mistake and hopes to be perfect for the rest of the week.</summary>
