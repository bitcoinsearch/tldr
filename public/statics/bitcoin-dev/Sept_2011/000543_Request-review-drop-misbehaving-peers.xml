    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin's GitHub repository in 2011, Luke-Jr argued against penalising non-standard transactions or those with insufficient fees. Instead, he suggested that these should be considered relay/miner policy decisions and made more easily configurable. He also stated that there is no such thing as non-standard transactions, as it is simply transactions outside the bounds of what a user or miner will accept/relay. Penalising for transactions falling outside personal policies could result in banning legitimate nodes.While standardness is an artificial construct that only has meaning to the software implementation, the vast majority of transactions follow a particular pattern. If someone gives a non-standard transaction, it may be suspicious but not a big deal. However, if they send many non-standard transactions, it is reasonable to disconnect them until you figure out what's going on.</summary>
