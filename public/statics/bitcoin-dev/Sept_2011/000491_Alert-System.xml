    <summary>The Bitcoin alert system has been a topic of discussion among developers. Some have criticized the system, however, others argue that it is not a significant concern. Those who support the system say that even if someone managed to compromise the private key, the most they could do is spam graffiti messages or try phishing. There are much worse things that could happen to the network, in which case an alert system could come in very handy. Furthermore, the transfer of the key from Satoshi to Gavin ensures that only authorized individuals will be able to send alerts. Pieter Wuille suggested using the alert system to ask people to upgrade to recent versions of the client when needed. He believes there may come a moment when it will be necessary to use it for that purpose. The next generation virtual desktops provide companies with an easier-to-deploy, easier-to-manage, and more affordable virtual desktop model.</summary>
