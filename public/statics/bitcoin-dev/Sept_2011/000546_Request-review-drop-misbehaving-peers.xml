    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in September 2011, Laszlo Hanyecz expressed his disapproval of peer disconnection in the reference client implementation. He likened it to using packet filters and stateful firewalls which require constant tweaking based on local policy and cause problems when changes in usage dictate allowing something that wasn't allowed before. He suggested that this kind of filtering would be better implemented in a separate bitcoin proxy, like a firewall between a router and network. Hanyecz believed that any type of built-in filtering is limiting to future innovation and that people's policies will differ greatly. Responding to Luke-Jr's comment about penalizing non-standard transactions, kjj argued that while standardness is an artificial construct that has no meaning in the context of the protocol or the system as a whole, the vast majority of all transactions follow a particular pattern. While receiving one non-standard transaction might not be a big deal, if someone emits dozens or hundreds, it is hardly unreasonable to disconnect them until their intentions are clear. However, Luke-Jr disagreed, stating that there is no such thing as "non-standard transactions," and it is legitimate for other users/miners to relay/accept transactions more liberally, leading to banning many legitimate nodes.</summary>
