    <summary>On September 9, 2011, Gavin Andresen tagged the git tree v0.4.00rc2, which fixed several issues from the previous release candidate. These fixes included optimizing database writes for transactions with lots of inputs, fixing a deadlock that could occur when adding addresses from 'addr' messages and IRC, and addressing a potential problem with duplicate, un-spendable coinbase transactions if generating bitcoins with a locked wallet and running out of keypool keys. Jeff Garzik from exMULTI, Inc. inquired about uploading the source code and builds to SF.</summary>
