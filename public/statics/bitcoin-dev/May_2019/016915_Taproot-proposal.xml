    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed a Taproot softfork that includes several ideas like Merkle branches to hide the unexecuted branches in scripts, Schnorr signatures to enable wallet software to use key aggregation/thresholds within one input, improvements to the signature hashing algorithm, replacing OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY) with OP_CHECKSIGADD, Tagged hashing for domain separation, extensibility through leaf versions, OP_SUCCESS opcodes, and upgradable pubkey types. The BIP drafts can be found on Github. An initial reference implementation of the consensus changes is available on Github. However, there are some ideas that are not incorporated into this proposal. It may be useful to have a way to add a salt to tap branches and to sign an additional script (not committed to by the witness program).</summary>
