    <summary>On May 22, 2019, Russell O'Connor sent an email regarding Oracle signature verification and discrete log contracts. According to him, these two operations enable Oracle signature verification, including discrete log contracts. However, Jonas informed him that he had misunderstood how discrete log contracts work. The DLC signatures are not directly checked by Script and do not rely on CHECKSIGFROMSTACK. Russell apologized for his hasty literature review.</summary>
