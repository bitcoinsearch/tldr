    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Pieter Wuille raised concerns about how directly observing the difficulty in script language could complicate the implementation of mempools and make reasoning about the validity of unconfirmed transactions harder. To address this issue, a proposal was made to expose the sum of accumulated proof-of-work (PoW) instead of the difficulty value. This would only rise unless there is a reorganization after a difficulty drop caused by blacklisting a valid block several blocks back in the chain. The proposed solution mimics the effect of the block number, which only grows. If implemented, the script would estimate the accumulated PoW at a given time and put that value into the script.</summary>
