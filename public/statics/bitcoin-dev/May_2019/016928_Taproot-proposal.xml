    <summary>In a conversation between Johnson and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the possibility of signing an additional script. Johnson suggests using the annex, but ZmnSCPxj argues that it would not be possible since the whole annex is signed. Instead, ZmnSCPxj suggests using another leaf version. This new leaf version would have a delegation key as its script, with the actual script and signature from the delegation key on top of the witness stack. This method hides the existence of a delegation key from the output and allows for the use of alternate scripts without revealing the possibility of delegation.</summary>
