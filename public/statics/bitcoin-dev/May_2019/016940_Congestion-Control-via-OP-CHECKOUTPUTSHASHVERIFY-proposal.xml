    <summary>In a recent email exchange, two individuals discussed the issue of Bitcoin users discarding their keys. Jeremy stated that Bitcoin does not do anything to prevent this from happening and he believes it will not be fixed anytime soon. However, ZmnSCPxj mentioned that in some protocols, if a key was once known to the recipients, it may make it legally valid to inflict a punitive measure. He also noted that recipients can always choose to destroy the privkey after providing a signature for a challenge string, and they can insist on not cooperating to sign using the taproot branch, thus forcing spending via the OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY.</summary>
