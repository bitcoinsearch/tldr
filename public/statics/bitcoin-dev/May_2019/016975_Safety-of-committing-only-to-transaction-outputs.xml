    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeremy suggested some ways to improve witness replay-ability. He proposed salting the taproot key or the taproot leaf script at the last stage of a congestion control tree. However, he noted that the salt won't help if the address is reused. Furthermore, he suggested making chaperone signatures opt-in as there may be cases where they are not necessary. He mentioned OP_COSHV as being compatible with an additional checksig operation. Additionally, he proposed other mechanisms, including OP_CHECKINPUTSHASHVERIFY and OP_CHECKFEEVERIFY, that can improve safety and restrict replayability. OP_CHECKINPUTSHASHVERIFY allows checking that the hash of the inputs is a particular value, which is useful for other applications as well. On the other hand, OP_CHECKFEEVERIFY allows explicit commitment to the exact amount of fee, limiting replay to transactions funded with the exact amount of the prior. However, transactions using it must have all inputs/outputs set. Overall, these proposals offer ways to enhance witness replay-ability and improve safety in blockchain transactions.</summary>
