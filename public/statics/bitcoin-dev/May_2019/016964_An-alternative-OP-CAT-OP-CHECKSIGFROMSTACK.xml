    <summary>Russell O'Connor proposed the implementation of two new operations, OP_CAT and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY, to enable new features for Bitcoin. These operations would allow for Oracle signature verification, amortized secure multiparty computations, transaction introspection and weak covenants. These operations are pure computational operations on stack values and would not complicate the specification of Bitcoin operations. The message that would be signed using OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY could be any type of protocol-specific binary data, depending on the application. This proposal aims to build general-purpose tools that can be used for a variety of purposes, instead of narrow applications that complicate the interpretation of Bitcoin operations. Despite its potential usefulness, this proposal does not enable more interesting recursive covenants without the availability of an OP_PUBKEYTWEEK operation.</summary>
