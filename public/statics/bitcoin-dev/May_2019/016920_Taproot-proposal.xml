    <summary>Pieter responded to comments on the proposed BIP, addressing concerns about the use of tagging and caching across different data types. He also explained the use of an unknown discrete logarithm as an internal key and how it can be made provably unknown for all signers. With regards to Schnorr usage, Pieter stated that spending with the internal key requires a single Schnorr signature, while individual branches may use Schnorr only if they are marked as tapscript spend. However, tapscript is not mandatory because other leaf versions are undefined and left for future extensions. Lastly, Pieter suggested using the annex construction in the proposed BIP to deal with the functionality of BIP115.</summary>
