    <summary>The author of the given context has proposed a solution to aggregate spending from different wallets into one transaction for efficiency and convenience in certain circumstances. They have shared an idea regarding applying stateful signers that store trusted xpubs to apply it to stateless hardware wallets, which could distinguish the trusted output even if the inputs are not derived from the same set of xpubs. However, this idea seems to be an attempt at a different and broader problem. The author suggests constructing an auxiliary text with a code word marking 'epoch' of the package, which will be displayed prominently. In case of compromise, new trusted-xpub packages would use a different 'epoch' code word. This method makes the solution stateless, whereas having a counter inside the hardware wallet and checking package version against it would make it stateful.</summary>
