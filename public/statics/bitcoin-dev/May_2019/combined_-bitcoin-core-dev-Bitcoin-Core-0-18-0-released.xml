    <summary>Bitcoin Core 0.18.0 will no longer provide 32-bit Windows builds. Instead, users are advised to switch to the 64-bit build. Additionally, an experimental Bitcoin Core snap package is available in the snap store. This package includes a track for the latest release as well as each major version branch that has not yet reached its end-of-life. The snap package uses signed release binaries, although there is currently no known method of generating the hash of binaries installed via snap that works on any Linux distribution.However, some distributions may generate hashes using `sha256sum /var/lib/snapd/snap/bitcoin-core/current/{bin/*,snap/snapcraft.yaml}` which can then be compared to the signed ones as usual. The availability of the Bitcoin Core snap package provides an alternative method of installation for users who prefer it. It is important for users to take note of these changes and adjust their usage accordingly.</summary>
