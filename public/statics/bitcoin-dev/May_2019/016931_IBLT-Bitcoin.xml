    <summary>ZmnSCPxj shared the latest proposal for improved transaction relay which uses Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes for set reconciliation. The proposal can be found on GitHub minisketch. In an email to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Christopher DeLucia shared a paper he produced in 2017 on IBLT applications and Bitcoin. The paper references research done by Gavin Andresen and Rusty Russell, however, it was not peer-reviewed and was just for class. Although DeLucia has not looked at the paper or Bitcoin since 2017, he shared it with the community in case it could contribute anything.</summary>
