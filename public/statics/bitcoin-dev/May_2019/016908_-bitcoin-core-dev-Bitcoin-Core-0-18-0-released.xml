    <summary>Bitcoin Core 0.18.0 will no longer provide 32-bit Windows builds. Users are advised to switch to the 64-bit build. Additionally, an experimental Bitcoin Core snap package is available in the snap store. It includes a track for the latest release and each major version branch that's not yet EOL. The snap package uses signed release binaries, but there is no known way to generate the hash of binaries in an installed snap that works on any Linux distribution. Some distributions may generate hashes using `sha256sum /var/lib/snapd/snap/bitcoin-core/current/{bin/*,snap/snapcraft.yaml}` which can then be compared to the signed ones as usual.</summary>
