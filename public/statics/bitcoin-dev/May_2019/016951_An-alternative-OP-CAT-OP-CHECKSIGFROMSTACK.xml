    <summary>A recent proposal suggests implementing OP_CAT and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY opcodes for Bitcoin Script as a means of enabling new features for the cryptocurrency. These two operations will enable Oracle signature verification, amortized secure multiparty computations, and transaction introspection including simulated SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, determining if a transaction has exactly one input or not, weak covenants which can verify output scripts, and more. The semantics of these pure computational operations on stack values is straightforward, and adding them does not preclude the addition of more specialized opcodes in the future. This approach embodies the idea of "programmable money," providing general purpose tools that can be used for a variety of purposes. In contrast, other proposals such as SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and OP_CHECKOUTPUTHASHVERIFY are deemed too narrow-minded and would complicate the specification of Bitcoin operations by extending the semantic domain.</summary>
