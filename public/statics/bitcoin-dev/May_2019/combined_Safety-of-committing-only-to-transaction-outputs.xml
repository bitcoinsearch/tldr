    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeremy Rubin proposed several mechanisms to improve safety and replayability in a congestion control tree. He suggested salting the taproot key or leaf script at the last stage for witness replayability. Additionally, he suggested making chaperone signatures opt-in, as there may be cases where they are not necessary. OP_COSHV is compatible with an additional checksig operation. Other proposed mechanisms include OP_CHECKINPUTSHASHVERIFY which allows checking that the hash of inputs is a particular value, and OP_CHECKFEEVERIFY which enables explicit commitment to the exact amount of fee. The discussion revolves around the approach that enables witnesses to commit only to transaction outputs but not inputs. The existing bitcoin script system offers three options: committing to both inputs and outputs, committing to only inputs but not outputs, or not committing to any input nor output. However, the last option is unsafe as it allows relay/mining nodes to redirect payment to any output of their choice. Furthermore, the witness/scriptSig is replayable, making it easy for future payments to be swept immediately. To address this, three active proposals are put forward, namely CAT and CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS), ANYPREVOUT (aka NOINPUT), and CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY (COHV). These proposals ensure that redirecting payment is impossible. However, not committing to any input means that the witness is replayable without the consent of the address owner. The ANYPREVOUT proposal addresses this by requiring a chaperone signature that commits to input. Johnson Lau suggests always requiring a "safe" signature that commits to at least one input to improve security. However, this interacts poorly with the unknown public key type upgrade path described in bip-tapscript since it would require a hardfork to turn an unknown type sig into a safe sig. Despite this, a new leaf version could be used every time a new sighash type is introduced to create a new definition for a "safe sig". Customized sighash policies could be implemented with CAT/CSFS. Overall, these proposals offer ways to enhance witness replay-ability and improve safety in blockchain transactions.</summary>
