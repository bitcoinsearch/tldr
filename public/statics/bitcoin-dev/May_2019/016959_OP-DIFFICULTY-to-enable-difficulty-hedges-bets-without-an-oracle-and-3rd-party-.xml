    <summary>Tamas Blummer proposes a new opcode, OP_DIFFICULTY, for Bitcoin to offer native risk management for miners' biggest risk - difficulty change. This would allow for a self-contained solution that does not rely on external markets or oracles. The proposal involves using nLocktime denominated in block height and a multi-sig escrow for those who enter the bet. The winner would broadcast, and the transaction would not carry any counterparty risk. Nathan Cook suggests an alternative approach with OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT proposed by Luke Dashjr but Tamas argues this would not work as it fetches block hash and not the content of the header. Tamas plans to draft a BIP for this opcode and seeks feedback.</summary>
