    <summary>The author believes that the ultimate goal for Bitcoin should be to reach a point where the bitcoin consensus does not need updating. However, this may not happen in their lifetime. The idea of having a minimum time between soft forks and finalized consensus-change implementation is not feasible in a decentralized network like Bitcoin, as soft forks can be done as and when required. The author argues that bundling multiple consensus changes is not safer and could lead to more bugs. Instead, keeping things simple is crucial for security. One solution could be to be more direct about how decisions are made. The author also mentions BIP 8 with LOT=TRUE as a better activation mechanism option for Taproot, but some influential developers wrote misleading and unsafe comments about it on social media. Despite negative opinions about UASF, some people believe that speedy trial is the best thing Bitcoin has ever experienced. Michael Folkson also had an opinion on the activation mechanism.</summary>
