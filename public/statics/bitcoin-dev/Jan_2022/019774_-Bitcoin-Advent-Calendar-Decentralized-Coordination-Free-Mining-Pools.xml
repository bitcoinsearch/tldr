    <summary>In an online discussion, @vjudeu suggested introducing signing into mining to increase security. However, another participant, Jeremy, expressed concern that this would create a barrier for some miners who have the computing power to produce blocks but lack the necessary permission to sign them. Jeremy argued that this would shift the consensus from "the heaviest chain" to "the heaviest signed chain", which would compromise the reliability of the system. In response, @vjudeu clarified that their suggestion did not involve adding a barrier and explained that miners would sign a superblock with a public key after mining a valid Bitcoin block. This would still be connected to something secured by proof-of-work (PoW). Another participant noted that this is a key ingredient for DCFMP, which relies on an opt-in set of rules for sharing bounties in exchange for future shares.</summary>
