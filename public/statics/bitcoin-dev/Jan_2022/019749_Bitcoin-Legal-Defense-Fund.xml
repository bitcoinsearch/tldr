    <summary>In an email conversation, Prayank provided some suggestions regarding the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund. Firstly, Prayank suggested that the name of the fund could be confusing or misleading for newbies, as it is not an official Bitcoin entity. Secondly, Prayank recommended that people involved in the fund should avoid commenting on or influencing soft fork related discussions. The fund's administrator, Jack, agreed with both points and mentioned that he would come up with a better name for the fund. Additionally, Jack stated that he will consider the board operating principles which will publicly share the criteria for how cases are chosen to protect against the board and fund influencing direction. Jack welcomed ideas and suggestions from Prayank.</summary>
