    <summary>The first meeting for CTV is scheduled to take place on Tuesday at 12:00 PM PT. A preliminary agenda and time allocation have been included based on feedback, with the main part of the meeting running for 1.5 hours, followed by a 30-minute post-meeting discussion of broader next steps and consensus-seeking processes. The meeting aims to provide an overview of BIP and Q&amp;A, implementation and testing, proposed timeline technical feasibility, feedback on how to structure a bounty program, open-ended feedback, and what's required to get consensus/next steps.The subtopics under the overview of BIP and Q&amp;A include what CTV does, which fields are in the digest, the order/structure of fields in the digest, the half-spend problem/solution, using a NOP v.s. successX/legacy script types, using sha256 v.s. Ripemd160, and general Q&amp;A. The subtopics under implementation and testing include implementation walkthrough, validation burdens &amp; caching, vectors: tx_valid.json + tx_invalid.json + transaction hashes checking, and functional test walkthrough. The meeting will also discuss soft signals utxos.org/signals and activation mechanisms. The agenda does not thoroughly cover alternatives to CTV. The specific applications built on CTV will be best reviewed in follow-up meetings as technical evaluation of how well CTV works for use cases requires a deep understanding of how the CTV primitive works. The meeting is tightly scheduled to respect everyone's time and ensure high productivity. The email includes helpful links for deepening understanding on covenant properties, proposals, and varieties.If particular topics important to attendees are not represented in this agenda, they can drop a note, and an endeavor will be made to ensure they are either slotted into this meeting or included in a second meeting. There will be room for follow-ups or further exploration at future meetings or as mailing list follow-ups.</summary>
