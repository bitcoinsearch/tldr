    <summary>The message is inquiring about the ability to distinguish between two dust UTXOs used in lightning anchor outputs. The author wonders if the protocol could force the user to spend the first of the two outputs and if there is a way to know which output will be spent faster than the other. The author also points out that values equal to or less than $1 are rarely spent unless forced to do so and suggests storing them separately, along with non-standard and burned UTXOs. The inquiry notes that this information may make a difference. Additionally, the message includes a link to a website showing the number of Bitcoin addresses holding â‰¤$1, indicating that this value does not change much over time.</summary>
