    <summary>There is a discussion going on about the possibility of creating complex or recursive covenants with TXHASH + CSFSV. One participant states that typically CAT is needed to create such constructions. However, another participant disagrees and points out the example of txhash equalverify as a recursive covenant. They also suggest that with a little extra work, one can control for amounts and other details in these constructions.</summary>
