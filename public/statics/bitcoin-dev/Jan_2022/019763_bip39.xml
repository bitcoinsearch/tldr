    <summary>It has been observed that the words 'art', 'work', and 'artwork' can cause confusion when written down due to their adjacency and different meanings. Though not a big issue, it would be nice to clean up this ambiguity. Additionally, there is a list of word pairs with identical sounds but different spellings such as 'canal' and 'arm' versus 'can' and 'alarm'. This list contains other word pairs such as 'card' versus 'danger' and 'catch' versus 'chair'. Overall, these observations highlight the importance of clear communication and avoiding potential confusion in writing.</summary>
