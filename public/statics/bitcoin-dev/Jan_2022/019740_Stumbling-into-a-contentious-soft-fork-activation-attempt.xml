    <summary>In a message to Peter, Jeremy Rubin expressed gratitude for his review and feedback of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). In response to difficulties in reviewing, Rubin clarified that the branch linked from the BIP was not the latest and directed Peter to the correct PR for review. Rubin also sought guidance on best practices for linking to BIPs and implementations given the need to rebase and respond to feedback with changes. He acknowledged that the taproot BIPs do not link to a reference implementation of Taproot, and said he would suggest an edit to point it to the PR while recognizing that this is not ideal. Peter raised concerns about a discrepancy between the BIP and the implementation regarding caching and DoS not being addressed, which Rubin acknowledged was an oversight on his part. He explained that caching was required to avoid DoS and that he would add a note to the BIP about its importance. Rubin emphasized that this was not a mis-considered part of CTV and that the reference implementation had been designed specifically to avoid quadratic hashing while being friendly to caching. He also stated that he would make a PR to more clearly describe how caching should be used to avoid DoS. Rubin concluded by thanking Peter for bringing up these issues, which would improve the reviewability of the BIPs.</summary>
