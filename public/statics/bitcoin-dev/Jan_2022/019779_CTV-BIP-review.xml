    <summary>In an email exchange between Luke Dashjr and Eric Voskuil, they discussed the compatibility of soft forks with regards to the Bitcoin consensus protocol. Dashjr argued that soft forks are not backward compatible without "hash power enforcement" which can only be done by miners, and that observed chain splits have occurred in large scale soft fork deployments which were resolved through hash power enforcement. Voskuil disagreed, stating that enforcement of the Bitcoin consensus protocol is by users, not miners, and that soft forks never produce a chain split. Dashjr also called out Voskuil for making misleading statements about BIP8 and Taproot activation, accusing him of deception.</summary>
