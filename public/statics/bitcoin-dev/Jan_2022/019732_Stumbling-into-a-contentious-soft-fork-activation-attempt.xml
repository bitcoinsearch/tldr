    <summary>Prayank Gahlot has shared updates on their work related to OP_CTV. This includes reviewing pull request 21702 and working on writing contracts using the programming language Sapio based on their own ideas. They believe that a few months are enough time for the recent bounty to find bugs and complete other tasks related to OP_CTV. Prayank plans to attend IRC workshops on BIP 119 and encourages skeptics to participate in technical discussions. On the other hand, Michael Folkson questioned Prayank's assessment that OP_CTV should be ready to go in a few months. He cited concerns about the utility and safety of the opcode. Michael also encouraged Prayank to engage with skeptics on technical concerns and expressed skepticism about an imminent soft fork activation attempt. Prayank responded by stating that they have dedicated enough time reading about OP_CTV and would NACK Core PRs if they found issues. They believe that multiple programming languages would be beneficial for application developers. Prayank plans to attend the IRC workshops and believes that documenting support for a proposal is not irresponsible.However, Michael expressed concern about the potential short-term damage that could result from a contentious soft fork activation attempt. He contrasted Jeremy Rubin's approach to promoting OP_CTV with the authors and contributors of another soft fork proposal, BIP 118, who are building out and testing use cases. Michael encouraged skeptical engagement in technical discussions and emphasized that the high bar on readiness should apply to all proposals. There is a debate about stopping soft forks that improve Bitcoin, as some believe they are biased and non-technical. The idea of enabling covenants on Bitcoin is a significant change that has not been heavily researched. Some individuals are attempting to rush the implementation of this feature soon after Taproot activation, but others argue it should be resisted. Despite differing opinions, there do not seem to be any issues with implementing a soft fork in the next few months if it is deemed ready. There are no restrictions on researching covenants, and everything surrounding this topic is public.</summary>
