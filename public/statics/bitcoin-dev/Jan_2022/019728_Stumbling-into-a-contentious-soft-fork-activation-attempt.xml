    <summary>The writer of an article on the regularity of soft forks has expressed concern over a possible contentious soft fork attempt, specifically the enabling of a new opcode called OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (OP_CTV) proposed in BIP 119. The author believes that proponents of the proposal are irresponsibly pushing for an imminent activation of a soft fork, despite the lack of testing and research on the potential downsides of the new opcode. While there is enthusiasm for the speculated use cases of OP_CTV, the author argues that attempting to rush it through so soon after the Taproot activation should be resisted, as enabling covenants on Bitcoin is a big step change with barely any existing research on the topic. The article encourages community vigilance to prevent Ethereum-style seat-of-our-pants consensus changes.</summary>
