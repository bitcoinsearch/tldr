    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, AdamISZ shared an idea for a trustless transfer of control of a UTXO from one party to another with no interaction with the rest of the group, at the time of transfer. He proposed using signature adaptors and CTV or a similar covenant to achieve this, but noted the limitations and extreme assumptions required. In his gist, he mentions comparison to statechains or payment pools, which make different tradeoffs against the 'digital cash' type of goal. While the idea, called "pathcoin," may not be viable yet, he published it in the hopes that imaginative minds on the list might develop it further. Another member of the mailing list suggested combining AdamISZ's idea with the Sabu protocol to get closer to a solution. A link to a write-up on the Sabu protocol was provided.</summary>
