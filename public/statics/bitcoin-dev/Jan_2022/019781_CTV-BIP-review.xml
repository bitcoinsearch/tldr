    <summary>In this email thread, Jeremy Rubin thanks Luke Dashjr for his detailed review of CTV and stated that he will make a PR to clear up some language cleanups. Although he agrees with the need for drafting BIPs for specific use cases, he is skeptical about its overall approach as he believes that applications do not necessarily have to be standard. He suggests reviewing application-focused posts in rubin.io/advent21 and creating a BIP describing how to build something like Sapio to help users think through how to compile to CTV contracts.Luke Dashjr, in response, does not believe that CTV is ready yet and thinks that BIP 9 is flawed with known vulnerabilities. He believes that fully implemented BIPs for at least one of the claimed CoinJoin improvements should be in place before activation. He also questions why congestion-controlled transactions have not been thought through yet and suggests that Speedy Trial should be used instead of BIP 9 for future deployments. He discusses the limitations of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and how it restricts covenants to simple templates. Finally, he questions the use of nLockTime and suggests creating a UTXO both cold+hot can spend and then throwing away the hot key.</summary>
