    <summary>Bitcoin Developers are set to have their second recurring meeting on Tuesday, January 25th at 12:00 PT in channel ##ctv-bip-review in libera.chat IRC server. The meeting is expected to take approximately two hours and cover various topics. These topics include an update on Bounty Program &amp; Feedback, Feedback Recap, What is Sapio / How to think about Programming with CTV, Vaults, Congestion Control, Payment Pools, and General Q&amp;A. The Feedback Recap section will review recent feedback or reviews of CTV from Luke Dashjr, James O'Beirne, and Peter Todd. Topics covered in this section include concerns about activation logic and minor performance regression due to the cache precomputations. Rubin responds with patches for an improved caching strategy. Todd reviewed the BIP and an outdated implementation and found that the testing, analysis of validation resources, and quality of proof of concept applications were insufficient. The What is Sapio / How to think about Programming with CTV section will explore resources such as https://learn.sapio-lang.org/ch02-00-bip-119.html, https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2021/12/06/advent-9/, and https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2021/12/15/advent-18/.
