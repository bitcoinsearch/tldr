    <summary>The Bitcoin Core has a preference towards peers that listen on port 8333, and it does not provide incoming connections to those who do not listen on this port. However, ISPs can block this default port, which poses a problem for users in countries that use basic methods to block connections. To address this issue, pull requests were merged in October and November 2021 for Bitcoin Core, allowing non-default ports to be used for automatic connections. While there were no major issues found during the review process, one reviewer did have some nits, including a discussion on the mailing list.The option to change the default port was added in May 2011 by Gavin Andresen after a user posted about issues with the default port on bitcointalk in July 2010. Additionally, a PowerShell script was written and tested on v22.0 and PR branch to ban all peers every 100 seconds using the default port and was found to work as expected. The default ports used in Bitcoin Core are 8333 (mainnet), 18333 (testnet), 18444 (regtest), and 38333 (signet).It is uncertain whether Satoshi considered the fact that 8333 in leet becomes 'beee' in plaintext when hardcoding the default port for Bitcoin. However, the bad ports list added in PR #23542 is still not clear. Prayank informed the community about automatic outgoing connections to a peer at addr:port if the port is not 8333 and clarified that the discussion is solely based on this matter to avoid any confusion. The details and justifications regarding the same can be found in the PR available on GitHub. Vasil Dimov signed off with his email ID and a quote by Winston Churchill on diplomacy.</summary>
