    <summary>In this context, the author reviews the BIP and discusses various aspects of Covenants, including Congestion Controlled Transactions, Payment Channels, and CoinJoin improvements. The author argues that BIP 119 has limitations, and it is necessary to address them. The author also notes that the use of BIP 9 for deployment is flawed and vulnerable, and it should not be used again. Instead, future deployments should use BIP 8 until a better solution is developed. Additionally, the author points out that P2SH is incompatible with CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, and covenants are restricted to simple templates. Finally, the author discusses how the new rule will impact policy and validity.</summary>
