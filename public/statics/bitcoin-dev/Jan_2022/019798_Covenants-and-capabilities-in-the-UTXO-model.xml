    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bram Cohen raised concerns about a proposal that would require nodes to keep around the whole blockchain, potentially causing scalability issues. He pointed out that Monero's UTXO set is already the whole blockchain due to the difficulty in determining what has been spent and what hasn't been. Allowing references to old blocks could result in a similar situation for Bitcoin, which would cause problems for pruned nodes. The suggestion of only pointing back so far was also dismissed, as it would make transactions invalid and could lead to issues during reorgs. This highlights the importance of carefully considering proposals before implementing them to ensure they don't cause unintended consequences.</summary>
