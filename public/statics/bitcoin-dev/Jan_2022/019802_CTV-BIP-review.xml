    <summary>In a discussion about the activation method for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 8 and BIP 9/ST, there was disagreement over the characterization of these proposals. The only material distinction between them, according to Eric Lombrozo, is activation with or without majority hash power support. BIP9/ST requires this support while BIP8 does not. This issue has been central to the discussion, and there was no compromise made on it in Taproot.Billy Tetrud pointed out factual errors in LukeJr's mention and implications around BIP8 and agreed with Michael that the discussion should be kept separate from the BIPs themselves. Tetrud suggested that BIPs should not advocate for any particular activation method but should only mention what types of activation methods are possible. Separation of concerns would be useful to reduce noise in conversations.</summary>
