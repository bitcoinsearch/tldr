    <summary>The context discusses the application of OP_CTV and its alternative covenant constructions. The use of ANYPREVOUT-based covenants is suggested as a viable option to enable similar benefits. It is pointed out that the script of Taproot leaves can be set to CHECKSIGVERIFY CHECKSIGVERIFY with ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT signature of the CET for public key P=G. Signature creation has a negligible computational cost when using nonce R=G. However, it is noted that this method has an additional overhead of 64 witness bytes compared to CTV.</summary>
