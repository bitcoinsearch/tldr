    <summary>The Bitcoin development mailing list is the platform for discussing issues related to software engineering principles in soft forks. The email thread on the list revolves around the complexities of making changes to the consensus protocol of Bitcoin. Unlike bugs that can be easily reverted in social media apps, a consensus change is extremely hard to revert and requires a hard fork. Due to the security-critical nature of Bitcoin, it cannot be treated like any other software project, and soft fork features need to be thoroughly tested before deployment.One of the challenges with introducing a consensus change through a soft fork is achieving community consensus. If this consensus is not achieved, the network can split in multiple ways. The debate on the mailing list also highlights the need for better terminology to describe the different types of soft forks. Disagreements and forks are common in Bitcoin, but it is crucial to ensure they are well defined and clean.In conclusion, the email thread cautions against bundling changes in soft forks, as it reduces the number of qualified reviewers for a proposal. However, the exact context of the email is unclear, as it simply states that something is unlikely to occur in the future. The email includes links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and the Linux Foundation website.</summary>
