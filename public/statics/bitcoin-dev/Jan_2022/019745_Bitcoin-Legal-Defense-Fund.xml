    <summary>The Bitcoin ecosystem has created a fund to defend developers against lawsuits related to their activities. The fund's main purpose is to cover legal expenses, develop litigation strategy, and retain defense counsel for the accused. Meanwhile, in India, the Internet Freedom Foundation supports digital freedom and privacy and has been supportive of Bitcoin. It would be interesting to explore including them in this initiative.</summary>
