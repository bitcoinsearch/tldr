    <summary>The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF) might offer representation or file an amicus brief for a precedent-setting case, whether it directly involves bitcoin or not. Such cases could involve developers of alternative projects and heading off a strong precedent for other communities would be protective for Bitcoiners in general. The BLDF is primarily focused on things impacting the developers of Bitcoin or software for bitcoin specifically. However, the legal team behind BLDF is expected to form a coherent strategy around what is relevant to Bitcoin defense, even if the particulars of a case are not directly about Bitcoin. Jeremy Rubin hopes that the fund will not finance lawsuits irrelevant to bitcoin. Aymeric Vitte suggests more neutral names for the fund, potentially covering others than Bitcoin, mimicking EFF, and referring to Satoshi's paper where everything started. Jack agrees with the suggestions and welcomes more ideas and suggestions.</summary>
