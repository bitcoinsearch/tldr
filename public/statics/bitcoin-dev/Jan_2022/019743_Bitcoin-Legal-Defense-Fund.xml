    <summary>Recently, Ren√© Pickhardt asked if a fund will be created to educate developers about the risks they face in order to avoid legal pressure before it arises. Blockchain Commons has started a project led by Namcios and Christopher Allen to document the best practices of pseudonymous development. This project is part of their 2022 roadmap and is currently a work-in-progress. They welcome issues, reviews, and contributions to their GitHub repository, where the project is hosted.</summary>
