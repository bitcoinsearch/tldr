    <summary>The discussion on the legal definition of covenant arose in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, with Jeremy expressing annoyance over it. In response, aj proposed a more useful definition of covenant within the context of Bitcoin. According to aj, a covenant is when the scriptPubKey of an unspent transaction output (utxo) restricts the scriptPubKey in the outputs of a transaction that spends that utxo. aj went on to clarify that CTV and TLUV do have this type of restriction, while CSV and CLTV do not. He also noted that "checksig" doesn't necessarily fall under the definition of covenant, but if the signature used in checksig is in the scriptPubKey rather than the scriptSig or witness, it could potentially be considered a covenant as well.</summary>
