    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF) continues on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One user asks for a comparison between what BLDF and other organizations, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), can achieve. While the EFF has a deeper track record of experience, BLDF's Bitcoin-specific focus may outweigh this. Another participant suggests that BLDF can expand its legal assistance beyond the US and Europe to accommodate the growing number of developers located in other countries.In response to a previous message, another user disagrees with the suggestion that Alex Morcos should not be allowed to comment on future soft forks or anything related to Bitcoin. They argue that everyone should have an equal opportunity to participate and their comments judged on their merit. The user also points out that the name "The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund" could be confusing for newcomers and suggests that funders commit themselves to abstaining from involvement in cases or the process of accepting prospective clients. Overall, the initiative to create a legal defense fund for Bitcoin developers is appreciated, as it allows them to focus on development without worrying about legal issues and provides financial support.</summary>
