    <summary>The writer of this message expresses concerns regarding the inaccessibility of becoming a Bitcoin miner, as it is largely controlled by wealthy individuals. They question whether there is any correlation between being wealthy and running an honest node, and reject the idea that having "skin in the game" automatically makes one honest. However, the writer notes that block validation on the network is decentralized. James Lu suggests renaming full nodes to "validator nodes" to emphasize their role in checking the validity of blocks. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows anyone to run a validator node, even on a low-end laptop.</summary>
