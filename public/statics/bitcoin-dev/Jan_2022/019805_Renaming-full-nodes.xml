    <summary>The confusion around the control of the Bitcoin network by mining nodes has led to a suggestion of renaming full nodes as "validator nodes". This would emphasize their role in checking the validity of blocks on the network. The proposed name change would help clarify that Bitcoin is a decentralized network, as anyone can run a validator node, even on a low-end laptop. With this change, it would be easier for people to understand the importance of full nodes in maintaining the integrity of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
