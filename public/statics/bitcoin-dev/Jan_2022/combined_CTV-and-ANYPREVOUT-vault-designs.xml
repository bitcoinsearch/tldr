    <summary>The email discusses the lack of research on the safety and usefulness of different ways to construct vault designs. The proposed covenant opcode TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY has yet to be implemented, making it challenging to compare with constructing vaults using SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT or OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. However, TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY provides a vault design that resembles a previous one by Bryan Bishop but with additional benefits.Jeremy Rubin initially described OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY (later becoming OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY) as a "rudimentary, limited form of covenant" that does not bear the same technical and social risks of prior covenant designs. Andrew Poelstra blogs about how to use OP_CAT and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK to construct more generalized covenants and vaults. However, these have downsides of being less efficient and arguably riskier.A paper titled Bitcoin Covenants: Three Ways to Control the Future compares building vaults using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. This paper discusses three categories of vault design - deleted key, recovered key, and script-based covenants. Recovered-key and script-based covenants are mostly functionally equivalent, and if either were enabled, a new domain of practical covenant-based protocols could emerge. The paper concludes by stating that every modification of bitcoin's code-base and protocol introduces systemic risks, and it is difficult to analyze those risks. Therefore, it would be hubris to claim that there are no unknown risks associated with introducing changes to the protocol.</summary>
