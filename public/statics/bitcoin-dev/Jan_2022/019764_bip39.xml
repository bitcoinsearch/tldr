    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a suggestion was made to address the issue of non-void whitespace characters in BIP39 by introducing a new character such as "win x estate". However, it was pointed out that changing BIP39 would be difficult since software expects a standard list. Another suggestion was to reject seeds that do not contain certain pairs of words, but it is unclear how much entropy would be lost from this approach.The discussion then shifted to the topic of adjacent ambiguity in the English language, where similar-sounding words can lead to confusion when writing things down. The original commenter expressed dislike for the fact that "art", "work", and "artwork" are three different words, and suggested cleaning up such ambiguities. They provided a list of duplicated word pairs such as "canal/arm" and "can/alarm", "card/anger" and "car/danger", and "feed/anger" and "fee/danger", among others.The bitcoin-dev mailing list is a platform for developers to discuss technical aspects of the Bitcoin protocol and related projects.</summary>
