    <summary>The email thread discussed in this context is about the removal of notify options from Bitcoin Core as they can be used by attackers to compromise machines running the software. The author suggests three potential solutions to this problem, including removing notifications.dat, not using system() in runCommand(), and introducing a new setting in settings.json file called notifypolicy that is restricted by default but can be set to unrestricted.The author claims that these issues have been explained multiple times in various PRs and to different individuals, including reviewers who have rejected proposals due to their lack of understanding about the issues at hand. The author expresses frustration with the lack of interest in addressing these issues and indicates that this email is an attempt to raise awareness about them. The author also mentions being asked to not review and comment on a specific PR.In the email conversation, Prayank responds to Daniel about some points that he might have missed. He highlights that many fancy things won't work in Windows shortcut target and it is more suspicious even if someone tries to wrap it in notify options provided by Bitcoin Core. He also suggests that there is enough time to research more about the issue and respond with something new or helpful for documentation.The email ends with Prayank's public key and the author notes that this email will be helpful in their security project and wishes everyone a happy new year. Throughout the context, links to various PRs and issues related to this topic are provided for further reading. The author emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues for the future of money and what users expect from developers.</summary>
