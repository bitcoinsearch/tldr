    <summary>During the implementation of Taproot in Bitcoin, the Suredbits team discovered a mainnet output that did not comply with the BIP 340 specification and was burned. This error was made by an unknown developer rather than being a bug in the Taproot BIPs or Core implementation. The community is encouraged to share mistakes they make or things they find confusing when re-implementing Taproot or supporting it in wallets.Wallets may face common sources of confusion such as eliminating the key path or eliminating the script path. To avoid this, various existing resources are available like StackExchange posts, Optech series "Preparing for Taproot", Optech workshop, etc which could be useful for implementers. Additionally, an informational BIP could be a good idea as a first port of call for Taproot implementers who find BIP 340-342 dense and difficult to parse.For discussion and questions regarding Taproot, Libera IRC channels #bitcoin-dev and #bitcoin-core-dev are available. P2TR support on the Bitcoin wiki is being monitored by Murch. It is important to note that sharing mistakes and difficulties can lead to a better understanding and implementation of Taproot in the future.</summary>
