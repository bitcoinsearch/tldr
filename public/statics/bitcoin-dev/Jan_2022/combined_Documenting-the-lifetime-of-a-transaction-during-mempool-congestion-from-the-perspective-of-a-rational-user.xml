    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin discussed existing wallet behaviors and user preferences in Bitcoin. He argued that rational wallets should prioritize maximizing fully trusted balance, processing payments within the urgency budget requested by the user, and maximizing privacy. The author noted that rational wallet behavior may require metadata, such as trust scores of payment sources and hashrate data. The post also described scenarios for receiving payments and how rational wallet behavior would prioritize spending outputs to maximize balance. The author acknowledged that some rational behaviors are not implemented due to engineering complexity, UX complexity, and low mempool backlog, but argued that a more robust fee market could make these behaviors emergent among all Bitcoin wallets. The relevance of CTV congestion control in solving existing wallet architecture problems was also addressed, with the author noting that CTV can help reduce the need for rational behaviors like CPFP bumping and exert back pressure on transaction urgency. The discussion on the mailing list centered around rational wallet behavior that maximizes balance and payments, prioritizes spending untrusted outputs to CPFP them to the top of the mempool for guaranteed payment, tracks replaced payments, and prevents double-spend behavior. Wallet agents should retransmit transactions to the network if they believe other nodes are not aware of them and they are likely to go into a block. Certain wallets already have some of this functionality baked in, such as Lightning Channels. However, congestion control using CTV does not cause wallet behavior complications but helps solve an existing problem by reducing the need for rational behavior like CPFP bumping.</summary>
