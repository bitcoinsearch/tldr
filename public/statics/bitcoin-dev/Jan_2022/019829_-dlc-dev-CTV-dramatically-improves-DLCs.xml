    <summary>In this email thread, Thibaut Le Guilly is responding to a message from Lloyd Fournier about using CTV in the Discreet Log Contract (DLC) protocol. Thibaut agrees that CTV could simplify the protocol but wonders if CHECKSIGFROMSTACK might be a better opcode for DLC. He suggests that it would allow for requiring an oracle signature over the outcome without any special tricks or needing the oracle to release a nonce in advance. However, he admits that he hasn't studied covenant opcodes in detail yet. Jeremy responds to Thibaut's message, stating that CSFS might have independent benefits but in this case, CTV is only being used in the user-generated mapping of Oracle result to Transaction Outcome. He adds that it would only be complimentary if Thibaut came up with something CSFS based for the Oracles.</summary>
