    <summary>The Bob-Pays-For-Transaction (BPFT) policy proposes that recipients pay fees for transactions instead of senders, which could improve the fee market in Bitcoin through Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). This policy has the potential to promote adoption of CPFP and be useful for projects that use market making, like the maker-taker model. By allowing recipients to care about the urgency and security of the payment, the BPFT policy could resolve issues with miner revenue and security.However, there are some issues with this policy according to Sergej Kotliar. One issue is that receivers may send their unconfirmed coins onward expecting others to pay the fees until someone considers the transaction important enough to be confirmed soon. Furthermore, if the receiver pays via CPFP, it can become exploitable if known about them. Receiving wallets could provide easy options to use CPFP and pay fees that confirm the parent transaction. The CPFP calculator by djbooth07 or effective fee rate shown in explorers like https://mempool.space can be helpful.Spending wallets would broadcast all transactions with 1 sat/vB, but Bitcoin Core does not allow users to spend unconfirmed UTXO using GUI and most of the RPC in CLI. Kristaps made an interesting point in the linked issue that it could be allowed for transactions that do not signal RBF. However, this is not considered safe, but a lot of wallets allow this, including Wasabi in which some UI/UX issues related to unconfirmed UTXO were recently found.Finally, it should be noted that the whole fee paid for such transactions wouldn't be paid to the miner confirming the transaction but it would be shared between the miners creating the next N blocks.</summary>
