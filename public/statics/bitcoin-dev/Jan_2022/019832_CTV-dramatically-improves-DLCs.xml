    <summary>The email thread discusses the benefits of using OP_CTV with Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) on the Bitcoin network. OP_CTV simplifies and improves the performance of DLCs by enabling non-interactive asynchronously third-party unilaterally creatable contracts. With this, each party can compute all outcomes on their own in parallel, making multi-party DLCs easier to execute. Additionally, OP_CTV enables a "trustless timeout" branch where failover claims return funds to both sides, and DLCs can be composed in interesting ways. For example, Options over DLCs can be created, perpetual-like contracts can be combined, and iterative DLCs can be traded over a fixed set of attestation points with variable payout curves. Lastly, OP_CTV allows for pay-to-DLC addresses to be constructed and sent to third-party services, enabling the creation of DLCs without requiring the service to do anything other than make the payment as requested.</summary>
