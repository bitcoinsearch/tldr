    <summary>A new idea has been proposed for sending coins like email. Although it is generally impossible, there are certain restrictions and assumptions that could be used to create a toy version of this concept. The gist linked provides a detailed build-up of the idea, which involves using signature adaptors and CTV or a similar covenant to achieve a fully trustless transfer of control of a utxo from one party to another with no interaction with the rest of the group, at the time of transfer. However, there are extreme limitations to this idea and it is not yet known if it is viable or better than other tradeoffs, such as statechains or payment pools. The author is publishing this idea in hopes that imaginative minds may be able to develop it further.</summary>
