    <title>[dlc-dev] CTV dramatically improves DLCs</title>

    <summary>In this email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thibaut suggests that CHECKSIGFROMSTACK would be the ideal opcode for Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) because it would allow requiring an oracle signature over the outcome without any special tricks or needing the oracle to release a nonce in advance. He also acknowledges that he hasn't studied covenant opcodes in detail yet and asks if his line of thinking is correct. Jonas Nick responds by thanking Thibaut for the interesting application of OP_CTV and pointing out that this does not require OP_CTV but could also be enabled by other covenant constructions such as ANYPREVOUT-based covenants which provide similar benefits. The script of the Taproot leaves could be set to CHECKSIGVERIFY CHECKSIGVERIFY where the signature creation has negligible computational cost and the downside is the additional overhead of 64 witness bytes.</summary>
