    <summary>The email is discussing a review of CTV, with a focus on technical aspects. The author emphasizes that they will not be swayed by personal or legal attacks on the developers. They agree with the nitpicks mentioned in the email and express a desire to see fully implemented BIPs before activation. They give a hard NACK on using BIP 9, believing it represents developers imposing their will over community consensus and attempting to force a miner veto backdoor/vulnerability on deployment. The author suggests directing other technical comments to Jeremy or someone else as they are still researching and not confident enough to comment. The email ends with the author's contact information.</summary>
