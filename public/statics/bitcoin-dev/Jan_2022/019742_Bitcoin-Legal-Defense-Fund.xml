    <summary>In a message to Bitcoin developers, Jack pointed out that open-source developers are particularly vulnerable to legal pressure. He inquired whether the fund would also be used to educate developers on the risks they face and how to mitigate them to avoid legal pressure entirely. The fund's primary objective is to protect developers against legal action related to their activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This includes retaining defense counsel, devising litigation strategies, and paying legal bills. It is an optional and free resource available to developers who choose to take advantage of it.</summary>
