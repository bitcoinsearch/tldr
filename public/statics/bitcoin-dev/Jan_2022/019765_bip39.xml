    <summary>A recent Bitcoin-dev discussion addressed the potential confusion caused by similar-sounding words in seed recovery cards. The issue arises from BIP39, which uses a standard list of words for seed generation. One solution proposed is to add non-void whitespace characters between words, while changing BIP39 itself would be difficult as software expects the standard list. Another suggestion involves rejecting seeds that contain pairs of similar-sounding words, but it is unclear how much entropy would be lost. As an example, a Trezor recovery card was provided, which has each word in a separate box, written one under the other. A list of similar-sounding word pairs was also provided, such as "canal" and "arm", which could potentially cause confusion. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and was initiated by Jeremy Rubin.</summary>
