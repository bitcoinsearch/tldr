    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson raised a question regarding the status of custom signets with CTV. He mentioned that he was not aware of any such signets currently available. Meanwhile, Jeremy Rubin had previously shared a tweet in which he had included a signet challenge and an addnode. However, it is unclear whether there have been any actual transactions on the network as yet.</summary>
