    <summary>In this email conversation, a discussion is taking place between developers on how to manage the development process for new releases of the Linux kernel. It is suggested that in addition to smaller bug fixes (0.3.x) and major releases with impactful changes (0.4.x), there should also be an experimental branch where features that may not make it into stable releases can be tested. The Linux-next approach is mentioned where Stephen Rothwell maintains a tree of combined changes from individual developers. Each developer is expected to publish their changes, and merge conflicts are handled by Rothwell or coordinated by the developers themselves. This approach allows for constantly staged new changes with only a short period for bug fixing before a new version is released. A link to an example Linux-next report is provided as an illustration. The idea of applying this approach to Bitcoin development is also discussed.</summary>
