    <summary>In an email exchange on August 10, 2011, Gavin Andresen and other Bitcoin developers discussed the reluctance of new developers to join the project due to their suggestions being shot down. Gavin argued that the project needs more testers and people helping to fix bugs and scalability issues, rather than developers proposing new features. However, this attitude is not conducive to growing a community or encouraging new developers. People are motivated to work on what interests them, and telling them what they should work on does not work in an open-source environment. Instead, it's important to mentor new developers and offer opinions on how their ideas can be implemented. A development branch could also be created, similar to the one used in Git, to allow people to show what they're working on without compromising code quality.</summary>
