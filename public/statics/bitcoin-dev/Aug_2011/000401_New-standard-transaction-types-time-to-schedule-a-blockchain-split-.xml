    <summary>In an email exchange, Gavin Andresen proposes to enable a set of new 'standard' multisignature transactions, so they get relayed and included into blocks. He suggests that if the feature is not enabled, alternative clients can try them. However, he also expresses his worry that it might take months or even years to figure out how to add chain-forking features for this. Andresen suggests that to avoid dealing with incompatibilities, people using this protection should receive at a normal address and then create new transactions at their end. Though there will be a short period of time when the recipient's money is unprotected, he believes it is worth it as a better scheme can be made later after chain-forking features are figured out.</summary>
