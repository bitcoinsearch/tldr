    <summary>In an email conversation between Michael Gr√∏nager and Gavin Andresen, the question of whether securing a wallet needs to be coupled with creating a new address type was raised. Gavin responded that it was not necessary and clarified that he was only proposing agreement on the lowest-level infrastructure for a solid foundation upon which high-priority features could be built. He also shared a proposal link for people to review. Two issues were identified with the current proposal: a bug in CHECKMULTISIG and the need for 1-of-3 and 3-of-3 cases. Gavin suggested avoiding using CHECKMULTISIG altogether due to the bug and questioned how often the 1-of-3 and 3-of-3 cases would be used. He proposed dropping those cases for now to reduce the amount of code to write and test.</summary>
