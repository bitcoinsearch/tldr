    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin Core developer, sent an email on August 10, 2011, outlining his priorities for the next few months. His first priority was to determine the network's health status and identify suitable metrics to track it. He also requested volunteers to act as Bitcoin Network Health Inspectors to keep track of this information. Rick, a contributor, responded that he was already working on the project and had been using bitcoinj to peer with everything possible to create quality peer lists via DNS. He added that he could work with others to determine what constitutes a healthy network and develop ways to communicate its status. He also sought advice on how to be a polite peer.</summary>
