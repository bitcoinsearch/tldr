    <summary>In an email exchange on August 5th, 2011, Gregory Maxwell expressed concern over the creation of a party that would act as a denial-of-service attack on the network. However, others argue that such a party could actually be beneficial for double spend protection if it creates nodes and clusters that accept 10000+ incoming connections while making few outgoing connections. The shortage of listeners in the network may be due to the fact that Bitcoin users are not yet widely opening ports in their routers. However, this trend is expected to change as end users move towards lighter clients and full node users configure them better with improved documentation. In terms of malicious nodes, policies can be implemented to temporarily ban nodes that do not relay useful messages or try to flood the network. Matt Corallo also supports the idea of creating such a party for double spend protection, but notes that he had previously suggested a "miner backbone" as a more long-term vision.</summary>
