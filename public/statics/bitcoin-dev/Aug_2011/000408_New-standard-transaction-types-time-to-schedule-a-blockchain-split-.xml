    <summary>In an email thread dated August 24, 2011, Gavin Andresen expressed his opinion on the idea of scheduling a blockchain split. He was convinced by the discussion that it is not the right time to do so and suggested revisiting the matter in N months. His message was strongly agreed upon by Jeff Garzik, who responded to the same thread.</summary>
