    <summary>On August 4, 2011, John Smith shared an article with unknown recipients regarding security vulnerabilities in Bitcoin that were discussed by Dan Kaminsky at BH 2011. The article was vague but mentioned a tool called "blitcoin" that could reveal both sides of a Bitcoin transaction. However, the design of Bitcoin is such that all transactions are publicly visible, so this doesn't seem like a true vulnerability.</summary>
