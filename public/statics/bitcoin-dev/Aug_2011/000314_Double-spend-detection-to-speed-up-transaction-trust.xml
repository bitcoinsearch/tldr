    <summary>The network's end users with residential-type networks could be the reason for Bitcoin nodes using too many connections. The decision of how many connections a node should use is arbitrary, but reducing the number could be an option if not relaying. However, this could make sybil easier but randomly picking one node could be enough. Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a common protocol used by programs like Skype and Xbox Live, but it is not an IETF standard and is disabled by default on most routers. Nonetheless, some NAT routers still support it, and Bitcoin works with UPnP-enabled routers.</summary>
