    <summary>In an email exchange, Bobby Groff discusses the possibility of mining non-standard transactions in under an hour with 30%+ mining power. However, he notes that propagation is also a factor that needs to be considered. He also mentions that the IsStandard part of the patch is uncontroversial and could be implemented quickly, but the focus on maturity/bugfixes may delay the full patch. Groff expresses hope that building secure deposit systems will improve trust in the ecosystem. He adds that he has included a significant amount of unit tests and can add more if needed.</summary>
