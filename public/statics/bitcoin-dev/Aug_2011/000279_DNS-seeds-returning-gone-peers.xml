    <summary>The discussion is about DNS seeders and how to sort nodes by version, how long they've been observed to exist, the last polling time, etc. Matt's code in PHP can be used for this purpose, or a Java app could be developed using drop-in DNS serving libraries that could be linked with BitCoinJ+sqlite. Rick suggests publishing addresses under version.example.com if a version has a preference. Mike mentions the problem of bad nodes appearing in DNS seeds and how it is slowing down peer bringup for Android apps. He hopes to find someone who would take on DNS seeding as a project and develop a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version.</summary>
