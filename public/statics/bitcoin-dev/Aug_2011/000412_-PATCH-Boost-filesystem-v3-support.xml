    <title>[PATCH] Boost filesystem v3 support</title>

    <summary>Luke-Jr proposed a patch to adapt the one line needed to support boost filesystem version 3 (default in Boost 1.46+ and required for 1.48+). He confirmed that he tested it with Boost 1.41.0 to verify that it still works on older versions too. Jeff Garzik agreed that the change appears to be technically correct, but expressed disappointment that #ifdefs are used in the code. Jeff suggested that most projects work to hide this stuff in headers, so that the actual code is cleaner. However, Jeff acknowledged that this is only a general guideline and not a hard rule, as there are already plenty of #ifdef windows code.</summary>
