    <summary>In an email conversation between Andy Parkins and an unknown recipient on August 5, 2011, Parkins expressed his belief that bandwidth is a better metric than connection count. While the exact rules were not specified, he emphasized the importance of this metric. Parkins also mentioned that many people would be interested in patches that addressed the high peak memory usage associated with additional connections. The email did not provide any further details on these patches or how they would work to solve the issue.</summary>
