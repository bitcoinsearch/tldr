    <summary>In an email exchange, Christian Decker expressed his belief that anonymity should not be the main focus of Bitcoin developers. He argued that the core of the protocol is about making transactions in a secure and fast manner, not about allowing everyone to be anonymous. In addition, he suggested that TOR already provides a good option for those who want to stay anonymous. Decker also acknowledged that very few developers claimed that Bitcoin was ever truly anonymous, and network analysis has always been known to break anonymity. Another developer agreed with Decker and added that layering Bitcoin over Tor/I2P would be a better option than trying to replicate an onion network in Bitcoin itself. They argued that traffic analysis is much more difficult if an onion routing network contains multiple kinds of traffic. Additionally, they believed that doing anonymity right is very hard, so it's best to leave it to the Tor/I2P people who know what they're doing. However, both developers agreed that the client/network should be made more resistant against DDoS attacks.</summary>
