    <summary>In an email exchange, Christian Decker suggested a possible solution to the problem of compromised machines endangering the security of a secret key. He proposed combining the results of smaller encryptions/signatures using Lagrange interpolation, without ever sharing the secret key share itself. While unsure if this would be possible with ECDSA, it could allow several independent servers to share a secret key and sign transactions with it, while eliminating the risk that m-1 compromised machines could endanger the entire balance. Gregory Maxwell responded that while this RSA-like scheme works for ECC, it does not solve the issue of malware on individual machines since the composite key signer needs simultaneous access to all key-parts.</summary>
