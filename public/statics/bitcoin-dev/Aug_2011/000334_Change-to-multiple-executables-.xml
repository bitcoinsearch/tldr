    <summary>A proposal to split off the "send commands to a running bitcoin" feature has been met with mild opposition from Gavin Andresen. The proposal would make things less confusing for newbies, but require users who have already written backup scripts or other interact-with-running-bitcoin tools to tweak their code. Andresen suggests that time would be better spent working on remaining build issues so that they can switch to bitcoin-qt. He is not concerned about which tool is used, as long as it works on Windows and Linux under gitian and has clear instructions for building on a Mac.</summary>
