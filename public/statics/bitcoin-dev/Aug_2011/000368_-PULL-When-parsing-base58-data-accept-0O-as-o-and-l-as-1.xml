    <summary>On August 12, 2011 at 12:35:27 PM, Gavin Andresen proposed an update to the variable name 'pszDecode58' to 'pnDecode58' in a branch. He expressed his dilemma about whether this change would be worth it or not as it might cause trouble with vanity addresses that don't work in blockexplorer if theymos decides not to modify his code. It was suggested that the use of vanity addresses should be introduced only after the community has accepted them as legitimate representations. Gavin believed that gracefully handling the typos would be a sensible solution.</summary>
