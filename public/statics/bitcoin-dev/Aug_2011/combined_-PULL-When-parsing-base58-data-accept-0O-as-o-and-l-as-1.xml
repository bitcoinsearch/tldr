    <summary>A modification has been made to the Bitcoin protocol that allows for more flexibility when inputting addresses or other data manually. The change permits the use of certain characters interchangeably such as zero and uppercase 'O' in place of lowercase 'O', lowercase 'L', bar/pipe, and exclamation point in place of one. This modification was made through a Git command merging two branches of the codebase. It is expected to improve users' experience who manually type in Bitcoin addresses and also provides more options for creating vanity addresses.On August 12, 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed an update to the variable name 'pszDecode58' to 'pnDecode58' in a branch. He had expressed his concern about whether this change would be worth it or not as it might cause trouble with vanity addresses that don't work in blockexplorer if theymos decides not to modify his code. It was suggested that the use of vanity addresses should be introduced only after the community has accepted them as legitimate representations. Gavin believed that gracefully handling the typos would be a sensible solution.</summary>
