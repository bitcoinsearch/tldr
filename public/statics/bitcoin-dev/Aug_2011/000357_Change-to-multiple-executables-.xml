    <summary>In an email thread from August 11, 2011, John Smith suggested removing the RPC client from the gui/daemon executable. Pieter, in response, clarified that he was actually in favor of the idea and that there seemed to be misunderstandings surrounding the discussion. He mentioned that many discussions seem to die out after negative remarks are made, and suggested that people should be more outspoken about ideas they like. Pieter also stated that a development branch is needed, either something similar to linux-next or a separate official branch. The main tree should be dealt with conservatively, but it's difficult to make progress if every patch that does internal changes requires multiple rebases and maintenance before it can be merged and tested by a larger user base. Regarding backward incompatible changes to the protocol, Pieter acknowledged that there are serious deficiencies and redundancies, but changing them would require carrying around both the old and new code until at least block height X. If a better idea comes up in between, switching to the intermediate option is necessary as some clients may not have upgraded. While it's an option worth considering, for now, it doesn't seem worth the hassle. However, Pieter is in favor of a wiki page listing these deficiencies and their pros and cons in the context of when an incompatible change is made.</summary>
