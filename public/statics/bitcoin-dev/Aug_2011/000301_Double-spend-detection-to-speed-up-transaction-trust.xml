    <summary>The issue of objections to every change in Bitcoin is disputed, as it has been argued that only a few individuals are responsible for such opposition. Satoshi himself discussed the vending machine/detecting double spend issue in 2010, proposing payment processors that could "alert the transaction is bad". A recent idea proposed by Gregory has also been deemed sound, with suggestions made for a NAK message for transactions which were not propagated. This could potentially make debugging and testing easier. Additionally, there are situations in which nodes refuse to relay transactions due to outdated fee rules, leaving users uncertain about why their spend did not confirm. The implementation of a message stating "I refuse to process this tx because" would help to alleviate such issues.</summary>
