    <summary>In August 2011, John Smith proposed a change to the current mainline client that he believes is a bad idea for various reasons. He suggests creating three separate executables: bitcoind for the bitcoin daemon, bitcoin(-qt) for the bitcoin GUI executable, and bitcoincl for the bitcoin RPC command line. Another member of the discussion misunderstood John's proposal and reformulated it. The new suggestion includes three different executables: bitcoin-gui (or bitcoin-qt), which always starts the GUI and optionally starts the RPC server; bitcoin-server, which always starts the RPC server without a client or GUI; and bitcoin-client, which always runs the RPC client without an RPC server or GUI. There could also be a script or symlinked executable with names "bitcoin" and "bitcoind" that detect whether RPC commands are present on the command line, and based on this invoke either bitcoin-server/bitcoin-gui or bitcoin-client for backward compatibility.</summary>
