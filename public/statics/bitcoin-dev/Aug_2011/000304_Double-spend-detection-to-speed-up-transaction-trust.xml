    <summary>In an email conversation from August 2011, Stefan Thomas discussed the potential usefulness of network support like a MSG_DOUBLESPEND. However, he realized that such a service could be a denial-of-service attack on the network, which is already lacking in functioning listeners. Some nodes in .ru/.ua aggressively connect to him, but have never passed him a transaction. Thomas suggested that alerts may scale better and would complement network support. Although alerts are vulnerable to filtering by sibyl attackers, they have deeper network penetration. In cases where filtering doesn't prevent them, a connection is not needed to hear them.</summary>
