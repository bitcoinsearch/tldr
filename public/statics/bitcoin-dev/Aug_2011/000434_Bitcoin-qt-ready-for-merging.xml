    <summary>In an email dated August 31, 2011, John Smith announced that Bitcoin-qt was now feature complete and had been tested without any major problems. The project builds on Windows, MacOSX, and Linux using qmake. It lacks translations, with only English, Dutch, and Russian being available at the time. Smith suggested porting some of the existing translations to the new platform. Despite this, Smith believed the lack of translations wasn't a significant issue and suggested merging Bitcoin-qt soon after the release of version 0.4.</summary>
