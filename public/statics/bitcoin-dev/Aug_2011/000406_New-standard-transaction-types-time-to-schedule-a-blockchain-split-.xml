    <summary>The author, Gavin Andresen believes that multi-signature transactions are the fastest path to secure bitcoin wallets. He proposes the creation of a new set of 'standard' multisignature transactions for better protection. He is trying to get consensus on low-level 'standard' transactions and defines the current draft proposal in the gist link provided by him. Though it will require new as-yet-undefined bitcoin addresses that will be incompatible with old clients, he still thinks it's a good idea. Gavin worries that if they try to do things right from the start, there may be no consensus on exactly which digest function should be used or whether there should be a new opcode for arbitrary boolean expressions involving key pairs after six months. The author recommends moving forward with existing code and working on block chain rule proposals at an agreed-upon block number.</summary>
