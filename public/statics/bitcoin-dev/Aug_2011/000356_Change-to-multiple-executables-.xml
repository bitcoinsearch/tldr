    <summary>On August 10, 2011, Gavin Andresen expressed his thoughts on the need for more developers and features in an open source project. He believed that more developers and activities were essential to make the project successful. However, he also acknowledged the importance of addressing bugs and scalability issues, which would be easier to fix with some underlying problems addressed. Gavin proposed multiple branches to look at the long view while handling immediate firefighting, allowing people to choose whether they wanted to try something newer or run the older version with known issues. He emphasized the need to remain P2P-compatible for as long as possible while addressing issues such as build system, modularization, pluggable DB and storage back-ends, and separating the system into multiple locked-down processes. Andy Parkins agreed that the negative attitude displayed when new features were suggested was not the way to grow a community. Instead, a mentoring attitude should be adopted, offering opinions on how a new developer can get their idea in rather than telling them why it will never happen. The focus should not always be on the negative sides of every proposal, creating a climate of fear.While Gavin agreed that bugs and scalability issues needed to be addressed, he believed that more developers adding new features were not needed at the moment, and the project's critical needs were people testing and helping to fix bugs and scalability issues. However, he also believed that ignoring end-users could cause them to run away, making the project pointless. Gavin proposed that having more developers and features would make the project successful, but it should be done while addressing underlying issues.</summary>
