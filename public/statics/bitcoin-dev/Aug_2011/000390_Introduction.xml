    <summary>In an email conversation from August 22, 2011, Fred Concklin expressed interest in starting building with autotools, specifically using autoconf to simplify the installation and testing process. In response, Jay mentioned that some work has already been done for autotools but has not yet been merged into the main repository. Jay provided a link to pull request #180 on the Bitcoin GitHub page as a starting point for anyone interested in this topic.</summary>
