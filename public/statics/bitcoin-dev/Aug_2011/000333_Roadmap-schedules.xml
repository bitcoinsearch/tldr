    <summary>Gavin Andresen, in his message, has outlined his priority list for the next few months. Network health is the first priority on the list, with Gavin calling for volunteers to serve as a Bitcoin Network Health Inspector to keep track of metrics and identify any work that needs to be done. Secondly, he has identified a chronic problem of CRITICAL_SECTION deadlocks caused by new code, suggesting that they should be detected early and possibly re-architected to be single-threaded/asio in the long term.Wallet security is another priority, with Gavin planning to ship Matt's wallet encryption soon along with groffer's Multisign patch (#319) to create trojan-resistant secure wallet solutions. Bug fixing is also high on the priority list, with 44 bugs already listed that require prioritization and assignment to ensure they are fixed. Gavin calls for a volunteer to assume the role of the BugKeeper to oversee this process.Testing is another critical area that Gavin aims to address, acknowledging that he does not have the time to test every PULL request and requiring significant testing for any pull requests involving more than trivial code changes. He proposes finding money and/or people for a dedicated "core bitcoin quality assurance team" to help with unit tests and automated testing.For the next release after the next, Gavin would like to see fClient mode (download headers only), Sipa's wallet and key export/import, moving from wxWidgets to qt for the GUI, and un-hardcoding fee handling. Finally, Gavin calls for research-y features such as impolite peer detection/reaction, better detection/reaction to double-spend attempts or block-chain splits, and code for mining pool participants to help keep mining pool operators honest.While everything else is considered lower priority, Gavin says he will not object to pulling it if it is important to others, is thoroughly tested, and has zero chance of introducing a security vulnerability. If there are any items that Gavin missed, he has offered to create a Roadmap page on the Bitcoin wiki if there is general consensus about priorities.</summary>
