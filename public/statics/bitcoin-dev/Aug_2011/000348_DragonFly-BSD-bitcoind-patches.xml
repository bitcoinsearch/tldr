    <summary>On August 7, 2011, Venkatesh Srinivas sent an email containing three patches that enabled bitcoind to run on DragonFly BSD. The first patch fixed an issue where bitcoind assumed SO_NOSIGPIPE was available on BSD, which was not true for NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly. The second patch modified the signedness of pchMessageStart to 'unsigned char' in main.cpp and net.h to prevent unsafe values beyond 0x80. The third patch qualified make_tuple as std::make_tuple in db.cpp, fixing an error where std::make_tuple was preferred over boost's make_tuple. Jeff Garzik responded positively to the patches and created pull requests on GitHub.</summary>
