    <summary>On August 10, 2011, Gavin Andresen expressed his opposition to splitting off the "send commands to a running bitcoin" feature. He argued that it would force everyone who had already written backup scripts or other interact-with-running-bitcoin tools to tweak their code, which would be a waste of time. However, he acknowledged that since the project was still in an experimental phase, people could expect changes like this. Another developer responded by saying that the change was trivial and made sense for future directions, such as the UIWallet in separate processes for security concerns. They also expressed frustration with proposals being shot down, regardless of how well-formulated they were. The developer suggested that it would be better to switch to two branches like most other open-source projects they had worked with: one for small, compatible changes and bug-fixes (0.3.x), and another for more impactful changes and eventual major releases (0.4.x).Andresen responded that he would rather time be spent working on any remaining build issues so they can switch to bitcoin-qt. He did not care whether it was autotools or qmake or QT creator but wanted it to work on Windows and Linux under gitian and have clear instructions so he could build it on his Mac.</summary>
