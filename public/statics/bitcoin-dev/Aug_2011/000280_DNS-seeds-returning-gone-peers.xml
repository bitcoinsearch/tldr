    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mike Hearn discusses the issue of bad nodes appearing in DNS seeds. He notes that out of 48 IP addresses returned by a scan, only 19 are actually usable. This slowdown is affecting the bringup of peers for Android apps, which currently don't save the addresses of last-used peers. To resolve this, he suggests creating a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers running the latest version. Hearn mentions a friend who expressed interest in Bitcoin and hopes they might take on the DNS seeding project. He also includes a promotional message for BlackBerry DevCon Americas, an upcoming event for mobile developers.</summary>
