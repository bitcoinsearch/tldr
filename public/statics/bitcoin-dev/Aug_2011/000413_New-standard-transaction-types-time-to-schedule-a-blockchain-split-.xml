    <summary>In a 2011 email exchange, Christian Decker proposed an RSA-like scheme for m-out-of-n signatures. The proposal involves distributing key shares that are points on a curve with the actual key as a 0-value. Decker noted that this scheme would work well for ECC and wouldn't require any changes if ECDSA allowed something similar. However, he also pointed out that the scheme doesn't solve the problem of malware on individual PCs because it requires simultaneous access to all key-parts by the composite key signer.</summary>
