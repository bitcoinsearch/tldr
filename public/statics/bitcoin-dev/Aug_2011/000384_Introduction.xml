    <summary>Fred Concklin, a Bitcoin developer working at Trucoin, is planning to work on automated builds and testing for GNU/Linux and BSD platforms. He aims to structure the Bitcoin project into a structure compliant with GNU autotools, which will facilitate testing and bug reporting. Fred is also interested in daemonizing Bitcoin on boot and furthering work to bring Bitcoin into general coding and implementation paradigms seen on GNU/Linux platforms. Although he mainly spends his time in high-level functional programming languages, he hopes to contribute to Bitcoin development and improve his occasional C++ implementation skills. Fred is also interested in spurring discussion on new blockchain distribution techniques and thoughts on improvements for Bitcoin. He is excited to begin work on Bitcoin.</summary>
