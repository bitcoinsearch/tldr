    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Andrew Schaaf proposed a double-spend fighting option for mining pools to offer a real-time feed of accepted transactions (TXs). He planned to complete a minimal bitcoind patch that writes raw accepted TXs and blocks to stdout with a prefix of ("2naXaRQj--TX\n%d\n" % (data_length)) along with a minimal NodeJS app which invokes bitcoind as a subprocess, parses the TXs and BLOCKs, and offers a real-time feed. However, Matt pointed out that mining pools already provide the IP of their node or a proxy node on top of theirs for security purposes.</summary>
