    <summary>The author suggests that multi-signature transactions are the fastest way to secure bitcoin wallets. They ask if anyone has open-source, patent-free, and thoroughly-tested code for DSA-key-splitting. They have been trying to get consensus on low-level 'standard' transactions for 2 or 3 key signatures. The author thinks it is a good idea to enable new 'standard' multisignature transactions even though there are arguments against it because it will lead to a new kind of bitcoin address that will be incompatible with old clients. Finally, the author's biggest worry is that people's wallets will continue to get lost or stolen if there is no consensus on how to do it right.</summary>
