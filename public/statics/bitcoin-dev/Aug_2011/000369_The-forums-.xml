    <summary>Vladimir is preparing to launch a Bitcoin community portal at https://bitcoin.org.uk. The website features advanced forum functionality, a blogging platform, a community calendar, and chat capabilities. It is professionally hosted on high-end dedicated servers running FreeBSD in a data center located in Amsterdam, NL. There is also a "by invitation only" section that may be suitable for Bitcoin developers. Vladimir encourages them to start using it and help jump-start the community. Additionally, Bitcoin businesses can have their support forums set up on the website, retaining moderatorial control over them.The soft launch is scheduled for August 15th, but the site is already functional and open for registration. Users can register and contact Vladimir for setting up appropriate permissions for private forums. He welcomes any suggestions and feedback.</summary>
