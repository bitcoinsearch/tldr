    <summary>After a discussion about scheduling a blockchain split, Gavin Andresen has concluded that it is not a good idea at this time. Instead, he suggests revisiting the topic in the future when there is a roadmap, unit tests, and well-tested patches for fixing issues that should be addressed before a split is necessary. Participants in the discussion seem to agree that new standard transactions, although imperfect, are an acceptable short-term solution for the time being.</summary>
