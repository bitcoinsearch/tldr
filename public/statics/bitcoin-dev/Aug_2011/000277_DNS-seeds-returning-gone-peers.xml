    <summary>According to a person who runs a moderately large website, some ISPs cache DNS for as long as a week without regard to TTL. Google tracks DNS disobeyers for load balancing purposes and doubts that any large or professional ISP would disobey the TTL to that extent since it would cause frequent problems reaching popular sites like those hosted on Google or Akamai. However, randomizing DNS requests is still considered a good idea.</summary>
