    <summary>In an email from Gavin Andresen, he asks for advice on how to encourage more bug-fixing and testing of existing functionality instead of adding more features. Two things that would help are letting people know that bug fixing is needed and maintaining a list of the most important bugs that need to be fixed in an easy-to-find place. There may be many talented programmers who want to help but don't know how or aren't aware that this kind of help is needed. A changelog file included in the main source distribution that credits bugfixes to those who contributed them for the next few releases would be even better than a bounty system.</summary>
