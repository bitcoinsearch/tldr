    <summary>The patch attached to this context defines MSG_NOSIGNAL to 0 on platforms where it is unavailable. This definition was previously only available under __WXMSW__. The src/util.h file has been modified to add a definition for MSG_NOSIGNAL, but only if it is not already defined. If MSG_NOSIGNAL is already defined, no changes will be made.In addition to defining MSG_NOSIGNAL, the patch also includes definitions for MSG_DONTWAIT and UINT64_MAX for the __WXMSW__ platform. The patch has been signed with a PGP signature, which is included as an attachment.</summary>
