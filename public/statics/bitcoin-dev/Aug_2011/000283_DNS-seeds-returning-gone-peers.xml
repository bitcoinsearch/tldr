    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown individual that took place on August 3, 2011, the issue of a starved p2p network was brought up. The individual suggests "massively increasing" anti-DoS limits in version 0.4, however, Hearn points out that this could potentially cause nodes on lower memory systems to run out of memory. He goes on to say that 125 connection slots should be sufficient and suggests that they need to figure out why it isn't.</summary>
