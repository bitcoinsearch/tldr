    <summary>Pieter Wuille suggested additional opcodes that could be useful in a message dated August 24, 2011. One of the proposed opcodes would provide access to the block height it is part of. Although this feature can be misused, legitimate uses include "Clearcoin" functionality within the script itself. Another proposal was to remove the requirement for 100 confirmations before spending generated coins. The new outputs should be flagged as "generated" or "recently generated" to inform recipients about the risk of using them. The suggested feature could be useful for pool operators if blocks could contain a transaction spending one of the same block's generation in addition to other non-generated coins. By making pool payouts all generated, there is no risk to paying invalid blocks instantly (since if the block is invalid, so is the payout made in it).</summary>
