    <summary>On August 5th, 2011, Gavin Andresen wrote about a mechanism for deanonymizing Bitcoin. The process involves connecting to every node in the cloud discoverable through sweeping/IRC/get_peers messages. The first IP address to consistently relay transactions for a particular identity would be identified as that identity. Transaction forwarding could be randomized by randomizing the outgoing order and adding a delay between each forward. Even the massively connected monitor cannot represent all connections on every real node, so it would have no way of knowing if it received a transaction from the originator or because it got a fast path through the first N nodes to receive it.</summary>
