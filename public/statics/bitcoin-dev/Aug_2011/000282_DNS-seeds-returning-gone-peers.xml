    <summary>The p2p network is facing a major issue of being starved for connectable slots. To solve this issue, it has been suggested to increase the anti-DoS limits massively in version 0.4 as they have caused more harm than good so far. Additionally, an "upgrade now" type announcement can be broadcasted through the alert system to inform users about the threat to system stability and encourage them to upgrade.</summary>
