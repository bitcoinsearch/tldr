    <summary>The project is experiencing a problem where every change proposed by the developers, no matter how well formulated, is shot down. This discourages developers from joining the project. Gavin Andresen suggests that what the project needs right now are more people testing and helping to fix bugs and scalability issues rather than adding new features.When someone proposed to switch to two branches, Gavin was not in favor of it as he thought it would divide efforts between a 'bug fix' and 'development' branch and would not help fix the critical needs of the project. Gavin suggests that if they did switch to two branches, there would be less pressure to help with the boring bug-fixing and testing of the bug-fix branch which he thinks would be bad. He also mentioned that if someone wants him to switch to supporting a particular proposal, then they should send him a list of wiki pages they'll edit to document the change and tell him that they'll be around to help people rewrite their backup scripts.</summary>
