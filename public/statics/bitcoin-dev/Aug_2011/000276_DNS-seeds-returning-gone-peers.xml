    <summary>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his concern about the bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds. He stated that only 19 out of 48 IPs returned by nmap are actually usable. This is slowing down peer bringup for the Android apps which do not save the addresses of last-used peers. An acquaintance of Mike Hearn who runs a moderately large website said that some ISPs cache DNS for as long as a week without regard to TTL. Thus, if DNS seeds are not pointing to your own dedicated boxen then you might want to do a lookup on a random cookie as a subdomain. In response to this, Mike Hearn opined that a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version would be helpful for resolving this issue. Matt Corallo pointed to https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed and said that it could use a bit of cleanup but it works. He also suggested that if a different DNS Server were used to pull directly from the database in a more dynamic way, it would probably work better too. The original backend was set up on MySQL and PowerDNS, but that is quite a resource hog compared to SQLite and BIND.</summary>
