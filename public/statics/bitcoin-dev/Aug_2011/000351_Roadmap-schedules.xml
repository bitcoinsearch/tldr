    <summary>The creator of Bitcoin, Matt, has written an email regarding the development of Bitcoin. He would like to prioritize wallet security and requests for the encryption to be shipped soon along with the Multisign patch. However, he notes that there is a lack of documentation on how to prepare bitcoind installations for encryption. He plans to write something up on it. Regarding testing, Matt mentions that he does not have enough time to test every pull request personally. He will only pull a request if it has been thoroughly tested and suggests finding people to create a dedicated "core bitcoin quality assurance team." He also mentions that simple "it works" tests are reasonable for new features but emphasizes that testing tends to happen in the periphery by organizations and individuals with incentives to focus on those issues. Lastly, Matt addresses the issue of un-hardcoding fee handling. He asks if anyone has come up with a good solution and suggests Sipa's approach as a potential solution. However, there are still some underlying problems left to solve.</summary>
