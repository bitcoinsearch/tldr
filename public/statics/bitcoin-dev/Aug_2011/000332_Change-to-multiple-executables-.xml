    <summary>The discussion on splitting Bitcoin into separate executables for UI and RPC is ongoing, with some agreeing that it would make sense to have a headless daemon by default. The proposal would involve building the headless daemon as a separate "bitcoind" executable, with the UI still being available with RPC through the -server option. However, concerns were raised about users who run the UI and switch to RPC calls to inspect details, and whether this usage pattern is common. It was suggested that if the split is mainly intended for distribution purposes, bitcoin-qt should be pulled-requested instead. There was also talk of switching everything to qmake, but some argued that CMake or autotools would be better. Regardless, building the GUI is relatively easy on Windows with Qt Creator, while it may require additional contributions for MacOSX.</summary>
