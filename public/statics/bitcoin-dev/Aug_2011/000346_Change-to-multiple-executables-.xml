    <summary>John Smith proposed a change to the current mainline client in which everything is lumped into one executable. He suggested having three separate executables: bitcoind as the bitcoin daemon, bitcoin(-qt) as the bitcoin GUI executable, and bitcoincl as the bitcoin RPC command line. By default, all three would be built, but in non-GUI mode, only bitcoind and bitcoincl would be built. Jeff Garzik from exMULTI, Inc. responded that the proposal seemed reasonable.</summary>
