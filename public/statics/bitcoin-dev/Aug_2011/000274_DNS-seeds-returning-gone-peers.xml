    <summary>In a discussion on 08/03/2011, Mike Hearn expressed concern about the limited number of slots available and wondered if the current settings were too conservative. He also noted that a seed provided several IPs that did not respond to ICMP pings. It was pointed out by another participant in the discussion that many home routers ignore ICMP requests and Windows Vista/7 only responds to pings from a LAN address/private address range in order to stay hidden.</summary>
