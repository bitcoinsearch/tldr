    <summary>According to a report by groffer, there is a bug in CHECKMULTISIG which causes it to pop too many arguments off the stack. As a result of this issue, it is recommended that users avoid using CHECKMULTISIG altogether. However, it is unclear what exactly the bug entails and if there are any potential workarounds that can be utilized. It would be important to further investigate the nature of the bug before making any significant changes or decisions regarding the use of CHECKMULTISIG.</summary>
