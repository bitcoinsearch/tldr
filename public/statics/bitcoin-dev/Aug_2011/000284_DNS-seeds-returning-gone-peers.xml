    <summary>The Bitcoin network is experiencing a lack of connectable slots, with only 19 out of 48 IPs returned by DNS seeds actually usable. This issue is slowing down peer bringup for Android apps, which do not currently save the addresses of last-used peers. Mike Hearn suggests that a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers running the latest version would be helpful in resolving this issue. Rick Wesson offers to contribute to the DNS seeding project and asks for help defining long-lived peers. There is no current project, but starting from Matt's code in PHP or using Java with BitCoinJ+sqlite libraries could be viable options. Nodes could be sorted by version, how long they've been observed to exist, and the last polling time to better manage connectivity.</summary>
