    <summary>In a post from August 5, 2011, Mike Hearn questions how many connections a node should use in BitcoinJ. He believes that the number of connections used is arbitrary and that the bandwidth is what truly matters. Hearn suggests setting a bandwidth limit and adding/accepting connections until that limit is reached. This method can be measured automatically or set by a user. Hearn also states that for well-designed software, the number of connections shouldn't matter and that Bitcoin would work well as a UDP system.</summary>
