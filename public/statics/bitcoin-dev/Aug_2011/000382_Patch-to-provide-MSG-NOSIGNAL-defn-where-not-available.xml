    <summary>The attached patch defines MSG_NOSIGNAL to 0 on platforms where it is unavailable. Previously this definition was only available under __WXMSW__. The patch includes changes to the src/util.h file, adding a definition for MSG_NOSIGNAL if it is not already defined. If MSG_NOSIGNAL is already defined, the patch does not make any changes. Additionally, the patch defines MSG_DONTWAIT and UINT64_MAX for the __WXMSW__ platform. The patch is signed with a PGP signature, which is included as an attachment.</summary>
