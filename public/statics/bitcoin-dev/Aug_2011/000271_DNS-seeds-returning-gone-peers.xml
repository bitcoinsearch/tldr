    <summary>The Bitcoin network is experiencing a lot of bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds, which is slowing down peer bringup for Android apps. Out of 48 IPs returned, only 19 are actually usable, with 6 being closed. There is currently no address-saving functionality for last-used peers in the Android apps, which needs fixing. A custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version could be helpful in resolving this issue. The speaker hopes that his friend might take on DNS seeding as a project.</summary>
