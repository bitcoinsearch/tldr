    <summary>The email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Rick Wesson revolves around the idea of replacing hard limits on block size with something that can adapt dynamically. Luke-Jr suggests this adaptation could be based on difficulty to avoid gaming, but Maxwell believes it is too early for such a change and questions the demand for it. Wesson argues that the trend is towards more transactions and bumping into the limit is inevitable, so they should consider scaling or justify why it's not a good idea. Maxwell counters that they don't know what the network dynamics would look like at maximum traffic levels, making it difficult to determine the right metrics for behavior. Wesson contends that no one can predict network dynamics before the code is even written.</summary>
