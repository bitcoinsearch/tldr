    <summary>In an email thread from August 5, 2011, Andy Parkins and Mike Hearn discussed the relevance of "number of connections" as a metric for network security. Parkins emphasized that too many connections can fill connection slots and prevent others from connecting, while too few connections can result in isolated networks. He also noted that if no relaying is taking place, each connection uses almost no bandwidth, so the question becomes how many connections are needed for security. The email includes a digital signature attachment.</summary>
