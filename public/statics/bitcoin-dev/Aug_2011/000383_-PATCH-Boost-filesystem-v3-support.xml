    <summary>A patch has been created which conditionally adapts one line to support boost filesystem version 3, which is the default in Boost 1.46 and required for 1.48+. The author of the patch has tested it with Boost 1.41.0 to ensure that it still works on older versions as well. The patch file is attached to the message, with details about its type, size, and format provided.</summary>
