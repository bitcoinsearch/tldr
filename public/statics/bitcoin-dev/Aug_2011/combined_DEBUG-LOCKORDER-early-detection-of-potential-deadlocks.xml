    <summary>In the latest commit 865ed8a, a new compile-time #ifdef called DEBUG_LOCKORDER has been added to record the order of locks and detect potential deadlocks in Bitcoin Core. By compiling with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER, each time a lock is acquired by a CCriticalSection, a check is made to ensure that the locks are being acquired in a consistent order. If a potential deadlock is detected, the debug.log file will display the previous and current lock orders.Gavin Andresen, one of the developers of Bitcoin Core, has stated that he will be working on eliminating any potential deadlocks and conducting RPC stress-tests to identify any other potential problems. This new feature will help improve the overall stability and reliability of the Bitcoin Core software.Overall, the new DEBUG_LOCKORDER feature will provide a valuable tool for detecting and preventing deadlocks in Bitcoin Core. With the ongoing efforts of developers like Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin Core software will continue to evolve and improve, providing a more secure and stable platform for users.</summary>
