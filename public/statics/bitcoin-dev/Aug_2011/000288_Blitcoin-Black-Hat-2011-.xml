    <summary>In 2011, Dan Kaminsky discussed "security vulnerabilities" in Bitcoin at BH 2011. Despite claims that Bitcoin is not anonymous, Kaminsky wrote a tool called "blitcoin," which maps the inputs and outputs of a person on the network. The article linked in the email from John Smith is vague and provides little information about the tool. However, Matt speculates that Kaminsky's tool unmasks both sides of a Bitcoin transaction. At the time of the email, there was little information available online about blitcoin. The attachment to the email is a digitally signed message part.</summary>
