    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Stefan Thomas raises concerns about the deployment of the IGD protocol in NAT routers. While Bitcoin has UPnP support, there were no statistics available about the prevalence of the IGD protocol, which is not an IETF standard and was reportedly disabled by default on most routers at the time. The protocol used to be enabled by default on almost all routers a couple of years prior to the email thread, but security researchers had deemed it a "huge security vulnerability" and it was subsequently disabled on most routers. No further information about the context or relevance of this discussion was provided.</summary>
