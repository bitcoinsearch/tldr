    <summary>The author of the context is proposing a modification to the way confirmations are reported for the duration of a chain split. They suggest subtracting 1 from each confirmation reported via RPC if a block has been received but a majority of peers relayed a block that split the chain. However, this may break existing code that relies on the current definition of confirmations. To address this, the author proposes adding a floating-point 'confidence' measure in addition to the integer confirmation value. This measure could be used to gauge the reliability of transactions or blocks based on various factors such as whether they came from trusted peers, have a lot of confirmations, or there are no active blockchain forks. The proposed confidence measure would start at 0 if confirmations = 0 and increase as more confirmations are received. Overall, the author suggests exploring ways to improve the accuracy and reliability of blockchain transactions through modifications to the confirmation and confidence reporting system.</summary>
