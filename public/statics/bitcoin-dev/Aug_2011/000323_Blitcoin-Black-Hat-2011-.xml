    <summary>In a discussion between Gavin Andresen and Andy Parkins on August 5, 2011, they addressed the issue of optimizing the transaction forwarding process. They suggested that randomizing the outgoing relay order and adding a random delay between each forward could make attacks less effective. This approach would make it difficult for attackers to determine whether they received a transaction from the originator or if it was received through a fast path. However, they did not suggest completely changing the transport protocol or implementing onion routing.</summary>
