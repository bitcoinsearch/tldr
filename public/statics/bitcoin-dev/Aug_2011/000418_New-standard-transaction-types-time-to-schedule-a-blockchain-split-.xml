    <summary>In a Github pull request, Pieter proposed a general scheme to convert arbitrary expressions over signature-checks given in RPL notation to Bitcoin scripts. Gregory Maxwell suggested a possible address type that could encode any payment script. With this proposal, the user would provide inputs and set the outputs plus additional outputs, then sign them. The client would refuse to pay to an address if the resulting transaction fails IsStandard.The proposed address type would encode an expression in RPL form, which should be more compact and easily parseable than usual Bitcoin scripts. This address type would have two extra pseudo-instructions: one representing an address check, and one representing a pubkey check. For instance, the expression "a1 OR (a2 AND a3) OR COUNT(a4,a5,a6)&gt;1" (with a1-a6 given addresses) would be given in RPL form as "ADDR ADDR ADDR BOOLAND BOOLOR ADDR ADDR ADD ADDR ADD 1 GREATERTHAN BOOLOR". Compared to the real Bitcoin output script, this would save 41 bytes.</summary>
