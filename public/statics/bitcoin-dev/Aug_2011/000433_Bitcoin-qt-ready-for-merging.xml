    <summary>Bitcoin-qt, a cryptocurrency software, has now become feature complete with wallet encryption and has undergone testing by various individuals without major issues. It is currently in a state of feature freeze and can co-exist with Wx in the source tree while being built on Windows, MacOSX and Linux using qmake. The software still lacks translations as it only supports English, Dutch and Russian. With minimal impact on core bitcoin functions, the software is ready to be merged according to the author's opinion.</summary>
