    <summary>On August 4, 2011, Jeff Garzik responded to a message regarding a bugfix related to a platform-specific compile fix. He asked whether he left anything out while merging the commit made by JoelKatz on July 25, 2011. Jeff was informed that there was a compile fix included in the commit which involved casting between potentially incompatible types. Although it appeared that this compile fix would not have any practical impact on the software, it was still considered important to include.</summary>
