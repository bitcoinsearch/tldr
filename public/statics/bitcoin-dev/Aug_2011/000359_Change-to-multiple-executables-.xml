    <summary>Former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn expressed his concerns to Gavin Andresen in an email about the rejection of ideas for the open-source cryptocurrency. Hearn pointed out that potential new contributors are not being encouraged due to the lack of constructive help and that the treatment of them is not offensive but not encouraging either. While it is normal for project maintainers to say "no" more often than they say "yes," it is important to offer guidance to get the suggester what they want. Hearn listed several ideas he had that were rejected and provided counterarguments to each. Although some of them were reasonable, others may have been shot down for specific reasons that may not be apparent to him. Ultimately, Hearn is concerned about the future of Bitcoin and wants it to do well.The author of the email also admits to missing the use of current sequence numbers in contracts. He stated that it may have been overlooked due to the lack of an OP_PUSH_SEQUENCENUMBER script operator. The author argues against the idea that they do not value backward compatibility, suggesting that version fields could be used to fix problems and that incompatible changes could be delayed using a block number. However, the author acknowledges that their ideas may not align with those of other developers and that fights over client ideas are unnecessary.</summary>
