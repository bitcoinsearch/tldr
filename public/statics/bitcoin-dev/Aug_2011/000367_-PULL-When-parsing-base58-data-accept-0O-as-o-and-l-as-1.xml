    <summary>The context describes a simple modification made to the Bitcoin protocol. The modification allows for more tolerance when inputting addresses or other data manually, by permitting the use of certain characters interchangeably. Specifically, inputs using zero and uppercase 'O' in place of lowercase 'O', as well as lowercase 'L', bar/pipe, and exclamation point in place of one are now accepted. The modification was made through a Git command that merged two branches of the codebase. It is expected to improve the experience of users who manually type in Bitcoin addresses or other data, and also provides more options for creating vanity addresses.</summary>
