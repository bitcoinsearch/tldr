    <summary>In an email thread started on August 3, 2011, a discussion took place regarding the implementation of IsStandard transactions. The idea was that if Eligius mining and other pools were open to the concept, it was hopeful that over 30% of mining power could be upgraded to allow for these transactions to be mined in under an hour. However, it was noted that propagation was also a factor, and non-standard transactions were more vulnerable to double spending by standard transactions. It was suggested to split pull request 319 into two separate requests: one for the IsStandard change and another for adding the full escrow feature set. This way, when the escrow patch does enter the mainline client, it will be met with a network capable of handling its transactions. It was mentioned that there seemed to be no reason to block on the other pull.</summary>
