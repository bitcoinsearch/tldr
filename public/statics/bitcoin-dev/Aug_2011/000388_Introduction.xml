    <summary>A new developer named Fred Concklin has introduced himself and his plans to work on Bitcoin development through his position at Trucoin. He is skilled in automated builds and testing for GNU/Linux and BSD platforms, and plans to structure the Bitcoin project into a structure compliant with GNU autotools to facilitate testing and bug reporting. He is also excited to work on Bitcoin, despite occasional cpp implementation ineptitudes. The community seems welcoming of him and his contributions.</summary>
