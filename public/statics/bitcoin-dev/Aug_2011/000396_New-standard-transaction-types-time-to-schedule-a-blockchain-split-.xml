    <summary>On August 24, 2011, Gavin Andresen requested for some open-source, patent-free, and thoroughly-tested code that already does DSA-key-splitting. A proposed solution was presented where a trusted third party is involved, and the protocol would not need any level changes. The process is as follows: parties agree to endpoint destination address and provide it to the third party. The third party generates a key and provides shares to each party in the transaction and the resulting address to both as well. After confirmation of receipt of goods or what have you, both parties provide shares back to the third party who uses the privkey to transfer inputs to the previously agreed upon destination subtracting their fee. This resembles more traditional escrow setups and relies on the trust of a third party, which is not ideal, but would be fairly simple to implement until the other proposals could be better investigated and implemented.</summary>
