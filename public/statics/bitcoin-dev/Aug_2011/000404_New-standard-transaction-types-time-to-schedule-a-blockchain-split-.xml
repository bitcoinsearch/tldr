    <summary>In an email exchange between Rick Wesson and Gregory Maxwell, the topic of dynamically adapting hard limits in Bitcoin was discussed. Luke-Jr had suggested replacing the 1 MB maximum block size with something that can change based on difficulty to prevent gaming of the system. However, Maxwell believed it was too early to consider such changes and asked for a reference to support the demand for it. Wesson then asked for a reference to the claim of demand made by Luke-Jr. Currently, the network is not at maximum size and it is unknown how the network dynamics would be affected at that level. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the appropriate metrics for ensuring the proper behavior of the system.</summary>
