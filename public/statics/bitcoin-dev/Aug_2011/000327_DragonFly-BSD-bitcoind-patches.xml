    <title>DragonFly BSD bitcoind patches</title>

    <summary>The message posted is related to Bitcoind, which has been patched for DragonFly BSD. The patches were shared by Venkatesh Srinivas. The first patch tests for SO_NOSIGPIPE instead of assuming all BSDs support it. The second patch specifies 'unsigned char' in main.cpp and net.h. This is because the signedness of pchMessageStart is unsafe for values &gt; 0x80. The third patch qualifies make_tuple with boost namespace as db.cpp has a number of uses of make_tuple and has 'using namespace std' and 'using namespace boost'. Without qualifying make_tuple, std::make_tuple is preferred, which is incorrect. The patches are from git format-patch and can be applied with git-am.</summary>
