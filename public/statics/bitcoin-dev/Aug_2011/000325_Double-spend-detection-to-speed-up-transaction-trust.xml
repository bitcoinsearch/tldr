    <summary>In an email exchange, Andy Parkins argues that "number of connection slots" is not the best metric for accepting incoming connections. Mike and Matt were discussing outgoing connection count, which is a separate matter. Matt points out that having 1000 Bitcoin connections is still almost no traffic, and the only time you hit much traffic is when you get a peer with a client who doesn't have the full chain as they will start downloading the chain maxing your bandwidth. According to Matt, neither bandwidth nor connection count are good metrics for choosing the number of incoming slots.</summary>
