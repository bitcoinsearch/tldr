    <summary>Gavin Andresen, lead developer for Bitcoin, is working on a 0.4 release but is still struggling with deadlock bugs caused by the new wallet encryption and/or the CWallet refactoring. He plans to reduce the number of locks and make sure they're always acquired in a consistent order in the short-term, while reworking the design to be based on boost::asio and use fewer threads in the longer term. Other items on the 0.4 TODO list include block chain checkpoint, updated hard-coded seed nodes list, and Pieter's dump/import privkey patch. After giving a talk at a conference, Gavin was approached by Alex Waters about being the core Bitcoin Q/A lead. Alex will work on creating test plans, keeping on top of the issues list, testing new features, suggesting improvements to the code/test/release process, and anything else he thinks needs to be done to improve core Bitcoin.Gavin also plans to rewrite the m-of-n signature "standard transaction" proposal to mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack that he realized it would open up. He did not provide details on this issue, as he doesn't want to give bad guys ideas.</summary>
