    <summary>In an email exchange between Nadav and ZmnSCPxj, Nadav expresses concern about the security of a proposed public key scheme for a Bitcoin transaction. Specifically, he is concerned that the taker could steal funds by manipulating the nonce point used in the transaction. ZmnSCPxj clarifies that the taker must provide the actual value of the nonce to the maker, making it unnecessary for the maker to trust the taker's calculations. The discussion then moves on to the use of 2p-ECDSA for privacy protection in CoinSwap transactions. ZmnSCPxj argues that using OP_CHECKMULTISIG instead of 2p-ECDSA would remove most of the privacy advantages of CoinSwap. However, he also notes that the protocol is complicated and implementing OP_CHECKMULTISIG first would allow for refinement of other details before adding 2p-ECDSA later. Nadav agrees but points out that the privacy benefits of singlesig anonymity sets are still significant.</summary>
