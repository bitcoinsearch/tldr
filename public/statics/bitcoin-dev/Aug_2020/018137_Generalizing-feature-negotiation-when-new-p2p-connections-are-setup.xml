    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Jeremy discussed the idea of multi-round feature negotiation with another individual. The other person mentioned that there may be scenarios where a node would only want to expose certain functionality to peers who support specific features. For example, if a new feature is introduced to fix a bug in an existing feature, a node may only want to expose the fixed feature to peers who support the new feature. Jeremy seemed to imply that this approach may have security benefits, but the other individual clarified that it was not privacy-oriented. Rather, it was intended to prevent nodes from accessing buggy or incompatible features. However, they also noted that implementing this logic purely post-hoc could lead to inconsistencies between peers. The other individual suggested that if a node doesn't want to expose a buggy feature, it should simply disable it.</summary>
