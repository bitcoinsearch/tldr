    <summary>In February, Suhas Daftuar proposed WTXID-based transaction relay or BIP 339 with a feature negotiation proposal to take place prior to the VERACK message being received by each side on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. He did not receive any responses regarding the proposal's feasibility at the time. Since then, the implementation of BIP 339 has been merged into Bitcoin Core but is yet to be released. Now, Daftuar proposes that Bitcoin network clients should ignore unknown messages received before a VERACK, which he codified in a draft of his proposal available here. Daftuar believes that software upgrading past protocol version 70016 was already planning to either implement BIP 339 or ignore the wtxidrelay message proposed in BIP 339. If this were not the case, it would create network split concerns in the future. Daftuar also thinks that if there are proposals for future protocol upgrades that would benefit from feature negotiation at the time of connection, it would be nice to use the same method as proposed in BIP 339 without even needing to bump the protocol version. Therefore, having an understanding that this is the standard of how other network clients operate would be helpful. Daftuar hopes to hear feedback regarding any potential issues with his proposal to prevent disruption in deploying future p2p changes.</summary>
