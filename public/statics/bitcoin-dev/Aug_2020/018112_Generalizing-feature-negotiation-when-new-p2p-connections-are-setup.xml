    <summary>On August 14, 2020, Suhas Daftuar suggested codifying in a BIP the idea that Bitcoin network clients should ignore unknown messages received before a VERACK. A draft proposal was made available and discussed by developers. In response to this suggestion, aj proposed a specific feature negotiation message that would only be valid between VERSION and VERACK. This message would include a length-prefixed-string giving the feature name, optional additional data, and if the feature name is not recognized, the message would be ignored. Aj also suggested that supporting a "polite disconnect" feature for a generic FEATURE message may be easier than implementing it for each new feature proposed.</summary>
