    <summary>In an email exchange, Eric Voskuil and another individual discuss the security implications of a particular feature in a protocol. Voskuil argues that the feature exposes the system to any node that wants to negotiate for it, and suggests disabling it if privacy is a concern. The other individual interprets this as being about obfuscation and privacy, but Voskuil clarifies that it is a matter of security. He notes that the feature may not be buggy, but could simply not support peers who do not support another feature. Ultimately, Voskuil suggests disconnecting peers who send messages that were not handshake on.</summary>
