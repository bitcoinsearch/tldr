    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-Dev email thread, Matt Corallo proposed the idea of adding a multi-round negotiation feature to Bitcoin protocol messages. The idea is that nodes could negotiate which features they support in a more efficient manner by exchanging multiple rounds of messages. Jeremy Rubin responded with an example of where this would be useful: when you have a feature A that gets bug-fixed by feature B and you don't want to expose support for A unless you first negotiate B. There are currently service bits that allow negotiation of non-bilateral feature support, but they are limited. The new multi-round negotiation feature would improve efficiency and make it easier to broadcast messages in the correct order.</summary>
