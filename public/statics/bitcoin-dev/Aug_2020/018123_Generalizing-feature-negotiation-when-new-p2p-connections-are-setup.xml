    <summary>The discussion is about a proposal made by Jeremy to change the process of sending or processing VERACK in Protocol &gt;= 70016. Instead, he suggested using HANDSHAKEACK after feature negotiation that could be completed on a per-feature case. AJ also proposed using a FEATURE wrapper or a rule that all messages in this period should be interpreted as features. The main concern was acknowledging whether a feature is enabled or disabled. Therefore, there was a suggestion of adding a message SYNC to indicate the end of a list of FEATURES and a request to send ACKS or NACKS back followed by a SYNC, allowing multi-round negotiation rather than a pure announcement system. This makes it possible to expand the set of features being offered based on the presence of other features. Matt appreciated Suhas' proposal as the diff is about -1/+1, but expressed doubts about the need for over-engineering unless a specific use-case arises in the future.</summary>
