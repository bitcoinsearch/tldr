    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.20.1 has been released with various bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. The updated version can be downloaded from the Bitcoin Core website or via BitTorrent. Users running older versions should shut them down completely before upgrading to the latest version. Old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported. The update is extensively tested and supported on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.Peers that misbehave (e.g., sending invalid blocks) are now referred to as discouraged nodes in log output. Discouraged addresses are treated differently in this release: discouragement does not time out automatically after 24 hours, discouragement is not persisted over restarts, and there is no method to list discouraged addresses. Wallet notifications are now sent for wallet transactions that are removed from the mempool because they conflict with a new block.Notable changes include PSBTs containing both the non-witness utxo and the witness utxo for segwit inputs to restore compatibility with wallet software that requires the full previous transaction for segwit inputs. Changes have also been made to mining, P2P protocol and network code, wallet, RPC and other APIs, GUI, build system, and tests and QA. The release includes credits to everyone who directly contributed to this release, as well as those who helped with translations on Transifex.</summary>
