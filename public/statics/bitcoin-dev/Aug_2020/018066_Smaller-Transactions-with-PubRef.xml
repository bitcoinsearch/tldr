    <summary>In a response to an original posting, ZmnSCPxj points out several important issues with the proposal of a new opcode called Hard NAK. These problems include hurting fungibility and privacy by encouraging address reuse, preventing pruning, requiring the creation of another index to previous block data which increases requirements on fullnodes, and needing SCRIPT to be re-evaluated on transactions arriving in new blocks to protect against reorgs of the chaintip. ZmnSCPxj notes that none of these issues have been addressed in the current proposal and that it looks only at clients without considering what validators will need to implement to validate new blocks with this opcode.</summary>
