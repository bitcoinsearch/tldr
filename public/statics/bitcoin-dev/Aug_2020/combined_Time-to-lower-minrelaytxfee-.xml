    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the possibility of reducing the minimum relay transaction fee (minrelaytxfee) on the Bitcoin network. The current fee, which was set five years ago when Bitcoin was trading at $255, is 1000 sat/vkB. However, some argue that this fee is too high and a reduction to as low as 22 sat/vKB would be more appropriate. This reduction is driven by the need for ultra-low-fee on-chain transactions due to growing adoption of the Lightning Network.Dan Bryant brought up the fact that it's been five years since the minrelaytxfee was lowered and suggested reducing it even further. He suggests reducing the fee to 22 sat/vkB, though an even more conservative reduction to 100 or 50 sat/vkB would be welcome. Two years ago, there was a PR to reduce the fee from 1000 to 200 sat/vkB but it was eventually closed in favor of another PR. Despite being parameterized and configurable in bitcoin.conf, it is still unclear how changing the default minrelaytxfee could be detrimental to node operation.While it is acknowledged that reducing the minrelaytxfee could make denial of service attacks cheaper, proponents argue that thoroughly testing any changes can prevent bugs that could cause issues on the peer-to-peer network. The discussion also referenced previous pull requests (#13922 and #13990) related to reducing the minrelaytxfee. Despite the potential risks, some believe that changing the default fee could be beneficial given that it is already configurable in bitcoin.conf.Five years ago, the fee of 5000 sat/vkB was deemed too high for Bitcoin trading at $255 and thus was reduced to 1000 sat/vkB. This reduction provided anti-DoS protection equal to $0.00255/vkB in USD terms. To have parity with the last reduction, a further reduction to 22 sat/vkB is required, but a conservative reduction to 100 or 50 sat/vkB would be welcome. The growing adoption of LN demands ultra-low-fee on-chain transactions, which could be queued and confirmed overnight, or even waiting till Sunday lull, as miners have not reached their mining floor yet. The concern raised in the discussion is that having large portions of the network using a different minrelayfee could make it easier to double-spend unconfirmed non-rbf transactions with more ease. Node operators that accept unconfirmed payments with a minrelayfee that's higher than what other nodes/miners are typically accepting would be at risk. While relying on unconfirmed transactions is discouraged, it's worth bringing up this potential issue. Dan Bryant references various links for more information on this topic.</summary>
