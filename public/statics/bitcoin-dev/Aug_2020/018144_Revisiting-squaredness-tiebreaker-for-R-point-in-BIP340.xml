    <summary>On August 21, 2020, John Newbery via bitcoin-dev suggested changing the proposal and implementation to use even tie-breakers everywhere. The comments received unanimously supported this change, and a pull request was created for it on Github. This change reduces the mental overhead needed for explaining design decisions as the entire optimization section from the BIP can be removed. Another ongoing discussion is about permitting the use of messages that aren't exactly 32 bytes in length, but it would be a strict superset of what is currently permitted and have no impact on its use in BIP341/BIP342. Pieter Wuille expressed his happiness with the outcome of the change.</summary>
