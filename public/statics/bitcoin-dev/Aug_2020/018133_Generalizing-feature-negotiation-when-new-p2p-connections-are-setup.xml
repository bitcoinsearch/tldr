    <summary>The original poster thanks the participants of a discussion for their input and confirms that their primary motivation was to establish the expectations for new feature deployment, particularly whether the protocol version should continue to be bumped or not. They state that they have received an answer that is different from their initial proposal but does not hinder future work in any meaningful way, and therefore, they are happy to withdraw their suggestion. The discussion included a suggestion to build a new message into the protocol, which would allow for negotiation of non-bilateral feature support. However, one participant argued that this would only provide trivially weak obfuscation and would not be worth complicating the protocol to achieve. Another participant provided an example of where multi-round negotiation could be useful, such as when introducing a bugfixing feature that depends on another feature that should not be exposed unless the bugfixing feature is negotiated first. Overall, the discussion centered around the best practices for new feature deployment within the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
