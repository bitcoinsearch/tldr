    <summary>The discussion among the Bitcoin developers is about the proposal to eliminate the current pattern of sending a message indicating support for a given feature and replace it with something more flexible. Matt Corallo and Jeremy agree that all proposals they have seen are over-engineered and the current implementation of service bits is appropriate, although there are too few bits. Jeremy proposes using HANDSHAKEACK instead of VERACK, which would signal success or failure to agree on a connection after feature negotiation. AJ suggests using a FEATURE wrapper or a rule that all messages in this period are interpreted as features. They propose adding a SYNC message for multi-round negotiation and making it an actual negotiation rather than a pure announcement system.</summary>
