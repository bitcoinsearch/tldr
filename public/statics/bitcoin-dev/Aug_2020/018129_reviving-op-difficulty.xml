    <summary>The Bitcoin community is mourning the loss of Tamas Blummer, a pioneering developer who passed away recently. Blummer had proposed an additional opcode for enabling Bitcoin difficulty futures. In response to his proposal, Jeremy Rubin introduced a scheme that allows difficulty futures without requiring any changes to Bitcoin. This scheme takes advantage of the fact that changes in difficulty also cause a difference in maturation time between timelocks and height-locks. The method should be compatible with off-chain commitments and could be embedded in a taproot commitment using OP_CLTV or OP_CSV instead of nLockTime.</summary>
