    <summary>A new opcode has been described in the attached BIP, which enables transactions that are about 37% smaller than a traditional single-source segwit transaction. The savings vary based on the number of inputs. This pursuit of smaller transactions is crucial for Inclusive Accountability as less data needs to be recorded on chain, leading to improved frugality in two ways. Firstly, more transactions can be confirmed in a block, and secondly, small value inputs that were otherwise inaccessible can now be referenced without losing unrecoverable value due to transaction overhead. The BIP can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/TheRook/bip-pubref/blob/master/bip-PubRef.mediawiki.On the Ethereum side, the variant of this technology is Ditto Transactions, which can be found at https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-ditto-transactions/4455.</summary>
