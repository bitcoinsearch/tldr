    <summary>The email thread starts with Michael suggesting that re-orgs should be solved in a different way. ZmnSCPxj responds with "hard NAK" and highlights important issues with the proposal. These include encouraging address reuse, preventing pruning, requiring optimized implementation, and needing SCRIPT to be re-evaluated on transactions arriving in new blocks. ZmnSCPxj points out that none of these issues have been addressed in Michael's proposal and it only looks at clients without considering validators. The email thread includes an HTML attachment and a non-text attachment titled "Floating-Point Nakamoto Consensus.pdf" which may contain further information related to the discussion.</summary>
