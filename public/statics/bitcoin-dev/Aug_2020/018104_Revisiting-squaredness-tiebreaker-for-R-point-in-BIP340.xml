    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has announced a proposed change to the tiebreaker rule for block validation. This change aims to resolve a long-standing issue where blocks with an odd number of transactions have a higher chance of being orphaned in the network due to a tiebreaker rule that prioritizes the block with the lowest hash. Wuille proposes changing the rule to prioritize the block with the even number of transactions. Following positive responses, Wuille has created a patch to implement the change and plans to submit it to the BIPs repository if there are no further arguments against it. Discussion and questions on the proposal are still welcome.</summary>
