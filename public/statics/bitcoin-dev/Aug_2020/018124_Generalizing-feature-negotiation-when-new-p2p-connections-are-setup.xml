    <summary>In this discussion regarding Bitcoin's protocol, Jeremy Rubin proposes the use of HANDSHAKEACK instead of VERACK for feature negotiation in Protocol &gt;= 70016. Matt Corallo questions the need for this and suggests that it may be overengineered. Suhas Daftuar's proposal is praised for its simplicity and flexibility. AJ Towns suggests using a FEATURE wrapper or rule for interpreting messages as features to clarify which features are enabled. They propose adding a message for SYNC to request ACKS or NACKS for a list of features, allowing for multi-round negotiation. Ultimately, it is suggested that this proposal could be useful for future developments.</summary>
