    <summary>In an email exchange between Matt Corallo and Jeremy Rubin on August 21, 2020, they discussed the idea of building a new protocol into messages. The purpose of this would be to negotiate features such as bugfixes and obfuscate certain features for security reasons. Jeremy went on to provide an example of WTXID/TXID relay where SYNC primitive codifies message order and aids in negotiation. However, Matt expressed skepticism about the need for such complexity, saying that it only provides trivially weak obfuscation and complicates the protocol unnecessarily. Additionally, Jeremy mentioned that service bits which allow negotiation of non-bilateral feature support already exist, but are limited in their scope.</summary>
