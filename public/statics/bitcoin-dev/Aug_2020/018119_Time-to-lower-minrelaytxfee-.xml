    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the minrelayfee for Bitcoin transactions. The concern is that having large portions of the network using a different minrelayfee could make it easier to double-spend unconfirmed non-rbf transactions with more ease. Node operators that accept unconfirmed payments with a minrelayfee that's higher than what other nodes/miners are typically accepting would be at risk. While relying on unconfirmed transactions is discouraged, it's worth bringing up this potential issue. Dan Bryant brought up the fact that it's been five years since the minrelaytxfee was lowered and suggested reducing it even further. This would allow for ultra-low-fee on-chain transactions which are needed for growing adoption of the Lightning Network. He suggests reducing the fee to 22 sat/vkB, though an even more conservative reduction to 100 or 50 sat/vkB would be welcome. Two years ago, there was a PR to reduce the fee from 1000 to 200 sat/vkB but it was eventually closed in favor of another PR. Bryant questions why it would be detrimental to operation of a node to change the default minrelaytxfee if it's already parameterized and configurable in bitcoin.conf. He references various links for more information.</summary>
