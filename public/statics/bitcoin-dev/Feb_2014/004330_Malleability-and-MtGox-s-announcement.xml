    <title>Malleability and MtGox's announcement</title>

    <summary>In a conversation thread from 2014, Oliver Egginger discussed the potential for an attack on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange that involved renaming transaction IDs before being confirmed in the blockchain. The attacker would then stress the support team, resulting in refunded Bitcoins to their virtual wallet. However, before crediting the funds back, Mt. Gox should form a new transaction moving at least one of the coins the prior transaction was spending and wait for that transaction to confirm. In September of the same year, many customers experienced stuck transactions due to Mt. Gox spending immature coins. Later, it was discovered that they were producing transactions with invalid DER encodings, which led to mutation being used to fix these padded transactions. Someone may have also been exploiting Gox's behavior, as it seemed that their wallet was reusing coins that were already spent in new transactions.</summary>
