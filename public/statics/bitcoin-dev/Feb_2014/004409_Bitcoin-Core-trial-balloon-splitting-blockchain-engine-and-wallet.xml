    <summary>The Bitcoin Core wallet is set to run as a separate process and a separate binary from the blockchain engine. This allows for improved security by sandboxing wallet keys and sensitive data away from the P2P network exposed engine, among other benefits. Recent IRC discussions have proposed this next step in wallet development, which would involve a brand new IPC protocol and lots of new glue code. It was determined that separate programs seems to be the better option, and Pieter has been working on headers-first sync. The split requires upping the review and test bandwidth on Pieter's PRs.</summary>
