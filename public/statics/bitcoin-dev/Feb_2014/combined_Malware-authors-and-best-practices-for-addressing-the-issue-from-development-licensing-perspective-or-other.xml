    <summary>In this message, the author seeks advice from developers on how to prevent individuals from using their code for malicious activities such as stealing bitcoin. The question arose after the use of sx by a malware author to generate Stealthbit was discovered. Despite acknowledging that free, open-source code can be used for good or bad, the author is interested in finding ways to mitigate or prevent malware authors from easily appropriating their code. They understand that their question may sound foolish but hope that someone can rephrase it to make more sense in the context of the list discussion. The author supports bitcoin and other decentralized currency efforts, including walled development like darkwallet, and appreciates the work that developers do to further these initiatives.</summary>
