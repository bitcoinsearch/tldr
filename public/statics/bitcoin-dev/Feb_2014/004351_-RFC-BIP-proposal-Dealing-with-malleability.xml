    <summary>On February 10, 2014, Pieter Wuille proposed a document on GitHub which was the topic of discussion in an email exchange between him and Pavol Rusnak on February 12, 2014. Pavol Rusnak suggested dropping DER encoding completely and using just 64 bytes directly for signature if they were to bump nVersion. However, Pieter Wuille pointed out that it would be a hard fork and something to be discussed only if they ever introduce a version-2 scripting language, which is a long-term thing.</summary>
