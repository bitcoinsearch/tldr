    <summary>In this email conversation, Mike Hearn discusses the possibilities of lowering transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. He mentions that there are two possible outcomes - either miners refuse to include transactions with lower fees due to increased orphan costs, or the total value of transactions is not outweighed by orphan costs and miners stop including useful transactions. He also addresses concerns about potential DoS attacks through flooding the network with small transactions, stating that any change to Bitcoin can be objected to on anti-DoS grounds until someone spends significant time on resource scheduling and code audits. This conversation provides insight into the challenges and considerations involved in making changes to the Bitcoin network.</summary>
