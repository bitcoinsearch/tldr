    <summary>The discussion revolves around the need for a canonical identifier for transactions before they get to the chain, to support use cases where wallets might not be able to properly identify their status. One proposed solution is to have the initial transaction include zero fees and rely on child-pays-for-parent to get it and follow-up transactions into a block. However, this workaround relies on the assumption that miners won't include zero-fee transactions in the blockchain and that they implement child-pays-for-parent. Mutants cause issues such as wallet spam, DoS attacks, and introduce third-party attackers. The v3 transaction/block proposal raises questions about whether v3 transactions in v3 blocks would actually be guaranteed immutable with these changes. Therefore, it is important to consider whether it is worth taking steps to make transactions seem immutable or if it's best to accept mutants as a fact of life and only consider protocols and techniques that cannot be broken by mutants. Reducing sources of malleability may help, but if there is no guarantee of success, there may be no point in trying.</summary>
