    <summary>In this context, Denis Andrejew is seeking information on how to access unspent outputs and calculate the balance for all addresses in a particular block of the blockchain. He is using bitcoind via rpc as his source of information about the blockchain. Mark Friedenbach suggests that bitcoind keeps this information in a special LevelDB database in the chainstate directory, making it rather simple to iterate over the database for the list of all unspent outputs. However, Denis clarifies that he needs to be able to get the unspent outputs and calculate the balance for any particular block he is interested in. The suggested approach is to get a list of transaction hashes for the block from bitcoind and then query these transactions from the UTXO changestate database.</summary>
