    <summary>The conversation between Pieter Wuille and Jeff Garzik revolves around the topic of transactions in Bitcoin. Jeff suggests that regular transactions should have the ability to include some metadata, which Pieter disagrees with. Pieter explains that a MasterCoin or JPEG image transaction is not a "regular" transaction. He also points out that Jeff's two statements about the endorsement of chain data storage are in direct contradiction with each other. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist who works at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
