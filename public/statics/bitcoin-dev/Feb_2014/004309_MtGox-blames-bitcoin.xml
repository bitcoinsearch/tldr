    <summary>The Bitcoin Core developers have responded to MtGox's assertion that their problems are due to a fault of bitcoin, rather than their own. The technical analysis conducted prior to this issue indicated that MtGox was at fault for their faulty wallet implementation. This suggests that the blame lies with MtGox and not with bitcoin itself.</summary>
