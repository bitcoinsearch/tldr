    <summary>In a 2014 discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Wladimir proposed reducing the standard line length from 80 to 40 for regular transactions, citing the potential for graffiti messages and the fact that even 64-byte hashes such as SHA512 only offer 256-bit security at most. He argued that given the standardization on 128-bit security/256-bit primitives, no crypto-related data payload would require more than 40 bytes. While a signature won't fit in this space, Wladimir questioned the need for one in such transactions. As an engineer, he suggested that a little more room might be desirable, but emphasized the importance of sending a message that these transactions were intended for payment related applications like stealth addresses only. Jeff Garzik concurred that regular transactions should have the ability to include some metadata.</summary>
