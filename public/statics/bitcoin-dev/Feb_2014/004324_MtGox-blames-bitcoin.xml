    <summary>The email chain discusses the issue of public perception surrounding Bitcoin protocol flaws and the need for strong arguments to counter such perceptions. The writer suggests that if there is a flaw in the implementation or protocol of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind, then it creates a fundamental user-interface flaw, which could be detrimental to long-term adoption and use. A significant amount of wealth changed hands based on MtGox's press release, and there are concerns about insider trading by people who make market bets before information goes public. The suggestion is made for MtGox to AGPLv3 release their code, allowing for public technical discussions on how to fix it while still maintaining intellectual property ownership. However, this would cut off a significant revenue stream for those who rely on manipulating markets.Finally, the email includes a promotional message regarding introducing new BlackBerry 10.2.1 Runtime for Android apps.</summary>
