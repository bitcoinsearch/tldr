    <summary>A forum thread has been started to discuss proposed changes to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 70 payment protocol. The discussion is based on the author's experience in implementing the payment protocol in Bitcoin Wallet. One of the proposed changes involves the certificate chain in pki_data. The author suggests that it should be required to contain the first certificate plus all intermediate certificates (if any), but not the root certificate. This is because the goal is to be able to verify offline.Another proposed change pertains to the definition of timezone. The author notes that it is not clear whether times (e.g. expires) are in UTC or local time. The author suggests that UTC should be required. If there is no agreement on this, there should be a sentence about timezones included in the specification. Further changes may be added to the discussion as the conversation progresses.</summary>
