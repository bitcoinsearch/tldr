    <summary>Gavin, the project lead of Bitcoin, has quickly addressed the issue of MtGox trying to blame their problems on Bitcoin, which was harming the Bitcoin ecosystem. He wrote an official statement[1] setting the record straight and proving their incompetence. Although there are issues, MtGox should have worked around them rather than blaming Bitcoin. Additionally, Gregory wrote an article[2] about the matter as well.
