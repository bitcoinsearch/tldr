    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, expressed concerns in 2014 about the addition of a low-fee transaction feature to the Bitcoin software. He worried that it could lead to an easy DDoS exploit in which attackers could create large groups of low-fee transactions and double-spend them with higher fee transactions to consume network bandwidth. To prevent this, he suggested adding a memory-limited mempool or something similar prior to release. Additionally, he argued that releasing software with known and obvious DoS attack vulnerabilities that didn't exist in the previous version was irresponsible on multiple levels, as it could mislead people into believing that Bitcoin is a good medium for microtransactions.</summary>
