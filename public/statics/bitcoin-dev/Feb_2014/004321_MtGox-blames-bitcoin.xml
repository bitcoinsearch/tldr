    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin Github repository, Gregory Maxwell admits to being the only person with commit access who is independent of any venture capital or investment connections other than owning some Bitcoin and mining hardware. The discussion revolves around concern over people who have signed non-disclosure agreements or whose salaries depend on those who manipulate markets to take advantage of naive investors. What is particularly worrying is that the recent MtGox press release resulted in a huge transfer of wealth - leading some to suspect insider trading. In an ideal world, the code would be released under AGPLv3 so that technical discussions could take place to fix the problem, but this is unlikely because it would cut off a significant revenue stream for those making market bets just before the information goes public. Gregory Maxwell has a significant interest in copyleft/viral copyright development models and occasionally makes money from cryptocurrency mining when it can be sold in functional and transparent markets.</summary>
