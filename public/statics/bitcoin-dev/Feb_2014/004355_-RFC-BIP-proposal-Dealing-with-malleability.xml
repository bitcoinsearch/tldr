    <summary>In a conversation between Mark Friedenbach and Alan Reiner on February 12, 2014, they discussed the idea of changing the Bitcoin protocol to use static IDs. Alan Reiner noted that such a fundamental change would not occur in Bitcoin but could be useful at an application level to address certain issues. Mark Friedenbach added that using data (scriptSigs) not hashed in the Merkle structure of a block for consensus could potentially be insecure. Although no one on the list had suggested such a change, it had been raised multiple times on the forum. Mark Friedenbach suggested that using static IDs for input selection would be safe, even without using them in the merkle tree. He proposed using hashScript as the sole input value, which would make CoinJoins safe without breaking chains of transactions. However, this approach would completely break address reuse, although he did not see this as a problem in a theoretical world. He concluded that an altcoin could improve upon Bitcoin by implementing this idea.</summary>
