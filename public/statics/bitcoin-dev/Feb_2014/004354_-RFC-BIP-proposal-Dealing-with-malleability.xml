    <summary>In an email exchange dated 02/12/2014, Alan Reiner discusses potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Reiner states that using static IDs would be a fundamental change that is unlikely to happen in Bitcoin, but could still be useful at the application level. He also notes that relying on data that is not hashed in the Merkle structure of a block could potentially lead to insecurity. While no one on the email list had suggested such a change, Reiner had seen it raised multiple times on the forum.</summary>
