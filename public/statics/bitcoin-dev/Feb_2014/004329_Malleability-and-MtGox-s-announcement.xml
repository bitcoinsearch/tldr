    <summary>In a 2014 email exchange, Pieter Wuille expressed surprise at MtGox's announcement of the malleability of transactions, noting that it had been a known issue for years. While he did not view this as a significant issue, he acknowledged that it made infrastructure interactions with Bitcoin more challenging. A question was posed about how attackers could benefit from this attack by renaming the transaction ID before being confirmed in the blockchain and how they could fool Gox support to refund already paid Bitcoins to their (virtual) Gox-wallet. The questioner wondered why so many customers of Gox experienced payment defaults or severe delays when the attacker could have doubled their own transaction, but all transfers would still go through anyway. They were unsure what they were missing and hoped for clarification.</summary>
