    <summary>In an email discussion thread, Wladimir suggests running the blockchain daemon as a system service and the wallet daemon as the user. This method assumes that the user has the rights to do so, but in some cases, this may not be possible. Dustin D. Trammell agrees with this suggestion, adding that it would allow for sharing one blockchain daemon between multiple users and wallet processes, even if they are not on the same machine. Dustin also includes his contact information in his signature.</summary>
