    <summary>The author of this message is asking for advice from developers on how to prevent people from using their code to steal bitcoin or engage in other malicious activities. The question was prompted by the use of sx by a malware author to generate Stealthbit, which is malware that no one should use. The author acknowledges that code developed in a free, open-source context can technically be used for anything, good or bad. However, they are looking for ways to mitigate or potentially prevent malware authors from easily appropriating the code that developers create.The author recognizes that their question may sound dumb, but they are genuinely interested in hearing from developers about what can be done in the development community to lessen the likelihood that their code might be misappropriated. They support bitcoin and other decentralized currency efforts, including walled development such as darkwallet. They appreciate the work that developers do and hope that someone can rephrase their question in a way that makes more sense in the context of the list discussion.</summary>
