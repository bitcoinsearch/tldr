    <summary>In a discussion thread, Wladimir proposed that running the blockchain daemon as a system service with its own uid/gid and set of Apparmor/SELinux restrictions and the wallet daemon as the user would be the most straightforward way. Dustin pointed out that this may not always be possible and suggested making it optional instead of forcing everyone to do it. However, in a joking manner, he said that anyone not using his configuration should be punished by a special task force, and repeated offenders would lose their BitLicense. Wladimir then reminded everyone to focus on reviewing and testing pull requests for speeding up block synchronization.</summary>
