    <summary>Ryan X. Charles has suggested that BitPay should implement merge avoidance to increase customer and merchant privacy within the payment protocol. He explains that the merchant can deliver multiple outputs in the payment details, which would allow the customer to spend multiple outputs to those outputs in separate transactions, thus making achieving good value-privacy easier. Additionally, merge-flexibility makes cut-thru payments possible, saving on transaction fees as well as increasing privacy. X.509 is also mentioned in Ryan's email, with him suggesting that it's a terrible standard that should be abandoned as quickly as possible. BitPay is working on a new standard based on bitcoin-like addresses for authentication, and they want to establish a complete, decentralized authentication protocol.</summary>
