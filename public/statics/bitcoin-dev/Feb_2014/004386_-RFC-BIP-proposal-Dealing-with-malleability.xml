    <summary>In an email exchange, Michael Gronager and another individual discuss the support of relayed transactions that can be changed on the fly versus modifying them. It is noted that rational use cases of these types of transactions will be hard to find given their flexibility. The discussion then turns to the idea of making version 1 transactions unmalleable while introducing a version 3 that supports malleability features. This would allow for existing problematic implementations to be fixed without closing doors for experimentation. However, it is also noted that this would make deployment difficult without first blocking all ongoing transactions and updating all signers to be anti-malleability compatible.</summary>
