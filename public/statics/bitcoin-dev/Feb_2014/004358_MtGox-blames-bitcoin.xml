    <summary>A user named thenoblebot posted on Bitcointalk.org about the possibility of a pool/entity intentionally causing transaction mutation. They provided a link to their post explaining how to identify if this is happening and acknowledged that it doesn't solve or fix the malleability issue, but could alleviate the problem at a network level. In response to this post, another user named naman naman asked for clarification on how the attack would affect businesses who rely on txid for tracking purposes. They expressed frustration with not receiving a response from developers except for Gregory Maxwell's, which they felt was short and irrelevant. Maxwell responded by suggesting that naman naman hire a consultant if they require an immediate response to their musings and reiterated that his original response was relevant. He explained that only spending the inputs in question can prevent prior transactions from going through and that there is no risk of losing funds once the inputs have been respent.</summary>
