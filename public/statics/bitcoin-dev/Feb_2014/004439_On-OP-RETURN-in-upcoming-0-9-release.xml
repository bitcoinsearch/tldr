    <summary>In an email exchange on February 24, 2014, Andreas Petersson shared his thoughts on the use of OP_RETURN as a superior alternative for putting extra data in the blockchain. He suggested that if users can include more data with less fees using a multisig TX, then this will happen. Petersson also mentioned that block propagation times could have a stronger effect on effective fees than dust-limit rules, so a slightly larger payload than the biggest multisig TX is the right answer. He calculated this to be &gt;= 64x3 bytes = 192 bytes, which is his understanding of how large a 3-of-3 multisig tx can be, plus 1.5 bits encoded in the "n" parameter. In response, Luke suggested that Petersson ought to redo his data carrier configuration option as a max size.</summary>
