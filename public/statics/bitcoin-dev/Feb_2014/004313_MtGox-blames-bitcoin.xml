    <summary>The official response from the Bitcoin Core developers regarding MtGox's assertion that their problems are due to a fault of Bitcoin, as opposed to a fault of their own, is not clear. However, it is hoped that those with commit access to the Bitcoin repository would not be pressured by a company holding back user funds in order to get a patch included into the Bitcoin source code. The technical analysis preluding this mess was that MtGox was at fault for their faulty wallet implementation. It is a matter of common sense that it's just not practical to try to quickly apply an update to a distributed network, which may possibly cause problems with peering and consensus finding. When working with a protocol based on mutual agreement of a large user base, a single entity like MtGox would be better off trying to have their preferred changes implemented slowly if at all while solving their immediate issues on their side. Problems with transactions being accepted can often be solved by changing the wallet client's way of peering with other nodes without changing the protocol at all.</summary>
