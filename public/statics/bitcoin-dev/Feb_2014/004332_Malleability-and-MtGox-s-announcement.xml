    <summary>In February 2014, a conversation was held between Tier Nolan and others regarding an issue with MtGox's stalled transactions. It was mentioned that if the attacker had a direct connection to MtGox, they could receive the transaction directly. MtGox had a PHP script that returned base64 data for all their stalled transactions. However, it wasn't just attackers who used this script. Some people also tried to manually fix their transactions with honest intent but no idea that it would potentially confuse MtGox's software.</summary>
