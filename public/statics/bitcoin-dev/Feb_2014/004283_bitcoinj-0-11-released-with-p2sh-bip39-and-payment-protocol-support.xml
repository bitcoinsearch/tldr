    <summary>On February 4th, 2014, Mike Hearn announced the release of bitcoinj 0.11, a library for writing Bitcoin applications that run on the JVM. BitcoinJ is widely used across the Bitcoin community, with some users including Bitcoin Wallet for Android, MultiBit, Hive, blockchain.info, and more. The release-0.11 git tag is signed by Andreas Schildbach's GPG key, and the commit hash is 410d4547a7dd. This paragraph is signed by the same Bitcoin key as with previous releases, and the email is signed using DKIM and for the first time, a key that was ID verified by the Swiss government.Peter Todd stated that the release makes for a great homework problem for budding cryptographers. He offered two rewards of 25mBTC for correct responses to each question from a crypto newbie. Todd also noted that generated signatures now use canonical S values, which will aid in a future soft-forking rule change banning malleable signatures.Mike Hearn chimed in on the conversation, jokingly offering another 25mBTC while stating that he would post a fixed version tomorrow if nobody completes the homework. Additionally, he linked to a GitHub commit.Todd posed a bonus question, asking why the three forms of signature (DKIM, long-lived bitcoin address, and Official Swiss Government Identity) failed to let them verify they had the right code, but made for great security theater. He also asked who has the smallest work-factor for such an attack.</summary>
