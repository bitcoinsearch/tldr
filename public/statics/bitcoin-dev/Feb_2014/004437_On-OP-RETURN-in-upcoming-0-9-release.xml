    <summary>The discussion revolves around the best way to add extra data to the blockchain. It is recommended to use OP_RETURN if more data needs to be added with fewer fees. It is expected that block propagation times will eventually become more important than dust-limit rules and will have a stronger effect on effective fees. Therefore, a slightly larger payload than the biggest multisig TX, which can be at least 192 bytes, would be the right answer. This size is based on an understanding of how large a 3-of-3 multisig TX can be, plus 1.5 bits encoded in the "n" parameter.</summary>
