    <summary>In an email exchange between Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and Bitcoin Core developer Wladimir, Garzik suggested reducing the standard line length from 80 to 40 for regular transactions. He argued that the current length was almost inviting graffiti messages and that there was no need for 64-byte hashes such as SHA512 in the context of Bitcoin. Wladimir agreed with this proposal and suggested that if more space is needed for these types of transactions in the future, the limit can always be increased in a future version.</summary>
