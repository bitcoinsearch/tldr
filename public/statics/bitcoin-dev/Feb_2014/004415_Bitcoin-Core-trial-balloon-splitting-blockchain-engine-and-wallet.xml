    <summary>Jeff Garzik proposed running the Bitcoin Core wallet as a separate process, independent of the blockchain engine. The wallet would communicate with the blockchain engine using RPC and P2P channels to become a real SPV client. This plan has several benefits, including sandboxing wallet keys and sensitive data from the network-exposed P2P engine. Additionally, some users prefer the reference software and managing multiple wallets, which requires storing a copy of the blockchain for each one, quickly consuming disk space. If a local blockchain server or network is available, it could serve whichever wallet is started up instead of maintaining its own copy of the blockchain. Separating keys and sensitive wallet data away from the attack surface introduced by network interfaces into another separate process is a good security move. It is important to sanitize your IPC inputs when implementing this plan.</summary>
