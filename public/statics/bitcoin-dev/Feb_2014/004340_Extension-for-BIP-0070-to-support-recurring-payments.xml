    <summary>In this email thread, the sender is discussing the idea of reporting errors to a wallet and questioning the need for a separate URL for that. They suggest adding a simple status code in PaymentRequest as an easier solution, but also mention that the memo field along with an empty set of outputs may already be enough. The sender notes that in bitcoinj, the code will throw an exception if the set of outputs is empty, making it difficult to differentiate between a payment request without outputs and one with invalid outputs. They pose a question to everyone about how bitcoin-qt handles a PaymentRequest with no outputs. The email includes an attachment of HTML code.</summary>
