    <summary>The email exchange between Adam Back, Peter Todd, and Jeremy Spilman discusses the filtering of transactions using an Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) scheme to increase privacy. The IBE scheme involves 'filter' and 'recovery' pubkeys which are used to encrypt a short string of zeros to form a 'filter bait.' The bait is then placed in the transaction so that third-party decryption can be done later on. When a sufficient number of zeros are decrypted, it is considered a filter pass, and the transaction is sent to the payor. It is possible to combine both IBE schemes with public prefixes for optimal results. However, public prefixes reduce anonymity set when combined with flow analysis. Additionally, it may be desirable to find a non-IBE way to do this as it would be more computationally efficient, precomputable, and indexable. Finally, alternative methods such as one-use, stealth, or IBE addresses are suggested depending on the circumstances.</summary>
