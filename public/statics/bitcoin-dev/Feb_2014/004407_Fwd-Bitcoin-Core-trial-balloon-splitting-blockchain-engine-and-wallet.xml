    <summary>In a discussion about the benefits of having a separate process for running blockchain and wallet daemons in Bitcoin software, Mike Hearn notes that without a sandbox, a separate process would not offer any advantages. Sandboxing in user space is complex and expensive. The most straightforward solution proposed by Wladimir is to run the blockchain daemon as a system service with Apparmor/SELinux restrictions and its own uid/gid while running the wallet daemon as the user. This approach would allow multiple users and wallet processes to share one blockchain daemon, even if they are not on the same machine.</summary>
