    <summary>The context discusses the limitations of digital asset transfer systems and the challenges they pose when it comes to tracking ownership of contested assets. The author questions how to document rulings from small claims court in an embedded consensus system. They also emphasize the importance of good accounting systems that allow for reversing fraudulent transactions while maintaining a full audit trail. The author acknowledges that courts cannot legislate code, so it is necessary to meet them halfway by proposing model municipal and county ordinances. Additionally, the author warns potential investors that investing in digital asset transfer systems is risky and their value remains unproven. Finally, the author suggests that the only way to determine if these systems serve real-world business needs is to build them, test the code, use them, and then try them in court.</summary>
