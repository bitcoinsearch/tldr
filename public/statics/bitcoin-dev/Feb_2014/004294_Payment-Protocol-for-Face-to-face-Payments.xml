    <summary>Andreas Schildbach has updated the Bitcoin Wallet preview version with beta version 3.32, which implements BIP72 aka "URI extension for payment protocol". However, there is one important deviation from the standard: Bitcoin URI address and amount fields need to correspond to the data from the payment request. This ensures that the signature really signs the URI and not a malicious payment request introduced by a MITM. The memo isn't protected like that, so it can still be MITM'ed. For the time being, Bitcoin URIs must be "backwards compatible", but this should not be an issue since we will be in transition phase for many months anyway. Andreas has merged the code to his bitcoinj-0.11 branch and put up binary .apk files for experimentation. A prototype on a branch of Bitcoin Wallet has been implemented using bitcoinj 0.11 (not released) for leveraging the payment protocol for face-to-face payments.</summary>
