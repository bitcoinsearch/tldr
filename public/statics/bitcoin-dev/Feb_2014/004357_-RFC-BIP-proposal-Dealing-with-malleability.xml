    <summary>In an email conversation between Alex Morcos and a Bitcoin developer, the former asked about a possible long-term solution to malleable transactions. He suggested modifying the signatures to be of the entire transaction instead of zeroing out the inputs. However, the developer stated that doing so would be both unnecessary and ineffective. The elimination of malleability can be achieved without changing what is signed, and the signatures themselves are malleable, making the proposed solution ineffective. The Bitcoin community has been working towards eliminating malleability incrementally and has already made non-canonical encoding non-standard in version 0.8.</summary>
