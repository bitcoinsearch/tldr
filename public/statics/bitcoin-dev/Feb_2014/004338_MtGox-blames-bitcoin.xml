    <summary>On February 11, 2014, a discussion about a DOS (Denial of Service) attack was taking place on the Bitcointalk forum. However, despite asking for input from developers, the original poster did not receive any responses except for a short one from Greg. The poster suggested that if immediate feedback was needed, hiring a consultant might be the best option. Greg's response stated that if a transaction is reissued without respending the prior transaction's coins, it could result in double paying. Only spending the inputs in question can prevent the prior transaction from going through. Once the inputs are respent, there is no risk of losing funds due to an issue, regardless of how the coins are tracked in a higher-level application.</summary>
