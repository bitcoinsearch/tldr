    <summary>Mark Friedenbach proposed a BIP for human-friendly base-32 serialization with error correction encoding. The proposal includes automatic correction of up to one transcription error per 31 coded digits (130 bits of payload data). With this, seamless recovery from up to two transcription errors is possible as long as they occur in separate halves of the coded representation. However, Jim wonders if it is possible to do better than correcting single transcription errors. He suggests that transposition of two adjacent characters or insertion or deletion of a single character would be very common. To correct a transposition, Jim proposes interleaving the two halves of the coded representation.</summary>
