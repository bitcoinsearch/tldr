    <summary>The email thread discusses the development of a multicoin-qt wallet that runs on two blockchains from one binary and allows trading between the two chains. Peter Todd mentions a mechanism based on SIGHASH_SINGLE that allows for secure transfer of colored coins and consensus system assets in exchange for Bitcoins atomically. He outlines the p2p 2-step-trade mechanism that operates as follows: pre-signed offers are created with tags for assets, which can be appended to multiple inputs and outputs to result in a valid transaction. Mark Friedenbach provides an earlier attribution/reinvention of the 2-step-trade protocol using SIGHASH_SINGLE, while Jorge Tim√≥n suggests that tagging is an advantage of Freimarkets and allows for open binding orders. Meni Rosenfeld confirms Freimarkets as an implementation of Colored Coins. There is also a message about the new BlackBerry 10.2.1 Runtime for Android apps.</summary>
