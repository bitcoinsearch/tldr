    <summary>The recent fee drop in cryptocurrency trading has been criticized for creating new vulnerabilities, but some experts argue that this is not the case. The reduction in fees simply puts them back to dollar terms as they were a few months ago. Therefore, the cost of an attack would be the same as before. It is unclear why this change has caused concern about new vulnerabilities being created.</summary>
