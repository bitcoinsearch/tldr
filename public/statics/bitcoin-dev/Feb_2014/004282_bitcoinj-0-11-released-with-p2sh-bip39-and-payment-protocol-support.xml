    <summary>On February 4, 2014, Mike Hearn announced the release of bitcoinj 0.11, a library for writing Bitcoin applications that run on the JVM. BitcoinJ is widely used across the Bitcoin community. Some users include Bitcoin Wallet for Android, MultiBit, Hive, blockchain.info, the biteasy.com block explorer (written in Lisp!), Circle, Neo/Bee (Cypriot payment network), bitpos.me, Bitcoin Touch, BlueMatt's relay network, DNS crawler, academic advanced contracts research, and more. The release-0.11 git tag is signed by Andreas Schildbach's GPG key. The commit hash is 410d4547a7dd. This paragraph is signed by the same Bitcoin key as with previous releases. Additionally, this email is signed using DKIM and, for the first time, a key that was ID verified by the Swiss government. Peter Todd challenges budding cryptographers to answer why the three forms of signature, DKIM, long-lived bitcoin address, and Official Swiss Government Identity failed to let you actually verify you have the right code. He also lays out a bonus question: Who has the smallest work-factor for such an attack? Two rewards of 25mBTC are offered for correct responses to each question from a crypto newbie. Mike Belshe made it possible for the wallet to send to P2SH addresses. Generated signatures now use canonical S values. This will aid a future soft-forking rule change which bans malleable signatures.</summary>
