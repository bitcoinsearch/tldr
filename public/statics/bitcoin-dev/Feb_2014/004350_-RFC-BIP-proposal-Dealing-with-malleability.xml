    <summary>In a discussion regarding transaction malleability in Bitcoin, Rune Kj√¶r Svendsen suggested defining a new "canonical transaction hash/ID" (cTxID) to address the issue. However, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik noted that while this is one proposal, it is not a complete solution for all transaction types. It was also mentioned that a static hash is not necessary for wallet software to detect inputs being respent in another transaction. Overall, the conversation focused on the technical details of Bitcoin transactions and potential solutions for improving the system.</summary>
