    <summary>The idea of running the network part of the core as a system service is considered a great idea, but it may not be practical for most users. A suggestion was made to segregate the two processes instead, with the blockchain daemon running as a system service and the wallet daemon running as the user. This straightforward approach would involve having its unique uid/gid and set of Apparmor/SELinux restrictions. However, there is a desire to avoid implementing a complicated scheme that requires running things under multiple users.</summary>
