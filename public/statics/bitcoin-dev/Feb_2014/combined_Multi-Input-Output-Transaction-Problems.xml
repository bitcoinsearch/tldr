    <summary>The individual is experiencing difficulties with a multi input/multi output transaction. They have shared some pseudo code illustrating a working transaction that includes 1 input and 2 outputs. However, when the number of inputs/outputs is increased, the transaction gets rejected. The individual is seeking assistance to identify what may be causing this problem.Two sets of code were presented by the individual, one set that worked for the 1 input/2 output transaction and another that did not work for the 2 input/4 output transaction. It was observed that the working transaction's vouts were created using CScript, whereas the non-working transaction's vouts were not properly defined. This suggests that there may be an issue with the scriptPubKey in the non-working transaction.Further analysis is required to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.</summary>
