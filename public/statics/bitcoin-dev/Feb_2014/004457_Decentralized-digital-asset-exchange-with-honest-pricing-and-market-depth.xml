    <summary>In an email thread between Jorge Timón and Peter Todd, Timón expressed his doubts over the implementation of hardfork due to the limitation of one-sided trade. Todd argued that a Bitmessage-like network would be vulnerable to sybil attack and proof-of-publication is required to ensure honesty in records. Timón believed that the primary goal of markets is not price discovery but trade itself. He also suggested an nLockTime feature to cancel orders without double-spending inputs, which Todd deemed dangerous in a reorg.</summary>
