    <summary>Denis Andrejew was seeking to access unspent outputs and calculate the balance for all addresses of a specific block in the blockchain. Mark Friedenbach suggested that bitcoind keeps this information in a special LevelDB database in the chainstate directory, which can be easily iterated over to obtain the list of all unspent outputs. However, Denis clarified that he needed to access the unspent outputs for any particular block he is interested in, not just the current state of the blockchain. In response to Wladimir's helpful input, Denis expressed gratitude and ended his message with a quote from Mahatma Gandhi: "Be the change you want to see in the world."</summary>
