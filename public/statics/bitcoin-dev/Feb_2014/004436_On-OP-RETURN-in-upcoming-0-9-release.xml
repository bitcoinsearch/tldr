    <summary>The email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Jeremy Spilman on February 24, 2014, discusses a Github pull request which reduces the size of a max-sized operation push to 40 bytes. Jeremy Spilman mentions that while he has only glanced at the code, it appears that the reduction in size does not do anything to enforce the most efficient encoding. He goes on to explain that the code is difficult to parse since it does not require any data but rather disallows more than a certain number of bytes of data. Therefore, a bare OP_RETURN would be allowed as well. Jeremy suggests that if one were to strictly require no PUSHDATA, they could modify the code to include this requirement. The email signature indicates that Jeff Garzik was a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist for BitPay, Inc.</summary>
