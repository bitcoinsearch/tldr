    <summary>In a humorous exchange between Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd, the latter posed a bonus question asking what he was smoking and gave a hint that it was related to where he lives. Garzik replied with a pun, "Cryptographers smoke... hash, right?" implying that Todd may have been smoking cannabis. The email thread ends with Todd's signature and a digital signature attachment.</summary>
