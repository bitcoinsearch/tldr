    <summary>The team has completed the second iteration of their prototype which implements subscription cancellation and upgrade/downgrade. They have checked in both the bitcoinj and php server to test it. They have also worked on their merchant implementation (Kill Bill) to ensure that the protocol will support advanced business cases. The team responded to a few points previously raised by Kevin. They agreed with Kevin's suggestion to extend PaymentACK with a boolean success field to report successes or errors. They also extended their RecurringPaymentDetails message to solve the problem of subscription changes and cancellations for free. To solve the issue of the wallet not knowing when payments are supposed to end, they introduced the concept of a subscription, referred to by a unique id, which has multiple contracts. Each contract has payment bounds and a validity period. Upon cancellation of a plan, the end date of the contract will be updated and polling will stop eventually. All of this contract metadata is returned to the wallet so the user can make an informed decision. The team also discussed the use of a separate URL for reporting errors to the wallet and ultimately decided that adding a simple status_code in PaymentRequest would be a much easier way to achieve this. They also considered using the memo field along with an empty set of outputs to report errors. Overall, the team thanks Kevin for his feedbacks and suggestions.</summary>
