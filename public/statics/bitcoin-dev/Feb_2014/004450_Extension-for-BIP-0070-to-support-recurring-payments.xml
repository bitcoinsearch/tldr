    <summary>The specification needs to include a daily option and a recurring cycle, specified as every n*period (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). The quarterly option can be dropped since it is expressed as per 3*monthly. It is suggested that the {unitType, unitsPerInterval} tuple only includes minutes and months, since all other standard units of time can be expressed in terms of those two. Additionally, changing "optional uint64 ends = 4;" to an interval count rather than a UTC timestamp would avoid ambiguity when implementing the 'while' loop.</summary>
