    <summary>In a Bitcointalk thread, naman naman discusses a DOS attack that affects entities doing tracking with transaction IDs. Gregory Maxwell responds to naman naman's post and suggests that he hire a consultant if he needs immediate technical assistance. Although naman naman acknowledges that Maxwell's response was correct, it does not address the full scope of the attack, in which a small pool intentionally makes the hash invalid for the transactions they receive. This leaves many businesses relying on TxIDs for tracking purposes in the lurch. Naman naman clarifies that he is not blaming anyone but trying to highlight the issue. Maxwell reiterates that if a transaction is respent without spending the prior transaction's coins, it will result in double payment. Once the inputs are spent, there is no risk of losing funds due to an issue, regardless of how one tracks coins in their higher-level application.</summary>
