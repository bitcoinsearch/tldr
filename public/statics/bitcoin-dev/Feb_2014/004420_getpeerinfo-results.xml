    <summary>On February 22, 2014, Ronald Hoffman noticed that the "services" field appeared to be garbled in the latest source code level from Github. He realized that Bitcoind was connected to his Java node server at 127.0.0.1:8333 and thought he was sending a bad 'version' message but received the correct results using 0.8.6. Therefore, something must have changed in 0.9.0. Wladimir suggested creating an issue on Github and he found and fixed the problem, which was a Windows inttypes.h border case. He provided a link for testing purposes.</summary>
