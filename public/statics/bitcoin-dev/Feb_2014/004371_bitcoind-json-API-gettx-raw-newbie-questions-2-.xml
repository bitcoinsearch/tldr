    <summary>In this email, the sender is seeking clarification on the gettx / getrawtransaction (decoded) API call and its vout array in the scriptPubKey.addresses array. Specifically, they want to know why the information is typed as an array when it seems to only contain one address. They inquire if there are any cases of transactions that do not contain exactly one item in the array or if the array is in place to make the data structure more extensible for future use. The sender also questions the importance of the address in spending coins, suggesting that all that matters is owning the public/private key contained in the vout script. They request help with special cases in the blockchain that need to be handled properly to produce accurate data. Additionally, the sender recommends checking out coinb.in/multisig and abis.io.</summary>
