    <summary>Pieter, a member of the Bitcoin community, has written a proposal aimed at getting rid of transaction malleability. The proposed document can be found on GitHub and Pieter is seeking feedback from others in the community. While most rules are expected to not be controversial, rule 1 and 3 may require modifications to wallet software and potentially invalidate some script functionality. However, these new rules remain optional and controlled by an nVersion increase.</summary>
