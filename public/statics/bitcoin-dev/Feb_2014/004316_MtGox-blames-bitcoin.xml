    <summary>In a conversation that took place on February 10, 2014, Troy Benjegerdes asked for a single person with commit access to the Bitcoin GitHub repository who is independent of any venture capital or other investment connections. In response, an individual claimed to be such a person, unless owning Bitcoin and mining hardware are considered investment connections. The individual did not name anyone else but also did not deny the existence of others who fit the criteria. Additionally, the individual noted that they do not expect others to step forward due to the potential for attack.</summary>
