    <summary>A software engineer, James Hartig, has stated that a major benefit of using multiple wallets on the same blockchain process is being able to run cheaper processes instead of having wallet functionality which isn't used. He also mentioned that it gives the user flexibility to make it as secure as they feel comfortable, and if they want to run them both as the same user with no SELinux or file protections, they're already doing that now with bitcoind, albeit with possibly a larger attack surface. On the security front, this doesn't seem to be any less secure. Additionally, he runs three different bitcoind processes on the same server to utilize multiple wallets and cannot use them serially in his case.</summary>
