    <summary>When paying with bitcoin over http, merchants cannot reach the consumer's wallet and sending a "Cancel Payment Request" to the user is impossible. Similarly, sending a "Reject Payment Request" to the merchant is useless if the customer does not want to send it. However, in cases where the payment is no longer valid, there are two solutions: the merchant can refund the money, or the customer can contact the merchant with a signed request to return the funds. Tim Tuxworth raises concerns about common business scenarios that may require a "Cancel Payment Request" message or a "Reject Payment Request" that could be used for both. These scenarios include cancelling a request before payment is sent due to charging the wrong amount or sending the request to the wrong customer, as well as cancelling the transaction after the payment request is sent due to alternative payment methods, insufficient funds, or changing one's mind.</summary>
