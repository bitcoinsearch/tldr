    <summary>In this email thread, Ryan X. Charles expresses interest in working with the community to establish a complete, decentralized authentication protocol. He also addresses issues with certificates in node.js, stating that the CA cert is not supposed to be included and that it may be an issue with node rather than the spec. He suggests designing a protocol extension to allow merchants to delegate their signature authority to BitPay. This would involve signing a secondary key with their own ssl key as part of the enrollment process. Charles also discusses the feedback URL and suggests adding a status code to PaymentAck so receivers can reject payments if they are bad in some way. Jeff Garzik provides information on SINs and identifies himself as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist for BitPay, Inc.</summary>
