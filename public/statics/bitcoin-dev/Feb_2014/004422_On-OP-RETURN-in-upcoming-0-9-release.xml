    <summary>In an email conversation dated February 24, 2014, Jeff Garzik expressed his opinion regarding the inclusion of metadata in regular transactions. He believes that it should be possible to include some metadata in these transactions. However, another statement made by him regarding the endorsement of chain data storage seems to contradict this view.Pieter, who is part of the email exchange, points out that the two statements are in direct contradiction with each other. It is unclear whether Garzik changed his stance on the matter or if there was a misunderstanding in the conversation.Overall, the email exchange highlights the importance of clear communication and avoiding contradictory statements when discussing complex technical topics.</summary>
