    <summary>The discussion revolves around the support for P2SH (Pay to Script Hash) in bitcoinj, which has been present in the consensus code for a long time. The support for sending to such addresses was added once an app that required the feature appeared, highlighting the competitive nature of the wallet market. V3 transactions are a consensus change, and different wallets will pick up the feature at different times. In response to a comment about implementing changes faster, Gregory Maxwell questions Mike Hearn about the recent addition of P2SH support to his implementation.</summary>
