    <summary>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik, Todd asked a bonus question to which Garzik replied with a joke. Todd's question was "What was I smoking?" and he gave the hint "where do I live?" It is unclear what Todd meant by his question, but Garzik made a joke about cryptographers smoking hash. Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist working for BitPay, Inc.</summary>
