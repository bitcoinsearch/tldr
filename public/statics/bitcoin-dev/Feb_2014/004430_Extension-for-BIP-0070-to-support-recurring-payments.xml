    <summary>The email thread discusses the progress of implementing a BIP0070 extension for recurring billing. The team has a working prototype that they have tested by extending the php 'payment server' from Gavin, which is also checked-in in a fork. The team is waiting for feedback before investing more effort and suggests turning it into an actual BIP, writing serious unit tests, and merging back code into bitconj trunk. The email also talks about implementing subscription cancellation and upgrade/downgrade features and extending RecurringPaymentDetails message to solve the problem of subscription changes and cancellations for free. The concept of a subscription, referred to by a unique id, which has multiple contracts with validity periods, is introduced. All of this contract metadata is returned to the wallet so the user can make an informed decision. The team is looking for feedback on how to report errors to the wallet and suggests adding a simple status_code in PaymentRequest or using the memo field along with an empty set of outputs.</summary>
