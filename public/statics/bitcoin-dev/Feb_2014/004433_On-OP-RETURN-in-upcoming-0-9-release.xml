    <summary>In an email dated 24th February 2014, Jeff Garzik suggested a pull request that would reduce the size to 40 bytes. However, he noted that the change in the template matching code did not enforce the most efficient encoding, instead it only limited the number of bytes of data allowed. This meant that even a bare OP_RETURN would be allowed. Jeremy suggested that if they wanted to strictly require no PUSHDATA, they should modify the code as follows: `else if (opcode2 == OP_SMALLDATA) { // small pushdata, = OP_PUSHDATA1 || vch1.size() &gt; MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY) break; }`</summary>
