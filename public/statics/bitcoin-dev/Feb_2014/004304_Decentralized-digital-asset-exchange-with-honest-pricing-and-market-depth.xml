    <summary>Peter Todd posted on a Bitcoin mailing list about a mechanism proposed by Alex Mizrahi based on SIGHASH_SINGLE that allows secure transfer of colored coins or similar embedded consensus assets in exchange for Bitcoins atomically. The p2p 2-step-trade mechanism operates in two steps. In the first step, Bob sends Alice a partially signed transaction with an output that can only be spent by her, and Alice signs and broadcasts it to the network. In the second step, Alice sends Bob a partially signed transaction with an output that can only be spent by him, and Bob signs and broadcasts it to the network. Peter Todd requested information about earlier attributions/reinventions for the 2-step-trade protocol using SIGHASH_SINGLE to give credit where due.</summary>
