    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-development mailing list, Troy Benjegerdes criticizes MtGox for blaming a bug that was already documented and known for years. He also accuses MtGox of market manipulation under the guise of blaming developers and exchanges. Pieter Wuille responds by noting that the malleability of transactions was already known and is not a significant problem, but that wallets need to be aware of it. Wuille proposes a normalized transaction ID to identify transactions unambiguously. Benjegerdes expresses concern about off-list discussions and the power they give insiders. He suggests that more technical details should be broadcast to the mailing list and that a code release would be a huge win for MtGox and cement their position as market leader in transparent cryptocurrency trading. Finally, he questions why revolutions always put the same old bullshit back in power and calls for transparent code evolution. In addition, he asks if there is any third-party archive of bitcointalk.org as he prefers mailing lists and likes to have an archive.</summary>
