    <summary>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Peter Todd responded to a query from Troy Benjegerdes about developing a multicoin-qt wallet that runs on two blockchains. Todd clarified the difference between cross-chain trading and the “clever 2-party-trade trick,” noting that the former does not allow for the latter. Benjegerdes then asked if there was a simple way to do cross-chain trades without needing a third chain to facilitate the process.</summary>
