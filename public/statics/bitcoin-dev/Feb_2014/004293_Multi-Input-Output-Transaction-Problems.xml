    <summary>The individual is having trouble with a multi input/multi output transaction. The code works for 1 input and 2 output, however when adding more inputs/outputs the transaction gets rejected. They are looking for ideas on what they may be doing wrong to cause this issue. The individual provided some pseudo code showing a working transaction. Two sets of code were provided, one set which worked (1 input, 2 outputs) and another that did not (2 inputs, 4 outputs). The working transaction's vouts were made using CScript, while the non-working transaction's vouts were not defined properly. There may be an issue in the way the scriptPubKey was set for the non-working transaction.</summary>
