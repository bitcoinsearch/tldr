    <summary>The writer is questioning the addition of a memory limited mempool or something prior to release to prevent low-risk DDoS exploit due to the fee drop. They are concerned about the network bandwidth DoS attack mitigation strategy relying on transactions accepted to mempools getting mined, and the clearance rate of new low-fee transactions being small, causing problems in the past with mempool growth during high demand. They also point out that large groups of low-fee transactions can be created and then cheaply double-spent with higher fee transactions to consume network bandwidth. The writer thinks it is irresponsible to release software that has known and obvious DoS attack vulnerabilities that did not exist in the previous version, and notes that Bitcoin is not a good medium for microtransactions despite claims to the contrary.</summary>
