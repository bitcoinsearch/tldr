    <summary>Mat√≠as Alejo Garcia, a developer working on Bitcore and Insight for BitPay team, has invited people to contribute patches, suggestions, and bug reports on their GitHub page. Insight also offers blockchain query capabilities through its REST/Websockets API, which is explained in the Readme document. It is important to note that Insight is a software package that can be downloaded, installed and used alongside a trusted bitcoind instance. The demo installations of live.bitcore.io / test.bitcore.io are just for demonstration purposes. Additionally, Melvin Carvalho shared information about a free software testnet explorer based on javascript/node called http://test.bitcore.io/. He also mentioned his work on a testnet explorer and the possibility of adding semantic web style markup attributes to the HTML.
