    <summary>The context suggests a possible mitigation for flooding through discussion and process BIP, which needs further thought and analysis before being acted upon. The author presents two possibilities regarding the value of transactions with lower fees, stating that if orphan costs outweigh the value, miners may refuse to include them en-masse. Alternatively, if the total value of transactions is not outweighed by orphan costs, miners may stop including useful transactions and face pressure to change their policies. The author notes that the possibility of a DoS attack through flooding small transactions is only an issue in the first situation and is not the easiest or cheapest method of DoS attack on Bitcoin. However, the author acknowledges the need for more DoS resistance, which requires significant time spent on resource scheduling and code audits. Overall, the context highlights the importance of careful consideration and analysis before implementing any changes to mitigate potential issues.</summary>
