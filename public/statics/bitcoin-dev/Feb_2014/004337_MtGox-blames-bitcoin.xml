    <summary>In a forum discussion on bitcointalk.org, user naman naman brought up a possible attack scenario, which was met with little response from Bitcoin developers except for a short reply from Greg. Naman naman expressed disappointment in the lack of acknowledgement and responsibility shown by the developers. He also messaged some of the devs with the suggestion that the attack be named "thenoblebot" after his handle, meant to be a joke but ended up causing disruption in the ecosystem. Another user, Vocatus Gate, suggested a solution to the problem of relying on TxID for tracking: making unique transactions based on inputs, outputs, and receiving addresses. Peter Todd added that this kind of attack is more of a social engineering issue and can be prevented through well-thought-out payment protocols like BIP70 and stealth addresses.</summary>
