    <summary>Bitcoin blocks contain a coinbase transaction at the beginning, which is special because it can pay coins to its outputs without having to specify an input. The total value of the outputs of the coinbase transaction cannot exceed the block value plus the fees. This is checked in ConnectBlock in the Bitcoin source code. The coinbase transaction's value is also checked on line 1731. The only transactions in which the sum of the outputs can be larger than the sum of the inputs are the coinbase transactions which cannot have inputs. The outputs from the coinbase transaction can be spent like any other output.</summary>
