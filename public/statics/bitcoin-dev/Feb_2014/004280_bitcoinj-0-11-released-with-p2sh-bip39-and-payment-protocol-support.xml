    <summary>Bitcoinj 0.11 has been released, which is a library for writing Bitcoin applications that run on the JVM. Some notable changes and new features include an implementation of BIP39 ("Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys"), compatibility with the latest Trezor implementation, the wallet can now send to P2SH addresses, the network layer was rewritten from scratch, the wallet can now watch arbitrary addresses and scripts, Bloom filtering was also improved, a new PostgreSQL based pruning block store was added, micropayment channels got many big improvements to the API and implementation, the default USER_THREAD executor can now be replaced, allowing a 1-line switch of all callbacks onto a thread of your choice instead of needing to override each callback, each time and a new DNS seed has been added. Smaller improvements include adding nullity annotations to the API, the WalletAppKit got a bunch of new features and convenience APIs, the wallet will now create inputs with dummy signatures if the private key for an output is missing, rather than throwing an exception. Notable bug fixes were made and some API changes were implemented. Also, in futureÂ the author plans to re-namespace the library from com.google.bitcoin to org.bitcoinj - auto-migration scripts will be provided when this is done.</summary>
