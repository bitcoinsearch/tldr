    <summary>In a 2014 email exchange, Bitcoin Core developer Drak was asked about the response of the developers regarding MtGox's claim that their issues were due to a fault in Bitcoin rather than their own. Drak responded by stating that both parties were at fault for different reasons. While Bitcoin made it difficult for implementers to get things right, MtGox failed to implement the protocol in a way that dealt with known behaviors since 2011. He also explained that Malleability, a process where transaction IDs can be changed, is irrelevant when it comes to basic funds safety. In order to cancel or reissue a payment without risking theft, double-spending must occur. Input tracking is necessary and sufficient for all cancellation cases. Although mutation handling is necessary for support and accounting purposes, it is not necessary or sufficient for cancellation security. Drak expressed a willingness to help MtGox with technical issues and mentioned that removing malleability has been a long-term goal.</summary>
