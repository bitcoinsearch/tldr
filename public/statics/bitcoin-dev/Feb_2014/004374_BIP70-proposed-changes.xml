    <summary>In this email thread, Gavin Andresen and Ryan X. Charles share complementary thoughts on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) related to the payment protocol. Ryan points out that the payment protocol is missing a concept of payment status, and he suggests adding a message that can return the merchant's view of the status of the transaction(s). He also proposes that the payment protocol should implement merge avoidance to increase customer and merchant privacy. Furthermore, he thinks that the world needs to abandon timezones altogether for everything and only use UTC. In response, Andreas Schildbach suggests making changes to BIP70 to require UTC for times (e.g. expires), and to clarify the definition of timezone. He also thinks that it should be required for the first certificate plus all intermediate certificates (if any) to be present in the pki_data, but not the root certificate. Gavin agrees with requiring UTC and including all intermediate certificates in the pki_data. He suggests that allowing the root certificate to be present would be compatible with other tls code. Additionally, he mentions that BitPay is working on a new standard based on bitcoin-like addresses for authentication, and they hope to establish a complete, decentralized authentication protocol with the community. Finally, he notes that BitPay has proposed a new standard, BIP 73, for shorter URIs and less dense QR codes.</summary>
