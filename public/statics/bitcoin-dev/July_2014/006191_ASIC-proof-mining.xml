    <summary>On July 4, 2014, Gregory Maxwell responded to an email from Andy Parkins regarding a Bitcoin idea. While Maxwell did not think the idea was good and was skeptical about fixed versions, he assured Parkins that many others had similar thoughts and would find the discussion interesting. Despite the impracticality of the idea, Parkins appreciated the thorough and courteous response and found it educational.</summary>
