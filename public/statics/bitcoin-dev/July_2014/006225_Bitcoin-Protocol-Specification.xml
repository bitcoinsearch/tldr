    <summary>It is possible to create proper protocol specifications other than the original C++ version for Bitcoin, as it is a finite code base. However, no one has succeeded in doing so thus far, even those who attempted to reimplement the code by reading it. The main issue is that Bitcoin is quite complex, and any attempts at creating new protocols could come with risks and challenges. Nonetheless, it remains a possibility for the future.</summary>
