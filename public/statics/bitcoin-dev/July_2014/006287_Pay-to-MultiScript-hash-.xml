    <summary>Jeremy had an idea for a new transaction type that matches on script hashes similar to pay to script hash, but it checks for one of N scripts. However, this idea seems less flexible and efficient compared to the Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree construction. Although it may be slightly easier to implement, it would not be any easier to deploy. The proposed idea was already discussed by Tier Nolan in the "Selector Script" thread recently mentioned on the same list.</summary>
