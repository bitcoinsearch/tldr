    <summary>The email thread discusses an issue with creating a password on iOS devices with astral characters and not being able to enter that password on a JVM wallet. It is noted that JVMs may not support Unicode NFC, which could limit the spec to the subset of Unicode that all popular platforms can support. However, it is suggested that it might be a JVM string library bug that could be reported and fixed. The issue is due to the character from the astral planes, which Java may not support due to its use of 16-bit characters internally. It is recommended that any implementation that wishes to be compatible with JVM-based wallets refuse any passphrase that includes characters outside the BMP unless a fix is found. This is not expected to hurt anyone.</summary>
