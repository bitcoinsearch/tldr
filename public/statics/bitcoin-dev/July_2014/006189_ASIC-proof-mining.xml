    <summary>In an email exchange on July 4th, 2014, Alan Reiner and Dr. Andy Parkins discuss the ROMix-like algorithm. The algorithm requires a different 32 MB of the blockchain for each hash, which is uniformly distributed throughout the blockchain. There is no way to predict which 32 MB will be required until it has been executed. If the difficulty is high enough, miners may need to search through the entire X GB blockchain while searching for a good hash. However, other nodes will only need to do 32 MB worth of disk accesses to verify their answer, but it will be unknown which 32 MB until they execute the 1,000,000 hash+lookup operations on their X GB blockchain.</summary>
