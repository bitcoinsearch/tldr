    <summary>The writer, a seasoned software developer, seeks guidance on how to contribute to Bitcoin for learning purposes. They express interest in contributing to unit tests and understanding the Bitcoin code from top to bottom. Additionally, they would like to write a Bitcoin wallet in another language but are unsure where to get the "Bitcoin - Core Wallet" code. The writer requests information on the tools and frameworks needed to work on tests and preferred IDE and full development stack, as well as guidance on where to start looking at the Bitcoin core code and the wallet code. They inquire about whether there is a separate area for core wallet development on Github and mailing lists. The writer hopes that there is a wiki doc for new developers that would reduce their searching and experimentation time.</summary>
