    <summary>The discussion in this email thread revolves around the security measures of breadwallet, an iOS application for Bitcoin storage. The original poster suggests recording the time to disk when a PIN attempt is made and refusing to allow more attempts if time goes backward. Aaron Voisine responds that breadwallet's security is based on block height rather than block timestamp and that a pin-locked device is reasonably secure due to hardware AES encryption. Gregory Maxwell questions whether breadwallet is tamper-resistant and zero-on-tamper hardware, while William Yager argues that it is difficult to attach to a process on an iOS device and change its system time. The discussion concludes without a clear resolution on the security benefits of recording time to disk.</summary>
