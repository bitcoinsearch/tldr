    <summary>The writer is seeking help to understand the input signature script of a specific transaction ID (tx 70f7c15c6f62139cc41afa858894650344eda9975b46656d893ee59df8914a3d). The ECC library being used by the writer has failed to verify the point, which needs to be positive. The writer has tried to modify it by simply modulo curve.order, but that didn't work either. The writer is looking for guidance on how to obtain a positive value for point P (where Py = 0 and Py &gt;= 0).</summary>
