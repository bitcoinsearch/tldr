    <summary>Aaron Voisine, the creator of breadwallet, announced that the upcoming release of the wallet will use the height of the blockchain to enforce timed pin code lockouts. This feature is designed to prevent attackers from quickly making multiple pin guesses and changing the device's system time to get around the lockout period. However, a concern was raised regarding the tamper resistance and zero on tamper hardware of breadwallet. The user questioned if the security feature was just security theater, as an attacker could attach a debugger to the process or modify the program and ignore the block sourced time.</summary>
