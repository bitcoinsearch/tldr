    <summary>On July 27, 2014, Jeremy Rubin raised concerns about a potential network exploit going on. He discovered that an unnamed node came online and is processing the most traffic out of any tor node. The node has been up for three days and is mostly processing plaintext Bitcoin traffic through port 8333. Alex Stamos was also included in the discussion. They discussed what this could mean and wanted to raise it to the attention of the group for further discussion. The node's activity is probably expensive to run, as the most expensive server at the company hosting costs â‚¬299/month with 50TB of traffic.</summary>
