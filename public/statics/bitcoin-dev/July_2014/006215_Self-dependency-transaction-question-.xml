    <summary>A developer is working on the UTXO database for their Python implementation of bitcoind and has come across a situation they did not realize was valid. They are asking if the 3rd transaction of a block could use the 4th transaction from the same block as an input, or if transactions are processed strictly top to bottom. They also ask what would happen if a transaction was self-referencing and had an output Y, would Y be a new valid utxo, without being a generation transaction input.</summary>
