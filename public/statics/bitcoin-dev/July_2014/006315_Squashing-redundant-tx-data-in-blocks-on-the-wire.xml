    <summary>In an email from 2014, Emin GÃ¼n Sirer discussed a problem similar to "set reconciliation" where peer A believes that the set of transactions that should be in the block is S_A. The focus in this space is on minimizing data transfer, especially for the miner-interested case where round complexity is crucial. Many proposals have been made, but some are not optimal and may require a round-trip. Sirer mentioned a previous proposal to use forward error correction to minimize data transfer while maintaining a low probability of needing a round-trip, with a tradeoff for more overhead for lower roundtrip probability.</summary>
