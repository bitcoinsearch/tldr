    <summary>Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, has expressed concern over some nodes rapidly connecting to the same node, taking up public slots. Garzik noted that there was no reason for such abuse and that other seeders were also rapidly reconnecting (although with a slightly wider time window). The version message, which helpfully tells Garzik his own IP address, does not provide information on the abusers' IPs.</summary>
