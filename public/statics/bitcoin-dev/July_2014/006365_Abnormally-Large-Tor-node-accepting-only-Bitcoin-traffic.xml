    <summary>On the Bitcoin-Development mailing list, a user expressed concern about a bitcoin-only exit node that had no traffic leaving it. Multiple people confirmed that the node is connected to an abnormally large percentage of the Bitcoin network, leading the original poster to suspect a Sybil attack. However, another user pointed out that the lack of traffic might be due to the fact that Tor speculatively builds circuits at startup on the assumption they'll be used for web browsing. Additionally, running a Tor exit node that only allows port 8333 could be a way to contribute exit bandwidth without much risk of getting raided by law enforcement.</summary>
