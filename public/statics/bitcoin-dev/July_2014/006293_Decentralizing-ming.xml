    <summary>The email thread starts with a message from someone apologizing for replying to the wrong subject line in the thread. The writer then suggests that the best path forward is to finish off getblocktemplate support in various tools so that it's possible to pool for payout purposes without giving up control of block creation modulo the coinbase. This would hopefully persuade some non-trivial chunk of hashpower to go back to running their own node and start the process of turning pools merely into payout trackers rather than block selectors. Next, Mike Hearn responds to Jeff's message about GPU mining. Mike notes that Satoshi's only comment on the topic of GPU mining was to wish for a gentlemen's agreement to postpone it as long as possible, to help make sure the distribution of coins was as even as possible. This predated pooled mining.</summary>
