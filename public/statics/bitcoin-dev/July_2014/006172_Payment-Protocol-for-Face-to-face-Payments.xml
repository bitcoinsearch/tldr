    <summary>The sender is discussing the importance of having a priority and fallback method for phone clients and suggests p2p radio as priority, web as fallback, and BIP21 as always-working-default. They aim to provide the same level of user experience for Bitcoin users as contactless card users. The matter of encryption over Bluetooth is also mentioned but low-level problems need to be sorted out before that stage. Backwards compatibility is brought up in regards to processing multiple "r" parameters where the array solution is suggested. However, this may not work well with repeating parameters, so a completely new parameter may need to be added to address upcoming issues with accommodating other protocols. Existing BIP72 may also need to be modified to strictly define "r=" as an HTTP(s) only parameter, while all other protocols should go to the new array parameter.</summary>
