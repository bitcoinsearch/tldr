    <summary>Mike Hearn opened a pull request for a draft BIP for getutxo. The document describes a small P2P protocol extension that performs UTXO lookups given a set of outpoints. Full Bitcoin nodes maintain a database called the unspent transaction output set, which is how double spending is checked for: to be valid a transaction must identify unspent outputs in this set using an identifier called an "outpoint", which is merely the hash of the output's containing transaction plus an index. The ability to query this can be useful for a lightweight/SPV client, which does not have the full UTXO set at hand. Two new messages are defined; the "getutxos" message and "utxos" response message. Nodes indicate support by advertising a protocol version above 70003 and by setting a new NODE_GETUTXO flag in their nServices field, which has a value of 2 (1).</summary>
