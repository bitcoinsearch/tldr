    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Melvin Carvalho shared an article about GHash committing to a 40% hashrate cap at the Bitcoin Mining Summit. Concerns were raised about why limiting oneself to only a 50% chance of successfully double-spending a 6 confirm transaction is not acceptable. Satoshi's quote about postponing the GPU arms race for the good of the network was also mentioned. The email ended with a promotion for Black Duck Code Sight, a software that indexes and searches up to 200,000 lines of code.</summary>
