    <summary>There are two websites where Tor nodes can be listed by bandwidth. One of the nodes is an exit node on port 8333 only, and blockchain.info has recorded information about the IP address going back to May 2014. A discussion among Bitcoin developers ensued regarding the need for better incoming connection limiting, with one suggesting a scheme with interactive proof-of-memory. Another developer could not find any nodes connected to it, though they did not consider it to be a significant issue. The conversation took place over an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
