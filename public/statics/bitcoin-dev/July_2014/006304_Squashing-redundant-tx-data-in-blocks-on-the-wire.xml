    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin-development mailing list on July 18th, 2014 Kaz Wesley suggested that peers should exchange mempool priority policies to accomplish flexibility in which transactions to remember. He also suggested assigning unique sequential IDs for each transaction. The proposed new messages were sparseblock, invack message, and gettx. Ordering policies should allow arbitrary algebraic combinations of their parameters, as well as thresholds. Wesley also pointed out that this allows for an environment of completely heterogeneous mempool policies. In response, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, shared his thoughts on how policy-scripts could be used by miners to advertise things like their relative price of sigops vs bytes.</summary>
