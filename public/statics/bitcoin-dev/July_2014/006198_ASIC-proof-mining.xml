    <summary>A participant in a conversation about Mike's decentralization blog post has suggested that the mining problem could potentially be solved by changing the reward structure. Rather than relying on proof of work/asics, the suggestion is to allocate a portion of the reward to runner-ups, even if their block is orphaned. This would involve X% of the block reward going to Y number of runner-ups based on a certain criteria. However, this could create downsides such as having to keep the orphaned blocks around in the future. The question then remains as to what criteria should be used for the X% payout/allocation.</summary>
