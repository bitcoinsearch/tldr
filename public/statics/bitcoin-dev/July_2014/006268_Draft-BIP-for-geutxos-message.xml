    <summary>In a discussion about a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), Jeff Garzik raises concerns over the security of querying multiple nodes and combining their answers, which is only mentioned partially in the BIP. He suggests that this method should only be used if there are no trusted solutions available, and calls for a warning label to be added to the proposal. Garzik also notes that there is a lack of discussion on this choice in the BIP. In response, Mike Hearn points out that the writeup attached to the implementation pull request covers how to make the proposal secure, as well as the "Authentication" section of the BIP. However, he acknowledges that the proposed solution involves a chain fork, which is a large project. The BIP does discuss the security issue raised by Garzik, but Hearn welcomes suggestions on how to improve it. Finally, Garzik draws a comparison between this proposal and BIP 35, but Hearn argues that the two proposals are not comparable.</summary>
