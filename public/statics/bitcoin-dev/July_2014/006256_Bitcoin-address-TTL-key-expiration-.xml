    <summary>There are reasons why deposits might not be able to use PaymentRequests even when wallets or computers are offline since payments happen regardless of whether the sender is online or offline. However, it is important to note that the sender must be online to parse the PaymentRequest and follow the instructions. Negotiating HD wallet details enables users to use a new address every time. There have been discussions about extending BIP 70 to allow for this, as well as proposing an expiry time for addresses. While BIP70 satisfies some use cases, designing extensions to address situations where BIP70 is not feasible or suboptimal is necessary.</summary>
