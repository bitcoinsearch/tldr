    <summary>Pieter Wuille sent a pull request to make a small change to BIP 62, his anti-malleability proposal that is still in draft. He made two of the seven new rules mandatory for old-style transactions in new blocks, and he believes that both have no use cases. The reason for this change is to drop the requirement for signature verification engines to be bug-for-bug compatible with OpenSSL, which supports many non-standard encodings for signatures. Instead, he requires strict DER compliance for signatures, so any implementation just needs to support DER. Wladimir agrees with this change as it is better to strictly define what is allowed instead of relying on bug-for-bug compatibility.</summary>
