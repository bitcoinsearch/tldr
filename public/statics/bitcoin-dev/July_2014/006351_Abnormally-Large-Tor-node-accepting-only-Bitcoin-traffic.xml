    <summary>A potential network exploit has been identified where an unnamed node has come online in the last three days and is processing the most traffic out of any Tor node. The node has only port 8333 open and is mostly processing plaintext Bitcoin traffic. It has been up for three days, and this is probably expensive to run as the most expensive server at the company hosting costs â‚¬299/month with 50TB of traffic. Alex Stamos and Jeremy Rubin have been discussing this on Twitter and wanted to bring it to the attention of the group for discussion.</summary>
