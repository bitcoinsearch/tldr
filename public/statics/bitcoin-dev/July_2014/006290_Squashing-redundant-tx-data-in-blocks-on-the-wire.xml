    <summary>The author is moving a design document to a Github gist in order to integrate any future changes. They mention that an important improvement over their initial idea is that bloom filters don't need to be kept around and built up, but can instead be one-shot and clear matching entries upon arrival. The author plans to work on the implementation details of this proposal such as message format and capability advertisement once there is support for it. Gavin Andresen suggests coding a prototype first in whatever language the author is most familiar with. He also suggests combining the optimizations with "broadcast as many near-miss blocks as bandwidth will allow" on a mining backbone network to achieve faster propagation of newly solved blocks. The author plans to work on the design details while simultaneously working on a prototype.</summary>
