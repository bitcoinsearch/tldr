    <summary>The email thread discusses the behavior of a Bitcoin crawler software, specifically its frequency of reconnection. The author notes that the software should not reconnect more than once every 15 minutes. However, it is suggested that two connections may actually be different instances. The conversation then shifts to the version message and its usefulness in determining IP addresses. It is recommended to try -logips as logging peer IPs was disabled by default after #3764. Wladimir also observes abusive behavior and questions why the requests need to be so frequent. The email ends with an advertisement for Infragistics Professional and a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
