    <summary>The document in question already mentions that a local network attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on all the peers. The last sentence of the authentication section suggests querying multiple nodes and combining their answers as a partial solution, but highlights that since nothing authenticates the Bitcoin P2P network, incorrect results are still possible. It is suggested that changes be made to the document to call out this vulnerability more specifically. A diff with proposed changes can be sent upon request.</summary>
