    <summary>On July 2, 2014, Isidor Zeuner shared a link to a PDF document about Bitcoin's design, which can be found at enetium.com/resources/Bitcoin.pdf. JMOlmos GMail commented on the post, asking if there was a translation available. Isidor responded that the document is a great reference for anyone interested in Bitcoin and suggested putting the source under version control to facilitate tracking future protocol improvements. The conversation took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by lists.sourceforge.net. A message promoting the Bonita BPM Community Edition was also included in the email chain. Overall, the PDF document is praised as a comprehensive resource for those who want to learn about Bitcoin without delving into code.</summary>
