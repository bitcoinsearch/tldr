    <summary>In an email conversation on July 15th, 2014, Jeff Garzik pointed out that BIP70 was not suitable for an unknown number of future payments of unknown value. In response, the recipient offered a solution where zero can be specified as an output value and reused until it expires, providing the same functionality as BIP70. However, this scenario may result in address reuse, which is no worse than with an extended textual address.</summary>
