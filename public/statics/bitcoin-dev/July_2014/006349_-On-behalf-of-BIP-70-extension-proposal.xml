    <summary>In an email exchange, a person named Mark is informed that their proposal for a new feature in Bitcoin is similar to a proposal made some time ago. The email includes a link to the old proposal and states that the outlines of the design are clear and the two proposals do not differ substantially. However, it is noted that someone needs to make the proposal a reality.</summary>
