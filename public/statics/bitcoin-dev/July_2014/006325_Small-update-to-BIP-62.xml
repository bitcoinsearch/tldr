    <summary>In a discussion about the rationale behind Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) #62, Mike Hearn questioned why rule #4 was necessary. This rule states that any non-push operation in a scriptSig invalidates it, which is meant to prevent malleability. However, Wladimir pointed out that this issue is already covered in BIP62 and making it mandatory for old transactions does not provide much protection against malleability. The reason for including rule #4 is simply because allowing non-push operations in scriptSig does not benefit anyone.</summary>
