    <summary>In a discussion between Odinn Cyberguerrilla and Wladimir, the topic of SOCKS4 and SOCKS4a was brought up. Odinn had believed that SOCKS4 would aid in preventing information leaks, however, Wladimir notes that SOCKS4a supports DNS lookups on the server, but it is not supported by bitcoin core. Wladimir adds that SOCKS5 can do everything that SOCKS4 can do, and states that if someone wanted to contribute SOCKS4a support, it would be acceptable.</summary>
