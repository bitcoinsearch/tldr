    <summary>In an email exchange between Mark van Cuijk and Mike, the former expressed his interest in a postponed idea. However, he clarifies that this is not technically the case, but rather the upgrade requires some work from many people who are currently busy with other things. Mike had proposed the idea of a PP issuing non-SSL certificates for the purpose of merchant identification, however, Mark suggests the opposite, where a merchant issues an extension cert to allow the PP to act on their behalf. They also discussed the choice of how to authenticate the PP, with Mark preferring his proposal due to backward compatibility concerns, while Mike's extended certificate system was deemed cleaner but required two separate signatures for old and new clients.</summary>
