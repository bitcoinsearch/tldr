    <summary>Bitcoinj is a Java-based library that provides everything to plug together a basic SPV wallet and runs in the JVM. On 29/07/2014, Caleb Roger Davis expressed his interest in contributing to Bitcoin for learning purposes. He wanted to contribute to unit and/or other types of tests (code), not production code, understand the Bitcoin code (as much as possible from top to bottom), and write a Bitcoin wallet in another language. Caleb was interested in Clojure, a modern dialect of Lisp, and Felipe Micaroni Lalli suggested implementing Bitcoin in Clojure or Scheme. The discussion also included links to stack exchange and PGP ID, and Caleb requested direction on where to get started.</summary>
