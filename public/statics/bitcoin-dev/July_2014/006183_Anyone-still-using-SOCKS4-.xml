    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Wladimir proposed removing support for SOCKS4 in the next major release. The reasons given were that it would remove some unused code and improve privacy by allowing DNS redirection. Another reason was that SOCKS5 supports IPv6. With no objections raised, the removal of SOCKS4 was set to go ahead. The email also included a message promoting Bonita BPM Community Edition, an open source business process management suite built on Java and Eclipse.</summary>
