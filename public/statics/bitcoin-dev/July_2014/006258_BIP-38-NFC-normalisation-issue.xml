    <summary>Andreas' code is performing normalization, but the output bytes are different. The discrepancy is due to a character from the astral planes, which Java doesn't support because it uses 16-bit characters internally. As a result, any implementation that wants to work with JVM-based wallets should refuse passphrases that include characters outside the BMP unless someone can find a fix. This likely won't have a significant impact on users.</summary>
