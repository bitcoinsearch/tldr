    <summary>The conversation revolves around the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and a specific issue raised by the user. The BIP suggests querying multiple nodes and combining their answers as a partial solution to the issue, which the user found unhelpful for their question #2 and received no response for question #3.A draft BIP for getutxo has been proposed by Mike Hearn, which performs UTXO lookups given a set of outpoints. Two new messages are defined in the specification, "getutxos" and "utxos," with the latter returning the height of the chain at the moment the result was calculated, a block hash of the top of the chain, an array of bytes encoding one bit for each outpoint queried, and a list of result objects. The ability to query the unspent transaction output set can be useful for a lightweight/SPV client that does not have the full UTXO set at hand. Nodes indicate support by advertising a protocol version above 70003 and by setting a new NODE_GETUTXO flag in their nServices field, which has a value of 2 (1).However, there are security concerns over the untrusted view of UTXO, which may be malicious or wrong. Jeff Garzik expressed his concern about the lack of helpful advice in the BIP on querying multiple nodes and combining their answers as a partial solution. He suggested that such an approach should only be used if a trusted solution is not available and called for a warning label to be added to the proposal. Mike Hearn points out that the writeup attached to the implementation pull request covers how to make the proposal secure, as well as the "Authentication" section of the BIP. However, he acknowledges that the proposed solution involves a chain fork, which is a large project. The BIP does discuss the security issue raised by Garzik, but Hearn welcomes suggestions on how to improve it.The BIP already discusses how to make the system secure in the Upgrade section of the writeup and Authentication section of the BIP. A possible solution has been proposed to address this issue. The writer agrees to fix any part of the BIP that may be misleading and welcomes suggestions for improvement. It is suggested that changes be made to the document to call out this vulnerability more specifically. A diff with proposed changes can be sent upon request. The conversation suggests an alternative option of querying a block explorer or other trusted third party if the constraints are insufficient for the user's use case, to make the BIP clearer. The ability to use a trusted third party is always present, and it does not need stating. However, the respondent agrees to add a sentence suggesting an alternative option of querying a block explorer or other trusted third party if the constraints are insufficient for the user's use case, to make the BIP clearer.The comparison between this and BIP 35 (mempool command) is not apt as miners and full nodes treat "mempool" returned data differently than "getutxos" command that proffers post-verification trusted data. The conversation also discusses the lack of security considerations section in the BIP and the need to document weaknesses. It is suggested that some things should be broken out of the auth section into a security/security-limitations section. Moreover, the document should call out specifically that a local network attacker can MITM all the peers. The IETF documents require a security considerations section, which is absent in the BIP. Therefore, it is suggested that weaknesses should be documented as set out from the rest of the document.</summary>
