    <summary>In an email thread from 2014, Mike Hearn raised an objection to Krzysztof Okupski's document, which attempted to describe the Bitcoin protocol in English. Hearn argued that calling it a "protocol spec" was incorrect since implementing it based on the description would result in errors. He cited examples such as the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug and unspecified difficulty transitions. However, he acknowledged its value as a loose description for newbies and suggested linking it in the developer guide. Regarding the possibility of creating other proper protocol specifications, Hearn questioned if it was feasible apart from the C++ original. Krzysztof Okupski responded by adding a license file to make integration of changes made by others smoother and placing the updated spec under version control on GitHub while maintaining the old PDF link.</summary>
