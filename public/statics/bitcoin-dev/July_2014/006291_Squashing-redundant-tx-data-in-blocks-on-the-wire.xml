    <summary>In an email thread dated July 17, 2014, Kaz Wesley proposed that a node should have the ability to forget invs it has seen without invalidating what peers know about its known txes. To achieve this, a node would assemble a bloom filter. Additionally, another option suggested was to keep at least the last N sent in each direction to limit memory usage. However, it was noted that going beyond these options may not be worth it unless there are significant gains. It was recommended to measure the benefits before implementing any complex solutions. The email also included a link to a more complex idea for block network coding on the Bitcoin wiki page.</summary>
