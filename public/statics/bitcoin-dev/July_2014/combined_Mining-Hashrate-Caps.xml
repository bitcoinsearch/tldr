    <summary>GHash, a major bitcoin mining pool, has committed to a 40% hashrate cap at the Bitcoin Mining Summit. This is due to concerns raised over GHash's increasing control over the network, which could lead to the ability to double-spend bitcoins and undermine trust in the system if they reach a majority share. The commitment from GHash aims to promote a more decentralized mining ecosystem and address these concerns. Satoshi Nakamoto's quote about postponing the GPU arms race in mining for the good of the network was also mentioned, highlighting the ongoing tension between decentralization and profit and efficiency in the mining industry.On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Melvin Carvalho shared an article discussing GHash's hashrate cap commitment and concerns were raised about why limiting oneself to only a 50% chance of successfully double-spending a 6 confirm transaction is not acceptable. The email ended with a promotion for Black Duck Code Sight, a software that indexes and searches up to 200,000 lines of code.In another email conversation on the Bitcoin-documentation mailing list, Mark Friedenbach asked for an explanation as to why limiting oneself to a 50% chance of successfully double-spending a 6 confirm transaction is still unacceptable. David A. Harding responded, stating that they were working on something similar and getting close to submitting a pull request for the Bitcoin.org website. He provided a preview link to the section of the website that will address the issue and noted that the discussion regarding this document belongs on the Bitcoin-documentation mailing list, providing a link to the thread.</summary>
