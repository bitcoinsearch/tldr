    <summary>The Tor project warns about SOCKS and DNS information leaks, suggesting that using Socks4A may be a better alternative. The warning is based on the fact that applications using socks5 only give Tor an IP address, while applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak information. In response to this, someone questioned whether there was any good reason for SOCKS4 and SOCKS4A. They also asked if there would be a problem with having a setting for SOCKS4A for traffic in a setup that includes Tor, Privoxy, I2P, and FoxyProxy together while running Bitcoin Core, given the changes proposed to remove SOCKS4 as suggested in bitcoin-development. In response, Wladimir stated that they plan on removing support for SOCKS4 in the next major release for two reasons: it would remove some crufty, hardly tested code paths, and SOCKS5 offers better privacy as it allows DNS redirection. Additionally, SOCKS5 supports IPv6.</summary>
