    <summary>In an email conversation on July 14, 2014, Mike Hearn asks whether it would be possible to create proper protocol specifications other than the original C++ codebase for Bitcoin. The response is affirmative, but with a caveat that everyone who has tried so far has failed. Even those who attempted to reimplement it by reading the code keep getting subtle details wrong. It is suggested that it should be possible one day assuming Bitcoin doesn't become more complex, but it's a minefield.</summary>
