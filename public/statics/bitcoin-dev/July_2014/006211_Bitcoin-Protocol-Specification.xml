    <summary>In a message sent on July 8, 2014, Matt Whitlock inquired about the existence of a specification document for Satoshi's Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocol. He was interested in understanding how blocks and transactions were communicated over the network. In response, a high-level guide was provided via a link to bitcoin.org's developer guide. However, it was noted that this guide was not a protocol specification but rather a description of the P2P network. The wiki page was deemed adequate for describing the P2P protocol which consists mainly of a framing mechanism with aggressive checksumming, a version handshake, an inventory mechanism, and alerts.</summary>
