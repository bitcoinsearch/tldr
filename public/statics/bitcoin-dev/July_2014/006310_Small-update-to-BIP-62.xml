    <summary>On July 18, 2014, Mike Hearn raised a question regarding rule #4 of scriptSig. He couldn't understand the rationale behind this specific rule. According to the rule, any non-push operation within scriptSig invalidates it. This rule is essential because having non-push operations in scriptSig can lead to malleability as multiple sequences of opcodes can evaluate to the same result. The purpose of this rule is to protect Bitcoin transactions from being manipulated or altered by malicious actors. Non-push operations are used to modify the signature, which can change the transaction ID, making it difficult for nodes to verify the validity of the transaction. The rule ensures that scriptSig remains valid and doesn't allow any unauthorized modifications. Wladimir, the creator of Bitcoin's core software, responded to Mike's query, explaining the significance of rule #4. He emphasized that the rule aims to prevent the possibility of manipulation and ensure the security of Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
