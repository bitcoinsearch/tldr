    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Pieter, they discuss changes to Bitcoin's consensus rules. Rule #4 is mentioned as being unnecessary and not standard, with Pieter suggesting it should be made into a consensus rule if it's controversial. The conversation then turns to backwards compatibility and the importance of preserving it over technical niceness until old versions have been phased out. Pieter expresses concern about dropping OpenSSL-based signature parsing until well-defined rules are established for valid encodings. However, he suggests investigating how many non-DER signatures still make it into blocks before making any changes.</summary>
