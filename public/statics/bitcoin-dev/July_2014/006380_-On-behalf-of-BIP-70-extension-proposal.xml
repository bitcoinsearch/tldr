    <summary>In a conversation between Mark van Cuijk and Mike Hearn, they discussed the implementation of a new BIP for formalizing the extensions process. Mike expressed his frustration with payment processors not using useful memo fields and hopes that once wallets start displaying memos in their transactions list, this will change. Mark offered to write the proposal for the new BIP but was unsure whether it should be a standalone BIP or part of BIP70. They also discussed how the extensions process should describe the proposal's process.</summary>
