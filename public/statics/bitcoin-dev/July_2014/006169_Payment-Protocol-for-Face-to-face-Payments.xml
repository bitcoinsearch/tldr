    <summary>The BIP72 has a problem where there is no fallback alternative URI for payment request fetch if client wallet supports BIP70 but doesn't support fetching over Bluetooth or when a Bluetooth connection fails. The idea is to have the recipient wallet upload to the internet and expose the payment request over Bluetooth simultaneously, allowing the sending wallet to pick whichever radio layer works best in its current conditions. However, Bluetooth support is not specced in any BIP and lacks link-layer encryption. Bitcoin Wallet also does not properly implement BIP 72. Further spec and implementation work is needed to push this work forward.</summary>
