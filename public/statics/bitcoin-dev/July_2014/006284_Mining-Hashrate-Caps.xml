    <summary>In an email conversation on the Bitcoin-documentation mailing list, Mark Friedenbach asked for an explanation as to why limiting oneself to a 50% chance of successfully double-spending a 6 confirm transaction is still unacceptable. David A. Harding responded, stating that they were asked to work on something like this about a month ago and are getting close to submitting a pull request for the Bitcoin.org website. He also provided a preview link to the section of the website that will address the issue. The discussion regarding the document belongs on the Bitcoin-documentation mailing list and a link to the thread was also provided.</summary>
