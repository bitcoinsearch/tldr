    <summary>Alan Reiner, a software developer, expressed his hope to provide an optional service to synchronize data between parties. However, before creating oneâ€™s own service, it would be better to add Bitmessage integration to provide the P2P communication layer. The author suggests that Bitmessage should be more trusted in the long term because the service created by an individual would not be their primary product or core competency. The message concludes with a call to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and a link to learn how to do so.</summary>
