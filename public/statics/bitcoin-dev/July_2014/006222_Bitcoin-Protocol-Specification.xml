    <summary>The protocol for newbies is an important resource for those who are new to the field. It has been linked from the developer guide under Additional Resources for quite some time now, making it easily accessible to developers. However, there may be a need to further promote this resource to ensure its usefulness is fully appreciated. One suggestion is to include a direct link to the protocol for newbies on the developer guide page itself. This will make it more prominent and easier to find for those who are looking for guidance on the protocol. Overall, the protocol for newbies is a valuable tool for both new and experienced developers alike.</summary>
