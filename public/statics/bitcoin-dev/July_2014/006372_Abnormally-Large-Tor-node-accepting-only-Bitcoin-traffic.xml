    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell and Robert McKay discussed the Sybil attack and identity issues in the bitcoin protocol. Maxwell argued that the bitcoin protocol is identityless and relies on network capacity. McKay suggested that the behavior under discussion might not be considered abuse and could improve transaction and block propagation. However, Maxwell noted that it wasn't relaying transactions or blocks to anyone with a connection. In an unrelated message, s7r asked about the security risks of using bitcoin-qt on a laptop with Tor. He questioned what data a node would see if he used Tor to send or receive BTC and whether a spy node would provide any useful information.</summary>
