    <summary>Armory has announced Lockboxes, a multi-signature transaction interface. The interface allows for decentralised multi-sig, offline signing devices and private key management. The interface is compatible with existing Armory wallets and can be used for escrow and contracts. Simultaneous funding ("simulfunding") features are included. Armory Technologies is offering to match up to 20 BTC in donations to the EFF, FSF, College Crypto Network, Chamber of Digital Commerce, and the Bitcoin Foundation. The software has been tested for over three months, and the team has been using it for the management of company funds between officers for the last two months. Multi-Signature Lockboxes are available through a full-featured interface for creating multi-signature addresses, putting money into them, and collecting signatures to spend them. Additionally, "Simulfunding" for Addresses and Lockboxes is also available through the "Multi-Sig" menu. Several upgrades have also been made to improve stability, compatibility, functionality, and usability.</summary>
