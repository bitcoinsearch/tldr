    <summary>It is acknowledged that conversations can be archived, and are spread across forums, lists and IRC, making it hard to know the current state of the art thinking. The second prong of the argument is that beating ASICs would result in botnets. It is preferred to have a single pool dominate for a while, rather than having one with a major botnet presence, given their history of mining empty blocks and giving random people enormous electricity bills. It is believed that good headway can be made through optimization, without requiring an algorithmic silver bullet. Outsourcing mining can be accomplished by not having any hardware at all, CEX style, and preventing outsourcing using clever hacks seems ultimately doomed.</summary>
