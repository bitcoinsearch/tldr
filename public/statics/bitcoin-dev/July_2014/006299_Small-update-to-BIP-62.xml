    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has sent a pull request to make a small change to BIP 62. The anti-malleability proposal is still in draft form. Wuille's proposed change would make two of the seven new rules mandatory in new blocks, even for old-style transactions. These rules are already non-standard since version 0.8.0 and have no use cases according to Wuille.The reason for this change is to drop the requirement for signature verification engines to be bug-for-bug compatible with OpenSSL. OpenSSL supports many non-standard encodings for signatures, but requiring strict DER compliance for signatures means any implementation just needs to support DER. Wuille is seeking comments on the proposed change.</summary>
