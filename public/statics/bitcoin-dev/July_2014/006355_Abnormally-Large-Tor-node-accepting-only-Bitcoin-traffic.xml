    <summary>In a discussion between Peter Todd and gmaxwell on July 27th, 2014, they discussed the need for better incoming connection limiting. They referenced a scheme proposed by gmaxwell using interactive proof-of-memory, but Todd was unable to find any nodes with it connected to them. The last discussion on measures for anti-global-resource-consumption was held on Bitcointalk.org, but it did not seem to be a pressing issue that justified adding more protocol surface area.</summary>
