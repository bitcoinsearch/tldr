    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer in the Bitcoin community, suggested investigating the number of non-DER signatures that make it into blocks. However, in the last 11 blocks, which consisted of 4148 transactions, apparently none were non-DER signatures. This information suggests that the Bitcoin network is functioning as intended and that non-DER signatures are not a significant issue at present.</summary>
