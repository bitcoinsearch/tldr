    <summary>The conversation is about the security of breadwallet, an iOS application that allows users to make Bitcoin transactions. The discussion centers around the use of a PIN lock as a security measure. Aaron Voisine suggests delaying access to the wallet for increasing amounts of time after each failed PIN attempt, while Mike Hearn suggests recording the time of each failed attempt and not allowing further attempts until time has advanced past the previous attempt. The group also discusses the possibility of someone accessing the wallet seed through jailbreaking the phone or attaching a debugger to the process. The conversation ends with Aaron Voisine stating that using the block height instead of the timestamp is a more secure method for the delay, and that a pin-locked device is reasonably secure due to encryption. However, Gregory Maxwell questions the overall security of breadwallet.</summary>
