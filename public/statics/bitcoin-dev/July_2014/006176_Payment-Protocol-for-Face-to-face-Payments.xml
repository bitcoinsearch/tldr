    <summary>The email chain discusses the use of parameters in Bitcoin transactions, specifically the "r" parameter used for URLs. Andreas Schildbach suggests using "r=" for the first URL and appending additional URLs as "r1=", "r2=", etc., which would also define an ordering system. Michael Wozniak raises concerns about how clients should handle multiple parameters, as it is currently undefined. Alex Kotenko suggests implementing a priority and fallback method for different protocols, with p2p radio as the priority and web as the fallback. The issue of backwards compatibility is raised, and Kotenko proposes using an array parameter name for the "r" parameter to accommodate other protocols. There is discussion around whether or not to add a completely new parameter or modify the existing BIP72 standard. The conversation ends with links to a business process management suite built on Java and Eclipse.</summary>
