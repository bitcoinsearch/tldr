    <summary>In a Bitcoin Core software, a few basic rules were established for the DNS seeds. The purpose of codifying this was to add more DNS Seeds run by people who follow development closely and/or are aware of the issues involved. A DNSseed operating organization or person is expected to follow good host security practices and maintain control of their serving infrastructure and not sell or transfer control of their infrastructure. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are equally expected to uphold these expectations. Also, the DNSseed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network to the best of the operator's understanding and capability. For the avoidance of doubt, the results may be randomized but must not single-out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an urgent technical necessity and disclosed. If these expectations cannot be satisfied, the operator should discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin Core development team as well as posting on bitcoin-development.</summary>
