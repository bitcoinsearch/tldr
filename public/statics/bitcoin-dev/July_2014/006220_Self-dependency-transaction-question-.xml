    <summary>In the blockchain, all transactions are on a single timeline that is quantised into blocks. While it is a strict line, duplicated transactions can occur despite being hash-based. Satoshi assumed this would never happen, but duplicating coinbases is possible and was banned by a rule change. Older parts of the chain may still have this issue, so it is essential to be able to process them. A BIP exists to cover the new rule.</summary>
