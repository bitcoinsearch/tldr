    <summary>The author has created an ipython notebook utilizing a new floating fees algorithm to gather data and explore statistics. While the rules are not currently active, the author suggests that others may be interested in this or wish to expand on it. The ipython notebook can be found at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/haraldschilly/bitcoin-floating-fee-statistics/blob/master/estimatefee.ipynb and the source code is available at https://github.com/haraldschilly/bitcoin-floating-fee-statistics/. The most interesting graph attached to the message is a time series of estimated fees per confirmation level over the course of four hours, with vertical green lines indicating where new blocks were found.</summary>
