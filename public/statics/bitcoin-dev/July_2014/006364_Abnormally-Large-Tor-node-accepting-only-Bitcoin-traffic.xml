    <summary>The "exit" flag in Tor does not necessarily mean what one might expect. According to a user, without the exit flag, it's unlikely that a Tor node will select a particular node to exit traffic unless manually configured. The reason for this is because Tor speculatively builds circuits at startup on the assumption that they'll be used for web browsing; if a node doesn't exit web traffic, then it won't receive much traffic. At least until bitcoinj-based wallets begin shipping Tor mode, that is. However, despite this, there are legitimate reasons why someone would run such a node. For instance, running a Tor exit that only allows port 8333 is a way to contribute exit bandwidth without risking getting raided by authorities.</summary>
