    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, shared his thoughts in an email thread about incentivizing nodes to propagate transactions. He suggested that the majority of transaction data, excluding coinbase, has already been propagated and as such, nodes should be incentivized to propagate transactions. In response to this, Wladimir proposed starting the 'set synchronization process' as soon as the miner starts working on a certain block. This would prepare peers for the actual block broadcast, which would only consist of the header and coinbase transaction.</summary>
