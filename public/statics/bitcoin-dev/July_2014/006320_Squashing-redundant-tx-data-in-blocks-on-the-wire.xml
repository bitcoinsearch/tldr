    <summary>In an email conversation on July 18, 2014, Emin GÃ¼n Sirer and another individual discussed the importance of minimizing data transfer in the cryptocurrency mining process. The round complexity was identified as a key factor in this regard, with a single round trip time (RTT) being enough to send the entire block on many relevant paths. Yaron's non-interactive scheme, which involves sending a packet of O(expected-delta) for immediate delta calculation without further communication, was seen as particularly magical due to its lack of overhead. Although the other individual had been attempting to approximate this property with Forward Error Correction (FEC), they acknowledged that there was still some overhead involved. However, they also noted that computational soundness arguments could be made to ensure average performance. Sirer expressed no preference in the matter, stating that multithreading the client would likely be the best approach. Nonetheless, he acknowledged the potential applicability of Yaron's work and queued the paper for reading.</summary>
