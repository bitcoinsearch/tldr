    <title>Bitcoin Protocol Specification</title>

    <summary>Krzysztof Okupski has renamed the document "Bitcoin Developer Specification" to "Bitcoin Developer Reference". The document is an attempt to describe the Bitcoin protocol in English, but it is not a specification. Implementing the protocol based on the document would result in mistakes. The document lacks information about important areas like difficulty transitions and the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug. However, as a description of the protocol for beginners, it is an invaluable resource. Mike Hearn suggests linking to it from the developer guide. The only spec that matters is the C++ original. Okupski hopes that together they will be able to fill in the missing gaps in the description of Bitcoin.</summary>
