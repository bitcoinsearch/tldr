    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, there was a discussion about Unicode characters in passwords. Andreas Schildbach suggested that banning/filtering ISO control characters would solve the problem. However, Mike Hearn pointed out that Java might not support this kind of thing due to its use of 16-bit characters internally and recommended that any implementation wishing to be compatible with JVM-based wallets refuse any passphrase that includes characters outside the BMP. Aaron Voisine added that if JVMs really can't support Unicode NFC then that's a strong case to limit the spec to the subset of Unicode that all popular platforms can support. A free copy of Black Duck Code Sight was also advertised.</summary>
