    <summary>The blockchain can be 'gamed' in terms of time, as miners have previously manipulated the timestamp to increase their gigahashes. It is also possible for an application to be stuck in the past if given a truncated chain. Although using the blockchain as an approximate time source provides worldwide consensus without direct trust of any player, Bitcoin-level trusted time can currently be obtained by polling independent servers such as google.com, baidu.cn, and yandex.ru. Building time capsule applications that cannot be tricked into exposing their contents too early requires a tamper-resistant execution environment with the correct system time. However, trusted execution environments sometimes have tamper-resistant clocks, making it essential to consider configuration details.</summary>
