    <summary>The context discusses the insufficiency of payment protocol in certain scenarios such as on-going payment stream and deposit addresses. There is a disagreement regarding whether the payment protocol satisfies the requirements or not. The suggestion is to use a PaymentRequest with a zero valued pay-to-address output and an expiration time, base58 encoded, which would resemble the extended address form. Although it is not recommended to represent PaymentRequests using base58, it helps to understand the concept. Retrofitting protocols or APIs that require a piece of text could be done by accepting base58 encoded PaymentRequests, but it is fundamentally binary data.</summary>
