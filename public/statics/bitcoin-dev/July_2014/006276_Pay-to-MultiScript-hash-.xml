    <summary>In an email conversation on July 16, 2014, Jeremy proposed a solution to express multiple ways that would incur additional costs in terms of complicated control flows. He suggested using a normal P2SH output and a script with OP_IF and friends, which seems more straightforward when considering the costs. However, there is an implication in terms of increased utxo pool bloat and increased transaction complexity, where each 20-byte hash allows for a 500-byte script, and only one of the 500 byte scripts has to be permanently stored on the blockchain.Jeremy also mentioned that doing boolean logic with multisig groups is quite possible, such as "group AND group" or "group OR (group AND group)," which he called "multi-multisig" for lack of a better name. He discussed this with gmaxwell several months ago on IRC and considered it a valid use case.</summary>
