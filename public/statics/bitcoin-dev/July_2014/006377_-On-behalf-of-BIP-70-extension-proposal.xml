    <summary>On July 28, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed his priority with BIP70 to formalize the extensions process. He planned to write a proposal and hoped to get BitPay/Coinbase to put useful text in the memo field instead of random numbers. Although he was unsure about the process to follow, he could probably pick up writing the proposal. He questioned if the proposal should be formatted as a new BIP or part of BIP.70 and how the extensions process would describe it.</summary>
