    <summary>In July 2014, Jeff Garzik proposed the idea of limiting the lifetime of a Bitcoin address as requested at CoinSummit. While adding an optional expiration timestamp to addresses was possible, it would require a non-backward-compatible change that would affect a lot of software. Instead, Wladimir suggested promoting the use of the payment protocol and discouraging the use of addresses not just for this reason but also for other benefits. Payment request expiration was meant to address the issue of preventing bitcoins being sent to a pubkey/pkh after the key expires.</summary>
