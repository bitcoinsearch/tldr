    <summary>In a conversation thread, a person acknowledges that their idea was referred to in a previous email. They clarify that the referred email did not contain the proposal itself. The other person points out that there is another signature needed for payment delegation authentication, which would bring the total number of signatures in the proposal to three. The proposer agrees that a mandate type system may be simpler and easier to implement. Their next priority with BIP70 is to formalize the extensions process and work on improving the memo field.</summary>
