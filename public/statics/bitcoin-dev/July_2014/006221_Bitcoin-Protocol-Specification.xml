    <title>Bitcoin Protocol Specification</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of calling a document the "Bitcoin protocol spec". The argument is made that the document is not a proper specification as it is an attempt to describe the Bitcoin protocol in English, and anyone who implemented it based on this description would get it wrong. The lack of mention of important areas such as the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug and the unspecified difficulty transitions also contribute to the claim that it is not a proper specification. However, it is noted that the document can be a valuable resource for newbies as a loose description of the protocol. As a result of the feedback, Krzysztof Okupski put the spec under version control, which is available at https://github.com/minium/Bitcoin-Spec. The old link to the PDF will also be kept updated. The email thread ends with a promotion for Black Duck Code Sight, which allows indexing and searching up to 200,000 lines of code.</summary>
