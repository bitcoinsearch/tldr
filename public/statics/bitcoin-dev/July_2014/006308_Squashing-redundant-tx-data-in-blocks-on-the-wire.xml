    <summary>On Fri, Jul 18, 2014 at 3:51 PM, Kaz Wesley proposed an additional proposal that would tighten the new-block process. The proposal involved sparse blocks and Ultra-fast Block Validation (UFBV), which would incentivize ahead-of-block transaction propagation and make the new-block process more efficient for miners. The benefits of these changes only occur when transactions have been seen in advance, but working on a block without first ensuring peers have its transactions would be expensive from a miner's point of view. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, is also mentioned in the email as being involved with BitPay, Inc.</summary>
