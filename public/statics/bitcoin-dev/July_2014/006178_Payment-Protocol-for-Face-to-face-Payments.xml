    <summary>In a conversation from 2014, two individuals are discussing the implementation of Bluetooth and web address on r= and r1= respectively. One person mentions that they will submit a pull request to BIP72 for this implementation. However, they express uncertainty about the need for escaping in bitcoin URIs as it is not critical but still a part of RFC, and they do not think going against it is appropriate. The other individual agrees with the use of r1/r2 and suggests updating the spec to reflect that escaping is largely unnecessary in many cases.</summary>
