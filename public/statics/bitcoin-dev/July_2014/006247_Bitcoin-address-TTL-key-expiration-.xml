    <summary>In a discussion between Bitcoin developers Luke Dashjr and Jeff Garzik, the topic of transactions using the same Bitcoin address more than once was brought up. Dashjr pointed out that wallets and services can already ignore transactions using an address more than once, but there may be issues with race attacks if this is implemented immediately. However, Garzik argued that few users would appreciate their deposits being ignored as a feature. Additionally, he noted that payment protocol doesn't address certain use cases such as an on-going payment stream from one entity to another or deposit situations. Garzik is a core developer for Bitcoin and an open source evangelist who works at BitPay.</summary>
