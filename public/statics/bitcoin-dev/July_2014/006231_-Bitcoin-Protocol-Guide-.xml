    <summary>In this email thread, Mike Hearn responds to Krzysztof Okupski's attempt to describe the Bitcoin protocol in English and cautions against calling it the "Bitcoin protocol spec" as it is not a formal specification. He notes that implementing the protocol based on the description would result in errors and important areas such as the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug and difficulty transitions are left unspecified. However, he acknowledges its value as a resource for newbies and suggests linking it from the developer guide. In response to Ron's question about which C++ original version is the only spec that matters, no further information is provided.</summary>
