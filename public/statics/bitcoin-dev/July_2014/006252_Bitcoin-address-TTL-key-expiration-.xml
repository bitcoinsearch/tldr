    <summary>The use of BIP 70 for payment relationships has been a known issue since its inception due to its low-level functioning. BIP 70 is designed for singular payments with specific outputs and values, which does not fit the use cases described for longer-term payment relationships such as subscriptions. The focus should be on exchanging HD wallet payment details rather than sending or receiving outputs. A hack that makes zero-valued outputs behave differently would not change the granularity at which BIP 70 operates. Jeff Garzik suggests retrofitting protocols or APIs that require text input by accepting base58 encoded PaymentRequests, though it is fundamentally binary data. Ultimately, smarter contract language is needed to include HD wallet payment details.</summary>
