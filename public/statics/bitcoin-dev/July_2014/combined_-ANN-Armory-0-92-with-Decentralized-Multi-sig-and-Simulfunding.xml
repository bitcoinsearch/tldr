    <summary>Armory Technologies has launched Lockboxes, a multi-signature transaction interface that allows for decentralised multi-sig, offline signing devices and private key management. It is compatible with existing Armory wallets and can be used for escrow and contracts. Simultaneous funding ("simulfunding") features are included. The software has been tested for over three months, and the team has been using it for the management of company funds between officers for the last two months. Multi-Signature Lockboxes are available through a full-featured interface for creating multi-signature addresses, putting money into them, and collecting signatures to spend them. Additionally, "Simulfunding" for Addresses and Lockboxes is also available through the "Multi-Sig" menu.The company is also offering to match up to 20 BTC in donations to the EFF, FSF, College Crypto Network, Chamber of Digital Commerce, and the Bitcoin Foundation. Several upgrades have also been made to improve stability, compatibility, functionality, and usability. Meanwhile, Alan Reiner, a software developer, expressed his hope to provide an optional service to synchronise data between parties. However, before creating oneâ€™s own service, it would be better to add Bitmessage integration to provide the P2P communication layer. The author suggests that Bitmessage should be more trusted in the long term because the service created by an individual would not be their primary product or core competency. The message concludes with a call to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and a link to learn how to do so.</summary>
