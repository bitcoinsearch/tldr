    <summary>In an email conversation between Krzysztof Okupski and Jeff Garzik on July 14th, 2014, they discuss the document titled "Bitcoin Developer Specification." Okupski had recently renamed it and suggested "Bitcoin Developer Reference" as an alternative. Garzik praises the document and agrees that the term "specification" may not be the best choice. He identifies himself as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
