    <summary>In an email thread on July 15, 2014, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr suggested that deposits can use unique payment requests or addresses every time. However, fellow developer Jeff Garzik pointed out that payments can still occur even when wallets or computers are offline. He suggested that if HD wallet details have been negotiated, a new address can be used each time. Garzik is also an open-source evangelist and works for BitPay, Inc., a company in the cryptocurrency space.</summary>
