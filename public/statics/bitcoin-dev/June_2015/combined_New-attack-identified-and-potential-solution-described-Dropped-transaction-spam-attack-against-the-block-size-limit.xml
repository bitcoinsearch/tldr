    <summary>Bob McElrath discusses Hashcash, a technology used to tackle spam. He suggests that smaller blocks should be mined down to the level of individual transactions instead of relaying unmined transactions. Peter Todd responds by explaining that Bitcoin can be considered a system that maintains a ledger for transferrable hashcash, with transaction fees paid in hashcash. The implementation of block size limits was intended to prevent large blocks from being used as an attack, but it opened up another issue: spamming the network. A proposed solution is to add a new rule on how fees are handled, where some amount of every fee should be burned and cannot be spent. Patrick Mccorry notes that with the 0.01mBTC/KB minimum relay fee and $230 USD/BTC, it works out to about $2.3kUSD/GB of RAM. Mike Hearn reduces the minimum relay fee to 0.01mBTC/KB, making the fee $23/MB (assuming 1,000 tx * 2.3 cents) and $23k/GB (assuming $23 * 1000, as each $23 is 1mb). This highlights the increased expense involved in Bitcoin transactions. In a discussion thread, Raystonn raises concerns about the absence of a memory pool cap in Bitcoin Core. However, Peter Todd explains that existing mempool implementation does not remove transactions, and transactions can only be removed through mining, double-spending, or node restarting. While the solution is to cap the size of the mempool, it breaks zeroconf security, which can prevent reasonable fee transactions from propagating. Fixing this issue is therefore necessary. The topic of a potential attack on Bitcoin is explored, with an explanation that flooding all blocks with spam transactions would be expensive but potentially destructive if well-funded entities desired to do so. Spam transactions would enrich miners at the cost of spammers, which is considered anti-fragile. However, there will always be a block size limit due to technological considerations and network bandwidth limitations. An attacker flooding the network with transactions can raise costs but cannot harm security, as it would be cheaper to just 51% attack the network in such cases. This point is reached when transaction fees are 25mBTC/KB, based on the current block subsidy of 25BTC/MB.</summary>
