    <summary>The email chain is discussing a Bitcoin block size debate and the creation of a Git repository to avoid exclusive-by-default wiki policies. Pindar Wong shares a Github link that is reachable via VPN, but Gabe Appleton requests they use the original fork from Ethan Heilman to avoid confusion. Mats Henricson expresses frustration with the repetitive nature of the debate and encourages posters to read up on previous discussions and suggest alternatives. The group discusses creating a wiki page for the debate to condense information and receive public comments. They plan to throw the discussion on Reddit and receive feedback, with leads already given by the community.</summary>
