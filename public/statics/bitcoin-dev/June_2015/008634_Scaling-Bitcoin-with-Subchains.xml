    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Martin discussed the assumption that different people's wallets will be uniformly distributed over several sidechains to hold their transactions. As a result, an average transaction would require a cross-chain transfer to get the money to the recipient since their wallet is usually associated with a chain different from the sender's. Martin suggested that incentives should be set to invalidate this assumption. If fees and security guarantees on the main chain are highest, and fees drop with distance from the main chain on each level of side chains, then communities with many internal transactions would create their own side chain with low fees. Martin expects geographic as well as virtual communities to form and enjoy cheap fees on their 'local' chains and expensive but comparably rare 'long-distance' fees. A typical user would maintain a wallet in each of her communities which are loaded and drained with rare expensive transactions, whereas daily business with many transactions is done cheaply within each community chain. Thus, Martin argues that side chains equipped with the right cost incentives for cross-chain transactions would lead to a scalable and efficiently self-organizing network of side chains.</summary>
