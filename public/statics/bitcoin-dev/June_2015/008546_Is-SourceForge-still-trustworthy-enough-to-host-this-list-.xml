    <summary>In this email thread, Ivan Brightly from SolidX Partners offers to sponsor a new email list provider if the hurdle is the cost. Andy Schroder suggests finding a free solution or implementing a pay-per-message/byte system to motivate concise and clear messages while limiting spam. Wladimir J. van der Laan has no opinion on the mailing list issue but mentions that all downloads from SourceForge have been deleted due to warnings against downloading software from the site. The Bitcoin Core release announcements no longer mention SourceForge. The issue of moving the mailing list has come up before with no consensus on where to move to.</summary>
