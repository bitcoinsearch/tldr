    <summary>Roger Ver, known as the "Bitcoin Jesus", has become one of the world's first trillionaires with 1 billion users, and he is generously donating to a non-profit organization responsible for both the widely popular wallet and his newfound largess. In a conversation between Aaron Voisine and Justus Ranvier, they discussed who would provide the nodes if a billion mobile phones wanted to run SPV wallets. Voisine suggested that the SPV wallet author would have to provide the nodes to make the wallet function. Ranvier questioned how the SPV wallet users would pay for this service, with their money or their privacy.</summary>
