    <summary>In an email conversation, Michael Naber asked about global network consensus and whether off-chain solutions could provide it. The response explained that hub-and-spoke payment channels and the Lightning network were not off-chain solutions but rather ways to use on-chain transactions more efficiently. Off-chain systems such as Changetip enable economic transactions without any blockchain transactions. It was mentioned that Bitcoin Core scales with O(N), and scaling to O(n) would require a trust-based system, which is not a global consensus system. It was suggested that building a trust-based system on top of Bitcoin's global consensus functionality would be a better approach.</summary>
