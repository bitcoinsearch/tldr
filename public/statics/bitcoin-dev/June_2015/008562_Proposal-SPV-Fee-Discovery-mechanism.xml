    <summary>The conversation on June 10, 2015, between Nathan Wilcox and Aaron Voisine discussed a possible solution to enforce the data format by encoding it in an op_return output in the coinbase transaction and later be enforced with a soft fork. However, Nathan raised concerns regarding the SPV protocol's inclusion of this coinbase txn since it may not be reliable until the softfork is activated, as results can be fabricated by individual miners. Peter Todd further added that fee stats can always be fabricated by individual miners because fees can be paid out-of-band.</summary>
