    <summary>In an email conversation between Tom Harding and Kalle Rosenbaum on June 6, 2015, they discussed suggestions for changes related to the "Proof of Potential" (PoP) in Bitcoin transactions. Tom suggested that real outputs should not be included as they are redundant since the transaction ID is already referenced. He also recommended starting the proof script with a magic constant to make PoPs easy to identify and extend. However, Kalle removed the constant and added a two-byte version field instead to make it more extendable. Kalle thanked Tom for his suggestions and noted the term "Proof of Potential."</summary>
