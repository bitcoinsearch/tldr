    <summary>Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist Jeff Garzik argues that the current "do nothing" approach to block size issue within Bitcoin is untenable. He believes that there is a need to plan ahead and set a hard fork date in the future, to prevent significant negative impact on users when blocks are consistently full. Failing to do so will result in most businesses assuming that the relevant Bitcoin Core standards process is failing, and proceeding with the Bitcoin-XT fork. Garzik stresses the importance of getting out in front of the need to avoid an immediate fork for which the network and markets are not prepared.</summary>
