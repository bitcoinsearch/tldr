    <summary>The author expresses frustration with a debate and wishes that all posters could follow two simple principles. The first principle is to read up on all of what has been written before posting, as rehashing what others have said wastes time. The second principle is to be helpful by suggesting alternatives rather than just criticizing. The author believes that criticism without offering solutions is destructive and suggests that those who do not want change should state so.</summary>
