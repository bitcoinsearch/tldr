    <summary>The discussion revolves around simplifying the implementation of Proof of Payment (PoP) which is currently being used to sign and validate transactions. The idea of making PoPs invalid as transactions is being debated, with different ways being suggested for doing so. There is a concern that asking people to sign something that is not an actual transaction, but could be used as one, is risky. However, some argue that it's just a matter of trusting your wallet, which is already done with ordinary transactions. Regarding the naming of PoP, there are different suggestions with varying levels of clarity. While "Proof of Payment" makes one think it proves payment, it actually proves the ability to create a particular transaction and commit to it. On the other hand, "Proof of Transaction Intent" does not help understand what it is about. Despite this, it's okay to call it Proof of Payment even if people may use it for other purposes.</summary>
