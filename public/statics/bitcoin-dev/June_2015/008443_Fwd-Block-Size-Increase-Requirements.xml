    <summary>In this email thread among members of the Bitcoin development community, the discussion centers around block size increase requirements and the potential impact on miners, particularly those in China. One user suggests that if the Chinese miners collaborate and start firing out small coinbase only blocks, they can build a longer chain for themselves without having to receive 20mb blocks from other nodes. This would give them all the coinbase they stamped, while invalidating previous transactions by other nodes. Another user argues that miners outside of China should not be dis-incentivized, but if they cannot get the required bandwidth through their firewall, then too bad, they'll have to carry on without them. The conversation also includes a clarification from one user who explains that his previous post was intended as sarcasm and not meant to exclude any particular participants.</summary>
