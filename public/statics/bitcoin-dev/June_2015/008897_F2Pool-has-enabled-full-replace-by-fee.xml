    <summary>In this message, Jeff Garzik asks whether nodes could see conflicting transactions on the network as part of a micropayment channel and not know it was observing the resolution of a channel rather than a likely retail double spend. He argues that if both transactions have been broadcast, then one of the conflicting members of the set will have nSequence adjustments. It is unlikely that a clever griefer could make their retail double spend look like a micropayment channel, as they would be missing the other identifiable markers of that protocol.</summary>
