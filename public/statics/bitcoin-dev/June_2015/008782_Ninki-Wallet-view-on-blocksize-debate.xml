    <summary>Ben, the developer for Ninki Wallet, expresses his support for the bitcoin core dev team and their attitude towards consensus and a clear process for change and discussion of changes. He believes that the block size limit will have to be increased in the future, but not without an established consensus on how bitcoin will scale with decentralization and maintain its key value property. Ben does not support any group that attempts to fork the blockchain in the manner proposed using XT and strongly urges Gavin to withdraw from this standoff and work with the bitcoin core devs via the existing and successful bip process. Ninki Wallet has recently been listed on bitcoin.org.</summary>
