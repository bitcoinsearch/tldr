    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been experiencing issues with its archive, specifically with the "mbox" format. The archives are missing necessary headers for easy use by users' MUA's in their local environment. Additionally, attachments that are necessary to the context and archives of all lists are not included, resulting in wasted time attempting to post-process them into usable form. Furthermore, there appear to be at least 15 instances of unescaped '^From ' in the "mbox." A user requested that the full raw archives be provided in regularly updated [gzip/7z] mbox format to fix these issues. In regards to the message footers and subject prefix, they are considered corruptive and space-wasting clutter that should be turned off. Lastly, gmane was able to change the subscription of the previous list to the current list, and while there is a gap in their archive at the beginning and last week of the archive, they have requested a link to a single mbox file archive that can be used to restore the list archive in its entirety.</summary>
