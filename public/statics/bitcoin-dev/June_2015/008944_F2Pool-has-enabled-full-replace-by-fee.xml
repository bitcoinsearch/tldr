    <summary>The discussion among Bitcoin developers regarding the need for non-repudiation as a feature of the protocol resurfaced in 2015. Eric Lombrozo argued that non-repudiation was not necessary since there is no association of identity with signatures in the Bitcoin protocol. He further suggested that attaching any further significance to transaction signatures would be unwise, as conflicting transactions can be legitimate and determination of intent may not always be clear. Jorge Tim√≥n disagreed, saying that non-repudiation could be built on top of the payment protocol layer, while Justus Ranvier argued that non-repudiation is an intrinsic property of ECDSA signatures used in Bitcoin.</summary>
