    <summary>The context of this conversation revolves around the voting system for miners on whether or not to change the limit of transactions in Bitcoin. Matt Whitlock suggests using two bits instead of a single bit, with "no preference" being 0 0, "remain the same" being 0 1, "halve" being 1 0, and "double" being 1 1. User transactions would follow the same pattern. Peter Todd agrees with this encoding system, stating that taking the median of the options and discarding "don't care" votes makes sense. However, Matt brings up the issue of plurality versus median, arguing that median ensures that voting "no change" is meaningful. After some discussion, it is agreed that plurality could lead to halving winning despite being supported by a minority, so median should be used instead. The email ends with J. Aaron Gustafson's signature and contact information.</summary>
