    <summary>In an email exchange on June 15, 2015, Mike Hearn and Pieter Wuille discussed the use of centralized services versus decentralized approaches in the block size debate. Hearn argued that using a centralized service is easier but introduces systemic risk and disregards long-term implications. Wuille agreed with Hearn but also noted that if a decentralized approach doesn't add anything, it cannot be reasonably promoted. This led to Wuille's opposition to getutxos in the P2P protocol. The discussion highlights the ongoing debate within the Bitcoin community about the best way to handle transactions and scalability.</summary>
