    <summary>In an email conversation on June 25, 2015, Milly Bitcoin defined 'cultish' as making claims without supporting facts. Another email from Milly Bitcoin stated that the consensus on code changes among developers is almost never 100%, and someone has to make the decision about what is an acceptable consensus. This statement was challenged by someone who claimed that the consensus on code changes is almost always 100%. They provided examples of changes made to bitcoin core's code with no opposition which can be found on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master. The challenger asked for examples of changes made with opposition and questioned whether it is better to let a decider decide instead of addressing all concerns.</summary>
