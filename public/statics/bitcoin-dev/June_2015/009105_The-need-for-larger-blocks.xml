    <summary>In the context given, Venzen, a cryptocurrency expert, explains that the market for block space is different from the market for bitcoin. He also discusses the centralization risk associated with the market for block space which arises due to the resources required to run a full node. He mentions that this consideration determines the actual capacity of the system instead of just the declared capacity. Venzen further points out that the 1MB cap was not indexed with the increasing availability of resources and suggests that estimating the change in resource availability since the implementation of the cap could help determine the size of any initial hard cap increase. It is important to note that such an increase would require careful consideration to avoid any negative impact on the blockchain network.</summary>
