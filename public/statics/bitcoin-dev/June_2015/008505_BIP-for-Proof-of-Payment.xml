    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Luke Dashjr were discussing the use of OP_RETURN in Bitcoin transactions. Luke Dashjr suggested that it should not be so cleanly compatible with Bitcoin transactions and proposed using an invalid opcode instead. However, Pieter Wuille argued that this would only send funds into the void without invalidating the transaction. Instead, he suggested setting nLockTime to 500000000-1 and nSequence appropriately to make the transaction impossible to mine for the next 9500 years. Despite these suggestions, Pieter Wuille expressed his doubts about the idea. The conversation ended with a digital signature attachment from 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</summary>
