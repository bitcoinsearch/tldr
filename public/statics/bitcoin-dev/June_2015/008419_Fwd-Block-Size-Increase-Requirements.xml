    <summary>In an email exchange, Chun Wang expressed their opposition to Gavin Andresen's proposal for a 20MB block size increase. They argued that such an increase could lead to an unacceptable orphan rate. Instead, they suggested a limit of 5MB, 8MB, or 10MB. Andresen responded by asking for feedback from others and suggesting that a compromise of starting at 8 or 4MB could be reached. He defended his initial proposal, saying all of his testing showed it to be safe and the costs reasonable. He expressed uncertainty about when BIP66 would meet its 95% goal.</summary>
