    <summary>The issue of corrupted archives, specifically "mbox" archives, is discussed in this email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The problem lies in mailman's handling of email addresses in messages, leading to corruption and loss of important data such as attachments and headers. Various members of the list suggest solutions, including disabling the "obscure_addresses" option and demanding pristine historical sources for mirrors. There are also calls to turn off message footers and subject prefixes. Overall, there is agreement that current mbox archives are broken and useless, and a need for full raw archives in regularly updated gzip or 7z mbox format.</summary>
