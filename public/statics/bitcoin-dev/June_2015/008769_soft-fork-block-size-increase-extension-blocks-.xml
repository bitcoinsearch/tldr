    <summary>In an email thread from June 1, 2015, Adam Back suggests waiting and seeing while reducing spam and working on improving decentralization metrics. He also proposes doing a blocksize increment to "kick the can" if necessary while trying to do something more long-term about scale. In response, Tom Harding questions the lead time required to kick the can and shares a graph that plots every single block by retarget interval, showing a distribution of block sizes. Richard Moore, founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc., is listed as a contact at the bottom of the email.</summary>
