    <summary>During a discussion on miner economics, Vincent Truong suggested that miners with an agenda could create their own transactions without fees to achieve it. Luke proposed a solution to allow miners to have their block counted as votes for a particular outcome, as long as they do not include any transactions against it. This would enable miners to forego the fees of opposing transactions without having to increase block size.</summary>
