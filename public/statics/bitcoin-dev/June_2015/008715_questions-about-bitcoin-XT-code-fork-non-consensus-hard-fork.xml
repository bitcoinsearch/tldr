    <summary>In an email conversation, Eric Lombrozo expressed his disagreement with the idea that everyone is okay with what Mike and Gavin are doing in terms of lifting the limit. He disagrees with the means being used by them to lift the limit. Although most news publications keep the discussion rather shallow and like to keep the controversy pretty black and white, some people have far more nuanced views. Lombrozo believes that the limit needs to be lifted eventually but not by following the current method.</summary>
