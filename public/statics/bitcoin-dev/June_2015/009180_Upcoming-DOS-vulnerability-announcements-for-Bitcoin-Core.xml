    <summary>On June 27th, 2015, Gregory Maxwell recommended that anyone running production nodes exposed to inbound connections from the internet upgrade to version 0.10.2 of the software as soon as possible. However, someone asked if anyone knew when/if version 0.10.2 would be available on the Ubuntu PPA (Personal Package Archive), as they preferred the convenience of using a PPA rather than installing manually.</summary>
