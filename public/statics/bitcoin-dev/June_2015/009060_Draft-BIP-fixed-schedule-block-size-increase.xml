    <summary>In an email sent by Gavin Andresen, he thanked someone for their consideration and working within the established BIP process. The email was in response to a news article about Chinese mining pools calling for consensus and refusing to switch to Bitcoin XT. Gavin mentioned that the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) has been assigned number 101 by the BIP editor and that he plans on filling in the TODOs and submitting it as a pull request to the BIP repository. The title of the BIP is "Increase Maximum Block Size". The email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
