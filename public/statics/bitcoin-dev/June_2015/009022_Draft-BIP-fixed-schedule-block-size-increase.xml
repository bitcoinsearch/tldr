    <summary>The conversation revolves around the idea of replacing most of Testnet with a specialized test chain. It's suggested that this would not be a good idea, but it might be a good time to consider a fourth test network with large blocks from genesis onwards. However, two years of 8mb blocks is deemed excessive for testing purposes. The question is raised whether there's any specific reason for two years as opposed to six months. Peter Todd emphasizes the importance of realistic testing of what an 8MB limit could look like in the near future. Load testing is also important as part of that testing. He proposes using August 1st, 2013, as the switchover date for testnet to allow for the creation of a realistic full-load blockchain on testnet. This is inconvenient as it would require 2 years of 8MB blocks which equates to 840GB worth of data, but it's necessary to fully test the real-world behavior of the entire infrastructure ecosystem. Todd believes that with a $3.5 billion market cap at stake, resources can be scraped together to voluntarily run a few hundred full-load full-nodes for testing a change with the potential to destroy that market cap.</summary>
