    <summary>In the world of open source projects, voting takes a different form. Developers make changes and users accept or reject them by choosing to use different developers or software. This is known as the standard open source method. However, it should be noted that not all open source projects require 100% user adoption for compatibility with other users. This sets it apart from most open source projects. Simply repeating "stock" answers does not advance the discussion.</summary>
