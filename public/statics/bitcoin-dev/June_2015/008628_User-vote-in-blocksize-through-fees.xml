    <summary>In an email dated June 14, 2015, Chun Wang claimed that the reason why core developers were not in favor of BIP100 was due to the fact that most miners were located outside of the West. He also criticized developer Mike Hearn and called for the implementation of BIP100. In response, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik pointed out that BIP100 required a hard fork and user opt-in, clarifying some of the technical aspects of the proposal. Garzik is an open source evangelist and works for BitPay, Inc.</summary>
