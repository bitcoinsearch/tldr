    <summary>The discussion is regarding the possibility of encoding fee statistics in the coinbase transaction to help SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients. Aaron Voisine suggests that it could be done by agreeing on a data format and encoding it in an op_return output in the coinbase transaction. Nathan Wilcox raises a concern about miners moving fees outside of explicit inband fees and the usefulness of the proposal limited to the information of in-band fees. Peter Todd points out that fee stats can always be fabricated by individual miners because fees can be paid out-of-band. The tradeoff between the size of transactions and altering consensus rules for Header-PoW-verifying client is also discussed.</summary>
