    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a former lead developer of Bitcoin, has sent an email to F2Pool expressing his disappointment over claims that the mining pool will run the replace-by-fee patch. He strongly encourages F2Pool to wait until most wallet software supports replace-by-fee before implementing it, as it makes it easier to steal from bitcoin-accepting merchants. Andresen also advises waiting until most merchants support bigger blocks before creating blocks larger than 1MB. He believes that if everyone thinks about what is good for the whole system, including users, merchants, exchanges, and miners, Bitcoin will succeed more quickly.</summary>
