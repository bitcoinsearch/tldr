    <summary>The email conversation is about a potential Dropped-transaction spam attack against the block size limit in Bitcoin. The discussion primarily revolves around mitigating this attack. One of the proposed solutions is to limit the memory pool to some reasonable number of blocks-worth of transactions and prefer evicting transactions that are part of long chains of unconfirmed transactions. Blocks can grow in size during times of high transaction demand, allowing miners to absorb fees thrown at them by attackers. Another proposed solution involves adding a new rule on how fees are handled. Raystonn proposes that some amount of every fee should be considered as burned and never be spent. He suggests 50% of the fee be burned, but there may be better numbers. Loi Luu proposes another practical rule where 50% of the transaction fee is credited to the next block instead of burning it. This would prevent an attacker from performing the attack with 0-fee but avoid doubling the price of the TX fee for the fix.Raystonn argues for the removal of the block size limit since it enables the dropped-transaction spam-attack problem. Large blocks created by miners to spam other miners out of competition is a problem because miners do not pay fees for their transactions. They collect the fees they pay, which breaks the economic barrier keeping people from spamming the network since the spamming is essentially free. His proposed solution is to add a new rule on how fees are handled, where half of every fee would be burned and disappear forever, while the other half would be collected by the miner of the block. For this to work, a minimum fee must be paid for most of the transactions in every block, and the new transaction fee rule must be in place. Then, the block size limit can be removed.</summary>
