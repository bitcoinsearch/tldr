    <summary>Jameson Lopp, a software engineer at BitGo, announced the support of individual accounts on Statoshi.info. Devs can now create, save and share their own dashboards by following the instructions provided in the Medium post. Statoshi is an application that provides insight into the operations of Bitcoin Core nodes. If you are unfamiliar with Statoshi, two posts are linked to provide more information. Lopp's goal with Statoshi is to give information about the metrics or instrumentation of Bitcoin Core nodes. The developer invites anyone who thinks there should be additional metrics or instrumentation added to Statoshi to submit a pull request or issue on GitHub.</summary>
