    <summary>In an email conversation on June 30th, 2015 between Adam Back and David Harding, Back asked for a way to support opt-in full-RBF. Harding suggested bundling it with BIP62 version-2 transactions, which are already specified to be opt-in. However, he also pointed out that while BIP62 transactions prevent third-party mutation, they do not prevent all mutation, including double spending. Therefore, signers can still mutate their own transactions even with BIP62 transactions. Harding noted that the downside of this approach could be a further delay of full BIP62 implementation. Still, he acknowledged that developers who want RBF may help push BIP62 into production.</summary>
