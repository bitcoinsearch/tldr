    <summary>In an email conversation regarding a proposed change, Gavin Andresen asks for clarification on what kind of resources are needed by miners for profitability in the case of other miners sabotaging it. The response likens the situation to that of a suspension bridge with limited traffic capacity and tolls increasing as demand rises. The proposed change is to expand the bridge by adding fifteen more lanes and doubling them every two years with no clear termination plan. However, this proposal requires careful analysis of the carrying capacity of the bridge, threats it faces (such as earthquakes), strength of cables, weight of traffic, and peer-reviewed data. The worst-case scenario if nothing changes is simply supply and demand toll system adjustment, which may lead to some usage reduction but ultimately traffic would still flow. Civil engineering has taught us not to give in to political pressure until consequences are well understood.</summary>
