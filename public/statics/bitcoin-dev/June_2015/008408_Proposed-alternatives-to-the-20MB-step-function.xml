    <summary>The discussion of the block size limit has led to the conclusion that any constant block size limit is not a long-term solution. The dynamic lower limit, which is based on past blocks, does not account for usage spikes. Therefore, another dynamic lower limit scheme is proposed. This new scheme suggests that the block size limit should be a function of the number of current transactions in the mempool. The idea is that bitcoin usage regulates the block size limit. Although the author does not have knowledge of the code base or time to make simulations, they propose this approach for discussion and to encourage other ideas.</summary>
