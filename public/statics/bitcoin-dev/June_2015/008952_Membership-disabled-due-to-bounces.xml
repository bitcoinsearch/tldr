    <summary>Braun Brelin reported that his membership in a mailing list was disabled due to excessive bounces. He claimed to have only sent out one email on the list, excluding the current one, and asked if anyone else had seen similar issues. Braun also questioned whether the problem could be related to SourceForge's mail list hosting issue. The message was posted on a public forum for discussion purposes.</summary>
