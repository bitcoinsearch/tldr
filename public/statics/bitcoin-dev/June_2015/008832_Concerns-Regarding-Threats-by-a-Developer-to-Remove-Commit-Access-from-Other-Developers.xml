    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin developer, has stated that larger blocks aren't the solution to scalability issues in the network. Rather, architectural and algorithmic improvements are needed so as to move to a model where not everyone needs to validate everyone else's transactions. He believes that larger blocks might only be a temporary fix for keeping the current system running smoothly and that a fee market will eventually need to be created to address block size issues. However, this will require real market pressures for it to happen. He also states that maintenance of source code repositories is not the issue surrounding XT, but rather the forking of a cryptoledger. Open source repositories are meant to be forked; however, there are currently no mechanisms in place to support merging of forked cryptoledgers. Once a fork is made, then that becomes an altcoin. He suggests that Bitcoin should have similar workflow with consensus rule evolution as most other open source projects. Chris Pacia, another developer, expresses concern that solutions such as Lightning Network may end up being worse for decentralization than a Bitcoin network using larger blocks. He suggests allowing people to voluntarily opt in to these solutions after experimenting with them to see how they function in practice, rather than forcing everyone in the ecosystem to collectively spend millions of dollars upgrading to Lightning without knowing whether it will actually improve decentralization.</summary>
