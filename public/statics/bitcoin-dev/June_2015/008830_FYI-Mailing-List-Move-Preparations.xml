    <title>FYI - Mailing List Move Preparations</title>

    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is undergoing a transition period to a new list server. During this time, posts to the old list may be delayed for 5+ minutes due to greylisting. The decision has been made to not link the old and new lists during the transition period, but instead to announce the switchover date (Tuesday, June 23rd) and reject all posts to the old list after that point. Archives will be exported/imported into the new list server before it is opened. Those interested in subscribing to the new list can do so now and are encouraged to make test posts. Any posts to the new list prior to the final switchover will be wiped from the archives. Opinions on the transition can be shared in Freenode #bitcoin-dev with Warren Togami.</summary>
