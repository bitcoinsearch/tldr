    <summary>Peter Todd suggested a modification to Jeff Garzik's proposal to increase or decrease the upper block size limit using miner votes. Todd proposed that user transactions should also be able to vote on the issue using two bits: 00 for no preference, 01 for maintaining the current limit, 10 for halving the limit and 11 for doubling the limit. Wildcard votes could be included in any block, but blocks with wildcard votes would only contain transactions with wildcard votes. This system would provide miners with a financial incentive to represent the wishes of users through fees. Peter Todd also referred to John Dillon's proposal for proof-of-stake blocksize voting.</summary>
