    <summary>In an email dated June 10, 2015, Andy Schroder listed a few motivations for switching mailing lists. Firstly, the current mailing list sometimes delays delivery for several days. Secondly, there are usually lots of ads at the footer of messages which detract from the content and confuse new readers. Thirdly, HTML messages are not allowed on a technical mailing list. Lastly, digital signatures are often broken because the list server modifies them. Peter Todd responded to this email by asking for more information on the type of digital signatures affected and the email client being used.</summary>
