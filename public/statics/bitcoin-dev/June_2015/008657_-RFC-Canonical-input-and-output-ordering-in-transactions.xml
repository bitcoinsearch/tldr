    <summary>In an email exchange on June 8, 2015, Danny Thorpe recommended that while sorting inputs and outputs as a best practice in transactions is better than random, it should not be included in IsStandard() or consensus rules. He noted that there are situations where the order of inputs and outputs is significant. The author of the email then queried whether this recommendation was acceptable if it resulted in easy distinguishability of usage, higher transaction fees, or software breaking due to incorrect expectations of transaction orders.</summary>
