    <summary>Breadwallet, a popular bitcoin wallet, plans to create its own full nodes to reduce the load on volunteer networks as its user base grows. The company also plans to contribute any Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) serving performance optimizations it makes to bitcoin-core. One concern raised by users is that SPV wallets may be charged for connecting to the network, which could discourage decentralized participation and incentivize the use of centralized wallets. Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine acknowledges these concerns and hopes that running its own full nodes will mitigate any negative impact on the network.</summary>
