    <summary>The consensus-based system can cause difficulties in implementing changes, but it is an integral aspect of decentralized and distributed systems. Those who do not like this system may find that it is not the right space for them. However, if consensus must be reached to make significant changes, then those changes cannot be made easily. A strong bias towards the status quo may only work if external factors affecting the network also remain static. This was stated by Aaron Voisine, the co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com.</summary>
