    <summary>In this email conversation from June 27, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan expresses his hostility towards the idea of hardforks after recent stressful conditions. He warns that expecting a few developers to make controversial decisions is not only breaking expectations but also making life dangerous for those developers. Wladimir suggests that hardforks must be possible, providing that they are uncontroversial and give enough time for users and alternative software to upgrade. In doing so, he hopes to prove that nobody wants hardforks to be impossible. However, he acknowledges that politically loaded changes should be avoided. The conversation ends with Wladimir's signature and a link to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
