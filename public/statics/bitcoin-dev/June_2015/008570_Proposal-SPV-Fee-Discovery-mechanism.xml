    <summary>The proposal discussed assumes that Bitcoin transactions are being cleared normally and fees only change slowly. The author acknowledges that the proposal would not function correctly with full blocks, as Bitcoin cannot work at all in such a state. It is important to know the network congestion in order to avoid dropped transactions, but even then, one must hope that someone who wants the space more than they do doesn't show up after they disconnect.</summary>
