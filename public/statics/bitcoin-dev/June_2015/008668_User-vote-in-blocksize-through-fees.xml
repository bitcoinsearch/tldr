    <summary>In a discussion between Eric Lombrozo and Jeff Garzik regarding the block size limit controversy, Lombrozo expressed his frustration with the fact that it took six years to figure out a mechanism to enable hard forks and only now has the issue of increasing the block size limit become urgent. He also pointed out that the controversy is merely a symptom of a larger problem. Garzik proposed a mechanism for determining the proper block size limit, which Lombrozo agreed was better than having high priests make decisions without proper consensus. The main concern with the proposed solution was its potential economic consequences and corruptibility. There is a consensus that the block size limit needs to be increased, but the question remains as to what the limit should be and by what factor.</summary>
