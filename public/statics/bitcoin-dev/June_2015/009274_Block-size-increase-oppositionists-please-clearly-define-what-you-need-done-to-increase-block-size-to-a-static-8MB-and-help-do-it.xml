    <summary>The context discusses the need to increase the block size of Bitcoin to a static 8MB and the importance of consensus in achieving this. The author uses an analogy of an engineer building planes with increasing capacity to argue that the cost of adding transactions to blocks will approach zero, but miners will still need to charge fees to stay in business. The author urges the community to pitch in to run necessary tests and agree on future increases in block size as technology allows. They argue that holding back progress will not serve the best interests of Bitcoin and could potentially lead to a fork. The message is to prioritize the growth and expansion of Bitcoin for the benefit of its users and the market demand for increased capacity.</summary>
