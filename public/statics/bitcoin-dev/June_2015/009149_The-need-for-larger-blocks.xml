    <summary>In a conversation between Jorge and Wladimir, the possibility of uncontroversial hardforks is discussed. Wladimir suggests that these hardforks may not be very different from softforks in terms of deployment, but they require more time for users to upgrade. He also mentions extreme cases where new crypto algos would need to be added due to secp256k1 or SHA256 showing weaknesses or practical quantum computing becoming powerful enough to factor discrete logarithms of those sizes. Wladimir believes that there are other possible uncontroversial hardforks, such as minor issues planned on the long term or features that are not politically loaded. Additionally, any major emergencies that clearly exploit coin holders or miners could warrant a hardfork. However, he admits that the only way to find out if these hardforks are viable is to propose them and see. He also notes that non-critical and non-controversial hardforks can be planned and time-locked up to 5 years ahead, eliminating the need for quick client upgrades.</summary>
