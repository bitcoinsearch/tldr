    <title>The Bitcoin Node Market</title>

    <summary>The writer proposed an idea to make it sustainable and profitable to run full nodes on the Bitcoin Network in the long term. The proposal involves a market where nodes that supply Bitcoin Network data are paid by other nodes, wallets, and services, based on the cost imposed on them to perform the work and send the data. Nodes that leech data will pay the nodes they connect to, but likely receive no payments from others. Meanwhile, balanced full-service nodes will have revenue-neutral payments with each other but will receive payments from leech nodes, wallets, and other services.The result of this system is that those who use the Bitcoin network without contributing to running a full node will share the cost of running the network. Fees will develop for connecting to the Bitcoin Network, which should cover the cost of running it. However, nodes can still offer free access if they wish. Market efficiencies are expected to mean that nodes only take in what is required to keep the network operational.</summary>
