    <summary>In an email correspondence between Gavin Andresen and Pieter, they discussed the simulation of bandwidth for block messages as a bottleneck. Pieter suggested that Matt's fast relay network could make their simulations irrelevant in the long-run. Gavin responded by proposing two simulations: one assuming 100% of transactions use the relay network and another assuming a percentage less than 100%. They also discussed the potential advantage for miners to sabotage the relay network, which the analysis confirmed. However, even with the relay network, there is still a delay. The email ended with Peter's contact information and a digital signature file.</summary>
