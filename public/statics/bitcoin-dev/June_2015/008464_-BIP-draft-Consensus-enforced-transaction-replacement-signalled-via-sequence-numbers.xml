    <summary>The email conversation discusses the proposal of a soft-fork change to the consensus-enforced behaviour of sequence numbers for supporting safe transaction replacement via per-input relative lock-times. The proposal aims to use the full range of the 32-bit sequence number, which has rarely been used for anything other than boolean control over absolute nLockTime, in a way that is semantically compatible with the originally envisioned use of sequence numbers for fast mempool transaction replacement. However, the proposal also has some disadvantages such as external constraints, preventing the full range of sequence numbers from being used when interpreted as a relative lock-time, and repurposing nSequence as a relative lock-time precludes its use in other contexts. The BIP draft can be found at the given gist link, and the reference implementation is available at the provided git repository.</summary>
