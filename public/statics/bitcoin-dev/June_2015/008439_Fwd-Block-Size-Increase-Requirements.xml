    <title>Fwd: Block Size Increase Requirements</title>

    <summary>The author is considering the possibility of increasing the block size for Bitcoin. They suggest a simple increase to something in the 4-8GB range with no further increases without a hard fork. The author thinks that Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth is not relevant because it only looks at the speed of his connection, not the amount of data usage that his provider allows. They also believe that a scheduled ramp up of block size increases is an unnecessary complication and that it is impossible to predict what the block size will be 20 years from now. Instead, the author suggests making informed decisions about block size increases as they become necessary and demonstrates the ability to react to changing requirements and conditions.</summary>
