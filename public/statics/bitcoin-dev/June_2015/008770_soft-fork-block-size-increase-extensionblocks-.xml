    <summary>A user named Raystonn on GitHub suggests increasing the default block size limit to 1MB. The email containing this suggestion was delayed by the list, as it was sent on June 1 but received on June 17. The author argues that the current limit is too low because it is being reached in bursts of transactions, which puts pressure on the average displayed in graphs.</summary>
