    <summary>In an email conversation on June 15, 2015, Aaron Voisine expressed concern about the possibility of a hard fork for Bitcoin. He stated that such a move should be considered only as a last resort, if Bitcoin Core maintainers refused to lift the 1 MB limit. Instead, he suggested alternative proposals like BIP100 or a modified version of Gavin's proposal. He believed these changes would help avoid the need for an XT-only hard fork. The email also mentioned that there was no consensus about any proposal, including Garzik's proposal. Finally, it was noted that BIP100 seemed to be the only proposal that was gaining momentum towards consensus at that time.</summary>
