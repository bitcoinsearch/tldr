    <summary>The discussion revolves around miner economics and the importance of user votes in blockchain decisions. It is suggested that miners should only count user votes and not create their own transactions to achieve an agenda. However, it is important to note that miners need to include transactions with the same vote as them, or else they will face a pool of unconfirmed transactions that vote against them. It is better for small miners to have a voice in the decision-making process to avoid centralization. Troll users can be ignored by excluding their transactions unless they pay attractive fees. The importance of upgrading node owners and wallet developers is stressed for successful consensus. On the topic of vote bits, it is suggested that binary votes are simpler than up-and-down votes within the same vote. A suggestion is made to announce a vote that contains a certain change, such as the hash of a config file. This would allow different constants to be exposed to votes in the future. The preference is for 1 to represent yes, 0 for no/neutral/ignored, and omitted for no. In regards to miner revenue from fees, there is concern that without wallets that can make decent suggestions, this feature will be almost inaccessible to regular users. Miners may have more incentive to block transactions or spam their votes than to adapt to transaction sender preferences. However, miners who fill their blocks with garbage transactions that agree with their vote risk losing money, as they would be paying their own money as fees to themselves. To get real income, miners would have to vote in accordance with real users.</summary>
