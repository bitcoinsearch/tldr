    <summary>The industry trend of using web2.0 technology in wallets/services is not due to block chain sizes, but rather because of a generation of developers who see no alternatives. Projects like Lighthouse are trying to show people that they can blend the good bits of the web with the good bits of more traditional client side development, at a cost they can afford. However, one of the reasons that developers turn to outsourced services is that those services actually like developers and give them the features they need. It's unreasonable for the Bitcoin Core developer group to constantly call developers building apps idiots or "non technical" and then complain that people don't write apps in their preferred way. The approach chosen by developers must be accepted as decentralised app dev is already hard, and the way Core is run makes it much harder still.A big part of the reason modern web dev is so messed up is that lots of developers starting thinking every app they built needed to be "web scale" from day one. SQL databases? Pah. Doesn't scale. Think big. A big part of the debate around this change is showing that the statement "scaling" is not some kind of binary yes/no thing. O() notation normally refers to computational complexity and the vast majority of users don't run relaying nodes that take part in gossiping. They run web or SPV wallets. And the nodes that do take part don't connect to every other node. There is a case for an increase in the block size limit in order to create some breathing room to work on scaling and decentralising tech, but if it's done in isolation, it's not focusing on the big picture.</summary>
