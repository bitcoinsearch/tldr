    <summary>In a conversation between Peter Todd and Matt Whitlock on June 12, 2015, they discussed the idea of using bits for miners to vote on whether to double or halve the limit of user transactions in a block. Matt suggested that two bits be used instead of one to allow for a "wildcard" vote and a vote to keep the limit the same. Peter agreed with this suggestion and proposed taking the median of the three options, while throwing away any "don't care" votes. However, after further discussion, they decided that using the plurality vote would be better to ensure that "halve" doesn't win on a minority vote.</summary>
