    <summary>After reaching a 75% threshold, miners who haven't updated their version can be attacked through the creation of invalid blocks. This happens when someone produces a version 3 block that violates new rules and miners who haven't upgraded waste their mining power building on that block which could be an expensive way to attack them. The risk of this happening is low since creating an invalid version 3 block costs 25BTC in hashing power and the miner who does it ends up creating an invalid block.</summary>
