    <summary>James is seeking clarification on a line in the BIP32 definition regarding the context of "n" in the algorithm. The specific section he is referring to is "Private parent key â†’ private child key," which includes the step "The returned child key ki is parse256(IL) + kpar (mod n)." James is unsure of what "n" represents and is asking for help understanding its role in the algorithm. He has provided a link to the BIP32 definition for reference.</summary>
