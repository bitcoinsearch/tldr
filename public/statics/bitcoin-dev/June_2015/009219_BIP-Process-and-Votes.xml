    <summary>The Bitcoin software development system is subject to attack from a few people who have veto power, leading to concerns about centralization. While it's true that anyone can download different rules and run them, this is constrained by the network effect. The issue with developers is their tremendous influence to veto any changes because they have the power to make changes to the consensus rules. There is no known mechanism for safely deploying controversial changes to the consensus rules. The process of seeking consensus is in place, but its definition of "uncontroversial" is vague. The core maintainer has always been in control of the consensus rules since Satoshi came up with them. Any changes to any part of the code go through the core maintainer. People who keep repeating that the software development is decentralized because you fork the code without explaining the constraints are just cultists. The discussion has nothing to do with who has the position now, but the maintainer has a very large influence way beyond anyone else. The outside influences and stake of the developer is a relevant topic as developers try to put themselves on some kind of pedestal where they are the protectors and pure while miners, users, merchants are abusers, spammers, attackers, scammers, cheaters, etc. It is relevant that a core developer has minimal stake in Bitcoin holdings yet has major veto power over code change. Some kind of process needs to be developed that does not involve trying to convince one person to make the changes or a system that depends on unwritten, ever-changing rules maintained by a handful of people.</summary>
