    <summary>On June 30, 2015, Venzen Khaosan proposed increasing the block size of Bitcoin to a static 8MB. However, this led to concerns about exclusion from testnet and mainnet participants as well as compromising diversity and decentralization. As a solution, testing at double capacity (2MB) was suggested, but this raised questions about scaling beyond that and the purpose of such an increase. Peter Todd contributed to the conversation, pointing out that the proposed plan only doubled the capacity with no clear path for scaling further.</summary>
