    <summary>In an email conversation between Milly Bitcoin and an unknown recipient, the topic of incentivizing new developers to influence code is discussed. The recipient argues in favor of "rough consensus and running code" as opposed to design by committee, stating that arguments should be assessed based on technical merit rather than the number of people advancing it. The recipient also suggests that a process open to external manipulation would be a concern.</summary>
