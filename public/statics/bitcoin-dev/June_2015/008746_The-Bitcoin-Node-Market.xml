    <summary>Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, responded to a question on who would provide nodes for a billion mobile phones running SPV wallets. He stated that the SPV wallet author would provide the nodes if they wanted their wallet to function. When asked how SPV wallet users would pay for this service, he suggested that they could pay with their money or privacy by taking advantage of optional additional financial services such as consumer protection insurance.</summary>
