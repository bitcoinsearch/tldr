    <summary>On June 22, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list about an issue related to an email from an un-subscribed user. He noted that the email should have been auto-rejected by the server and speculated that there could be a problem with the configuration if it went through to the list. The email included links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and the website for the Linux Foundation, which hosts the list.</summary>
