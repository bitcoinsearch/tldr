    <summary>The email conversation revolves around the discussion of a proposal to agree on a data format and encode it in an op_return output in the coinbase transaction. This proposal is suggested as a means to help SPV clients, but it is pointed out that until a softfork is activated, SPV clients should not rely on this encoding as the results can be fabricated by individual miners. Furthermore, the statistics would only cover in-band data, which is the scope of consensus rules. A Header-PoW-verifying client could still be given all transactions in a recent block, from which it can see the in-band fees directly. The trade-off in this proposal is the size of those transactions versus the need to alter any consensus rules or do soft forks. It is noted that fee stats can always be fabricated by individual miners because fees can be paid out-of-band.</summary>
