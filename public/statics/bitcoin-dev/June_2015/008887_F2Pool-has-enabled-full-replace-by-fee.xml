    <summary>In an email exchange between Matt Whitlock and Justus Ranvier on June 19, 2015, the topic of a non-repudiation mechanism in a protocol was discussed. The conversation revolved around the need for explicitly defining such a mechanism rather than relying on assumptions. Justus pointed out that “prima facie” did not mean “always,” but instead meant that it was the default assumption unless proven otherwise. Matt questioned why fraud should be automatically assumed by default and recommended making no assumption without any information one way or another about fraudulence or non-fraudulence of any given double-spend.</summary>
