    <summary>The discussion revolves around the need for cryptocurrency transactions to be made cryptographically safe and whether or not it is necessary for them to be perfect. Aaron Voisine argues that transactions do not need to be perfectly secure, they just need to be safer than credit card payments, which can be charged back. Luke Dashjr believes that unconfirmed transactions are vulnerable to double spending if someone were to seriously try, but Eric Lombrozo points out that most people have better things to do than try to steal small amounts, and vendors have learned to tolerate a certain level of risk. The comparison is made to vending machines selling newspapers, which are often not closely monitored despite the obvious potential for abuse. Ultimately, it's agreed that perfection is not necessary in all situations.</summary>
