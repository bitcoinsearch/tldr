    <summary>In this email thread, the bitcoin community is discussing moving away from SourceForge mailing lists and using LF as a mailing infrastructure provider. They also want to research secure mailing list models for bitcoin-security. There are discussions about the name of the new list (bitcoin-dev vs bitcoin-development), proposed cut-off date for the old list (July 15th) and moderators for the new list. The overall consensus is to move forward with creating the new list and subscribing it to the old list. Once greater than 50% of the members of the old list are members of the new list, an announcement would be sent out that the old list will be turned into read-only mode in 3 weeks and to use the new list only after that time. Trusted community members may also be identified to help with moderation.</summary>
