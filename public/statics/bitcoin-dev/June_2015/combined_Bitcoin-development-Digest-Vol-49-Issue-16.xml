    <summary>In June 2015, Eric Voskuil responded to a proposal aimed at addressing the issue of block size limits and increasing scalability in Bitcoin development. Voskuil emphasized that decentralization is the core of Bitcoin's security model and what gives it value. Despite lesser usage compared to state currencies like Visa, Dollar, Euro, Yuan, and Peso, Bitcoin has utility because of its lack of centralized control. The premium for Bitcoin exists solely because of its decentralization, which is the primary objective of Bitcoin. Ron, another participant in the discussion, agreed with Voskuil's sentiment and added that the value of Bitcoin lies in its independence and constancy. Its worth does not change, only the worth or worthlessness of corrupt states and their currencies that it's compared to/exchanged with. However, Ron hesitated to call Bitcoin money since money is supposed to be a store of value over time.</summary>
