    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Peter Todd expressed concern about payment providers considering legal contracts with large miners to ensure their transactions are mined. This would create a centralisation risk as small miners would not be able to enter into these contracts, leading to higher profits for larger pools and potentially resulting in non-compliant miners being kicked off the network with a 51% attack. Todd suggests that the P2P network will become more unpredictable as nodes move away from it due to the changes being made, however, if nodes incentivise their neighbours to relay standard transactions, this could benefit the network as a whole. The discussion also covers the potential benefits of full-RBF (replace-by-fee) functionality in broadening what the P2P network relays, making it more useful by providing a uniform method to get transactions to a wider variety of miners with a wider variety of policies. Todd's pull request allows users to disable full-RBF functionality if they choose not to support it.</summary>
