    <summary>A member of the community, Fellow Traveler, has been waiting for nine months for progress on proposals related to BIP-drafts found at https://github.com/Open-Transactions/rfc/tree/master/bips. The individual is trying to find out where the breakdown occurred but cannot locate any discussion or information regarding "Base58 Serialization for Transaction-Based Color Descriptors" or "Order-based Smart Property Coloring" or the draft names bip-ccids. The individual has searched their email and list archives to no avail and asked others with no success. They are considering creating threads for each proposal under the assumption that there was a mailing list error.</summary>
