    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Aaron Voisine, they discuss the importance of confirmations in Bitcoin transactions. While Voisine argues that it is the receiver who cares about delays or getting confirmations, Todd points out that most receivers do not accept zeroconf transactions. Todd himself only has his funds credited after four confirmations when he deposits them on his exchange. Thus, while the sender can be informed of the receiver's requirements, it is ultimately the receiver who cares about confirmations.</summary>
