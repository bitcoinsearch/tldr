    <summary>In a conversation about the submission process for draft BIPs to bitcoin-development, Mike Hearn states that Bitcoin Core maintainer will deliver a preliminary yes/no verdict within three weeks, which may be informed by the previous three weeks of debate. The BIP author may request an extension if more time is required. However, Wladimir clarifies that the Bitcoin Core maintainer does not decide on protocol or consensus level changes and that finding someone else would be necessary if an arbiter is needed. He also mentions that posting proposals as a new thread would provide better exposure than replying to existing topics. Additionally, he notes that the idea of a Bitcoin Standards Body was once proposed but is not actively being worked on.</summary>
