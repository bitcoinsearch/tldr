    <summary>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and Gavin Andresen, the issue of block size restriction was discussed. Todd raised the question of what would happen if a block following a size increase trigger is back in the past before the size increase, as block timestamps are not always chronological. He proposed comparing the timestamp against the median time to solve this issue, however, Andresen pointed out that this would complicate the implementation. Instead, he implemented a variant that replaced the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant with a function that took both a timestamp and a block height, which he believed was a more stable number to work with. However, there were several places in the current reference implementation where digging out the block height or calculating the median timestamp for the block would involve changing quite a few functions in the call-chain or acquiring the cs_main lock to consult the current best chain.</summary>
