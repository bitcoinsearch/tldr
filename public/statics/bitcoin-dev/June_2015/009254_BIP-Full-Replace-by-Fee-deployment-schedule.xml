    <summary>In a message sent by Peter Todd on June 29, 2015, he requested Gregory to assign a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) number to a proposal regarding full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and transaction deadline functionality. However, Luke responded that the policy regarding nodes and miners is not within the scope of BIPs, implying that such decisions are left to their discretion rather than being determined by proposals.</summary>
