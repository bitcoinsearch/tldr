    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric expressed his opinion that in the ongoing debate over the block size limit either one branch will emerge victorious in a short period of time or both branches will lose. This sparked a philosophical question about whether the majority has the right to dictate on the minority. Ivan Brightly argued that bitcoin does not provide any rights to individuals and that from a technical perspective, the longest chain with the greatest number of users valuing the token on that chain would emerge as the winner. While there are incentives for the majority to not override a minority group, if the reward for imposing a change is deemed greater than the value lost in disruption, there may be no stopping this change.</summary>
