    <summary>In a discussion between Gregory Maxwell and Luke Dashjr, Maxwell argues that even if policy is considered pure local fiat, BIPs about best practices or coordination are still reasonable. He suggests that understanding different policies is important for creating transactions that work. As an example, he mentions Luke-Jr's own BIP19, which suggests a non-consensus-critical policy change regarding M-of-N Standard Transactions. Maxwell goes on to say that full-RBF (replace-by-fee) has significant impacts on wallet authors and other stakeholders and will require changes in how transactions are authored and re-authored.</summary>
