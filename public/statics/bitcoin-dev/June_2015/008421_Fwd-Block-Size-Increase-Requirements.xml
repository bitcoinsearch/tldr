    <summary>The discussion in the email thread centers around what the maximum block size should be for Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen suggests starting at a max of 8 or 4, slightly less than Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth predicts for the next 20 years, to ensure predictability. He chose 20 because his testing shows it to be safe and reasonable. Oliver Egginger responds, suggesting that the max block size should be a power of two, specifically listing several examples such as 2^0=1MB and 2^3=8MB. However, he notes this is only his personal preference and asks if others feel the same. The email thread ends with information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
