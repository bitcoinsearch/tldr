    <summary>The email discussion thread between members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list discusses the possibility of implementing a spam filter and charging per-message fees to support the list. Troy Benjegerdes suggested implementing a HashCash system as a filter plugin that would ensure the required bitcoin fee has been paid, or better yet included in the message in some standard form. He also proposed that anyone who's contributed more than say 10 or 15 commits to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors should be excluded from the pay-with-bitcoin filter since they have paid with code. The rest should pay to distribute and archive their efforts. Patrick Mccorry (PGR) responded by asking what about researchers who do not commit code but help find problems in this space. He didn't think a mailing should be a paid-for service. However, if someone reposted something that did not make it to the list by accident or omission or a hashcash posting fee that was too high, it would end up on the list if enough people bothered to read it and either repost or post the bond to pass the filter. Andy Schroder suggested making a pay-per-message or byte solution, where the cost could be dynamic based upon the number of current mailing list subscribers. This could solve the issue of who pays problem, the sender pays. At the same time, it could limit spam while motivating people to be more concise and clear with their messages.Wladimir J. van der Laan commented on the discussion by mentioning that all downloads from source forge have been deleted, even old ones, because of warnings against downloading software from SourceForge. However, he had no opinion on the mailing list, though he thinks it's less urgent. The issue of moving the mailing list has come up a few times before, and people can't agree where to move to.</summary>
