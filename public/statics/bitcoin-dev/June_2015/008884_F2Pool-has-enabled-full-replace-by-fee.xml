    <summary>Coinbase, a leading Bitcoin exchange, has been accused of a sybil attack for connecting to many nodes on the network which creates systemic risks of failure. The Bitcoin P2P network is resilient to failure when the chance of any one node going down is uncorrelated with others. Coinbase is running around a dozen nodes running regular Bitcoin Core in various subnets, and isn't doing anything particularly out of the ordinary here. If full-RBF sees any significant adoption by miners, then it will actively harm bitcoin adoption by reducing or removing the ability for online or POS merchants to accept bitcoin payments at all. Coinbase's goal is to drive bitcoin adoption by making it easy for people to spend their bitcoin with merchants online. They've historically had relatively little interest in what miners were doing (until RBF came out) but now if full-RBF sees any significant adoption by miners, it will harm bitcoin adoption.</summary>
