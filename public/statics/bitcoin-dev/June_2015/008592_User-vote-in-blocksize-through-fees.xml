    <summary>Matt Whitlock suggests using two bits for voting instead of one in the mining process. He proposes a "wildcard" vote, a vote to remain the same, a vote to be halved, and a vote to be doubled. User transactions would follow the same usage. This proposal addresses a concern with Jeff's proposal that hands control exclusively to miners; now, miners lose out on fees if they do not represent the users' wishes. Although Peter Todd expects disaster to ensue, he is less concerned if the disaster is something users explicitly allowed to happen in a consensual way.</summary>
