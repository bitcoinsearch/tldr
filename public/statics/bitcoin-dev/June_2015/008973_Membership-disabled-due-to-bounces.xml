    <summary>Several individuals on the Bitcoin-development mailing list received a message stating that their membership had been disabled due to excessive bounces. One member, Braun Brelin, expressed confusion over this as he had only sent one email on the list in recent weeks. Matt Whitlock also received the message and had to re-enable his membership, questioning why messages from the list would be bouncing. It is unclear if this issue is related to the recent issues with SourceForge and mail list hosting. The email includes a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list for further information.</summary>
