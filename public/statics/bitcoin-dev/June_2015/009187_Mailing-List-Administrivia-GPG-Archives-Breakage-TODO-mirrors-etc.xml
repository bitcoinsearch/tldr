    <summary>The members of the Bitcoin development community have expressed their concern over the fact that the archives of the mailing list they use to communicate are corrupt. Members are requesting that the "mbox" format used for archiving be fixed and made available for public use as it is the most efficient way to preserve the list's history. Users have also stated that spam cannot be prevented by this method, and that any attempts to do so are futile. Additionally, some users feel that message footers and subject prefixes should be turned off as they are cluttering up the email chain. The internet has been asked to provide a regularly updated gzip/7z mbox format of the archives to resolve these issues.</summary>
