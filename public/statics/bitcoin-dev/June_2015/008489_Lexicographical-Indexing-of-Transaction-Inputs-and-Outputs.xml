    <summary>In this email thread, the sender thanks Stephen for his feedback on an explanation of sorting. Stephen suggests that the explanation could be shortened and clarified by stating that the transaction IDs (TXIDs) of inputs should be compared as uint256 integers. The sender considered this suggestion but is worried that it may be ambiguous when applied to different languages and platforms without further explanation. They explain that their intent is for wallets to implement the algorithm however they wish, as long as the output is compliant with the BIP definition. The sender believes that the algorithm in the BIP should target test cases rather than implementation and should leave little room for ambiguity.</summary>
