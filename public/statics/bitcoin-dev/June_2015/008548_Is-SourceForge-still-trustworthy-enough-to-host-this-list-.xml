    <summary>In an email thread discussing the mailing list for Bitcoin development, Andy Schroder suggests implementing live mirrors and requests PGP/MIME support. He also proposes a pay-per-message solution to limit spam and motivate people to be more concise with their messages. Troy Benjegerdes agrees to sponsor the implementation of a HashCash spam filter and suggests having several other people with Linux admin experience host live mirrors of the list. The message fee should be reasonable enough for independent admins to pay $250/month each for their time and server hosting/bandwidth costs. In addition, anyone who has contributed more than 10 or 15 commits to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors should be excluded from the pay-with-bitcoin filter, as they have paid with code. Finally, Wladimir J. van der Laan comments that all Bitcoin downloads have been deleted from SourceForge due to concerns about downloading software from the site, and expresses no opinion on the mailing list issue.</summary>
