    <summary>In an email conversation between Tier Nolan and Gavin Andresen, they discuss the proposed BIP-100 upgrade for Bitcoin. The window of 12,000 blocks (83 days) is used instead of the standard 1,000, which can cause noise on the measurement and potentially activate the proposal with less than 75% miner agreement. However, this also means that the vote has to be sustained for longer and inherently gives a longer notice period. Gavin believes that scanning through the last 12,000 block headers every new block will not cause performance problems. They also discuss the upgrade warning and how old nodes detect an upgrade by version numbers. Bitcoin Core will automatically alert when 51% of blocks have a version it doesn't understand or if it detects a chain with more work that it doesn't consider valid. Lastly, they discuss the fail condition where if the rule doesn't activate by January 11, 2017, then it becomes disabled. Gavin thinks this idea is good but doesn't like the vote idea because miners could set multiple bits.</summary>
