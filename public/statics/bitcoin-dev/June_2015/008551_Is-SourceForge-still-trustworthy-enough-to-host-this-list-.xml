    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of changing the e-mail list provider and finding an agreeable solution for it. The consensus seems to be between "pay with commits or pay with bitcoin." A sustainable solution suggested by a member is to identify a team of admins and use Digital Ocean's new team accounts feature. It is also mentioned that commercial list-as-a-service providers may not be trustworthy in the long run, and read-only mirrors of the list archives can help mitigate business risks. Ivan Brightly from SolidX Partners offers sponsorship to overcome the hurdle of list provider costs. Andy Schroder suggests various solutions such as 'pay per message or byte' which could motivate people to be more concise and clear with their messages. Wladimir J. van der Laan mentions that all downloads have been deleted from Sourceforge, including Bitcoin Core release announcements, due to warning issued about downloading software from them. Finally, Troy Benjegerdes gives his opinion on picking fights and trying to buy hackers.</summary>
