    <summary>In a thread, Eric Lombrozo made it clear that he believes the ease of double-spends has little to do with the protocol and more to do with poor software and security policy on the merchant's end. Although it may not be wise to make changes to the relay policy that make these exploits easier, pressure must be applied to merchants to upgrade their systems to be more resilient. This will allow for more room for changes to the relay policy without causing significant disruption to the network.</summary>
