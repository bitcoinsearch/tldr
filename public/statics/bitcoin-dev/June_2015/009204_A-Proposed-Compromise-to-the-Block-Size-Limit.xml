    <summary>The concept of decentralization is crucial and pooling protocols can help phase out artificial centralization. However, measuring the level of decentralization can be difficult as claims are often made without analysis or explanation. It is important to understand that decentralization is an approximation of having a collection of centralized systems interact in some way. To improve discussions on changes, it is suggested to come up with a metric for measuring decentralization.</summary>
