    <summary>In an email exchange, Mike Hearn discusses his difficulty in understanding how decisions are made in Bitcoin Core, and whether there is a formal process for decision-making. While it may be impossible to write down a system of rules that resolves every dispute among core developers, the lack of consensus becomes apparent when there are reasoned, comprehensible objections that have not been met after sufficient debate. Instead of a formal process, technical consensus is understood by all participants, and where it is absent, progress is not made. The absence of rules prevents the system from being gamed.</summary>
