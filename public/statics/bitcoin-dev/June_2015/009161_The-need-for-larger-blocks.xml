    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin transactions, Aaron Voisine raised the issue of sender and receiver priorities. He argued that it is the receiver who is concerned about transaction delays and confirmations. However, one commentator noted that most receivers do not accept zero-confirmation transactions. They cited an example of depositing funds on an exchange which requires four confirmations before crediting the funds. This means that the sender's priority should also be considered in ensuring timely and successful transactions. The discussion took place on 27 June 2015 at 03:14:41 GMT-04:00.</summary>
