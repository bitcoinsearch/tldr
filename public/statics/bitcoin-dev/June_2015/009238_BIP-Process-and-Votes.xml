    <summary>In a forum discussion, Adam suggests that a second mailing list called 'bitcoin-process' be created for people who are interested in learning about bitcoin process. He also proposes that a FAQ should be written to help interested individuals understand how and why the process works the way it does. The aim is to provide a starting point for discussions on bitcoin, so people can have a basic understanding of the cryptocurrency. This will help in promoting awareness and education of bitcoin amongst the public.</summary>
