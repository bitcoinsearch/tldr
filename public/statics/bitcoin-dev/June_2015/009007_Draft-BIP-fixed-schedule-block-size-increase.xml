    <summary>In an email thread from June 22, 2015, Gavin Andresen requested that participants reply directly to emails in question, rather than breaking the flow of conversation and taking replies out of context for other readers. The email thread discusses the current network message limit, which is noted as being 2MB, reduced from 32MB in a previous release. The email was signed by 'peter' and included a digital signature attachment.</summary>
