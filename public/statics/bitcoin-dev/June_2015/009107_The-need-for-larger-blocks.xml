    <summary>In a recent statement, Gavin Andresen commented on the growing usage of Bitcoin and its potential impact on the network. He agreed with Pieter's view that usage will increase to fill whatever maximum block size is allowed by miners or imposed by minimum transaction fees or a hard cap on block size. However, Andresen is not afraid of increased usage as he believes it will result in more investment, more smart engineers, and more people with incentives to solve scaling problems which will make Bitcoin stronger.Andresen also stated that he has been working on this issue since late last year, focusing on thinking, testing, simulating, talking, writing code, and consulting key people and companies. He believes that BIP 101 is a good compromise between "no limit, let the miners decide" and "lower the max size so a raspberry pi running on a 56K modem can be a full node." Overall, Andresen seems optimistic about the future growth and development of Bitcoin despite the potential challenges it may face.</summary>
