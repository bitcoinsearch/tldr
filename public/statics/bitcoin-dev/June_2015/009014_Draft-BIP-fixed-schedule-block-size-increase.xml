    <summary>In the nVersion bits proposal, timestamp issue is solved by comparing it against median time which is guaranteed by protocol rules to advance monotonically. Moreover, median time is also used to ensure a clear point where the protocol change starts. The proposal suggests that blocks will only allow larger block size if pindex has GetMedianTimePast() after midnight 11 Jan 2016 and a supermajority showing support for the fork has previously been reached.</summary>
