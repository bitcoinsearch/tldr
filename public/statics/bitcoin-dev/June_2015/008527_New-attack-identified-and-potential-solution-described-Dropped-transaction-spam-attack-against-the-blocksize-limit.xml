    <summary>The email thread discusses a potential solution to a dropped-transaction spam attack against the blocksize limit in Bitcoin development. The sender, Btc Drak, mentions that even a smaller limit would have to go to remove the attack. Raystonn argues that without the blocksize limit, a spammer could flood the network with transactions until they run out of money. However, Btc Drak points out that there is still a hard message size limit imposed by the p2p protocol, which would limit the block size to this size. The email does not provide further information on the details of the attack or the potential solution.</summary>
