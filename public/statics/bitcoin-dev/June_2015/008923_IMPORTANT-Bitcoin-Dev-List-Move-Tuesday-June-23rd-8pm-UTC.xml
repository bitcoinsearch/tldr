    <summary>An important notice has been issued to the members of the Bitcoin Dev List regarding some changes that are going to take place on Tuesday, June 23rd at 8pm UTC (1pm PDT). The current list at bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net will reject all posts and the current archives at http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-development/ will be exported. The test archives at the new list will be wiped and replaced with an import from the old list. The new list https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev will be open to posts after the archive import is complete. Everyone may subscribe to the new list now and make test posts. Anything posted prior to the switchover on Tuesday will be wiped from the archives.An issue with this list is posts from domains that require DKIM signature verification will end up in the spam folder at popular providers like Gmail. Initially, the new list will have that exact same problem as they will continue to have the subject tag and footer. Within a few weeks, LF will upgrade Mailman to do automatic Munge From which will solve this problem. Warren Togami has informed about these changes.</summary>
