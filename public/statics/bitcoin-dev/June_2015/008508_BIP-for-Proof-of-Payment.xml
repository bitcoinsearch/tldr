    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, a discussion was taking place regarding the use of OP_RETURN as a method to store arbitrary data on the blockchain. Participants debated whether or not this practice should be allowed and suggested alternatives such as using an invalid opcode or setting a high nLockTime value to make the transaction impossible to mine for the next 9500 years. One participant had previously rejected the idea of a high lock_time due to concerns about nodes having to keep it in memory, but later realized that nodes would only accept transactions with a near-in-time value. Despite some reservations about the practice itself, participants acknowledged the potential benefits of using a high lock_time value.</summary>
