    <summary>In an email conversation, s7r expressed concern over a potential hard fork of Bitcoin. While agreeing that the majority should not be able to enforce rules over the minority, s7r worries that if the majority creates a new altcoin, it will leave the remaining minority with less or no value in their product or service. Therefore, s7r suggests enforcing some rules agreed by the majority or supermajority to ensure the survival of the product or service, as long as it still has value. However, s7r warns that a Schism fork could result in nobody receiving any value, and says that such a hardfork is akin to forcing users to go to war against each other. S7r acknowledges there are valid points on both sides of the debate, but thinks that if a hardfork does happen, it should also include a smart change that will make future changes requiring hardforks simpler, with fewer risks involved. S7r is in favor of hardforks, but doesn't want to kill the system attempting one.</summary>
