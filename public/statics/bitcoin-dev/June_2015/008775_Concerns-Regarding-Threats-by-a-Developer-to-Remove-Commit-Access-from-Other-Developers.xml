    <summary>The Bitcoin Core project operates differently from other open-source projects when it comes to consensus changes. While there is plenty of decision-making ability for code changes, achieving consensus is much harder. Controversial issues are dealt with carefully, and any changes to consensus code must have full agreement among the technical community. The ongoing libconsensus work aims to separate "Bitcoin Core, the node software" and "The Bitcoin Consensus" along clear lines, which will help avoid confusion. The goal is to maintain a robust, global, decentralized network beyond anyone's control. It would make no sense to run it like a dictatorship, creating a central position where power can be applied to push through changes to the system's behavior. Anyone with commit access can block any change, making it difficult to achieve broad agreement on anything controversial.</summary>
