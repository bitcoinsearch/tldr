    <summary>In an email exchange on June 1, 2015, Adam Back discussed the possibility of reducing spam and waiting to see if fee pressure would take effect, while working on improving decentralisation metrics and relay latency. He also suggested increasing the block size incrementally if necessary, while attempting to find a long-term solution for scaling beyond just volume. When asked about the lead time required to kick the can, there was no clear answer. Back provided a graph that showed how the maximum block size had been in play for eight months, emphasizing the importance of looking at the distribution of block sizes rather than just the average.</summary>
