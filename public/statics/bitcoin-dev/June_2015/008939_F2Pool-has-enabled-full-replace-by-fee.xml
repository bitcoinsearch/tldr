    <summary>In an email exchange between Eric Lombrozo and other individuals, Lombrozo suggests that if a non-repudiation mechanism is desired in the protocol, it should be explicitly defined rather than relying on assumptions. Lombrozo also advises against relying on signed transactions as proof of intent to pay if such a mechanism is not defined. However, he notes that non-repudiation can be built on top of the payment protocol layer.</summary>
