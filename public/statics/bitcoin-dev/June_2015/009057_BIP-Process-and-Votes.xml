    <summary>In an email exchange, Jeff Garzik stated that there is no voting in the traditional sense within the context of developers making changes that users will accept and use. However, Bryan disagrees with this statement, arguing that users are personally responsible for evaluating all rules for themselves. He suggests that every user should be educated on the topic to avoid principal agent problems, even if they have the ability to "fire" developers by choosing different software. Bryan draws a comparison to the importance of seeing all transactions on the network.</summary>
