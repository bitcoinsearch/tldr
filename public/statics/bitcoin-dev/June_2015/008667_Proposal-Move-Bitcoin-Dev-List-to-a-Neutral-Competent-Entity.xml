    <summary>In an email exchange, Jeff Garzik suggests moving away from SourceForge mailing lists, using LF as a mailing infrastructure provider and researching secure mailing list models for bitcoin-security. The security team needs to separately research/write tools needed for this. Warren asks whether he should go ahead and create bitcoin-development @ LF, but suggests waiting to hear from more of the other technical leaders. They discuss the list name and a proposed cut-off date for the old list, and suggest identifying known trusted community members who can help with moderation.</summary>
