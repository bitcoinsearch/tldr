    <summary>In a conversation on June 29, 2015, Gregory Maxwell and Luke Dashjr discussed the use of BIPs for best practices and policy coordination. While Luke argued that policy is node/miner fiat and not the domain of BIPs, Gregory believed that BIPs could be used to establish best practices and promote interop and coordination. However, Luke raised concerns about mixing protocol standards with policy suggestions, which could potentially hold miners liable for not enforcing BIPs and lead to government regulation of Bitcoin. He suggested that an independent and updated database might be a better solution than constantly issuing new BIPs for every node's policy.</summary>
