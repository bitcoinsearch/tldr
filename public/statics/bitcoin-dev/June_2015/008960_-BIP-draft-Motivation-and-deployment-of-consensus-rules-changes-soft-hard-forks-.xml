    <summary>In an email thread on June 21, 2015, Tier Nolan suggested fixing the "off by 1 bug" with a soft fork. This suggestion was made in the context of demonstrating how a non-controversial hard fork works. The timewarp fix discussed in the thread could potentially be coded as a soft fork instead of a hard fork. However, it is unclear if there were any other candidates for addressing the issue.</summary>
