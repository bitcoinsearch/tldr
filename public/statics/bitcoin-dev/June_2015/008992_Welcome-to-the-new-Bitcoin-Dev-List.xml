    <summary>A recent announcement on the Bitcoin development mailing list stated that the migration of the previous archive has been successfully completed and new posts will now be saved. However, a question was raised about updating bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org which are viewed by many as important sources for development updates. Additionally, the Bip0001 page needs an update as well.</summary>
