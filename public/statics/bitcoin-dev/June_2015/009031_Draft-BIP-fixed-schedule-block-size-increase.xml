    <summary>Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, and Peter Todd have been discussing the proposed block size increase for Bitcoin. Wladimir had noted that the original intention of a block size increase was a one-time scaling to grant time for more decentralizing solutions to develop. However, there is consensus that going through this process once a year would be too painful. Pieter agrees that Bitcoin's blockchain can grow proportionally as availability of bandwidth, storage, and processing power increases, but an initial bump of 8 MB and the growth rate afterwards seems like no effective limit ever. He fears that throwing away several protections currently in place could result from not wanting to deal with the hard problem. Jeff Garzik's proposal of a blocksize increase with a miner vote feedback mechanism is seen as a huge improvement over Gavin's proposal.</summary>
