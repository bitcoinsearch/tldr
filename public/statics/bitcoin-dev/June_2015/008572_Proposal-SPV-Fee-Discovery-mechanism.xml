    <summary>In a discussion about dropped transactions, Peter Todd explained that transactions are dropped in a predictable manner - lowest fee/KB first. However, this predictability only applies to those who know the state and policies of a miner's mempool. From an end user's perspective, it wouldn't matter much because they wouldn't know if their transaction would be included in the network or not and by what time. End users wouldn't know which miners will find the next block, miners' mempool sizes, or potential custom eviction policies. Although, FSSRBF/CPFP can somewhat remedy this situation, provided wallets give users a good interface for such transaction replacements/chains.</summary>
