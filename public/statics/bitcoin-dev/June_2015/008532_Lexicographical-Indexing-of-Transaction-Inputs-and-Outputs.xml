    <summary>In this email thread, Peter Todd provides feedback on a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) related to transaction ordering. He questions the mention of SIGHASH_SINGLE and suggests focusing on generic statements rather than speculating too much on future uses. He recommends presenting the BIP in terms of a generic statement that specifies two common cases in detail. The updated language is provided for the BIP. Todd advises leaving out discussions on IsStandard() rules and soft forks as they can cause problems in the future. He also mentions a change in Bitcoin Core regarding a sequence number and anti-fee-sniping with nLockTime. Finally, he asks if there is a patch for deterministic transaction ordering for Bitcoin Core, but the author, Kristov, prefers to let someone else handle it.</summary>
