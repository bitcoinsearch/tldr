    <summary>The email thread discusses the need for a wiki page to summarize the ongoing debate about block size in Bitcoin. Mats Henricson expresses frustration with people rehashing the same arguments without reading previous discussions or offering alternatives. Gabe Appleton offers to help create a framework for the wiki page if someone else has permission to create it. Ethan Heilman agrees that a summary of positions and arguments would be helpful, as he does not have time to read all the emails generated by the debate. There is also mention of confusion around where bitcoin XT fits into the scheme of things.</summary>
