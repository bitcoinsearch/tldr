    <summary>A member of a mailing list has reported receiving a message indicating that their membership had been disabled due to excessive bounces. The member expressed confusion as they only recall sending one email to the list. The member wonders if this issue is related to recent issues with source forge and mail list hosting. Another member confirmed that they too received the same message and had to re-enable their membership on the list. However, they believe there should be no reason why messages sent by the list would bounce back to their address. No further information was provided about the cause of the issue or any steps being taken to resolve it.</summary>
