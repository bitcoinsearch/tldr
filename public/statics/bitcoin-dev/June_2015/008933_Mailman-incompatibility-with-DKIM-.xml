    <summary>In an email exchange between Adam Weiss and Jeff Garzik in June 2015, they discussed a feature in which the list would detect when someone posts from a domain that publishes a strict signature checking request for all mails originating from it and rewrite the envelope-from to the list's address. This behavior is not well-specified in RFC822 and is an edge case. However, rewriting envelopes has become more prevalent since strict DMARC has been adopted, and recent MUAs will handle it well. If this feature proves problematic, it could easily be switched to go the lkml route. Jeff Garzik expressed concern that this change may accidentally direct mail intended for DKIM-user + list to DKIM-user.</summary>
