    <summary>The invention of Hashcash technology a few years ago has been effective in dealing with spam. The solution to the problem of spam is already present in Bitcoin, where smaller blocks are mined down to individual transactions. When spam or transaction levels increase, mining targets for submission also go up. This requires a significant redesign of Bitcoin, which involves changing the parameters of hacky heuristics or "Consensus Threatening Quantities" (CTQs) like block time, block size, target difficulty, retarget time, etc. These CTQs induce a hard fork when changed and should be removed entirely. An attack that aims to destroy Bitcoin by filling all blocks with spam transactions will succeed if the attacker is well-funded. This gives well-funded entities the means to destroy Bitcoin if they desire. However, with a block size limit, the spam simply enriches miners at the cost of spammers, which is an antifragile quality. There will always be a block size limit based on technological considerations as the network has a finite bandwidth limit. Without a block size limit, the attacker would flood the network until consensus fails, rendering Bitcoin worthless and insecure. The worst an attacker can do with a block size limit is raise costs without harming security. At some point, it becomes cheaper to just 51% attack the network. Based on the current block subsidy of 25BTC/MB, the point where transaction fees are 25mBTC/KB corresponds to a cheap but still quite affordable attack for a large percentage of Bitcoin's users. Peter Todd is working on a concrete proposal for the redesign of Bitcoin and encourages others to do the same.</summary>
