    <summary>In a discussion thread on June 4, 2015, Mark Friedenbach questioned the relevance of a topic being discussed in a mailing list. Someone named Todd was being accused of involvement in various shady projects and scams with significant losses, including the failure of DarkWallet. Berg Investigations LLC expressed concern that Todd refused to answer reasonable questions about his involvement in these matters. The community deserves answers when someone so prominent is involved in such activities. However, no clear resolution or response was provided to this discussion topic.</summary>
