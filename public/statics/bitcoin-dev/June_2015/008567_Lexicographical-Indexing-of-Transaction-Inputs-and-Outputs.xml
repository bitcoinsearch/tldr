    <summary>Kristov Atlas has made requested changes to the BIP and sample code in response to Peter Todd's feedback. The discussion between the two revolved around the applicability of SIGHASH_SINGLE, with Todd suggesting that it is better to present the BIP in terms of a generic statement, while Atlas updated the language accordingly. Todd also recommended removing the "handling input/output deps" section. Additionally, Todd suggested simplifying the ordering algorithm by sorting txids as little-endian byte arrays using the bytearr_cmp() function, and sorting outputs by output amount instead of P2PKH locking script. He also pointed out an error in the statement about the number of bytes in amounts and P2PKH locking script. Finally, Todd mentioned that making this an IsStandard() rule is unlikely for now.</summary>
