    <summary>A discussion about full replace-by-fee (RBF) support being enabled by F2Pool, the largest pool with 21% of hashing power was had on the Bitcoin mailing list. The support means that transactions F2Pool has will be replaced if a conflicting transaction pays a higher fee and there are no requirements for the replacement transaction to pay addresses paid by the previous transaction. One user pointed out that intentional fraud is bad, but it is not fraudulent to reduce the value of a change address in order to pay a higher fee. Another user argued that un-prosecutable fraud is still fraud and anyone who encourages it should be recognised as a bad actor. The discussion turned towards Bitcoin XT, which relays double-spends, making it easier to get double-spends to miners than before; it was suggested this might be encouraging fraud.</summary>
