    <summary>In a conversation between Adrian Macneil and an unknown recipient, it was revealed that the company relies heavily on zeroconf transactions for merchant processing. The discussion revolved around the possibility of mining pools running an unsafe RBF (replace-by-fee) patch which could lead to fraud. In such a scenario, the company would have to explore ways to prevent fraud. Additionally, Adrian provided a link to https://www.f2pool.com/api/mempool as a potential resource for the recipient.</summary>
