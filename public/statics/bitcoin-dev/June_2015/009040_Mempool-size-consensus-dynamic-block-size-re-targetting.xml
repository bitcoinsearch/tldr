    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Filipe Farinha on June 24, 2015, the question was raised of whether mempool consensus could replace proof-of-work. Todd asked Farinha if his mempool consensus idea would work for this purpose, to which Farinha responded with a clear "no." This response is important to consider when evaluating the pros and cons of BIP 100.</summary>
