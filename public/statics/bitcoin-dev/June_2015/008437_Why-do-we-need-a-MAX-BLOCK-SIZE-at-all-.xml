    <summary>In this discussion from 2015, Jim Phillips questions the necessity of a hard limit on the block size in Bitcoin. He acknowledges that there are some reasons for keeping blocks to a certain size, such as difficulties with propagation and a need for a fee economy for miners. However, he suggests that this could be accomplished through configurable settings rather than a hard limit. He also argues that the original purpose of the limit, to prevent spamming, is no longer a concern with the rise of ASIC mining. Phillips suggests that allowing hardware limits to act as bottlenecks for scaling would be preferable to introducing an artificial bottleneck into the protocol that requires regular adjustment. He questions whether there is any big reason why a hard-coded limit is necessary and suggests that Bitcoin should be allowed to grow naturally within the increasing limits of hardware.</summary>
