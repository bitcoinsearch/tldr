    <summary>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Peter Todd made some suggestions regarding the use of replace-by-fee (RBF) in Bitcoin transactions. In his first message, he proposed a new methodology called "First-Seen-Safe Replace-by-Fee," which would allow for RBF without jeopardizing the safety of the original transaction. He also claimed that using RBF could lead to cost savings of 30-90%. In a later email, he reported that F2Pool had enabled full replace-by-fee. Adrian Macneil, Director of Engineering at Coinbase, also acknowledged F2Pool's implementation of RBF in a separate email. Todd noted that the links in the "References" section of the emails should be updated to reflect the new mailing list archive.</summary>
