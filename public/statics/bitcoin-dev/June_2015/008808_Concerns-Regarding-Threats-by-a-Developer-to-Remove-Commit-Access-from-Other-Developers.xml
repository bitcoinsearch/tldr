    <summary>The proposed changes to the consensus rules in Bitcoin have caused controversy among users. While it is ultimately up to each individual user to decide which code they run and what rules they enforce, the reality is that if your software does not agree with merchants and exchanges, you may not be able to pay your bills. Additionally, if Bitcoin were to split, the exchange rate could plummet and damage the ecosystem. Therefore, while users are technically free to decide within the constraints of the Bitcoin system, the potential consequences of their decisions are significant.</summary>
