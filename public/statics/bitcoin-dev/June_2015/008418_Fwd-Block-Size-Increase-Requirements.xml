    <summary>In an email dated June 1, 2015, Chun Wang expressed their disapproval of Gavin Andresen's proposal for a 20MB block size limit in Bitcoin. Wang argued that the community should instead increase the limit now and compromise on a lower limit, rather than risking the safety and stability of the system with such a large increase. They also suggested that starting with a max of 8 or 4 might get consensus among the community and scaling up predictably over time. Andresen defended his proposal, stating that all of his testing showed it to be safe and the costs reasonable, but he was willing to consider a lower limit if necessary. It is important to note that this email conversation took place during a contentious period in Bitcoin's history, as different factions within the community debated over how best to scale the network.</summary>
