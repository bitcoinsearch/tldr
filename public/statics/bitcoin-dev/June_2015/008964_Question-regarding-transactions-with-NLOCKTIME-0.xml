    <title>Question regarding transactions with NLOCKTIME &gt; 0</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the utilization of nLockTime in Bitcoin transactions. The usage of nLockTime is dependent on each wallet and how it handles transactions with it. It is suggested that one way to utilize nLockTime is to generate the transaction, keep it offline and then broadcast it when the locktime expires. The original email asks whether a transaction with N_LOCKTIME&gt;0 is stored in a block on the blockchain or in the mempool until its time expires. It is explained that a transaction with nLockTime cannot be stored in a block before the locktime expires and will not be accepted or relayed by nodes if broadcasted before its expiration. The discussion highlights the importance of nLockTime in verifying transactions and how Peter Todd and others are working on enhancements to offer users a guarantee that their signed transaction with nLockTime cannot be overridden by another signed transaction with nLockTime 0.</summary>
