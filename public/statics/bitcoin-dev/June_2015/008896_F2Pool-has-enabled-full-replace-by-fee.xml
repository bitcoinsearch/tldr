    <summary>In an email exchange between two individuals, Jeff Garzik, a bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, stated that making multiple incompatible versions of a spend is necessary for various refund contract protocols. In response, the other individual asked whether there was a dedicated field in a transaction (nSequence) for indicating when a protocol like this is in use. However, Jeff Garzik replied that there is no way of knowing which transaction is the 'right' or wrong one as one transaction may have obvious nSequence adjustments while the other - the refund transaction - may not. Jeff Garzik works at BitPay, Inc., a bitcoin payment service provider.</summary>
