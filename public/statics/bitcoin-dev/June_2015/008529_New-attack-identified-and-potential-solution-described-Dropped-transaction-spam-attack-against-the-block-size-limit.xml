    <summary>In a message sent on June 8, 2015, Patrick Mccorry noted that with the 0.01mBTC/KB minimum relay fee and $230 USD/BTC, it works out to about $2.3kUSD/GB of ram. Mike Hearn then reduced the minimum relay fee to 0.01mBTC/KB. The fee is now $23/MB (assuming 1,000 tx * 2.3 cents) and $23k/GB (assuming $23 * 1000, as each $23 is 1mb). This highlights the increased expense involved in Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
