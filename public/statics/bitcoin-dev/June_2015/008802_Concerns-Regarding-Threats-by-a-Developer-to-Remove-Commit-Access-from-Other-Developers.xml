    <summary>The message discusses the need for consensus changes within Bitcoin and how they should be approached. The author argues that force is not an accurate way to describe the situation as trading requires mutual agreement. Bitcoin's usefulness is related to the size of the group of people who can be convinced it is in their best interest to agree on a common trade protocol. Conversations about someone forcing someone else to do something are not helpful in growing the size of that group. Instead, effort should be focused on making sure current and future Bitcoin users are as informed as possible about the long and short term consequences of their choices.Furthermore, Bitcoin does not and cannot function as a set of rules imposed by some people onto other people. It is a negotiation about the best way for money to function in the future. The only way to get people to use Bitcoin is to convince them that the benefits they gain from agreeing to its protocol outweigh the downsides they encounter. It is important to recognize that it is a negotiation and the other parties have full agency and the right to walk away if mutual agreement is not reached.The author suggests that less time should be spent talking about procedural violations and more time convincing Bitcoin users that Bitcoin Core is the best client for them to use. Making improvements which the users are asking for or making a compelling case about why the users should reconsider could help persuade them. Finally, the author emphasizes that nobody can stop Bitcoin users from choosing the software they perceive to be in their best interests.</summary>
