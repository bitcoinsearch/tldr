    <title>Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity</title>

    <summary>Jeff Garzik, a developer of the Bitcoin community, wrote an email discussing several points. Firstly, he agreed to move away from using SourceForge mailing lists but only after a new replacement is established and welcomed by the community. Secondly, he agreed to use Linux Foundation (LF) as a mailing infrastructure provider. Thirdly, he suggested researching secure mailing list models for bitcoin-security. Although PGP is used for high security purposes, it would be nice to find a cryptosystem where mailing list participants individually hold keys for better access control. Peter Todd acknowledged all the points mentioned in Jeff's email.</summary>
