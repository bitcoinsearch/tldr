    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, stated in an email on 20 June 2015 that it is better for full nodes to fail if they have not noticed the fork instead of continuing to run on an outdated chain. He believed that this would be preferable to having a slow but functional chain. The Alert mechanism was suggested as a solution to this issue, which would notify nodes that they are outdated and need to update. If nodes continue to run despite receiving an alert, it would be considered intentional.</summary>
