    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev community is transitioning to a new list server and has decided against linking the old and new email lists during the transition period. Instead, they will announce the switchover date of Tuesday, June 23rd, and reject all posts to the old list with a message directing them to the new one. Archives will be exported and imported into the new list server before it opens, and users are encouraged to subscribe now and make test posts to help test configuration options to fix spam filter-related issues. Any posts to the new list prior to the final switchover will be wiped from the archives. Those with opinions on this decision are invited to join the discussion in Freenode #bitcoin-dev and speak to Warren Togami.During the transition period, posts to the old list may be delayed for 5+ minutes due to greylisting. The new list can be subscribed to at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev. Test posts can also be made as configuration options were being tested to fix some long-standing spam filter-related issues.On June 18, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. announced in #bitcoin-dev that a switchover would occur soon for the mailing list. The proposed switchover would take place on June 23, 2015, and an exact scheduled time for the move would be known probably the next day. At the time of the switchover, the old list would reject all messages, archives would be exported and imported into the new list server, then the new list would be opened. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, signed off the email.</summary>
