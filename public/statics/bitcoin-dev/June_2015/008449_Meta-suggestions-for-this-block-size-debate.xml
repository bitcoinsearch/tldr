    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mats Henricson expressed his frustration with the block size debate and suggested that all posters should read up on the various positions and arguments before posting. He also urged individuals to be helpful and suggest alternatives instead of just criticizing. Another member, Gabe Appleton, suggested creating a wiki page for the debate to condense information as much as possible. The idea was met with approval from some members who felt overwhelmed by the large number of emails generated daily from the debate.</summary>
