    <summary>The email conversation starts by stating that IPv4 came before IPv6. The discussion then moves towards the evolution of various technologies and how first mover advantage and network effect are overrated. The author mentions examples like Mac vs Windows, Yahoo! vs Google, MySpace vs Facebook and Bitcoin being the first mover in its space. However, the author believes that the whole world does not have low standards and is lazy, and someone will eventually build something better than Bitcoin, relegating it to history books and museums. The author concludes by saying that most of the potential brainpower available on Earth hasn't even begun to touch the Bitcoin movement, and Bitcoin startups shouldn't assume that they have an unassailable position.</summary>
