    <summary>The discussion revolves around the decision-making process for consensus changes or protocol changes in the Bitcoin core. The lead developer, Wladimir, is responsible for deciding on code patches but not for consensus rules. Bitcoin is different from other open source projects as it depends on a single blockchain that all users trust for value. Forking the blockchain and changing consensus rules would harm all users and impact the BTC/FIAT rate. This involves economics and human elements that are hard to fix through code development. The responsibility of improving the consensus should not be on the maintainer, but suggestions have been made regarding consensus changes made over a long period through soft forks, giving all users/miners/exchangers/merchants a chance to choose/take action. The question of who should get to vote on approval to commit a BIP implementation into Bitcoin Core is also raised. A civil discussion is needed to define a real process beyond personality-based arguments.</summary>
