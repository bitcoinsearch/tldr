    <summary>In an email conversation between Matt Whitlock and Mark Friedenbach, the latter expressed his concerns about Peter Todd's proposed protocol for a blockchain voting system. Friedenbach questioned whether the protocol would be free of miner influence over the vote, as miners could generate transactions that they claim in their own blocks. Whitlock responded by stating that miners could fill their blocks with garbage transactions that agree with their vote, but this wouldn't bring them any real income, as they'd be paying their own money as fees to themselves. Instead, miners would have to vote in accordance with real users to get real income. Todd's proposal involves giving users a mechanism to pay for votes to directly influence the outcome.</summary>
