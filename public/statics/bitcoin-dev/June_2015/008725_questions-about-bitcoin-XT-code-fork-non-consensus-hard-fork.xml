    <summary>The context is a message to Mike Hearn calling for him to stop the planning and deployment of a Bitcoin hard-fork that he and Gavin Andresen intend to action despite majority opposition. The message asserts that the actions are disrespectful of FOSS governance protocol, bad for the Bitcoin project, and dangerous for Bitcoin in the marketplace and people's wallets. The message also accuses Mike and Gavin of trying to usurp ownership and maintenance of Bitcoin. It warns of the risks involved and suggests that they will effectively ex-communicate themselves from the project and community. Furthermore, it claims that their proposed renegade action is causing stress unnecessarily and may cause a schism in the community. The message urges Mike Hearn to reconsider his plan and its intended and unintended consequences, put his feet back on the ground, and let the collaborative FOSS model gradually scale Bitcoin to everyone's grand vision. Lastly, the message highlights that the Bitcoin project serves as a flagship for the blockchain and has a payment network, but its key benefits are censorship resistance and trustless decentralization.</summary>
