    <summary>In an email conversation between Bitcoin core developers Jeff Garzik and Mark Friedenbach, Jeff suggested that the need for a hard fork to increase block size was necessary in order to prevent negative impacts on users when blocks become consistently full. Mark provided alternative solutions including implementing safe forms of replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent, developing cross-platform libraries for managing micropayment channels and using fidelity bonds and solvency proofs to minimize risk. Jeff argued that these suggestions would require significant work from all exchanges, payment processors, merchants and more, making it a far larger amount of work than simply increasing the block size limit.</summary>
