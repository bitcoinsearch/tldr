    <summary>A discussion about the appropriate value for mempool size in Bitcoin took place in June 2015. One participant disagreed with the proposed value of 11, citing that it would not last through peak trading hours. They suggested a larger value, closer to 72, which would maximize miner profit and prevent the need for resubmission after activity has died down. The participant also noted that memory requirements are reasonable up to 8mb blocks, but 20mb blocks may require reconsideration of the mempool size limit. Another participant agreed with the suggestion and preferred it over their own proposal as it did not make significant changes to the system's economics. In response to concerns about enforcing the policy, another participant stated that as long as a reasonable percentage of hash rate was following the policy, an attacker attempting to flood the network would fail and only transfer wealth to miners. Additionally, the default mining policy of setting aside space for high-priority transactions regardless of fee might be enough to prevent such an attack.</summary>
