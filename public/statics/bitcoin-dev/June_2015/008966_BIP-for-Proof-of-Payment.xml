    <summary>Kalle Rosenbaum has requested that proposals "Proof of Payment" and "Proof of Payment URI scheme" be assigned BIP numbers after constructive discussions, feedback, and updates. The source for both proposals can be found on GitHub. A limitation of 40 bytes for the OP_RETURN output had been discussed, and while it was suggested that a bigger nonce could be used, Kalle opted to stick with this limit due to simplifying implementation and not needing more data than 40 bytes. The Proof of Payment proposal allows for better privacy for customers who do not have to give out personal information such as an email address. It also creates a window of opportunity for thieves that is minimized since PoP is only usable once and created when needed. Different use cases will require different protection. The cost of using tokens is security, since a stolen token can be used over and over again.</summary>
