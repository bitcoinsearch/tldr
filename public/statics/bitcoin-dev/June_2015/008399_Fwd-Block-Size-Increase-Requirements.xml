    <summary>On June 1, 2015, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding whether or not miners have a disadvantage if their network speed is slower than others. Alex Mizrahi stated that being on a slow network puts one at a slight disadvantage, and Chun mentioned that his pool is on a slow network, which gives it a disadvantage when it comes to bigger blocks. Pindar Wong cautioned against assuming that investing in internet network infrastructure is a free or open market everywhere. Ricardo Filipe clarified that the disadvantage that Alex referred to only exists if miners do not have the same network speed and that miners are incentivized to invest in their network infrastructure if there is a difference in network speed. The discussion emphasized that just like easy ASIC access and low-price electricity, investing in internet network infrastructure is not always a free and open market.</summary>
