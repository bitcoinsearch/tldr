    <summary>A discussion about using a minimum height for Bitcoin blocks took place on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in June 2015. While acknowledging that it may be imprecise, one user suggested that over an extended period of time, a minimum height could be good enough. Another user proposed using the median time to ensure a clear point where a protocol change starts. This proposal was included in the nVersion bits proposal, which solves the issue of timestamp comparison by comparing it against the monotonically advancing median time guaranteed by the protocol rules.</summary>
