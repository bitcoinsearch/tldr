    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd suggested making websites with easy to understand displays of the current mempool backlog and the fee/KB needed to get to the front of the queue, similar to Bitcoin price charts. Filipe Farinha supported the idea and emphasized the need for standardization of reporting "delay alerts" in wallets through a BIP, which can help users take necessary actions like fee-bump, postpone or cancel transactions before sending them during periods of increased transaction volume. He also stressed the importance of keeping users informed of potential issues to prevent frustration and backlash against blockchain technology. Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, added that it's the receiver who is concerned about delays and confirmations, and they should tell the sender up-front what they're willing to accept in exchange for goods and services.</summary>
