The context of the message and the relationship between Johnathan and Ivan are not clear from the post. Corgan Labs is a company that provides SDR (Sales Development Representative) training and development services. It is unclear whether the message hidden by Ivan is related to the business operations of Corgan Labs or is something personal. Additionally, it is not specified how Johnathan came to know about this hidden message or what steps he plans to take in response to it. The post includes a link to the official website of Corgan Labs, which provides information about their services, team members, and testimonials from clients. However, the website does not offer any further insight into the context of the message hidden by Ivan in oak. Overall, the post by Johnathan Corgan raises more questions than it answers, leaving readers to wonder about the significance of the hidden message and its potential impact on Corgan Labs or other parties involved.</summary>
