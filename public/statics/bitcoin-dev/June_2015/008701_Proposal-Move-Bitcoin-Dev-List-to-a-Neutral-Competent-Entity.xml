    <title>Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the problem of DKIM signatures not being handled properly by Mailman 1.0 and whether switching to a different mailman provider will fix this issue. The suggestion is made to move the list, and one month is deemed a reasonable timeframe to do so. The new list can be set up to allow subscriptions but kept moderated until the cut, with lots of warnings sent out before unmoderating one and moderating the other. This presents an opportunity to hardfork something in Bitcoin without risk of breakage or losses. There is also mention of the possibility of downloading mbox archives of the list from SF and importing them to maintain archive consistency. The user documentation for Mailman 3 seems to be lacking, and there is some controversy surrounding Google Groups as an alternative mailing list option.</summary>
