    <summary>In an email exchange on June 6, 2015 at 8:05 AM, Kalle Rosenbaum expressed openness to changes. One suggestion made was to eliminate real outputs as they are redundant due to the txid being referenced. It was suggested that the proof script, which should be invalid, begin with a magic constant and include space for future expansion. This would make Proof of Potential (PoP) easy to identify and extend.</summary>
