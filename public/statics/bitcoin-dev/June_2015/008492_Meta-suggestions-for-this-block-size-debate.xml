    <summary>The email chain reveals a discussion about a git repo to avoid exclusive-by-default wiki policies. Pindar Wong provides the link to the github repository, but mentions that he doesn't have a low-level understanding of the code and does not feel qualified to sort through valid information. Gabe Appleton plans to resume work on the debate and suggests throwing it on /r/Bitcoin for public comment. Ethan Heilman requests a summary of the various positions and arguments in the block size debate, and Mats Henricson urges posters to read up on the topic and suggest helpful alternatives. The conversation also touches on issues such as testnet4 using 8mb blocks, bitcoin XT's role in the scheme of things, and the need for a wiki page to condense information.</summary>
