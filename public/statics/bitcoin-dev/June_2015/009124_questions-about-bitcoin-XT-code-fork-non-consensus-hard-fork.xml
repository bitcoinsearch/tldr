    <summary>In an email discussion on the regulatory question of Bitcoin, Pindar Wong suggests that any change in blocksize needs to involve all Bitcoin holders. He agrees that miners are important, but also highlights the need to consider other participants who invest time and effort in making Bitcoin work. Wong mentions that the Cyberport in Hong Kong is available for use on October 14th and 15th, and proposes a technical meeting to discuss BIP100, 101, and more. The Cyberport previously hosted last year's Global Bitcoin Summit, which featured the participation of many of China's leading Bitcoin-related companies. It is unclear whether the technical meeting proposed by Wong would take place before or after the October event.</summary>
