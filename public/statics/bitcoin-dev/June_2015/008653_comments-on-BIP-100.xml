    <summary>The conversation is about the concern that few in the industry are taking development initiatives or integrating libraries. However, this statement is countered by the fact that there are people who have built more scalable wallets and initiated projects like Lightning, such as StrawPay, which were ignored by Blockstream. The concern was also raised about the need to expose companies to the back-pressure implied by an O(n^2) scaling protocol instead of immediately increasing the block size to levels that are dangerous for decentralisation security. The idea of breaking the current software ecosystem to force people into a new fictional system that bears little resemblance to the Bitcoin we use today was also mentioned. It was suggested that raising the block size limit might be the only possible path left since nothing that has been proposed so far has much chance of actual deployment any time soon, which is why there will soon be a fork that does it. However, some argue that scrapping virtually the entire existing investment in software, wallets, and tools could be a costly move.</summary>
