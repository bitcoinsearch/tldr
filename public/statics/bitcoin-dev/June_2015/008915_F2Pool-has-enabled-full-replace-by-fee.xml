    <summary>Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, responds to a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the safety of retail transactions made with Bitcoin. He suggests that what retail needs are escrowed microchannel hubs (like the Lightning Network) that enable untrusted instant payments, rather than relying on single-signer zeroconf transactions that cannot be made safe. While they do not need to be cryptographically safe, such payments should be reasonably secure in practice and safer than credit card payments that can be charged back. The discussion also touches on the issue of double-spending and the need for mutual trust between co-signers to guarantee the irreversibility of a transaction.</summary>
