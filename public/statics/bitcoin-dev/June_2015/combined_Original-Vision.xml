    <summary>The debate surrounding Bitcoin's growth goes beyond block size or hard-forks; it is about the nature of Bitcoin itself. The incentive for running a full network node was to enable mining, with the rewards from new coins and transaction fees being the primary motivation. However, the original author intended organizations operating such nodes to provide connectivity to light clients, which would make up the majority of the user base.Currently, SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients are fundamentally flawed, and fraud proofs are believed to be practical, but no design that is both efficient and secure has been proposed and implemented.The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list from June 27, 2015, discussed the efficiency and security of fraud proofs. Eric Lombrozo clarified that fraud proofs do not have to be made super efficient, but they must be secure. He suggested creating a market for them to align incentives, making the scheme practical as very few fraud proofs ever need to be executed. However, he acknowledged that no efficient and secure design for fraud proofs had been proposed yet.Patrick Strateman argued that Satoshi believed fraud proofs would be widely available and practical, bringing SPV client security much closer to full node security than it is today. The email thread also touched upon the original author's intent behind running a full network node, enabling mining and providing rewards, and how it could benefit the user base. In an email exchange, Mark Friedenbach suggested using UTXO commitments to commit the validator state in each block, allowing for proving negatives by referencing the state commitment. However, maintaining a hash tree commitment over the validator state is expensive and may limit block validation speed.Another participant in the email thread suggested using a TXO and STXO O(1)-append commitment, which could scale better but may not be as efficient in some respects. Overall, while fraud proofs could bring SPV client security closer to full node security, no efficient and secure design for them has been proposed yet. However, the security concern of fraudulent blocks may be mitigated by peering with trusted nodes or consulting other nodes for serious transactions.The growth of Bitcoin and its user base is intricately tied to the incentives for running a full network node and providing connectivity to light clients, as envisioned by its original author. The global decentralized consensus was meant to make the network resilient to a single government or other adversary's ability to shut it down. However, the security concern that a newly announced block may not actually reflect a valid block in an attempt to defraud the light client could be mitigated by the light client peering with a node it trusts.The email thread on bitcoin-dev mailing list from June 27, 2015, discussed the efficiency and security of fraud proofs. Eric Lombrozo clarified that SPV is currently fundamentally flawed, while Patrick Strateman pointed out that fraud proofs need to be more efficient than full node validation, which they currently are not. No design for fraud proofs which is both efficient and secure has been proposed yet. The article also discusses the comparison between UTXO and TXO/STXO trees with respect to their complexity and scalability. Overall, revisiting the original author's design and scaling intentions can be helpful in moving forward together as a community.The email thread also discusses the debate about block size and hard-forks in Bitcoin, with some suggesting limiting the growth of the blockchain and having fees that reflect the costs of having large numbers of people validating, storing, and serving transactions to allow hobbyists with limited resources and connectivity to run full nodes. And Lombrozo discuss potential optimizations for future protocols related to Bitcoin, and Lombrozo suggests that producing a market for fraud-proof solutions is crucial. However, no design for fraud proofs that is both efficient and secure has been proposed, much less implemented or deployed. It appears clear that the original author intended organizations operating full network nodes to provide connectivity to light clients, which would make up the majority of the user base. Some amount of localized trust may be necessary, as having the system entirely decentralized and trustless for every client does not appear to be the original design goal.</summary>
