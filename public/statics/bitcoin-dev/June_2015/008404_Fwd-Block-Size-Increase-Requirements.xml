    <summary>In an email conversation between two individuals, Mike Hearn suggests that if miners in China cannot overcome their internet situation and compete with other miners, it's tough luck for them. He suggests that they can always run a node on a server in Taiwan and connect the hardware to it via a VPN. Chun Wang responds by calling him ignorant and stating that Western miners will suffer from higher orphans if they do not find a China-based VPN into China or improve their connectivity to China. The conversation is related to the engineering challenges facing Bitcoin and the need for everyone to focus on solid engineering to make Bitcoin succeed.</summary>
