    <summary>On June 19, 2015, Peter Todd discussed the brokenness of zeroconf and the measures that services have to take to avoid getting ripped off. He also mentioned the poor job that wallets do in showing whether or not a transaction is secure for the average user. However, Jeff Garzik emphasized that this is not an excuse to further degrade the overall network security. He acknowledged that there are many issues to address in the bitcoin ecosystem, and implementing "scorched earth" replace-by-fee would negatively impact users. Garzik also warned that outright attacks on zero conf would only degrade user security even further. As a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Garzik has a deep understanding of the challenges facing the Bitcoin community.</summary>
