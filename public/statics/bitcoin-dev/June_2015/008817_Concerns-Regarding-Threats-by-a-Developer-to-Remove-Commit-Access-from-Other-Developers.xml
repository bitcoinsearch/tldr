    <summary>The discussion regarding the block size limit of Bitcoin was started by Matt Corallo, who expressed his opinion against raising the limit at this time. Matt Whitlock also supported this position, stating that even if the limit should be increased in the future, now is not the best time to do it. Meanwhile, Ross Nicoll believed that inaction could potentially harm Bitcoin. However, Whitlock questioned who was proposing inaction, as the debate has been about how and when to increase the limit, rather than whether to take action or not. The debate continues on the mailing list, with some arguing for immediate action and others advocating for further discussion before any changes are made.</summary>
