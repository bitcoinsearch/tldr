    <summary>The email thread starts with Aaron Voisine questioning the decision to proceed with the XT fork. He suggests that increasing the block size limit is not a good option, and instead, the non-consensus code should be improved to handle full blocks more gracefully. He suggests several improvements such as fee estimation code, overhauling the block creation and mempool limiting code and integrating CPFP and RBF into transaction processing to handle edge cases where a priori fee estimation fails. Brian Hoffman asks who is planning to move to Bitcoin-XT if this happens, to which Faiz Khan responds that he is puzzled by the response and Adam's serious concerns have not been addressed. Bryan Bishop advises Mike Hearn to evaluate both messages and source code more carefully, especially in the world of bitcoin. The email thread ends with no clear consensus on whether to proceed with the XT fork or other alternatives.</summary>
