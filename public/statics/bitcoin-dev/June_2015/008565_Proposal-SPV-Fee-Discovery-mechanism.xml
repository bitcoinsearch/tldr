    <title>Proposal: SPV Fee Discovery mechanism</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around implementing a mechanism to allow SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients to rely on fee and other statistics. The proposal suggests encoding such information in an op_return output within the coinbase transaction and agreeing on a data format, which could later be enforced with a soft fork. However, until that time, SPV clients should not rely on this encoding since it can be fabricated by individual miners. The discussion also addresses the risk of Sybil attacks where malicious p2p nodes could lie about mempool data. For up-to-the-minute fee calculations, services like blockcypher are currently used, but they are susceptible to compromise. The proposed feature would allow wallets to rely on an API for timely stats verified through SPV verification of fee stats for confirmed blocks. The implementation of such a mechanism is valuable regardless of the outcome of the blocksize debate and would allow SPV clients to have PoW-backed assurances as all other header data.</summary>
