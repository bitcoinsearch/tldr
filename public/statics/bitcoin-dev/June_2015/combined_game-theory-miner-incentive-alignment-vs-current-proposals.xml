    <summary>In the world of Bitcoin, the interests of miners and users are not always aligned. While miners profit from transaction fees, users prioritize security, decentralization, and low fees. As a result, proposals such as Jeff's BIP, Greg Maxwell's flexcap, and Gavin's proposal need to be analyzed for their ability to hold up under attack scenarios and whether they prioritize user interests or miner game theory. One concern with these proposals is that close-knit groups of miners may attempt to create big blocks that disadvantage other miners, or keep blocks small to extract switching-cost fees from users. Jeff's proposal has a cost-free miner vote for cap increase with a threshold, but it is vulnerable to an advantaged minority forcing the block to stay small to extract switching-cost fees from users. Therefore, the robustness of proposals needs to be evaluated based on their ability to enforce user interests versus miner game-theory attacks or collusion scenarios.Moreover, there is also the issue of ramping up storage and bandwidth before transitioning to 8MB blocks. It is important to avoid outright replacing existing test data in favor of adding spam transactions on top of existing transactions. Overall, it is essential to consider all of these factors when evaluating proposals for changes to the Bitcoin network.</summary>
