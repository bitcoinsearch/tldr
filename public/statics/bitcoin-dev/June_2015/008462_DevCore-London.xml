    <summary>Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer, announced that the tutorial talk he gave at DevCore 2015 on "How to build a timestamping smart contracts app in 30 minutes" is now available on the website. The tutorial covers how to customize the wallet-template app for this use case, how to construct a complex multi-stage SPV proof of blockchain inclusion, how to save and then verify proof files, how to bind transaction confidence state to the user interface, and how to create a Mac DMG bundle with a custom icon. In addition, Hearn informed about an upcoming event called DevCore London where he and other developers will be present to run a hackathon/workshop type event. Hearn's "talk" will actually be a live coding event where he will write a decentralized cross-platform Tor supporting document timestamping app using OP_RETURN outputs and has a nice GUI in just 30 minutes on stage.</summary>
