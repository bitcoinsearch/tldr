    <summary>The email conversation discusses various aspects of the Bitcoin XT proposal, including the release of a BIP for review, handling feedback and suggestions from reviewers, dealing with the risks of non-consensus hard-forks, maintaining bitcoin-XT, and contingency plans in case of a failed hard-fork. The sender expresses concerns about the lack of consensus and the financial implications of a unilateral fork without wide-scale agreement from the technical and business communities. The receiver argues that the consensus exists among major players in the ecosystem and that the debate has been ongoing for years. The email ends with a call for scaling Bitcoin by letting it grow and tackling bottlenecks as they arise.</summary>
