    <summary>In this message, Peter Todd discusses the issue of double-spending in Bitcoin transactions. He explains that if two transactions spend the same inputs and have completely different output scripts, it is considered fraudulent. However, if one transaction has an identical output script to another but with a reduced value, it appears to be honest dealing. Todd notes that adding outputs to a transaction without changing existing ones is another way to increase the transaction fee. Regarding Bitcoin XT, which relays double-spends, Todd states he has not closely looked into its features and hopes it never becomes relevant. He believes that every signed Bitcoin transaction sent between different parties is part of a valid, enforceable contract. Thus, handling contracts and money is serious business and software should not respond to double spends frivolously.</summary>
