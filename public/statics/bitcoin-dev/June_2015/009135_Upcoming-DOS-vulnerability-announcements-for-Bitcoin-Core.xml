    <summary>On July 7th, details of serious denial of service vulnerabilities that have been fixed in recent versions of Bitcoin Core will be made public. This includes CVE-2015-3641. It is highly recommended for anyone running production nodes that are exposed to inbound connections from the internet to upgrade to version 0.10.2 as soon as possible.Upgrading older systems, particularly miners, is crucial due to the upcoming enforcing status of BIP66 soft-fork. For more information on this matter, please refer to: http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34199290/</summary>
