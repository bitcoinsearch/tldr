    <summary>Eric Lombrozo suggests the need for a voting system for metaconsensus but also implies that the problem should be looked at more generally. He goes on to say that false choices do not help. Jeff Garzik asks what the alternative would be, suggesting having a Chief Scientist or Technical Advisory Board choose what is a proper fee, level of decentralization and growth factor. Lombrozo responds with concerns over BIP100 having direct economic consequences, particularly for miners, and it lending itself to greater corruptibility.</summary>
