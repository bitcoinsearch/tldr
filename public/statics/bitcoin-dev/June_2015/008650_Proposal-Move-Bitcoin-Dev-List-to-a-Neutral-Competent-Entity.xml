    <title>Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity</title>

    <summary>The bitcoin-development mailing list hosted on SourceForge has been a topic of concern for some time, with the company's behavior and stability being increasingly questionable. Warren Togami Jr. proposed moving the list to a neutral competent entity, citing benefits such as professional maintenance and neutrality to the content. The Linux Foundation was suggested as a possible host due to their competence in supporting open source development projects. The proposal would involve migrating the current list archive to the new host's archives for user convenience. It is also suggested that the entire Bitcoin SourceForge project be deleted. While there are concerns over upsetting subscribers with mass imports, the proposal seems like a good fit for the bitcoin-dev community.</summary>
