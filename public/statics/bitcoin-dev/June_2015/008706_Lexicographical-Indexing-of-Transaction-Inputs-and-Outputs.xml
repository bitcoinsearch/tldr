    <summary>Kristov Atlas has written a draft of a BIP to standardize the sorting of transaction inputs and outputs for privacy and security reasons. He has received feedback from colleagues privately but is now looking for feedback from a wider audience before assigning a BIP number and having it accepted into https://github.com/bitcoin/bips. Rusty Russell has modified his implementation to match Kristov's proposal, which can be found at https://github.com/rustyrussell/bitcoin/tree/bip-69. The modified implementation compiles but will require testing.</summary>
