    <summary>In an email exchange on June 12, 2015, Mike Hearn questioned the slow speed of a 2 Mbit/s link between two connected entities. He compared this to the average speed of a 3G connection which is around 7-8 Mbit/sec. The context suggests that Hearn was trying to prove the existence of an effect through simulation and was concerned about the accuracy of the data due to the slow connection speed. Despite this concern, no further information is given regarding what this effect or simulation may be.</summary>
