    <summary>The debate over the block size in Bitcoin has been compared to a decision to limit planes’ wingspan to the most typical hangar door of 1940, resulting in a “controversy” that we can’t have modern planes out of fear they won’t fit into old hangars. There are concerns that if the current block size is increased, there could be potential risks to those who do not consent to it, such as double-spending possibilities due to conflicting forks. It has been suggested that a more realistic option would be to create a sidechain or altcoin with larger blocks, rather than experimenting with the current one in-flight. It is important to face reality instead of being wishful and creating false expectations.</summary>
