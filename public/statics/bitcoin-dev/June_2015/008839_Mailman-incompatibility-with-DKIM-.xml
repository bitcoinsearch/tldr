    <summary>The email conversation between Mike Hearn and Warren discusses the issue of compatibility with DKIM signing. They removed the footer because it was incompatible and are considering removing the subject tag as well. There is concern about DKIM enforcement being uncommon due to issues with mail being dropped or sent to spam folders. Suggestions are made to auto-reject DKIM enforced domain postings and any other reason for mail getting stuck in moderation queue, except for spam which may have to be silently dropped to avoid Mailman server becoming a spammer.</summary>
