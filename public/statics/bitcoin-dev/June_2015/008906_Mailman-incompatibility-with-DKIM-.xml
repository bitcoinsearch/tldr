    <summary>In an email exchange on June 19, 2015, Adam Weiss suggested a way to detect when someone posts from a domain that publishes a request for strict signature checking for all mails originating from it. By setting dmarc_moderation_action to "Munge from," the list will rewrite the envelope-from to the list's address, while adding Reply-to and setting it to the original sender. However, Jeff Garzik raised concerns that this might change reply behavior for some recipients and accidentally direct mail intended to DKIM-user + list to DKIM-user. Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist working at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
