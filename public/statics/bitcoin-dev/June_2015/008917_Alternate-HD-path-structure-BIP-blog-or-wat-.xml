    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of a new token layer on an existing blockchain. The writer suggests that using HD wallets to generate new token addresses would be a trivial task, but maintaining it could be a headache. However, using this method, an older HD wallet software can still understand what blockchain to query for utxos on the below path and generate valid BobCoin addresses without any updates even if it doesn't know about BobCoin. This approach seems valuable when developing against platforms where updates cannot be forced on clients. The writer clarifies that this is not a general-purpose successor to BIP44. Another member suggested using m/44'/9'/a'/c/i instead of having an internal mapping from 9'-&gt;0' to find out which blockchain to query.</summary>
