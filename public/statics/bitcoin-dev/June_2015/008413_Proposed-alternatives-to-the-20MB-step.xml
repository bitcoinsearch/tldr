    <summary>In an email dated 1 June 2015, Jérôme Legoupil expressed his concern over Gavin Andresen's approach to implementing a big increase in the Bitcoin-Xt project. He believes that decentralization is at the core of Bitcoin's security model and going from it to centralization is easy, but the other way around is a lot harder. He also thinks that bumping into any limit as soon as possible would be extremely healthy for the network to incentivize layer 2 and off-chain solutions to scale Bitcoin. Jérôme opposes Gavin's 20MB proposal in both content and form.</summary>
