    <summary>According to a recent message from Tier, the current network message limit is 2MB, reduced from 32MB in earlier releases. Gavin Andresen believes that keeping the consensus rules distinct from limitations of the p2p network makes sense as there are already different protocols for announcing transactions and blocks. The block will be rejected if it has a timestamp more than 2 hours in the future. There will be no impact if block timestamps are not in chronological order. As for testnet parameters, big blocks can be tested in -regtest mode with arbitrary timestamps in the past or future. However, testing maximum-8MB-blocks mined "in the past" on testnet will result in a testnet that is even more useless for ordinary testing of products or services being developed. Regarding scraping together money to run a few hundred full-load full-nodes, Gavin Andresen believes that hardware is cheap, but people are expensive. Most companies are busy trying to stay in business by attracting customers to their products or services. In his experience, tackling problems as they occur is the way to be successful scaling up.</summary>
