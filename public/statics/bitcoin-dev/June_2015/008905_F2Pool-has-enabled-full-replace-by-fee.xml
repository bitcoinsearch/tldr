    <summary>In a message sent by Adrian Macneil on June 19, 2015, he stated that the adoption of full-RBF could potentially harm Bitcoin adoption. This is because it would reduce or even remove the ability for online or point-of-sale (POS) merchants to accept Bitcoin payments. However, retail POS merchants should not be accepting vanilla Bitcoin payments as they do not guarantee the irreversibility of a transaction until it has been buried several blocks deep in the chain. Therefore, retail merchants should require a co-signature from a mutually trusted co-signer who vows never to sign a double-spend. Although zero-conf transactions have been irreversible "enough" up to this point, this was only a fortunate coincidence and should not be relied upon.</summary>
