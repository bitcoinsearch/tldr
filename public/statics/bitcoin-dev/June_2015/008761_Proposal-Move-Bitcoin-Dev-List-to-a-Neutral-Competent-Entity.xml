    <summary>The author of the given context emphasizes the importance of using an open-source platform like Mailman, instead of GoogleGroups, that can be easily moved around from one place to another. The author also highlights the cons of third-party archives such as their web interfaces being bloated, non-offline capable or authoritative, and not exportable. The author suggests making the raw archives downloadable in mbox format with full unobfuscated headers for threading and replying, along with signatures and attachments. This would enable newcomers to seed their own MUA's and archives, mirrors, search, etc.In addition, the author suggests getting rid of the tag in the subject, which wastes valuable space, and mail filters work just the same without it. The author discourages the use of forums due to their lack of bidirectional real-time message copying between list and forum. The author advises the need for exports of their message database.Finally, the author poses a question on when will the crypto P2P communities develop and use distributed messaging systems like bitmessage, blockchain, etc., to avoid old centralized issues. The author suggests disruptive tech is the new good and at some point, people have to start running clients and come to you instead.</summary>
