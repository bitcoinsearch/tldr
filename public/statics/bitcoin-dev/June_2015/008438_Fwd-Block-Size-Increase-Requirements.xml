    <summary>In an email exchange between Warren Togami Jr. and Mike Hearn, the topic of miners in China and their ability to mine was discussed. Hearn suggested that if Chinese miners couldn't get the necessary bandwidth through their firewall, they should be outcompeted and forced to stop mining. Togami responded with what he thought was obvious sarcasm, reversing Hearn's language to highlight how insensitive his statement was. However, some people misunderstood Togami's post, prompting him to suggest using "/s" to indicate sarcasm. A third party, Thy Shizzle, expressed agreement with Togami's sentiment but criticized the idea of dis incentivizing mining. They suggested that instead of creating a message that says "fuck you" to companies invested in farms of ASICS, the community should find a way to decentralize mining without hurting miners.</summary>
