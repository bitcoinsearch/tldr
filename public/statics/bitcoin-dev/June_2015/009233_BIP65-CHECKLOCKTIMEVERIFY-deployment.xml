    <summary>On June 25th, 2015, Peter Todd wrote on a Bitcoin Github thread about his plan to deploy CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY via the IsSuperMajority() mechanism. He opened a pull request which was considered the final step towards CLTV deployment on mainnet. Todd copied the logic and tests from the previous BIP66 (DERSIG) soft-fork line-by-line for ease of review, noting that any code review applicable to BIP66 should be applicable to BIP65. Once merged, he prepared a backport of the soft-fork logic for the v0.10.x branch as well.</summary>
