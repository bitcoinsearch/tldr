    <summary>In an email conversation, Benjamin raises concerns about the quality of service in bidding for blockchain transactions. Peter Todd responds by stating that many markets lack assured quality of service and transparency in bids, using financial and commodity markets as examples. Benjamin argues that market demand and supply settle through auctions with increasing increments. He also suggests that adapting supply would help resolve capacity problems. Peter Todd counters by asserting that bids in markets change based on the agreed prices, and production changes based on prices as well. He adds that blockchains have an inherent weakness in that there is no way to add computational supply, unlike scaling web services with AWS.</summary>
