    <summary>In a discussion thread, Raystonn raised concerns that there is no memory pool cap currently in the Bitcoin Core. However, Peter Todd replied that existing mempool implementation does not remove transactions and transactions can only be removed through mining, double-spending or node restarting. The protection against this issue is access to a lot of bitcoins to pay enough fees. While the solution is to cap the size of the mempool, it breaks zeroconf security, which can prevent reasonable fee transactions from propagating. Consequently, fixing this issue is necessary.</summary>
