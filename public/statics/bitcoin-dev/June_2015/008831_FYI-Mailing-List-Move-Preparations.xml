    <title>FYI - Mailing List Move Preparations</title>

    <summary>On June 18, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. announced in #bitcoin-dev that a switchover would occur soon for the mailing list. The decision was made not to link the old and new lists during the transition period but to announce the switchover shortly, after which all posts to the old list will be rejected with a message telling them where to find the new list. The proposed switchover would take place on June 23, 2015, and an exact scheduled time for the move would be known probably the next day. At the time of the switchover, the old list would reject all messages, archives would be exported and imported into the new list server, then the new list would be opened. The new list can be subscribed to at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev. Test posts can also be made as configuration options were being tested to fix some long-standing spam filter-related issues. Any posts to the new list before the final switchover would be wiped from the archives. If anyone has opinions about this, they could join Freenode #bitcoin-dev and talk to Warren. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, signed off the email.</summary>
