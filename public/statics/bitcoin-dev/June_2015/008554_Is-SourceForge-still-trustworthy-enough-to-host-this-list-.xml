    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Andy Schroder, Todd asked about the issue of digital signatures being broken on messages due to slight modifications made by the list server. Schroder explained that it was likely PGP/MIME signatures that were not working correctly. He also provided his email headers, which revealed that he was using Mozilla Thunderbird with Enigmail version 1.6. The email included a non-text attachment named "signature.asc" which was described as an OpenPGP digital signature with a size of 555 bytes.</summary>
