    <summary>This context is an email chain discussing a debate on the block size of Bitcoin. The participants are Pindar Wong, Gabe Appleton, and Mats Henricson. They discuss creating a wiki page to condense the information, and Wong shares a GitHub link for the debate. Appleton requests that they use the original forked version made by Ethan Heilman, as he doesn't have a deep enough understanding of the subject. Wong agrees and shares a new GitHub link accessible via VPN. They plan to throw the debate on /r/Bitcoin for more public comments soon. Mats suggests that posters should read up on all the information before rehashing what others have already said.</summary>
