    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Will, the topic of block size was discussed. Will suggested that making the lazy miners' default choice grow at the hard cap growth rate would solve any problems regarding voting. However, Andresen believed that changing the default 'target' block size to the average of the size of the last N blocks would have more benefits. This change would be policy-neutral and allow miners to drive block size up or down, while also creating a healthy "fee pressure" on the system if there are a significant proportion of lazy miners going with defaults.</summary>
