    <summary>In an email exchange on June 16, 2015, Kalle Rosenbaum discusses the importance of merchants ensuring that they only accept a proof of possession (PoP) provided as a response to their challenge. Tom Harding questions whether it will be difficult to explain to merchants that they must check the nonce in the PoP so that it matches the nonce in the PoP request. However, Kalle clarifies that he meant Tom had thought out the process in detail and standardized a latent capability of the cryptosystem, which would be very powerful for certain users.</summary>
