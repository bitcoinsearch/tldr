    <title>Mailman incompatibility with DKIM ...</title>

    <summary>It has been reported that both the sender and recipient of an email experienced their mail being sent to Gmail's spam folder due to DKIM. The sender is concerned that DKIM may be too fragile and not compatible with mailing lists. In order to address this, the footer has been removed as it was incompatible with DKIM signing. However, keeping the "[Bitcoin-dev]" prepend tag in the subject is only compatible with DKIM header signing if the poster manually adds it in their subject header. The sender is also worried that removing the subject tag might make DKIM enforcement work better but could lead to confusion among subscribers. The lack of Mailman footer may also make it difficult for subscribers to unsubscribe or access archives. Therefore, the sender seeks opinions on how to proceed. Arthur suggests manually adding "[Bitcoin-dev]" to the beginning of the subject to address the issue.</summary>
