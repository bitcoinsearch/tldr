    <summary>Mailman, a popular mailing list management software, does not currently sign emails with DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to take responsibility for the mail itself. However, DKIM signing is highly recommended as it helps spam filters identify the 'owner' of the mail. Other heuristics are used as a fallback by spam filters if DKIM is not used, but they can be unreliable. Mailing lists that edit people's emails do resign, such as the bitcoinj list. Removing subject tags and footers may be acceptable if there is no other choice, as email clients can still extract information from the headers and unsubscribe instructions are often included in them. Gmail is capable of using these headers programmatically.</summary>
