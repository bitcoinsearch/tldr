    <summary>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the undefined and unwritten portion of the BIP process. The question is who should get to vote on approval to commit a BIP implementation into Bitcoin Core. However, the lead developer, Wladimir, does not want to be a "decider" as he prefers not to decide on consensus changes or protocol changes which are different from merging patches and improving the code. The reason being that in case some users fork the blockchain and change consensus rules, they are not just harming themselves, but also affecting all the users, since such a thing would have strong impact over the BTC/FIAT rate, affecting everyone in the ecosystem. Some smart suggestions were made on this mail list for consensus changes which can be made during a long period of time through soft forks where all users/miners/exchangers/merchants get the chance to choose/take action.</summary>
