    <summary>The discussion revolves around Peter's proposal where only the votes in blocks are counted, not transaction votes. Miners get to vote but exclude counter-voting transactions at the risk of losing money. Garbage transactions are not a problem. Users who want to cast a vote "pay" for it by increased confirmation time. Mark Friedenbach expresses concerns over miner influence on the vote by generating transactions that agree with their own blocks. However, Matt Whitlock argues that miners filling their blocks with garbage transactions would not bring real income as they would be paying their own money as fees to themselves. To earn real income, miners would have to vote in accordance with real users.</summary>
