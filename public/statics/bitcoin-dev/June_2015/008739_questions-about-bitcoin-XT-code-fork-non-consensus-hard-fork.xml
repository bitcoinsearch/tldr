    <summary>On June 16, 2015, a discussion took place between Peter Todd, Pindar Wong, and Adam Back regarding arranging an initial open summit to meet with representatives of the Chinese miners in Hong Kong to facilitate a better understanding between different stakeholders of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This could be arranged for October or earlier if deemed necessary. Coordination with the blockchain-tech conference held by Constance Choi and Primavera De Filippi in Hong Kong on October 14-15 could be useful as it attracts audiences of people looking to use blockchain technology in general. Remote online participation would be welcome from those who might not be able to attend in person, but the meeting would be primarily document-driven to facilitate orderly translation, discussion, and decision. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority considers bitcoin a virtual 'commodity' and not a currency per se. It was also noted that regulatory issues and interaction with governments on regulation of blockchain technology and its potential threats to usage of the technology need to be taken into account in any blocksize discussion.</summary>
