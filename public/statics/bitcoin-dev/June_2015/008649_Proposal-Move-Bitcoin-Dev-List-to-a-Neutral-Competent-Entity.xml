    <title>Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin developers are considering moving the Bitcoin-dev mailing list from SourceForge to an alternative host. The move is in response to concerns over SourceForge's perceived stability and questionable behaviour, which have been growing since November 2013 when GIMP dumped SourceForge over dodgy ads and installer. More recently, SourceForge hijacked nmap's old site and downloads.  The proposal is to move the list to a neutral and competent entity, but Google Groups has been deemed too controversial within the community. One suggestion has been for the Linux Foundation (LF) to host the list, as they already host various open source infrastructure discussion lists. From the perspective of the community, the LF has zero stake and would be a competent, neutral place to host the dev list long-term. To be clear, this proposal is only about hosting the discussion list; the LF would have no control over the Bitcoin Project.</summary>
