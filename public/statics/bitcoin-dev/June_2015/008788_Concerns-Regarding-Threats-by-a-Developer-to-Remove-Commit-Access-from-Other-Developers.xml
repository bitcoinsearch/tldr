    <summary>In this email exchange, Mike Hearn expresses his concern about the current process of decision-making in Bitcoin Core and emphasizes the need for a clear process that cannot be manipulated. Wladimir responds by clarifying that he is only the Decider for code issues related to Bitcoin Core, not consensus issues which involve multiple implementations. He also reminds Mike of the BIP process, which can be used to propose improvements if it is not clear enough. The email includes a link to the BIP process document, as well as a PGP signature at the end for security purposes.</summary>
