    <summary>In an email exchange, Mark Friedenbach discussed the use of UTXO commitments to commit the validator state in each block. This would allow for proving negatives by referencing the state commitment. However, maintaining a hash tree commitment over the validator state is expensive and requires 15-22x more I/O during block validation. This can limit block validation speed. Friedenbach suggests that if one wants this commitment scheme for fraud proofs, then they should argue for a block size limit decrease (to 500kB), rather than increase.Another participant in the email thread suggested using a TXO and STXO O(1)-append commitment, which wouldn't cause as much overhead and could scale better. However, it may not be as efficient in some respects.</summary>
