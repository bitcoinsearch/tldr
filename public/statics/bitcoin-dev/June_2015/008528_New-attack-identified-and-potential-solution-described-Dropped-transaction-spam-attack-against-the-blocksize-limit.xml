    <summary>The discussion revolves around the blocksize limit of Bitcoin and its impact on the network's bandwidth and consensus. Raystonn argues that bandwidth is unique to every individual, while the block size limit is dictated for everyone. He believes that without a block size limit, spammers will flood the network with transactions until they run out of money. Meanwhile, everyone would jump on board trying to mine the blocks to collect fees from the spammers, leading to Bitcoin's growth. However, Peter Todd counters that argument by saying that if the bandwidth consumed by those transactions was sufficiently high, the network would collapse because consensus would fail. Peter Todd also points out that an attacker flooding the network with transactions with a block size limit can keep their fees high enough that only 1% of transactions coming from real end-users go through. This would make Bitcoin unusable, leading to a decline in the BTCUSD market and making it easier to pay transaction fees to keep real transactions out of blocks. However, he calculates that the maximum transaction fee in such an attack would be around $2.5 USD/tx, which is not high enough to make Bitcoin non-viable. He cites his personal experience of being able to afford fees like that for about 90% of his transactions this year. In conclusion, the block size limit determines the minimum bandwidth required to stay in consensus. While there are concerns about the possibility of attackers flooding the network with transactions, Peter Todd argues that the impact would not be severe enough to render Bitcoin non-viable.</summary>
