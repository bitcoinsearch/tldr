    <summary>The BIP process, which is used to propose and implement changes to Bitcoin Core, has an undefined portion that needs to be discussed. This pertains to the approval of a BIP implementation. The question raised is who should get to vote on this matter. A simple majority might not be sufficient for approval, so there is a need to determine what should be the appropriate percentage. This discussion is essential because the decision made will affect the future of Bitcoin. Raystonn initiated this discussion to encourage a civil discourse on this topic. Their objective is to come up with a solution that will benefit the community as a whole. It is important to note that the BIP process is crucial in ensuring that any changes made to Bitcoin Core are well thought out and agreed upon by the community before implementation. This discussion highlights the importance of collaboration and communication within the Bitcoin community. It also emphasizes the significance of considering all perspectives before making a decision. Through this discourse, a consensus can be reached that benefits the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
