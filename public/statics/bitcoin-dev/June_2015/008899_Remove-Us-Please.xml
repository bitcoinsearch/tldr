    <summary>In an email sent on June 19, 2015, Gigas Gaming Inc. requested to be removed from the Bitcoin-development mailing list. They claimed that the list had become a chatroom and was interfering with official company business. The email included a link to unsubscribe from the list, which is included at the bottom of every email. This request was made to the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge.</summary>
