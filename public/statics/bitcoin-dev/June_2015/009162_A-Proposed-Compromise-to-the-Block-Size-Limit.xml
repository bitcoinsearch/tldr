    <summary>In this message, Michael Naber proposed raising the block size to a static 8MB with a plan to increase it further if needed. However, the recipient of the message argued that it is not a reasonable path forward due to lack of testing with 8MB+ blocks and other problems. To make this proposal appear more reasonable, the recipient suggested setting up an 8MB testnet with two years of 8MB blocks in history and a large UTXO set to test performance characteristics. The recipient noted that such a testnet would require an 840GB download. The message includes a PGP signature for authentication.</summary>
