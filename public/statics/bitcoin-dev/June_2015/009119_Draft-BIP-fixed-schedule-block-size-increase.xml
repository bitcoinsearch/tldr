    <summary>Moving averages are compared to fixed growth and have their advantages and disadvantages. They are backwards looking and do not handle seasonalities or unanticipated increases in demand, such as Black Friday or the Bitcoin market hysteria. Adjustments for fee pressure would need to be frequent and nimble enough to handle these outliers. Gavin Andresen suggested changing the default 'target' block size from the current fixed 750K to the average of the size of the last N blocks, which would be policy-neutral and give the system a healthy "fee pressure." The change would allow miners to drive block size up or down, and if there are a significant proportion of lazy miners going with defaults, it would encourage more fee pressure in the system.</summary>
