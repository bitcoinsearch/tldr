    <summary>In an email exchange on June 30, 2015, Adam Back suggested the deployment of full-RBF in an opt-in way and leaving the current default miner &amp; relay policies as they are. This would allow for a smoother transition away from zeroconf assumptions towards greenaddress (trust based) and lightning/payment channel solutions. Back believes that abruptly stopping the first-seen miner &amp; relay policy is risky and unpopular and could lead to bad trends for fungibility. He warns about large centralized startups such as Coinbase getting hashing power contracts and sybil attacking the network. To prevent this, he suggests acting sooner rather than later in adopting full-RBF. Back also points out that some types of payments are generally high trust or have very low marginal costs and it is not their job to kill these businesses. Instead, they should focus on improving network security through trust via greenaddress or without trust via the hub &amp; channel model. Back suggests using nSequence for opting-in full-RBF and defining non-maxint nSequence as allowing RBF.</summary>
