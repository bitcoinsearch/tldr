    <summary>A proposal to implement a HashCash spam filter has been made for the mailing list. The proposal requires several people with Linux admin experience to agree to host live mirrors of the list, which could be switched over by whomever controls the relevant MX records for the mail list. The sponsor of the proposal suggests that a reasonable per-message fee should be agreed upon for the independent admins hosting the list. He suggests that those who have contributed more than 10 or 15 commits to Bitcoin's GitHub repository should be excluded from the pay-with-bitcoin filter, as they have paid with code. The rest of the community should pay to distribute and archive their efforts. In response to changing the e-mail list provider, Wladimir J. van der Laan stated he has no opinion on the matter of moving the mailing list. All downloads of Bitcoin Core have recently been removed from SourceForge for security concerns. Finally, Troy Benjegerdes advises not to pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel nor try to buy a hacker who makes money by the megahash.</summary>
