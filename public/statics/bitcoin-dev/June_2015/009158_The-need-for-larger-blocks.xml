    <summary>In a discussion about software changes regarding the Bitcoin network, Wladimir, a developer, explains that to make any changes, the entire network must agree to switch to the new software. He further clarifies that individuals can change their client to whatever they want and switch with others who also want a change. However, if a split occurs, it will lead to confusion and a decrease in value. Wladimir strongly suggests that such a situation should not happen.</summary>
