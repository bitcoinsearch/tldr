    <summary>In October 2014, Gigas Gaming Inc. announced that it was launching its own cryptocurrency and had hired an expert to do some of the coding for the project by October 14, 2015. The company had previously built a cryptocurrency called GigasCorpCoin for testing purposes, and through this process, had identified an underlying problem with Bitcoin that it aimed to solve. However, the company's President refused to be interviewed about the secretive project due to the amount of work that still needed to be done.In June 2015, Gigas Gaming Inc. responded to an email from Jameson Lopp, a member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list, requesting that their email be removed from the list as they believed it had become more of a chatroom and was interfering with official company business. The message from Gigas Gaming Inc. emphasized the importance of the project and the need for confidentiality. Despite this request, the company continued to develop its cryptocurrency in secret.</summary>
