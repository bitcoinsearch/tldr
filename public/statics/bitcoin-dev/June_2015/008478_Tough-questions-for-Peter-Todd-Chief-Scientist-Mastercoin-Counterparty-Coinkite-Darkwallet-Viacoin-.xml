    <summary>The email thread between Mark Friedenbach and Sven Berg discusses the involvement of Todd in "shady projects" and his refusal to answer reasonable questions about his involvement in these scams and failures elsewhere. Berg Investigations LLC believes that the community deserves answers when someone so prominent is involved in so many shady projects with huge losses, most recently, the failure of DarkWallet. However, Braun Brelin responded to these inquiries by asking if they were federal or state prosecutors, involved with law enforcement, or involved in a civil suit against Mr. Todd before telling them to "F*** off."</summary>
