    <title>Mailman incompatibility with DKIM ...</title>

    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn expressed his displeasure with the need to remove subject tags and footers from the new mailing list for compatibility with DKIM users. He also noted that lists can do what are effectively MITM attacks on people's messages in any way they like if they resign for the messages themselves. The question arises whether Mailman should be resigning it and if other mailing list software does. DKIM, which is used by most mail on the internet, is enforced using DMARC rules that publish in DNS statements like "All mail from bitpay.com is signed correctly so trash any that isn't." These rules are understood and enforced by all major webmail providers including Gmail. However, rusty geek infrastructure has problems with this, and DKIM/DMARC users have issues dealing with Mailman. LKML does not modify the subject or add a footer, perhaps because it would make it incompatible with DKIM of the several big corporate domains who participate. It is acceptable for us to remove subject tags and footers if there is no choice.</summary>
