    <summary>In an email dated June 22, 2015, Gavin Andresen outlined the maximum size of Bitcoin blocks. According to Andresen, the maximum block size would be 8 MB at a timestamp of January 11, 2016, and would double every two years until January 6, 2036, when it would reach a maximum size of 8 GB. This increase in block size would be linearly based on the block's timestamp. However, there was a concern raised about what would happen if a block following a size increase trigger is back in the past before the size increase. In this case, it was asked if that block would have a lower size restriction again. It was also suggested that using block height as a more stable number to work with would be a better solution.</summary>
