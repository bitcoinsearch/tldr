    <summary>In an email conversation on June 22, 2015, Gavin Andresen suggested that instead of complicating the code and specification with another condition, it would be better to specify that the activation date is the later of the miner supermajority and January 11th, 2016. In a follow-up email, Andresen corrected himself and stated that if activation occurred at midnight on January 11th, 2016, and the next block's timestamp was before midnight, then the next block would be limited to 1MB in size.</summary>
