    <summary>In an email conversation, Natanael pointed out that a proposal for a feature would fall to a Sybil attack and could not be secured. He argued that such a system would fail and attackers would walk away with embarrassingly large sums. However, the other person in the conversation disagreed with this assessment. They believed that checking that a node relays something is similar to banning it for relaying garbage. While acknowledging that they didn't offer a complete design and couldn't guarantee trust in nodes passing the test, they also didn't believe that the idea was as flawed as Natanael had suggested.</summary>
