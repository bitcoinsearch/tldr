    <summary>The author of the given context compares Bitcoin to Windows 3.11 in terms of backward compatibility and debates if it needs to be updated like Windows 95, XP, Pro, etc. The comparison, however, misses a key ingredient as it is impossible to run a program written on Windows 95 but for Windows 3.11 on a Windows 3.11 computer if everyone upgraded to Windows 95. This is because cross-compilers from Windows 95 to Windows 3.11 do not exist. Similarly, any coins that have post-hardfork coinbase outputs in their input tree cannot be spent on the no-change side of the fork.</summary>
