    <summary>F2Pool, the largest pool with 21% of the hashing power, enabled full replace-by-fee (RBF) support after discussions. This means that transactions that F2Pool has will be replaced if a conflicting transaction pays a higher fee. In the short term, wallet software aimed at average users has no ability to reliably detect conditions where an unconfirmed transaction may be double-spent by the sender. Additionally, SPV wallets based on bitcoinj can't even detect invalid transactions reliably and users should continue to assume that unconfirmed transactions could be trivially reversed by the sender until the first confirmation. If you use a payment processor/transaction API such as BitPay, Coinbase, BlockCypher, etc. you may or may not be accepting unconfirmed transactions, and they may or may not be "guaranteed" by your payment processor even if double-spent. Miner support of full RBF has a number of advantages to users, allowing you to more efficiently make transactions, paying lower fees.</summary>
