    <summary>In a comparison made by the author of an email in a Bitcoin mailing list, Bitcoin is compared to Windows 3.11 in terms of backward compatibility and whether or not it needs updating. However, the comparison misses a crucial aspect as it is impossible to run a program written on Windows 95 that is meant for Windows 3.11 on a Windows 3.11 computer if everyone upgrades to Windows 95. This is because there are no cross-compilers from Windows 95 to Windows 3.11. Similarly, any coins that have post-hardfork coinbase outputs in their input tree cannot be spent on the no-change side of the fork.The author questions what will happen to those who do not upgrade and have money tied up in the platform, suggesting that representatives from both sides of the issue appoint a developer representative and achieve a framework together. The writer also debates whether Bitcoin should remain as it is with better programs being developed for it or if new developments should be made that don't support older versions.</summary>
