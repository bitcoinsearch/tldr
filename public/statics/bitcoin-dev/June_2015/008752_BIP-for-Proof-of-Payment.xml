    <summary>In this conversation, Pieter Wuille and Kalle Rosenbaum discuss the compatibility of Proof of Payment (PoP) with CoinJoin, a system that combines multiple payments into a single transaction. They also discuss the limitations of PoP's nonce due to OP_RETURN output being limited to 40 bytes of data. Additionally, there is a discussion about the concept of creating an identity based on transactions, which some argue is not necessary for the receiver to know who paid but rather what was paid for. It is suggested that an extension to the payment protocol could provide a token in return for paying and knowledge of that token could be used to gain access to services provided. However, concerns are raised about the reusability and security of such tokens. The conversation concludes with potential solutions for using PoP with friends or transferring tokens to others.</summary>
