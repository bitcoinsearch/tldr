    <summary>The block size limit feature in Bitcoin has opened up a different attack, whereby spam can be used to force a transaction fee floor. If spam exceeds the block size limit long enough for transactions to be dropped from mempools, most of the spam transaction fees will never have to be paid. Meanwhile, real users will be forced to pay a fee higher than most of the spam to get their transactions confirmed. The block size limit enables this attack and needs a new fix for the large-block problem described in the first paragraph that does not suffer from the dropped-transaction spam-attack problem that is enabled by the block size limit today. The proposed solution is to add a new rule on how fees are handled. Half of every fee would be burned and disappear forever, effectively distributing the value of those bitcoins across the entire money supply. This solution would mean large blocks would cost a significant number of bitcoin to create, even when all of the transactions are created by the miner of that block. For this to work, we'd need to ensure a minimum fee is paid for most of the transactions in every block, and the new transaction fee rule is in place. However, there are several issues with this proposal. Firstly, normal users would not need to pay a higher fee as miners can ignore the spam. Secondly, if someone spams a lot of transactions to fill the memory pool, it would cost $120 every 10 minutes, and anything exceeding that may be considered "spam." There is no memory pool cap currently, but real hardware does not have an infinite amount of RAM and memory pool sizes cannot grow unbounded. Some transactions with insufficient fees do get dropped today after many hours. Moreover, it is not possible to identify which transactions are spam and which are not, let alone segregating the spam into a separate channel of transactions for inclusion on a 50/50 basis alongside other transactions. Lastly, it would certainly add quite a bit of cost and complexity on the miner's side, and you aren't going to get anything other than the simple spam that comes from the same set of addresses.</summary>
