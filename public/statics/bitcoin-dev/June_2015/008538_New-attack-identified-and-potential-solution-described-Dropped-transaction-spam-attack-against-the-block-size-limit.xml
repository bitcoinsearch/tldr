    <summary>In an email exchange from June 9, 2015, Gavin Andresen discusses the enforcement of two policies in relation to Bitcoin mining. Raystonn asks how the policies can be enforced, as a miner can adjust the size of the memory pool in their local source. Andresen responds that it doesn't have to be enforced and as long as a reasonable percentage of hash rate is following the policy, attackers will fail to prevent normal transaction traffic. He also notes that the existing default mining policy, followed by about 70% of hashpower, may be enough to cause attacks to fail in practice.</summary>
