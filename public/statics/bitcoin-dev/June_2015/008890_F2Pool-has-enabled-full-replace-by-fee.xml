    <summary>In a court case, prima facie means that the burden of proof shifts from one party to another. For example, having a federal trademark registration is prima facie evidence of those rights, though they could still be challenged. However, claiming that a prosecutor would have prima facie evidence of a crime because double spend was detected is a stretch. A discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list ensued about the definition of prima facie, with some arguing that it means the default assumption unless proven otherwise. Others argued that without any information one way or another, no assumption should be made about the fraudulence or non-fraudulence of a given double-spend.</summary>
