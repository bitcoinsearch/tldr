    <summary>In response to Mike Hearn's proposal to scale bitcoin through a unilateral hard-fork, Adam suggests that it is deeply inadvisable without wide-scale consensus from the technical and business communities. Adam raises several questions regarding the proposal, such as whether there will be a BIP for review, how the risks of non-consensus hard-forks will be dealt with, and what contingency plans are in place if the fork goes wrong. He also highlights the importance of not making technical decisions with this level of complexity and consensus risk under duress of haste. Instead, he recommends that engineering discussions center around BIPs, running code for review, simulation, and careful analysis. Adam urges everyone to work collaboratively to scale bitcoin and achieve the long-term objective.</summary>
