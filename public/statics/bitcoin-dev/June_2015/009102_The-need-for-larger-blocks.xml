    <summary>In an email conversation between Milly Bitcoin and Pieter Wuille, the two discussed the issue of increasing the size of Bitcoin. Milly believed that the size increase should be made in order to increase utility while understanding the risks. However, he noted that it would be silly to make a huge increase at once. Pieter added that people and businesses want assurance that there is a clear path and schedule to get changes accomplished when needed. The lack of a clear plan can cause anxiety for those involved. Through this exchange, Pieter felt that Milly had proved his point.</summary>
