    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Raystonn proposes a new fix for the large-block problem which creates an economic barrier to prevent people from spamming the network. He notes that prior to the block size limit, any attempt to spam the network by anyone other than someone mining their own transactions would have been economically unfeasible. However, with the block size limit in place, the beginning of a spam attack on the Bitcoin network will incur transaction fees but if spam continues at a rate exceeding the block size limit long enough for transactions to be dropped from mempools, the vast majority of spam transaction fees will never have to be paid. The proposed fix is to add a new rule on how fees are handled, where some amount of every fee should be considered as burned and can never be spent. Raystonn suggests that 50% of the fee be burned and disappear forever, effectively distributing the value of those bitcoins across the entire money supply. Half of every fee would be collected by the miner of the block as is done today. This solution would mean large blocks would cost a significant number of bitcoin to create, even when all of the transactions are created by the miner of that block.</summary>
