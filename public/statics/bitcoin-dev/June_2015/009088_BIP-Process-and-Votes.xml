    <summary>In a conversation on June 24, 2015, Raystonn asked for the process for adopting new rules in Bitcoin's consensus code. He also questioned whether this particular rule came into existence after Satoshi Nakamoto's departure and whether there was a consensus at that time. It was pointed out that many in the user community believed that Satoshi's written plans, some of which violated this new rule, would be implemented. Mark's answer to these questions was awaited. The conversation further emphasized the need to inform adversaries outside the open source ecosystem about the rules for hard forking changes. The Chinese miners were commended for working together. It was suggested that one way to assess who was trying to work towards this goal was to look at who had written concrete BIP/code and made changes in response to feedback.</summary>
