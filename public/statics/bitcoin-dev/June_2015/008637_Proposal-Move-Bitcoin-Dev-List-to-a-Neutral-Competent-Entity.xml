    <title>Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity</title>

    <summary>Many people have expressed discomfort with Sourceforge's hosting of the bitcoin-dev mailing list due to its questionable behavior and perceived instability, evidenced by past incidents such as GIMP fleeing SourceForge in 2013 over dodgy ads and installer, and SourceForge hijacking Nmap's old site and downloads in June 2015. While some have suggested Google Groups as a replacement host, it has been deemed too controversial for this community. The proposal is to move the Bitcoin Dev List to a neutral competent entity that can professionally maintain their infrastructure while being neutral to the content. Bitcoin is a global infrastructure development project where it would be politically awkward for any existing Bitcoin companies or organizations to host due to questions it would raise about perceived political control. The Linux Foundation (LF) was proposed as an alternative host and agreed to do so as OSS infrastructure dev is already within their charter, which led to the creation of sidechains-dev list there. From the perspective of the community, LF seems like a great fit as they are interested in supporting general open source development, have literally zero stake in this, and are a stable non-profit entity who will competently maintain and improve things like their Mailman deployment. The proposed action plan is to discuss this openly within the community and agree on a neutral host. The current list admins will become the new list admins, and the entire list archive will be imported into the new host's archives for user convenience. The Bitcoin Sourceforge project should be deleted as its continued existence serves no purpose and it only confuses people who find it. The toughest question would be the appropriateness of auto-importing the subscriber list to another list server, as mass imports have a tendency to upset people.</summary>
