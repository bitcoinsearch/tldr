    <summary>The email exchange discusses the differences between two methods of replacing transactions with higher fees, full replace-by-fee (RBF) and first-seen-safe RBF (FSS-RBF). The latter ensures that all outputs of the old transaction still need to be paid by the new transaction with at least as many Bitcoins. FSS-RBF is 25% cheaper than RBF and has more restrictions such as not being able to replace multiple transactions or a transaction with additional unconfirmed inputs. The controversial topic of zeroconf with regard to standard RBF is also mentioned, but FSS-RBF does not make it any safer. Peter Todd worries about the security of zeroconf and proposes using math instead of trust to secure these transactions. He updated his FSS-RBF patch on GitHub and plans to put up a bounty for anyone who can find a DoS attack in the patch.</summary>
