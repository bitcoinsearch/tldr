    <title>Welcome to the new Bitcoin Dev List</title>

    <summary>The author submitted a request for gmane to monitor and archive a new list, bitcoin-dev. They suggested that others may not need to re-request the same thing. Gmane has an HTTP/HTML archive and a newsgroup proxy that is useful for reading the archive. Additionally, gmane can subscribe the list to mail-archive.com. The old bitcoin-development list has a few months missing from its archive on gmane. However, the new list archive contains the same content as the old list. The author is seeing if they can import old archives from https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/ since it is complete. They may request that gmane delete or rename their old, incomplete archive in order to avoid confusion. There is also bitcoin-list, which may be discontinued. On gmane, it is missing the first few years of archives. The author wonders whether they should try to preserve this historical correspondence before sourceforce disappears. They suggest that mailman should allow people to change message footers and subject prefixes on a per-user basis.Warren Togami Jr. announced that the move to the new list, bitcoin-dev, was complete. The previous archive has been fully imported, and new posts will now be saved. However, the first post to this list may be delayed by 5+ minutes due to greylisting. Warren Togami Jr. also mentioned that LF will be upgrading Mailman soon to better handle posts from DKIM enforced domains. There will be a few more config tweaks like auto-rejecting non-subscribed posts. It is too dangerous to auto-reject spam because those messages need to go into a blackhole to prevent bounce abuse.</summary>
