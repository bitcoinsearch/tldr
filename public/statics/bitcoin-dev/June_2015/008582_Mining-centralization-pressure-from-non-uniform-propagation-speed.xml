    <summary>Pieter is praised for correctly assuming that bandwidth for 'block' messages is not the bottleneck. Gavin Andresen questions whether both their simulations will become irrelevant in the long-run due to Matt's fast relay network and further optimization of block propagation. He also suggests that little miners could run their block-assembling-and-announcing code on the other high-bandwidth-side of the bottleneck.</summary>
