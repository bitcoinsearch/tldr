    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a core developer of Bitcoin-XT project, plans to ask for help in reviewing and submitting patches for his proposal of an increase in the block size limit. He aims to grow the limit over time so that they can avoid going through this debate again. Additionally, he plans on lobbying merchant services, exchanges, hosted wallet companies, and other bitcoind-using-infrastructure companies. However, this approach is criticized as it incentivizes other core developers to go public and lobby too. This distracts them from working on technical issues, which is their primary responsibility. The proposed increase in block size limit from 1MB to 20MB is considered dangerous by some members of the community. Decentralization is the core of Bitcoin's security model, and centralization is more efficient than decentralization. Going from centralization to decentralization is easy, but the reverse is harder. The Gavin proposal is seen as compromising Bitcoin's long-term security for short-term better user experience. The urgency to do something about the block size limit is seen as a fallacy since there are promising designs and solutions such as Layer 2 and off-chain solutions available and new solutions will be invented. Jerome opposes the Gavin proposal in both form and content, arguing that bumping into any limit ASAP would be extremely healthy for the network. It would incentivize layer 2 and off-chain solutions to scale Bitcoin, and consensus among the community would be reached if necessary.</summary>
