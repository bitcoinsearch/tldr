    <summary>The person being questioned stated that they had no contracts or plans in place relating to preventing fraud through the use of RBF patches. However, they rely heavily on zeroconf transactions for merchant processing, so if a significant portion of mining pools used unsafe RBF patches, then they would need to investigate alternatives to prevent fraud. They currently accept zeroconf transactions with a small chance of double spend, which is an acceptable cost for providing a fast checkout experience. If the status quo changes, they would need to investigate alternatives such as mining contracts or only accepting instant payments from trusted hosted wallets. They would prefer an open, decentralized solution such as payment channels, green addresses, or lightning networks in the long term, but this is currently not yet implemented across popular wallet software and merchant processors.</summary>
