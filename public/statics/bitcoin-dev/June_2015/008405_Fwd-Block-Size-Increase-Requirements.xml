    <summary>Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer, sent an email in 2015 criticizing the Bitcoin community for not increasing the block size limit. He stated that if miners in China cannot handle the trivial amounts of bandwidth required to mine, then they should be outcompeted and the network should continue without them. However, he suggested that these miners could still run a node on a server in Taiwan and connect their hardware to it via a VPN. The email was sent to Alex Mizrahi and copied to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
