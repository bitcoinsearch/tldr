    <summary>On June 18, 2015, a discussion between Pieter Wuille and Wladimir J. van der Laan took place regarding decision-making ability for code changes in open source projects, specifically Bitcoin Core. Van der Laan encouraged examining the changelog for version 0.11 and following pull requests to see how many decisions about changes are made daily. He acknowledged the existence of forks, stating that it is how open source works and that making changes and running one's own version is perfectly fine. However, he expressed concern about controversial hard forks of the chain, particularly with regard to Bitcoin-XT. Wuille agreed with the right to make a fork but warned of the potential consequences of hard forks on the chain. The conversation ended with Wuille respecting the right to fork but cautioning against the risks of contentious hard forks.</summary>
