    <summary>The context explains that two entities are connected to each other through a slow 2 Mbit/s link. This speed is much slower than the average 3G connection, which can reach speeds of 7-8 Mbit/sec. The simulation being discussed assumes a speed even worse than what a mobile phone can achieve, indicating a significant limitation in the connectivity between the two entities.</summary>
