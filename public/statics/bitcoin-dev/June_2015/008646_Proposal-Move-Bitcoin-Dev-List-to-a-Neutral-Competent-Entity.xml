    <title>Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin developers are considering moving their mailing list away from SourceForge, which they have grown to distrust after a number of questionable incidents. One developer proposed the Linux Foundation as a new host for the list, as it is seen as neutral and competent in maintaining open source infrastructure. The proposal would only involve hosting the discussion list, with no control over the Bitcoin Project given to the Linux Foundation. The plan would be to import the entire list archive into the new host's archives for user convenience, whilst killing off bitcoin-list and bitcoin-test.</summary>
