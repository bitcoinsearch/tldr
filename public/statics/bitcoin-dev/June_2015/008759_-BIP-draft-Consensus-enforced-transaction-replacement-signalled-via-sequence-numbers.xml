    <summary>Mark Friedenbach, a Bitcoin developer, has requested the assignment of a BIP number for a soft-fork change to the consensus-enforced behavior of sequence numbers. The purpose of the proposed change is to support transaction replacement via per-input relative lock-times, which was previously discussed in a thread on the Bitcoin mailing list. The proposal seeks to repurpose the nSequence field of a transaction input to be a consensus-enforced relative lock-time, enabling safe transaction replacement and making use of the full range of the 32-bit sequence number. The BIP draft and reference implementation are available on GitHub, and several community-identified issues have been resolved. Friedenbach formally requests that the BIP editor assign a BIP number to allow the BIP consensus process to proceed.</summary>
