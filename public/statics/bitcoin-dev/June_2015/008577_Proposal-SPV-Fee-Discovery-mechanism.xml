    <summary>The proposal is to agree on a data format and encode it in an op_return output in the coinbase transaction for calculating average fee-per-kb paid by all transactions in a block. However, SPV clients should not rely on this encoding until a softfork is activated as results can be fabricated by individual miners. The proposal is only useful as the information of in-band fees is useful since statistics only cover in-band data. A Header-PoW-verifying client could still be given all transactions in a recent block from which it can see the in-band fees directly, but the trade-off is the size of those transactions versus the need to alter any consensus rules or do soft forks. Fees paid by any given transaction cannot be known unless all its inputs are also available. Transaction inputs do not include an amount. Average fee-per-kb paid by all transactions in a block can be obtained by looking at the coinbase transaction, subtracting the block reward, and dividing by the size of the block minus the header.</summary>
