    <summary>Gigas Gaming Inc. requested to be removed from the Bitcoin-development mailing list in an email sent on June 19, 2015. They claimed that the list had become a chatroom and was interfering with official company business. The request was made to the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge. It appears that the sender was receiving excessive emails or messages that were no longer relevant to their work or duties within the company, or they may have raised concerns about the content of the messages being circulated on the mailing list and believed that it is having a negative impact on productivity or communication within the organization.In October 2014, Gigas Gaming Inc. announced that it was launching its own cryptocurrency and had hired an expert to do some of the coding for the project by October 14, 2015. The company had previously built a cryptocurrency called GigasCorpCoin for testing purposes, and through this process, had identified an underlying problem with Bitcoin that it aimed to solve. However, the company's President refused to be interviewed about the secretive project due to the amount of work that still needed to be done.In an email thread, Jameson Lopp criticized a member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list for posting derisive emails that only strengthened Gigas Gaming Inc.'s point about the list. Brian Hoffman responded to the thread, jokingly accusing the critical poster of interrupting Gigas' focus on solving the underlying problem of Bitcoin. The discussion then turned to a humorous post from Gigas in 2014 announcing its own cryptocurrency, GigasCorpCoin, and plans to hire a coding expert by October 14, 2015. Gigas later requested its email to be removed from the Bitcoin-development mailing list, stating that it was interfering with official company business.Overall, it is clear that there is some level of dissatisfaction or frustration on the part of the sender regarding the current state of the mailing list and its impact on official company business. It remains to be seen how this situation will be resolved and whether any changes will be made to the way in which the mailing list is managed in the future.</summary>
