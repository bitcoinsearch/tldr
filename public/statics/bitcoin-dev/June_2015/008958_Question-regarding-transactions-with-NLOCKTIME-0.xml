    <title>Question regarding transactions with NLOCKTIME &gt; 0</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin network, a transaction with nLockTime&gt;0 won't be accepted by nodes or relayed until its time expires. This means that such transactions cannot be stored in a block before their locktime expires. nLockTime is designed in a way that it needs to be kept offline until the locktime expires. After that, it can be broadcast and included in a block like any other normal transaction. Peter Todd and others are working on CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and RELATIVE CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, which offer an enhancement to basic nLockTime. These enhancements guarantee that the signer holding the private keys used to sign a transaction with nLockTime cannot sign another one with nLockTime 0 and broadcast it before the locktime for the first transaction expires.A user named Braun Brelin asked whether a transaction with N_LOCKTIME&gt;0 is stored in a block on the blockchain or in the mempool until the actual time exceeds the current value. If such a transaction is stored in a block, it affects the concept of pruning that is supposed to be going into version 0.11. If a transaction takes effect after ten years and is stored in a block, does that block stay on the active list for that period?</summary>
