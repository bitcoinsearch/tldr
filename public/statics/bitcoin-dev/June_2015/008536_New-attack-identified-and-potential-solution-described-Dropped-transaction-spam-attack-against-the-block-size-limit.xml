    <summary>On June 9, 2015, Gavin Andresen proposed a mitigation plan for a potential Bitcoin attack. The plan includes limiting the memory pool to a certain number of blocks worth of transactions and preferring to evict transactions that are part of long chains of unconfirmed transactions. However, another participant suggested using fee per kB instead of evicting transactions based on chain length. With replace by fee, the new transaction would have to have a higher fee than a fixed amount more than the lowest already in the pool. To allow large blocks when block space is in high demand, there could be a limit on the average block size with the rule that blocks must be 2MB or lower and the total size of the previous 99 blocks and the current block must be 100MB or lower. This allows bursts while maintaining an average block size of 1MB.</summary>
