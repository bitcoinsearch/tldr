    <summary>The incentive process for developers needs to be taken into account when developing a process, as it feeds into the consensus process. A "rough consensus" with unstated personality-based rules of the game works fine with small projects, but as the project gets larger, that does not scale. The current process does not guarantee changes are approved on technical merit alone and that is part of the problem. Since there is no defined process, people make claims of all sorts of motives that may or may not exist. The idea is to get a defined process that gives a certain level of assurance to outsiders that the process is based on things like technical merit. On the other hand, an argument should be assessed on its technical merit alone, not on the number of people advancing it.</summary>
