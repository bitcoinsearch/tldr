    <summary>The block size limit was implemented to prevent an attack that would delay other miners by downloading and validating a large block. However, it opened up a different attack where spammers can force a transaction fee floor by paying high fees to fill the blocks with spam while real users are forced to pay higher fees to get their transactions confirmed. This undermines Bitcoin's credibility and usability. The proposed solution is to remove the block size limit and add a new rule on how fees are handled. Half of every fee would be burned and disappear forever, effectively distributing the value of those bitcoins across the entire money supply. The other half would be collected by the miner of the block as is done today. This would mean large blocks would cost a significant number of bitcoin to create, even when all of the transactions are created by the miner of that block. To ensure this works, a minimum fee must be paid for most transactions in every block, and the new transaction fee rule is in place. Another practical rule proposed is to credit 50% of the transaction fee to the next block instead of burning or doubling the price of the TX fee. Additionally, the memory pool should be limited to some reasonable number of blocks-worth of transactions, and if evicting transactions from the memory pool, transactions that are part of long chains of unconfirmed transactions should be preferred. Blocks should also be allowed to grow in size in times of high transaction demand. The combination of these measures means an attacker needs to prepare lots of confirmed inputs to pull off the attack, and miners can absorb fees that the attacker is throwing at them.</summary>
