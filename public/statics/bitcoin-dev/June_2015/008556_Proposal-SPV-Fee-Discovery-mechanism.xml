    <summary>The proposal to put fee and other statistics in block headers is being discussed as a way to allow Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients to rely on data with the same PoW-backed assurances as all other header data. While services like BlockCypher are currently used to calculate the fee-per-kb needed for transactions, this information is susceptible to sybil attack. This proposal could be enforced with a soft fork if it catches on. However, for real-time fee calculations, current mempool data needs to be taken into account, which is also vulnerable to sybil attack. For now, hard-coded ranges are used to protect against the service being compromised. The proposal is seen as valuable regardless of the outcome of the blocksize debate and could also be applied to other stats such as UTXO count.</summary>
