    <summary>A conversation between Brian Hoffman and Faiz Khan took place via email on June 15, 2015 regarding Bitcoin-XT code fork and non-consensus hard-fork. Faiz expressed concerns about personal ownership of the proposed fork and questioned Gavin and Mike's plans to move to Bitcoin-XT. He hoped that anyone wishing to fork the protocol would reconsider whether they are ready to test their skills and resources in this way as it is non-trivial to hard-fork successfully. Adam's questions were also raised and Faiz suggested that they be responded in-line when Mike is available. In another email, Bryan Bishop encouraged everyone to take extreme care with evaluating consensus changes, especially in the world of bitcoin. Technical miscommunication can be catastrophic in this context.</summary>
