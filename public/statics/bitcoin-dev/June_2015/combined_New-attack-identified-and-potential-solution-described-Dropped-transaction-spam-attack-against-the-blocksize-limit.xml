    <summary>The issue of blocksize limit in Bitcoin is creating problems as it can be used by spammers to deny transaction confirmation. An attacker flooding the network with transactions can keep their fees high enough that only 1% of transactions coming from real end-users would go through, causing everyone to give up on Bitcoin as it would become completely unusable. Meanwhile, everyone would jump on board trying to mine the blocks to collect the fees from the spammers, which could be one of the greatest transfers of wealth ever. The worst an attacker can do with a block size limit in place is raise costs without harming security, but if the fees become high enough, real end-users may give up on Bitcoin as it becomes unusable.Peter Todd explains that there will always be a block size limit due to the network's finite bandwidth limit. However, Raystonn argues that without a block size limit, the spam doesn't harm Bitcoin but rather enriches miners at the cost of spammers, which is an antifragile quality. Without a block size limit, it would still be possible for an attacker to flood the network with transactions until bandwidth usage becomes so great that consensus fails. Ultimately, Todd emphasizes that there will always be a block size limit based on technological considerations.The Bitcoin Core mempool does not drop transactions with insufficient fees unless they are double-spent or the node restarts. This is problematic because the only protection against a spam attack is a high amount of access to bitcoins for paying fees. Capping the size of the mempool and evicting lowest fee/KB transactions first is a solution but it breaks zeroconf security. If zeroconf security is not broken, then attackers can prevent reasonable fee transactions from propagating over the network. While there is no current memory pool cap, hardware limitations prevent memory pool sizes from growing unbounded.</summary>
