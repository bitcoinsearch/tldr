    <summary>In this context, the author expresses concern about Gavin's insistence on a 20MB proposal despite community opposition. The author argues that BIP66 has been around for a long time, and no one knows when the 95% goal will be met, indicating that a change to block max size could take over a year to be adopted. They suggest increasing the limit immediately but agree with any solution lower than 10MB in its first two years. The conversation then shifts to a discussion between Chun Wang and Mike Hearn regarding miners' ability to mine in China. While Hearn suggests that miners who can't get the necessary bandwidth through their firewall should be outcompeted, Wang disagrees, saying Western miners may suffer from higher orphans if they don't find a China-based VPN or improve their connectivity to China.</summary>
