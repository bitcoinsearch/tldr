    <summary>In an email thread, Jameson Lopp criticized a member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list for posting derisive emails that only strengthened Gigas Gaming Inc.'s point about the list. Brian Hoffman responded to the thread, jokingly accusing the critical poster of interrupting Gigas' focus on solving the underlying problem of Bitcoin. The discussion then turned to a humorous post from Gigas in 2014 announcing its own cryptocurrency, GigasCorpCoin, and plans to hire a coding expert by October 14, 2015. Gigas later requested its email to be removed from the Bitcoin-development mailing list, stating that it was interfering with official company business.</summary>
