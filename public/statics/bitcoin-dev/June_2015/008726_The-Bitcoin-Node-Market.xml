    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Justus Ranvier responded to Kevin Greene's argument that punishing users who use Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets is not the best way to incentivize people to run full nodes. Ranvier argued that if a billion mobile phones started using SPV wallets, there would not be enough nodes to connect to. He suggested that paying for connectivity would not be any more confusing or annoying than transaction fees. Ranvier proposed that some full nodes could offer paid connection slots, allowing users who checked the "pay subscription fee" box in their wallet configuration an easier time connecting than those who did not. This would function similarly to transaction fees, where paying one makes it faster and more probable for a transaction to be mined.</summary>
