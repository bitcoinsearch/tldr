    <summary>In response to a problem raised, Chun Wang acknowledges that they will switch to FSS RBF soon. However, the author of the message believes that Full RBF is better than FSS RBF for a number of reasons, such as user experience, efficiency, cost, and code complexity. They argue that it is more efficient to use full RBF since miners are likely to pick the option with higher pay, and because many users do not have multiple UTXOs. The author also suggests that supporting both Full RBF and FSS RBF separately would allow miners and users to choose whichever they prefer. They acknowledge that GreenAddress has always believed zero conf transactions are not secure and that miners have the incentive to run FBF.</summary>
