    <summary>In a message by Peter Grigor, the block size debate is discussed. The concern is that if block size is increased, malicious miners could publish large "bloated" blocks by generating private non-propagated transactions. However, Grigor believes that these bloated blocks could be easily detected by other miners and full nodes by containing a high percentage of transactions not found in their own memory pools. This signature can be used to reject bloated blocks. A threshold could be set on the allowable number of non-mempool transactions allowed in a solved block, and if a block exceeds this threshold, it would be rejected. However, Luke suggests that this idea can be defeated simply by broadcasting the bloat beforehand. If this idea works, the block size limitation could be completely removed.</summary>
