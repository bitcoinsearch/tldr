    <summary>Gem, a wallet platform that supports various cryptocurrencies, is considering a new hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet path structure that separates the coin_type field into two fields - network and asset_type. The purpose of this change is to enable validation of address formats, selection of appropriate daemons for scanning tokenized assets, and choosing multiple blockchain data sources relevant to an HDNode in the wallet using only information in the HDNode's path without maintaining an explicit mapping of coin_type -&gt; network. This will also help avoid maintaining an asset_type_to_blockchain mapping and exclude unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) tied to assets based on path. The company is considering publishing this information in a blog post or requesting a BIP number and publishing an informational BIP specifying the new purpose. Gem is also seeking feedback and suggestions from the community.</summary>
