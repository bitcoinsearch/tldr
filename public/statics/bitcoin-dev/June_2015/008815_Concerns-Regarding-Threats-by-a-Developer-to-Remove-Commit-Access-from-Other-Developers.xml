    <summary>The author discusses the inevitability of forks in Bitcoin, both planned and accidental, and suggests that education is key to understanding their effects and how to recover. They also address code forks as a solution to disagreements and express concern about inaction leading to the death of Bitcoin. The author encourages people to make informed decisions or delegate decision-making responsibilities rather than being apathetic. Finally, they acknowledge that the ongoing discussion surrounding Bitcoin's future is a time sink for many contributors and may not be productive in the pursuit of decentralization.</summary>
