    <summary>The community dictates the range of choices available as users ultimately choose which software to download. However, developers are required to provide multiple ACKs before acting on changes, and they tend not to do so if the community disagrees with the change. The person who approves the pull request becomes the decider regardless of the process beforehand. The lack of a real process contributes to the block size debate and creates contention within the community. Simply stating that users decide is not enough, and it's important to develop a genuine process to avoid further issues.</summary>
