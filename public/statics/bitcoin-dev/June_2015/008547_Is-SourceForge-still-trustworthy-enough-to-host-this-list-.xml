    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list shifted to the topic of changing email list providers. The current provider, Sourceforge, was found to be sufficient, and a paid solution with users paying per message was seen as a poor idea that would discourage community participation. Andy Schroder suggested a "pay per message or byte" solution that could motivate people to be more concise and clear with their messages while limiting spam. However, Wladimir J. van der Laan had no opinion on the matter and stated that the issue of moving the mailing list has come up before and people can't agree where to move to.Recently, all Bitcoin downloads, even old ones, were deleted from Sourceforge due to their questionable practices. This has nothing to do with the mail lists, and the distribution via Sourceforge was cancelled for obvious reasons which everyone fully understands and agrees to. The mail list is public, so there are no sensitive data on it. Moreover, the contributors want to encourage people to participate in the community, ask questions, come up with solutions and ideas for improvements. Thus, they need to focus on more important things rather than migrating to another provider that will only cause them headache and extra work.</summary>
