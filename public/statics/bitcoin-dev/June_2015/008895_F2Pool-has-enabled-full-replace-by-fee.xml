    <summary>In a message signed on June 19, 2015, Jeff Garzik discussed the need for multiple incompatible versions of a spend as a requirement for various refund contract protocols. A field in a transaction called nSequence is available for indicating when a protocol is in use, and transactions using these protocols can be easily differentiated from those that aren't, which is good from a payment assurance standpoint but bad from a privacy standpoint. The message is signed with a GnuPG v2 signature.</summary>
