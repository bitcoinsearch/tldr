    <summary>The discussion revolves around the issue of block size increase in Bitcoin. Michael Naber is advocating for a static 8MB block size increase and believes that it's necessary to continually push the block size upward as bounded only by technology. He uses an analogy of an engineer at Boeing who intends to double the plane's capacity every two years, and the airlines' need to charge sufficient fees to stay in business even if their planes are not full. Richard Moore, on the other hand, argues that airplanes take up space and resources proportional to their capacity, unlike Bitcoin blocks. He suggests that kicking the can down the road with a static increase is less better and we can always soft-fork the limit down if the actual block size is growing too fast. He also thinks that 8MB is a rather large jump, for either static or dynamic.Moore urges everyone to do what's best for Bitcoin and define what needs to get done to agree to a simple block size increase to a static 8MB. He encourages people to pitch in and help get the testing done for this, and agree to run more tests in the future when technology might allow for 16 MB blocks. He questions whether anyone wants to be the guy holding back bigger planes and artificially constrain block size below what technology allows. In the face of strong market demand for increased capacity in globally aware global consensus, he asks whether anyone really thinks they can prevent supply from meeting demand when the technology exists to deliver it.</summary>
