    <summary>The email exchange between Gabe Appleton and Pindar Wong, dated June 6, 2015, discussed their work on the block size debate in the Bitcoin community. They have created a git repo to avoid exclusive-by-default wiki policies and planned to put it on /r/Bitcoin for public comment. Wong offered help on the project and expressed his confusion about where Bitcoin XT fits in. Ethan Heilman also commented on the email chain, requesting a summary of the positions and arguments on the block size debate, while Mats Henricson urged posters to read up on all the information before posting and to suggest alternatives instead of just criticizing. The email chain also includes previous messages discussing the creation of a wiki page for the debate.</summary>
