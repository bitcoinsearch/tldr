    <summary>In an email thread, Peter Todd suggested that more science-driven investigations need to be done on Bitcoin to get some hard data to make decisions on. Pieter Wuille's recent work was cited as a great example of this kind of investigation that hasn't been done very much. Pindar Wong agreed and expressed interest in working with Constance Choi, Primavera De Filippi, and Peter Todd to make this happen. Peter Todd mentioned being in London for a conference where the blocksize issue was being discussed among attendees with different views than those seen on Reddit. Regarding the regulatory question of how jurisdictions view Bitcoin, Peter Todd noted that it is not just about how your local jurisdiction views Bitcoin, but rather how your customers' jurisdictions view it. He emphasized the importance of taking an ecosystem view, where miners are important, along with all the other participants who rely on and invest time, effort, and energy to make Bitcoin work well. Peter Todd mentioned being in contact with Primavera and that Cyberport would be available for use on October 14 and 15th (Wed/Thursday) to host a more technical meeting to discuss BIP100, 101, et al. He also noted that this location had previously hosted the Global Bitcoin Summit in Hong Kong, which was attended by many of China's leading Bitcoin-related companies.</summary>
