    <summary>On June 19th, 2015, Peter Todd reported that F2Pool, the largest pool with 21% of the hashing power, enabled full replace-by-fee (RBF) support after discussions with him. This means that transactions that F2Pool has will be replaced if a conflicting transaction pays a higher fee. There are no requirements for the replacement transaction to pay addresses that were paid by the previous transaction. However, intentional fraud is a bad practice to add to a financial protocol. A user who creates conflicting transactions and broadcasts both of them has self-incriminated themselves by producing prima facie evidence of fraud. Though it may be difficult for victims to rely on legal recourse since Bitcoin spans multiple legal jurisdictions and can be used anonymously, fraud is still fraud, and anyone who encourages it should be recognized as a bad actor. Committing vandalism and encouraging fraud to prove a point may be something the network can't stop on a technical level, but there's no reason not to call it out for what it is.</summary>
