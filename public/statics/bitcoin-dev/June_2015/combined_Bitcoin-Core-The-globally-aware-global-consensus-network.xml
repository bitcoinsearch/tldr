    <summary>The email thread discusses the importance of global awareness in Bitcoin transactions and the significance of Bitcoin Core being the hub at the center. The author suggests thorough testing of any proposed change in the maximum block size before increasing it to 8 MB, with the possibility of adjusting it further in the future as technology permits. Evan has suggested that Huobi would require around three months of testing on a test-net, which should begin in early-mid October. The author offers to host a face-to-face meeting in Hong Kong on October 14-15 to discuss the results of the testing process and engineer any remaining ones necessary to raise the level of confidence to help 'mine consensus' for any hard fork.Bitcoin is a globally aware global consensus network where each node knows about and agrees on every transaction. However, global awareness of every transaction is not necessary for running a worldwide payment network. Hub and spoke or other clever designs are going to ensure that worldwide transactions can run without requiring global awareness. Even with hub and spoke, there still needs to be a "hub" at the center. Bitcoin Core should aim to be that hub by being the best globally aware global consensus network that can be built. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to ensure that the network can operate at the highest capacity that technology can allow. If the test-net shows that hardware exists today to safely increase block size to a static 8 MB, then there will be broad developer support to make this happen. This step is crucial in building the best network possible. In the future, the block size can be adjusted upward as technology permits.In conclusion, Bitcoin needs to focus on being the best globally aware global consensus network by ensuring that the network can operate at the highest capacity technology allows. It is also important to keep adjusting and improving the network in the future to maintain its status as the best network for worldwide transactions. Anyone willing to contribute resources to participate in the design, execution, and analysis of such testing is invited to post to the email thread.</summary>
