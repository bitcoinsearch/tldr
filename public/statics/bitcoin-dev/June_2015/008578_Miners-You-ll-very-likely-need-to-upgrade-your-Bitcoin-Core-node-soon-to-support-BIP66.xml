    <title>Miners: You'll (very likely) need to upgrade your Bitcoin Core node soon to support BIP66</title>

    <summary>The BIP66 soft-fork has recently passed the 75% support threshold, indicating that 75% of the hashing power has upgraded to support it while 25% of the power has not. Once the hashing power reaches 95%, blocks created by the remaining 5% who have not upgraded will be rejected. It is important for those who operate a pool, solo-mine, or mine on p2pool to upgrade their Bitcoin Core node to support the BIP66 soft-fork; otherwise, their blocks will be rejected. However, if one only sells their hashing power to a centralized pool, they do not need to do anything.To measure BIP66 support, miners who have upgraded set the version field in their blocks to 3, while non-upgraded miners set it to 2. Bitcoin Core measures BIP66 support by counting how many blocks with version &gt;= 3 exist in the blockchain within the last 1000 blocks. If 750 out of the last 1000 blocks support BIP66, blocks with the version set to &gt;= 3 that do not follow the BIP66 rules are rejected. If 950 out of the last 1000 blocks support BIP66, blocks with version &gt;= 3 are accepted.</summary>
