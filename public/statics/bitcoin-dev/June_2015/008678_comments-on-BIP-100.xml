    <summary>O() notation is a reference to computational complexity, but the majority of users don't run relaying nodes that take part in gossiping. Instead, most users run web or SPV wallets. Additionally, the nodes that do participate in the protocol don't connect to every other node. This leads Eric Lombrozo to express concern that the fact that the majority of nodes don't relay and only perform basic validation, if any at all, is seen as an acceptable feature of the protocol.</summary>
