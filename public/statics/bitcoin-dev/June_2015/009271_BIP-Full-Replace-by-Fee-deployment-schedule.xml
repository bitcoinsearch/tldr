    <summary>In an email thread from June 30th, 2015, Adam Back suggests that the first-seen miner and relay policy is based on honor, but it is currently the default. In response to this email, someone questions the effect of Inverted Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT) on the first seen policy. It is suggested that if a miner were to use full RBF and broadcast extra data with their blocks while everyone else uses first-seen, then the miner's blocks would be at a disadvantage in terms of propagation. This effect could make first-seen a rational consensus rule rather than a hard one. However, it is unclear how significant this effect would be.</summary>
