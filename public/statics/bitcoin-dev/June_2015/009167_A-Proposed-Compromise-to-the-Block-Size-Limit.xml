    <summary>In an email conversation between Michael Naber and Peter Todd on June 27, 2015, the topic of increasing the block size to a static 8MB was discussed. Michael suggested a compromise that they could agree to increase the block size to 8MB with a plan to increase it further if necessary, except in a special case. Peter responded by saying that it was not reasonable at the moment due to the lack of testing done with 8MB+ blocks and other issues. He suggested setting up an 8MB testnet with two years or so of 8MB blocks in history and a large UTXO set to test performance characteristics. However, he noted that downloading 840GB for the test might be unreasonable.</summary>
