    <summary>In this email conversation, Andy Schroder and Peter Todd discuss issues with digital signatures on messages. Schroder notes that PGP/MIME signatures are not working properly due to modifications made by the list server. Todd suggests that Thunderbird may not properly handle messages with both signed and unsigned content, but Schroder believes that the Enigmail extension is simply feeding data to GPG and receiving a response back. Schroder also mentions that mailing lists rewriting parts of messages may be expected, and if PGP/MIME does not support partially signed content, it may be recommended to not use it for messages sent to the list. The conversation ends with a request for confirmation from others experiencing similar issues. The email includes a signature.asc attachment containing an OpenPGP digital signature.</summary>
