    <summary>The question posed by Braun Brelin is regarding the storage of transactions with N_LOCKTIME&gt;0 on the blockchain. Specifically, they are asking whether such transactions are stored in a block on the blockchain or if they are stored in the mempool until the actual time or block number exceeds the current value. Braun also questions how this affects the concept of pruning that is supposed to be going in to version 0.11. In other words, if a transaction is created that doesn't take effect for 10 years and that transaction is stored in a block, does that block stay on the active list for that period of time?</summary>
