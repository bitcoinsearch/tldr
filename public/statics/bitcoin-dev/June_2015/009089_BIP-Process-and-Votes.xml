    <summary>The email exchange discusses the process involved in handling soft and hard forks. Soft forks have a defined process, including BIP proposal, proposed code, dev acceptance, release, and miner vote/acceptance. However, the miner veto is stronger while the dev veto is weak. Moving forward with agreement between all parties is recommended. In contrast, there is no process for handling hard forks, which can lead to a mutual veto. The fundamental problem is that there isn't agreement on what the block size is. If Satoshi had said that 1MB was part of the definition of Bitcoin, then people would accept it to the same extent as they accept the 21 million coin limit. It was intended to be temporary, but people have realized that it might be a good idea to keep it. Both sides could argue that they should be considered the status quo.</summary>
