    <summary>A patch against v0.10.2 for the First-seen-safe Replace-by-Fee is now available on GitHub. A pull request has also been open for a few weeks. The creator of the patch is offering up to 1 BTC as a bounty to anyone who can find a way to attack miners running this patch. The creator specifies that they are concerned about things that could lead to significant losses for those miners, such as a total crash which would be considered very serious and excess bandwidth usage which would be considered minor. For reference, an example of a crash exploit found by Suhas Daftuar is provided. Additionally, if two people report the same or overlapping issues, the first person will get priority and adding a new test that demos the exploit to the unit tests will be looked upon favorably. The creator emphasizes that there are no hard promises with regards to payouts and that they have budgeted over 2BTC for this project.</summary>
