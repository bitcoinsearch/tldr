    <summary>Jeff's messages are not getting through because mailman 1.0 doesn't know how to handle DKIM properly, and switching to a different mailman provider won't resolve the issue. There is uncertainty regarding whether mailman 3.0 fixes this problem as their website does not provide clear information on it. A page on the mailman wiki suggests that they "fixed" the issue by deleting the signatures entirely, which DMARC policies prohibit since emails must be signed. However, user documentation for mailman 3 is non-existent, and links on the website are only for mailman 2.1. In contrast, Google Groups allows users to subscribe to groups without requiring a Google account, making it an accessible alternative to mailman despite its controversial reputation. Nonetheless, mailman requires users to create an account for each listserv to manage subscriptions, which may be a cumbersome process.</summary>
