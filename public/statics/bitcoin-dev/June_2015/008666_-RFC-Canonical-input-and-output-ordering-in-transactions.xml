    <summary>The discussion focuses on the soft fork argument concerning the use of mid-state compression, a technique that allows for compact commitments via OP_RETURN output. The issue is whether to exempt this type of output from soft-fork enforcement since it conflicts with two existing use cases. One solution is to advertise sort-order exemptions, but this is considered an ugly approach. Gregory Maxwell notes that the generalized sighash flag design he was thinking about is neutral about ordering and could replace SINGLE. However, the concern remains that other yet-to-be-invented use cases may also be affected by soft-fork enforcement.</summary>
