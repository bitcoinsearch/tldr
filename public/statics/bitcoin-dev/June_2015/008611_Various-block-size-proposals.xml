    <summary>Bryan Bishop has compiled a list of proposals and related scalability issues regarding the minimum block size questions. The list includes various ideas from different individuals such as dynamic block size limit controller, increasing the maximum block size using a soft-fork, elastic block cap with rollover penalties, variable mining effort, BIP100 Soft-fork limit of 2 MB, difficulty target scaling, annual 50% max block size increase, extension blocks, voting by paying to an address, vote by paying fees, double the max block size at each block reward halving, reducing the block rate instead of increasing the maximum block size, decrease block interval, increase default soft block size limit in Bitcoin Core, consider the size of the utxo set when determining max block size, reduce and decrease the max block size, change the value of MAX_BLOCK_SIZE in Bitcoin Core, problems with floating block size limits, simplified payment verification, lightning network, GHOST, payment channels, tree chains, and fedpeg + SPV. However, some old bitcoin-development proposals, old bitcointalk proposals, and anything unique from IRC are still missing. There is also a miningconsensus.slack.com group available for discussion on fact/source checking and completeness.</summary>
