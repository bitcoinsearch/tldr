    <summary>Peter Todd expressed disappointment in F2Pool's decision to enable full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) instead of the safer first-seen-safe RBF. He suggested that the fees gained by supporting full RBF over FSS RBF would be negligible. Two weeks ago, Peter Todd had already communicated this message to F2Pool. He also acknowledged Marshal Long of FinalHash for his help with FSS-RBF deployment and getting pools on board with BIP66.</summary>
