    <summary>The conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list centers around who should get to vote on approval to commit a BIP implementation into Bitcoin Core. While some developers become defensive when this question is asked, the lead developer, Wladimir, has been praised for his decision-making skills when it comes to code changes. However, he does not want to decide on consensus or protocol changes that could potentially harm all users in the ecosystem. The consensus rules need to be improved but it should not be solely the responsibility of the maintainer. Suggestions have been made on the mail list for consensus changes to be made through soft forks over a long period of time, allowing all users/miners/exchangers/merchants to choose/take action. The incentive for new developers to come in is that they will be paid by companies who want to influence the code, which should be considered. Furthermore, the lack of a defined process for approving BIP implementations is seen as a risk by businesses/investors looking in from the outside.</summary>
