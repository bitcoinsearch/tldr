    <summary>Kalle Rosenbaum has received feedback and is making changes to the data structure. There will now be only one output, referred to as the "pop output", and no outputs from T will be copied to the PoP. The pop output will have a value of 0. The sequence number of all inputs for the PoP will be set to 0 for simplicity, and the lock_time of the PoP will always be set to 499999999. Tom Harding suggested that there should not be any real outputs and that the proof script, which should be invalid, should start with a magic constant and include space for future expansion. Kalle removed the constant but added a 2-byte version field to make it extendable.</summary>
