    <summary>The post explores the narrowing of proposals that could be successful in addressing the block size limit debate. The author suggests that some proposals are more likely to succeed than others and offers examples such as Jeff Garzik's BIP 100, Adam Back's simplified soft-fork one-way peg, and Gavin Andresen's 8 MB block size limit adjustment. However, this assumes developers are willing to abandon contentious proposals like the "hard fork to XT w/ 20 MB." The author acknowledges Wladimir J. van der Laan's statement that pushing a hard fork in the face of controversy is a folly and danger to the network. In conclusion, the post invites thoughts and comments on the topic.</summary>
