    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his concerns about the relay policy changes that could increase the ease of exploits in a message. In response to this, another developer pointed out that there is no need to worry about causing more problems by relaying double-spends as it has been noted that only 20% of hash power strictly obeys first-seen after a year of observations. This observation shows that paying attention to double-spends is an opportunity for wallets and merchants. The period of ambiguity in double-spends is very short, lasting just two seconds. Fast double-spends between two and fifteen seconds are less successful, and the steady-state 80% respend success rate is reached after 15 seconds. The data point above thirty seconds includes transactions that were respent after a long time, sometimes months. Those longer-term respends are expected as people reclaim stuck transactions.With 140 Bitcoin XT nodes online, many wallets are already receiving alerts when a double-spend of a wallet transaction appears in a block. However, most wallets, including vanilla core, do not even alert when a double-spend occurs, even though there may still be time to withhold delivery of goods/services. If FSS RBF gains miner share, fewer successful zero-conf double-spends will occur. This result is seen as desirable by most developers.</summary>
