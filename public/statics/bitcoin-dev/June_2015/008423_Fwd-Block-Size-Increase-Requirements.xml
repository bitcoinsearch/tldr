    <summary>The writer is okay with a smaller size and formula that will ramp up over time as the demand for 10MB, let alone 20MB blocks, is far from being filled. It would take a significant increase in usage for them to feel squeezed inside 10MB within two years. Though it is not possible to predict what connectivity into China would look like in a few years, the writer believes that they cannot allow the Chinese government to dictate how Bitcoin is used. The reason to pick 20MB is solely based on expedience, and they don't want to be caught unaware if demand outstrips expectations. If capacity significantly outpaces organic growth, there should be no problems.</summary>
