    <summary>In an email exchange on June 22, 2015, Jean-Paul Kogelman asked about the stability of using block timestamps as opposed to block height in determining size restrictions. The response from an unknown source stated that the activation or not rule is purely timestamp based and any block with a timestamp less than 1452470400 has a limit of 1MB. Therefore, it is possible for there to be an 8MB block followed by a block limited to 1MB.</summary>
