    <summary>Tier Nolan has asked about the use cases for relative lock time verify and believes it is useful for ensuring that the other party has a chance to react. He suggests that most cases require no more than 8191 blocks, but this may depend on the individual use case. The absolute version of this feature is just as good for long-term purposes. However, Rusty notes that Lightning channels require this feature exactly as it is in order to revoke old transactions, which could be ancient on long-lived channels.</summary>
