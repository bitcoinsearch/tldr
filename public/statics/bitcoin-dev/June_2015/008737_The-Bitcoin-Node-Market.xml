    <summary>In a discussion about the prospect of a billion mobile phones running Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets, Aaron Voisine raised the question of who would provide the nodes these users would need to connect to. In response, it was suggested that the SPV wallet author themselves would have to provide this service if they wanted their wallet to function properly.However, the question of how SPV wallet users would pay for this service remains. Would they be paying with their money or with their privacy? This raises concerns about the privacy and security of users' financial information, as well as the potential cost of using such a service.Overall, the potential for a billion mobile phones to run SPV wallets is an interesting concept, but it also highlights the importance of addressing issues related to node provision and user payment in order to ensure the safety and security of users' financial data.</summary>
