    <summary>In a discussion about block size limits, Jeff Garzik proposed a hard-limit voting mechanism that would prevent miners from colluding to lower the block size limit. However, Gareth Williams questioned the need for this mechanism, stating that if consensus rules were only in place to enforce block size limits against miners, then it may not be necessary. He suggested that Gavin's simpler 8MB-&gt;8GB hard-limit growth curve would be safer and that a soft limit below that could be agreed upon through a voting mechanism. This later option can be implemented at any time without consensus changes. Additionally, note that both Jeff's proposal and Greg Maxwell's flexcap proposals include a growth limiter as a hard-cap and a mechanism for influencing a dynamic cap within that envelope, which serves as a safety limit in case there is a misunderstanding about the economics, incentives or game-theory.</summary>
