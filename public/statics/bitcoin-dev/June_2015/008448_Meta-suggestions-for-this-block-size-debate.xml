    <summary>In this email thread from June 1, 2015, Mats Henricson expresses frustration with a debate and suggests that posters should follow two simple principles. The first principle is to read up on all of the information before posting, as rehashing what has already been said wastes time. The second principle is to be helpful and suggest alternatives rather than simply criticizing without offering a solution. Additionally, one member of the email thread suggests creating a wiki page for the debate to condense information. The email thread is related to Bitcoin development and was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
