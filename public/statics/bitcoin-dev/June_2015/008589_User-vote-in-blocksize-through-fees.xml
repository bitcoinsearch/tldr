    <summary>In a conversation on June 12, 2015, Mark Friedenbach expressed concern to Peter about the possibility of miners having influence over votes by generating transactions in their own blocks. He suggested that miners could fill their blocks with garbage transactions that agree with their vote, but this would not result in any real income for them. This is because they would be paying their own money as fees to themselves. To earn real income, miners would have to vote in accordance with real users.</summary>
