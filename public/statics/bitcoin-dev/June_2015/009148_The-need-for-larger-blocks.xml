    <summary>Eric Lombrozo points out that there is a contradiction between the economic policy of avoiding fee pressure and the consensus status quo of not having a hard fork. Hence, maintaining the status quo is not possible without changing either a policy or a consensus rule. He suggests that making changes to the policy code of different implementations, which were not prepared for the current consensus rules, is closer to "maintaining the status quo" than a hard fork. Increasing the block size limit without fixing underlying problems is the "lazy option," as it will leave implementations unprepared for new rules. Eric notes that some participants in discussions just want to delay solving known problems or even remove the block size limit entirely.</summary>
