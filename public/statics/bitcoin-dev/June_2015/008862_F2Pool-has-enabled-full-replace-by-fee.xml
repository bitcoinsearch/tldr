    <summary>In 2013, the sender of a Bitcoin transaction was able to double spend without any mining power. As a result, F2Pool has announced that they will switch from full RBF to FSS RBF, which is believed to be safer. Peter Todd explained the difference between these two options and their impact on transaction fees. He has developed FSS-RBF with additional restrictions that make it less likely to have bugs or be susceptible to DoS attacks. Todd argues that zeroconf is already broken and that relying on it in the future could lead to issues with hashing power and lack of consensus on transactions. Todd's goal with standard replace-by-fee is to force merchants to implement ways of accepting zeroconf transactions safely. Todd updated the FSS-RBF patch and is waiting for feedback before putting up a bounty for anyone who can find a DoS attack in the patch. Overall, his aim is to make zeroconf transactions safer, more honest, and math-based rather than trust-based.</summary>
