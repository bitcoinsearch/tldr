    <summary>Jorge Timón discussed the topic of non-repudiation mechanisms in Bitcoin protocol with Eric Lombrozo. Lombrozo recommended defining a mechanism rather than relying on "prima facie" assumptions for it. However, Jorge Timón believes that non-repudiation can be built on top of the payment protocol layer as it is an intrinsic property of the ECDSA signatures used by Bitcoin. There is no way to accidentally sign a transaction or any third-party error that can result in a payee receiving an erroneous contract. The message was signed using PGP encryption.</summary>
