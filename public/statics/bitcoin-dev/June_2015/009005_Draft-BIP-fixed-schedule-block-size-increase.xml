    <summary>On June 22, 2015, Martin Schwarz proposed to Gavin Andresen that his proposal and code stop doubling at 32MB to avoid deployment of code that deterministically fails fatally in 2022. Schwarz suggested fixing the message size limit in the meantime. However, there is an exception in the code for "block" messages, which are limited to the max block size for two hours into the future. All other messages have a 2MB limit. To improve the DOS protection, Andresen suggests setting the limit for "block" messages to a week into the future, which would guarantee that message sizes are reasonable while still checking their size. A link to the relevant GitHub commit is provided.</summary>
