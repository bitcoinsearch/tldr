    <summary>The discussion is about miners in China and outside of China who mine Bitcoin. The author states that nobody has an inherent right to mine if they can't do the job, and if miners in outside China can't get the trivial amounts of bandwidth required through their firewall and end up being outcompeted then too bad, they'll have to carry on without them. The author suggests that miners in China can always run a node on a server in Taiwan and connect the hardware to it via a VPN or so. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
