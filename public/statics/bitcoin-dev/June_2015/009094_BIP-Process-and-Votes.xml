    <summary>The discussion revolves around the process of hard forks and soft forks in Bitcoin. The current process for soft forks involves BIP proposal and discussion, proposed code, dev acceptance, release, and miner vote/acceptance. However, there is no defined process for hard forks which are not bug fixes. The lack of checks and balances for hard forks can lead to a breakdown of consensus. The fundamental problem is that there is no agreement on what the block size should be, as it was intended to be temporary but has now become a topic of debate. Some suggest regularly scheduled hard forks to be planned with cut off dates for BIP submissions. This would avoid debates over whether there should be hard forks and what should be contained within them. It is suggested to follow the BIP process closely and add another step after "Dev acceptance" to include input from merchants, exchanges, miners, and users. The goal is to find a middle ground and move forward with an agreed-upon approach.</summary>
