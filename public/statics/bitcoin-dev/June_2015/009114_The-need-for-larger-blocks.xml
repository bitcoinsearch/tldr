    <summary>The context highlights the concern over proposing inaction to convince people that Bitcoin can scale. This proposal is deemed insufficient as people and businesses cannot perform capacity planning and future projections under it. The argument presented is that there will be no growth until there is fee pressure, which raises questions about what happens next. It is unclear what the proposal is beyond being against knee-jerk reactions. However, the individual does not want to take on the responsibility of deciding on whether to approve hard fork changes, which is understandable considering their workload. It is suggested that a process needs to be established to handle proposed hard-fork changes other than just asking the Core maintainer to do it.</summary>
