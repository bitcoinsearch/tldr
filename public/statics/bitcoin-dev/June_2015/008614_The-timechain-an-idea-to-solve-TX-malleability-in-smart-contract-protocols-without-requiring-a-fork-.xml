    <summary>The author proposes an idea using time-locked encryption to create a serial chain of time-lock encrypted GPG keys at N minute intervals. This structure can be used to encrypt ECDSA keys, which could then be used in multi-signature contract schemes as a 100% decentralized and trustless way to execute refunds in contract protocols. The author suggests that time-lock encryption could be used to build unbreakable DACs, where participants are incentivized to decrypt themselves, creating a secure and reliable system that doesn't require perpetual third-party management. The biggest flaw is the integrity of the timechain, but if generated securely by a reputable party, the author believes this could allow companies to entirely secure their systems. The author provides several sources for further reading on the subject.</summary>
