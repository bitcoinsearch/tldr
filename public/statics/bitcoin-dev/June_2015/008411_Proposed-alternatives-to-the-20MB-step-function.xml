    <summary>A proposal has been made to make the block size limit a function of the number of current transactions in the mempool. There is no consensus on the average number of unconfirmed transactions, and there is no single mempool which transactions could be counted. The author of the proposal believes that any constant block size limit is just delaying the issue, and dynamic lower limit solutions based on past blocks do not account for usage spikes. However, the author does not have the knowledge of the code base or time to make simulations on this kind of approach and leaves it up for discussion or other ideas.</summary>
