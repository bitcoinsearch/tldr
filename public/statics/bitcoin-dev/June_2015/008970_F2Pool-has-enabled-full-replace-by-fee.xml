    <summary>The co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, Aaron Voisine, suggests using relay and default tx selection rules to increase the value and practicality of Bitcoin. By raising the cost of double spend attacks, merchants can learn what the costs of accepting Bitcoin payments are, which can lead to greater adoption. However, Eric Lombrozo points out that double-spends are not due to flaws in the protocol but rather poor software and security policies on the merchant end. Therefore, pressure should be applied on the merchant end to upgrade their systems to be more resilient, so that changes to relay policy can be made without significant disruption to the network.</summary>
