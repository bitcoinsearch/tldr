    <summary>Pindar Wong has proposed to arrange an initial open summit in Hong Kong to meet with representatives of the Chinese miners at a convenient time. Adam Back supports this idea and suggests coordinating the summit with the blockchain-tech conference being held by Constance Choi and Primavera De Filippi on October 14th-15th, which could be useful. Attendees of the conference have significant experience with regulatory issues and interacting with governments on regulation of blockchain tech, which is important for Bitcoin's existence. Any blocksize discussion needs to be informed by these potential threats to usage of the technology as well as challenges to using scaling solutions. Remote online participation would be welcomed from those who might not be able to attend in person. However, it is hoped that such a meeting would be primarily document-driven to facilitate orderly translation, discussion, and decision. The work done by Pieter Wuille is a great example of the kind of science-driven investigations that need to be done to get hard data to make decisions on.</summary>
