    <summary>If you are looking to download software, it's best to avoid SourceForge if possible. In 2013, the developers of GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) removed their Windows downloads from SourceForge due to misleading advertisements disguised as download buttons. Unfortunately, in 2015, SourceForge took control over the old GIMP account on their platform, locked out the original maintainer, and added junkware-filled installers to GIMP downloads. This serves as a warning to be cautious when downloading software from websites and to always read carefully before clicking any download buttons.</summary>
