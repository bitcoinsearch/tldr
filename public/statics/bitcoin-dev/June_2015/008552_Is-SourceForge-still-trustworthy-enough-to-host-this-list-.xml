    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin-Development mailing list, Andy Schroder, has proposed switching to a new email provider due to issues with the current one. The current provider delays delivery sometimes for up to several days and adds ads to the footer of messages. Additionally, HTML messages are not allowed and digital signatures are often broken due to slight modifications made by the list server. Another member of the list, s7r, disagrees with switching, stating that the current provider, Sourceforge, is sufficient and has a nice web UI. They also point out that the mailing list is public and therefore not sensitive data. Andy Schroder suggests finding a free solution or creating a pay-per-message model to cover the costs of a new provider. He believes that this would limit spam and encourage contributors to be more concise with their messages. However, there has been no agreement on where to move the list, and some members do not see it as an urgent issue. The context also mentions that all Bitcoin Core downloads have recently been deleted from Sourceforge due to concerns over downloading software from the site.</summary>
