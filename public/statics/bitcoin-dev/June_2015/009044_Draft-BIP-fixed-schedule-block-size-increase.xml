    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter Todd highlighted how the proposed bump in mining fees was being suggested at a time when blockchain space demand is low and transaction costs are low. However, recent averages show that transactions cost around $0.04. Various stress tests have indicated the need for 10 times more. Despite this, Todd argues that the proposed bump is insignificant for almost all use cases since there is a whole ecosystem of non-purchase cases for which non-profit-mining fees are enabling such as penny stocks, voting, and notarizing.</summary>
