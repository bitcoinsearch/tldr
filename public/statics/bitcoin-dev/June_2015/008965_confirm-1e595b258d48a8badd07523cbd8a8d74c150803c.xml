    <summary>The email sender received a message stating that their membership in the mailing list Bitcoin-development has been disabled due to excessive bounces. The last bounce was dated June 21, 2015. They will not receive any more messages from this list until they re-enable their membership. There are three more reminders before their membership is deleted. To re-enable the membership, they can respond to the message or visit the confirmation page. They can also change their delivery options on their membership page. If there are any questions or problems, they can contact the list owner. It is unclear how the email with the sender's Gmail account would be causing bounces with this list.</summary>
