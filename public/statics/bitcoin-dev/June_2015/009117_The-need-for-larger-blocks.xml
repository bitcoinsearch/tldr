    <summary>In an email exchange between Patrick Strateman and other individuals, the issue of a proposed hard fork was discussed. The consensus was that for a hard fork to be safe, there needs to be a clear and self-evident course of action. Safety increases with more lead-in time, and updating the reference client two years prior to the hard fork would make it pretty safe. However, if miners or the community objected, it would be like a game of chicken. This highlights the problem with not making decisions in advance, as resulting hard forks are inherently safer.</summary>
