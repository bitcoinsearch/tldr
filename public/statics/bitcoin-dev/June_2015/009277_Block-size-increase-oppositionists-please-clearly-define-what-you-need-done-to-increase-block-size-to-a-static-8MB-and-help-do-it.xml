    <summary>In this message, Michael expresses his desire to lobby for a block size increase to a static 8MB. However, Peter Todd proposed a combined back-test and ongoing forward test to ensure that the infrastructure ecosystem can handle an 8MB block size. This includes questions about scalability of block explorers, SPV wallets, feasibility of initial synchronization, scalability of the UTXO set, etc. With a working dataset of that size, increasing the block size to 8MB would exclude many participants and contributors to the testing. Therefore, it was suggested to test at double capacity of 2MB instead. The core issue is that an 8MB block size will exclude a lot of mainnet participants (miners) and degrade the quality of diversity and decentralization.</summary>
