    <summary>The discussion between Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, and Luke Dashjr revolves around the use of Best Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to define Bitcoin's policy. While Luke believes that policy should be left up to node/miner fiat and not BIPs, Gregory argues that BIPs about best practices or coordination are reasonable uses of the process. As an example, Gregory cites BIP19, which defines a standard way of assembling multisig transactions. However, Peter points out that BIP19 does not directly change policy but rather specifies standards to use for authoring/modifying transactions. Furthermore, Peter notes that the proposed full-RBF BIP has significant impacts for wallet authors and other stakeholders, but it should leave out policy or constrain it to a non-normative section.</summary>
