    <title>Welcome to the new Bitcoin Dev List</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has completed its move to the Linux Foundation and the previous archive has been fully imported. However, due to Greylisting, the first post to this list may be delayed by 5+ minutes. Any subsequent posts should go through without any issue. The Linux Foundation will soon upgrade Mailman to better handle posts from DKIM enforced domains. There will also be a few more config tweaks like auto-rejecting non-subscribed posts. Although it is too dangerous to auto-reject spam, those messages need to go into a blackhole to prevent bounce abuse. There is no one available to moderate this list as of now. If anyone has any questions or concerns, they can contact Freenode #bitcoin-dev.</summary>
