    <summary>The conversation between Milly Bitcoin and Jorge Tim贸n discusses the issues with the Github process, where the developers have a dictatorial style and do not consider input from outside their inner circle. The maintainers deleted some of Milly Bitcoin's messages, and they have been banned from Github. Tim贸n argues that there are many pieces of software and maintainers, but Core developers have the biggest influence to decide hard fork changes. He also explains that Bitcoin core devs have control over Bitcoin core, not the consensus rules. Tim贸n believes that it is hard to define "uncontroversial" without giving veto powers to any random person on the internet, and the current proposals cannot be considered uncontroversial for any sane definition.</summary>
