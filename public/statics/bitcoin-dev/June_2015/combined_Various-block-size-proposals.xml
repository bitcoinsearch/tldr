    <summary>The Bitcoin development community is actively exploring various proposals to address scalability issues, particularly with regards to the minimum block size. These proposals include dynamic block size limit controller, increasing the max block size using a soft-fork, elastic block cap with rollover penalties, variable mining effort, BIP100 Soft-fork limit of 2 MB, difficulty target scaling, annual 50% max block size increase, extension blocks, voting by paying to an address or fees, reducing the block rate instead of increasing the maximum block size, decrease block interval, and problems with floating block size limits. Other proposals being considered include simplified payment verification, lightning network, GHOST, payment channels, tree chains, and fedpeg + SPV. However, some of these proposals have limitations such as vote censorship and utxo depth which cannot have consensus. Moreover, old Bitcoin-development and Bitcointalk proposals are missing from this list.Bryan Bishop has compiled a comprehensive list of proposals and related scalability issues regarding the minimum block size questions. The list includes various ideas from different individuals. There is also a miningconsensus.slack.com group available for discussion on fact/source checking and completeness.</summary>
