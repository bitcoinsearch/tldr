    <summary>In an email exchange in 2015, Jeff Garzik discussed the need to plan ahead and prevent negative impacts for users when blocks are consistently full. Two proposed solutions were setting a hard fork date in the future or fixing the reasons why users would have negative experiences with full blocks. The latter includes getting safe forms of replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent finished and developing cross-platform libraries for managing micropayment channels. Additionally, using fidelity bonds, solvency proofs, and other tricks could minimize the risk of already deployed off-chain solutions as an interim measure until soft-fork changes for truly scalable solutions like Lightning Network can be deployed. It is important to note that not raising the block size limit does not mean doing nothing to solve the problem.</summary>
