    <summary>The context provided here is related to the use of a particular identifier in the blockchain system. The identifier "99" is used to identify a counterparty in the blockchain. However, there are concerns about the use of this identifier and suggestions for an alternative approach have been made. One suggestion is to use m/44'/9'/a'/c/i as described in the documentation for slip-0044. This would help avoid the need for an internal mapping from 9'-&gt;0' to find out what blockchain to query, which should be trivial for any wallet. It is important to consider these suggestions in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the blockchain system.</summary>
