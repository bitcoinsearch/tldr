    <summary>The conversation is about the ongoing debate on block size in Bitcoin. One of the participants suggests creating a wiki page to condense information and make it easily accessible. However, they do not have permission to create the page. Another participant offers to help, as they are not sure about the nuances of where Bitcoin XT fits in. There is also a suggestion to create a testnet4 with 8mb blocks, but it has not been done yet. The conversation ends with plans to continue working on the issue and getting public comment by sharing it on /r/Bitcoin. A git repo is created to avoid exclusive-by-default wiki policies.</summary>
