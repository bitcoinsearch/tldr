    <summary>Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his skepticism towards the proposal that aims to enforce strict transaction ordering requirements. Maxwell noted that this is because such requirements could potentially conflict with future soft-forks that may impose further ordering constraints. Additionally, he believes that even without consensus rules, there may be invisible constraints in systems such as hardware wallets that sign top-down or future transaction covenants that have constraints about ordering. However, he notes that motivations for the proposal are understated and that an alternative would be to privately derandomize the ordering. He also suggests that collaborative transaction systems like coinjoins or micropayment channels might be driving the need for this proposal. Rusty, another Bitcoin developer, agrees with Maxwell's concern and adds that he was implementing deterministic permutations for lightning, where signature exchange requires both sides to agree on ordering.</summary>
