    <summary>In an email exchange, Pindar Wong expressed his interest in collaborating with Constance Choi, Primavera De Filippi, and Peter Todd to conduct more science-driven investigations on Bitcoin's block size issue. Peter Todd mentioned his presence at a conference in London where the block size issue was being discussed among attendees with different views than those seen on Reddit. Wong also noted that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority considers Bitcoin a virtual commodity rather than a currency, but regulatory questions extend beyond local jurisdictions to customers' jurisdictions. Ultimately, the entire Bitcoin community is involved in buying new coins produced by miners and paying fees to them.</summary>
