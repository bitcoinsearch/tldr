    <summary>In an email exchange between Adam Weiss and Pieter, the former mentioned that project admins may be able to download mbox archives of a list from SF. He suggested that new admins could import these archives to maintain archive consistency in one place. Pieter confirmed that this was indeed possible as he had already downloaded the entire archive of the list which took only a few seconds and was 64 Mbyte in size.</summary>
