    <summary>The email discussion is about the debate regarding the majority's right to dictate over the minority and whether enforcing rules agreed upon by the majority or supermajority would benefit the minority as well. The author believes that if the majority leaves and creates an altcoin, it will leave the remaining minority with a less valuable product or service. Hence, one must be cautious while deciding this matter. The author also suggests that if a hardfork happens, it should include a smart change that enables future changes requiring hardforks simpler and with fewer risks. Jorge Timon points out that there is no decentralized way of voting that works, and running 1000 nodes could lead to sybil attacks, making it impossible to gauge what the majority wants. He further argues that the majority has no right to dictate to the minority, and if some people want a more centralized version of Bitcoin, they can create an altcoin too. Finally, he questions whether Dogecoin already has big blocks.</summary>
