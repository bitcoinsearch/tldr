    <summary>In this email conversation, a wallet developer responds to questions about updating software to support extension blocks. The developer expresses concern that if an exchange supports extension blocks and they withdraw to a wallet that doesn't, the money will never arrive from their perspective, resulting in a potential disaster. They also argue that payments must be reliable and wallets must be compatible with each other. The developer disagrees with the idea that a Lightning-style approach would work, citing danger, inflexibility, and worse decentralization. They also express concern about using companies as a sounding board and ignoring the opinions of those providing services to the community. Overall, the developer is not in favor of extension blocks or any other contraption that exists purely to work around theoretical objections by Blockstream employees.</summary>
