    <summary>The conversation is about the risk of increasing the limit on block size, with some people advocating for a "software fork" to see how many people are in favor. However, there is no way to accurately gauge the majority opinion due to the possibility of sybil attacks and miners having an incentive to remove the limit altogether. It is debated whether the moral right of the majority to dictate to the minority should be considered in this discussion. Ultimately, if some people want a more centralized version of Bitcoin, they can create an altcoin.</summary>
