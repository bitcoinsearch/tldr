    <summary>In an email exchange between Milly Bitcoin and Jeff Garzik, the question of who has the power to make decisions regarding global consensus is discussed. Milly Bitcoin acknowledges that she is not the decider for anything concerning global consensus, but rather it is up to the person who decides if a pull request is accepted to significantly affect the behavior of the global consensus. However, multiple acknowledgements are required from developers who will not act if the community disagrees with the change.Jeff Garzik adds that ultimately, users choose by deciding which software to download, which dictates the range of choices available. He identifies himself as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
