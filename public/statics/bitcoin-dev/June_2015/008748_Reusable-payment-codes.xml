    <summary>In a discussion on bitcointalk.org regarding BIP 63, odinn asked for Peter Todd's input but received no response beyond "my time is better spent focusing on more fundamental issues" and "I've also got no-one interested in funding stealth address development right now." When several people offered to send donations to advance the BIP, no donation address was posted. Todd responded that he was too busy with responding to the blocksize issue to work on BIP 63 at the moment, and suggested that a standard describing the reusable codes aspect, and separately how the ephemeral key is transmitted to the recipient would make sense.</summary>
