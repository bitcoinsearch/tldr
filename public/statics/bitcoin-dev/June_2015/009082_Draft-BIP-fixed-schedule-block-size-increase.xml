    <summary>In a 2015 email, Jeff Garzik questioned the need for BIP100's hard-limit voting mechanism to enforce block size limits. He argued that miners can already collude to lower the block size limit. Garzik suggested that enforcing block size limits against miners might be necessary if the threat model includes the possibility of large miners creating large blocks to gain an advantage over small miners. However, he noted that BIP100 does not address this issue. Instead, he proposed supporting Gavin's simpler 8MB-&gt;8GB hard-limit growth curve and encouraging miners to enforce a soft limit below that through a voting mechanism. This could be implemented at any time without consensus changes.</summary>
