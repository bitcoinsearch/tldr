    <title>Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin Dev mailing list has expressed concern over SourceForge's continued hosting of the mailing list due to the company's questionable behavior and perceived stability. While there isn't much that SourceForge could do to harm an open discussion list, the community would like to move the list to a neutral and competent entity which is able to professionally maintain infrastructure while being neutral to the content. Suggestions have been made for Google Groups or existing organizations such as the IETF or Linux Foundation to host the mailing list, but these options were deemed too controversial. After discussions with the Linux Foundation, it was agreed that the LF would be a competent, neutral place to host dev lists for the long-term. The proposal is only about hosting the discussion list, and the LF would have no control over the Bitcoin Project. The proposed action plan includes discussing this openly within the community, migrating the current list admins to the new host, importing the entire list archive into the new host's archives for user convenience, and killing bitcoin-list and bitcoin-test. The appropriateness of auto-importing the subscriber list to another list server remains a tough question.</summary>
