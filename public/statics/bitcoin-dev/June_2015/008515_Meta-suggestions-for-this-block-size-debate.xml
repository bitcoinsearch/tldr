    <summary>The email chain discusses the BlockSizeDebate project linked on GitHub and its progress. The template for Arguments 3, 4, 6, and a full Argument 2 has been pushed while Argument 5 is not yet defined. It is suggested that Argument 6 may be merged with Argument 4 if necessary. The project can be found at https://github.com/EthanHeilman/BlockSizeDebate. The discussion also touches upon the need to create a wiki page to condense information about the debate and avoid rehashing old arguments. The email suggests that a few days from then, the project should be posted to /r/Bitcoin to get more public comments on it.</summary>
