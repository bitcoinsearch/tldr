    <summary>In a message sent to the Bitcoin development mailing list on June 19, 2015, Brooks Boyd inquired about the possibility of reducing the time between blocks to allow for quicker clearing of pending transactions. Boyd suggested that if blocks were allowed to come twice as fast, they could clear transactions in the mempool at the same rate as if the block size doubled. This would keep mining more decentralized since miners wouldn't have to work on such large-scale blocks. However, Boyd also acknowledged that this would require more storage space to store the blockchain. The email was part of a larger conversation about the scalability of Bitcoin and how to address its growing transaction volume.</summary>
