    <summary>The conversation between Peter Todd and Gavin Andresen focuses on the benefits of producing larger, more-fee blocks that propagate slowly. There is also a benefit in including high-fee transactions that may not propagate quickly through optimized relay protocols. The effect of including these transactions is likely an order of magnitude less important than producing larger blocks. Gavin questions the relevance of their simulations when considering Matt's fast relay network and future optimization of block propagation. Peter suggests simulating the relay network assuming 100% usage and 100%-x usage to analyze if it is in miners' advantage to sabotage the network. The conversation ends with Peter's contact information.</summary>
