    <summary>The context discusses the need for a minimum modification policy to preserve digital signatures and make mbox archives more useful. The issue lies in the "mbox" archives, which are broken and not verifiable, resulting in valuable content being lost. They are also missing original headers necessary for fully replyable, threadable, sortable, searchable, context-preserving use by users MUA's in their local environment, and do not include attachments such as patches, signatures, images, crypto, data that are essential to the context and archives of all lists. Additionally, there appear to be instances of unescaped '^From' in the "mbox". To address these issues, the full raw archives should be provided in regularly updated [gzip/7z] mbox format. Other mirrors, archives, analysis, journalism, and interfaces are useful, but they require pristine historical sources to seed from. The message footers and subject prefix should also be turned off, as they are corruptive and space-wasting clutter.</summary>
