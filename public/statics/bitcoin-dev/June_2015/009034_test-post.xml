    <summary>On June 22, 2015, Nathan Wilcox sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, introducing himself. He listed his contact information, including his email address and Twitter handle, and shared his PGP key. The email was signed with a GnuPG v1 signature. In the signature, Wilcox promoted two projects: abis.io, which he described as "a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and a new social good," and Keybase.io, where he had a profile under the username odinn.</summary>
