    <summary>StrawPay is developing a cheap and secure micropayments system, but hasn't released any details publicly. There's a discussion on Reddit about the company, but they are developing it before publishing more details that could change post-implementation. In another discussion, someone is asking for an ETA on when the blocksize increase code will go in Bitcoin XT. Gavin is still writing patches and once they are reviewed, it will be assumed that the code will go in unless there are other issues.</summary>
