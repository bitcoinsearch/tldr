    <summary>In an email thread, Eric Lombrozo suggests explicitly defining a non-repudiation mechanism in the protocol instead of relying on assumptions. He recommends not relying on the existence of a signed transaction as proof of intent to pay. In response, Peter Todd mentions his Proofchains work and how using single-use-seals in a consensus blockchain can make details of a smart contract protocol unobservable to anyone without the data behind those hashes. Todd includes a link for prior-art exposure to his Proofchains work. The email ends with a digital signature.</summary>
