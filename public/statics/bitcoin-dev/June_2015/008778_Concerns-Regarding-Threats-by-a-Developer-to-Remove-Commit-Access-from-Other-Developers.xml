    <summary>Wladimir J. van der Laan, a contributor to the Bitcoin Core project, responded to criticisms that the project is "run like Wikipedia" or an "edit war". He pointed out that there have only been two reversions in over 5,500 commits made in six years. Furthermore, he stated that allegations that anyone with commit access can block change are untrue. The Bitcoin Core project has no decision-making ability and any disagreement can cause controversy, leading to Wladimir's reluctance to touch an issue.</summary>
