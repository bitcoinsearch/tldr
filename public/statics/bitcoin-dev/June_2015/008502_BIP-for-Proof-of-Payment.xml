    <summary>In a conversation dated June 6, 2015, Pieter Wuille and Kalle Rosenbaum discussed the concept of "Proof of Payment" (PoP) which is a commitment to a transaction that proves its validity without necessarily indicating that an actual payment has taken place or preventing double-spending. Rosenbaum suggested that instead of making PoPs valid transactions, they could change the signature hashing algorithm by adding a second hashing step or prepending a constant string to render the signatures unusable for actual transactions while still committing to the same transaction. However, Wuille stated that making PoPs invalid as transactions would simplify implementation but admitted that it would be a cleaner specification if they made the PoP invalid as a transaction. They also discussed alternative methods such as adding a 21M BTC output at the end or bit flipping the txin prevout hashes, among others, that are guaranteed to invalidate it. Wuille was open to changes in naming and suggested that a simpler name that explains the main purpose of PoP- proving that you paid for something- is better than a name that exactly tries to explain what it is. Rosenbaum proposed "Proof of Transaction Intent" as a better name, but Wuille stated that he would like to see more name suggestions and added that the name does not prevent people from using it for other purposes, such as internet over telephone network.</summary>
