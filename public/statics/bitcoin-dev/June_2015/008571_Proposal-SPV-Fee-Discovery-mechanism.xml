    <summary>When blocks are full, network congestion can cause transactions to be dropped unpredictably. Therefore, it is critical to know the network congestion right now. However, this can be a lagging indicator based on the last time you connected. To address this issue, there is a need for ways to increase fees on transactions after initial broadcast, such as replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent. Transactions would be dropped in a predictable manner, with lowest fee/KB transactions being dropped first.</summary>
