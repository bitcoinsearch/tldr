    <summary>Peter Todd's tree chain idea was last discussed in Let's Talk Bitcoin episode 104. The idea has not been discussed recently and the reason for this is unknown. It was speculated that the technology would be an alternative to raising the block size, but it is unclear whether any major flaws were discovered. The original discussion on tree chains can be found at https://letstalkbitcoin.com/ltb104-tree-chains-with-peter-todd/.</summary>
