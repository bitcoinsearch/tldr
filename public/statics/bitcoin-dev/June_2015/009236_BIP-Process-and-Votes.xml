    <summary>In an email dated June 28, 2015, Patrick Murck discussed the role of Core Maintainer in managing the Bitcoin Core open-source software project versus the Bitcoin network. The Core Maintainer's role is primarily about managing and ensuring consensus among developers, rather than pushing through changes to the network. Murck noted that Wladimir's position of taking the safest option, even if it risks stagnation, is noble, as it defends the minority. However, despite this ethical position, the majority will typically get what it wants. Murck identified a potential lose-lose scenario if Gavin's fork wins, creating the very problems and risks that Wladimir was trying to avoid. Murck expressed concern that disagreements like these could occur again in the future, with no clear mechanism for resolving them. The situation is likened to a variation of the prisoner's dilemma, where the best solution would be an agreement on both sides, but such an agreement seems unlikely in practice.</summary>
