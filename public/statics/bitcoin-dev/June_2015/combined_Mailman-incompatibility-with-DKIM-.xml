    <summary>The discussion revolves around the compatibility of DKIM signing with mailing lists. Mailman, a popular mailing list management software, does not currently sign emails with DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to take responsibility for the mail itself. However, DKIM signing is highly recommended as it helps spam filters identify the 'owner' of the mail. Suggestions are made to auto-reject DKIM enforced domain postings and any other reason for mail getting stuck in moderation queue, except for spam which may have to be silently dropped to avoid Mailman server becoming a spammer.It has been reported that both the sender and recipient of an email experienced their mail being sent to Gmail's spam folder due to DKIM. The footer has been removed from the mailing list due to its incompatibility with DKIM signing. However, keeping the "[Bitcoin-dev]" prepend tag in the subject is only compatible with DKIM header signing if the poster manually adds it in their subject header.Mike Hearn expressed his displeasure with the need to remove subject tags and footers from the new mailing list for compatibility with DKIM users. He also noted that lists can do what are effectively MITM attacks on people's messages in any way they like if they resign for the messages themselves. The question arises whether Mailman should be resigning it and if other mailing list software does.In an email exchange on June 19, 2015, Adam Weiss suggested a way to detect when someone posts from a domain that publishes a request for strict signature checking for all mails originating from it. By setting dmarc_moderation_action to "Munge from," the list will rewrite the envelope-from to the list's address, while adding Reply-to and setting it to the original sender. However, Jeff Garzik raised concerns that this might change reply behavior for some recipients and accidentally direct mail intended to DKIM-user + list to DKIM-user.Removing subject tags and footers may be acceptable if there is no other choice, as email clients can still extract information from the headers and unsubscribe instructions are often included in them. The best solution is to use a mailing list operator that operates correctly with DKIM/DMARC and does not modify messages in transit or re-sends them under their own identity. The latter approach is risky as it puts the responsibility of spamming on the list operator, leading to a degraded reputation if the server is hacked or spammers post to the lists themselves.DMARC rules are used by heavily phished domains like Google, PayPal, eBay, and BitPay to publish statements that all mail from their domain should be signed correctly. These rules are enforced by major webmail providers including Gmail, but some rusty geek infrastructure has problems with this. To avoid everyone's mail going to the spam folder, it is important to ensure compatibility with DKIM/DMARC and not modify messages in transit or re-send them under their own identity. Spam may have to be silently dropped to avoid Mailman server becoming a spammer.</summary>
