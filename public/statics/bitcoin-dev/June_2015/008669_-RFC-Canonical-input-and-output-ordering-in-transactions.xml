    <summary>In an email exchange, Gregory Maxwell expressed his opposition to a proposal due to two reasons. Firstly, he believes that strict ordering requirements could be incompatible with future soft-forks that may expose additional ordering constraints. Secondly, he states that even in the absence of consensus rules, there may be invisible constraints in systems such as hardware wallets that sign top down or future transaction covenants that have constraints about ordering. Kristov suggested adding a private sorting key for wallets to sort inputs and outputs instead of implementing the proposed strict ordering requirements. However, he noted that adding another key would require special key rotation rules and backup procedures and might not be widely adopted.</summary>
