    <summary>Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, responded to a question on who would provide nodes for a billion mobile phones running SPV wallets. He stated that the SPV wallet author would provide the nodes if they wanted their wallet to function. Additionally, he estimated that the cost to provide service to SPV wallets would be less than $0.01 per month per wallet, which could be taken up by the wallet author or transparently through a payment channel by the user.</summary>
