    <summary>In a Reddit post, Gregory Maxwell stated that if Gavin Andresen were to do a pull request for the block size change and merge it, he would revert it. Mike Hearn commented that he fully believes this would happen. He also mentioned that any such change would be immediately reverted, and that commit rights may be revoked on the assumption that the account had been compromised. Hearn reassured that the allegations of the Bitcoin project being "run like wikipedia" or "an edit war" are false, and suggested checking the commit history.</summary>
