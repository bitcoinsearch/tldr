    <summary>Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth, which states that bandwidth available to high-end users grows by 50% per year, has been debunked. Data points from speed tests done within a city or country cannot be used to model the connectivity of a peer-to-peer network. In China, uplink bandwidth is scarce and expensive, averaging about $37 per 1mbps after 5, but the real issue lies in ISP transparent proxies run in countries like Thailand, Lebanon, and southern France. The solution suggested is to use MPTCP (Multipath TCP), which allows multiple interfaces/networks for a single TCP connection, improving bandwidth and connection stability by combining a local Wi-Fi/Ethernet connection with a 3G phone tether. This allows the user to set up a middle box somewhere, put a Shadowsocks server on it, and route all TCP traffic over the Shadowsocks client, with MPTCP automatically picking the best path for upload and download.</summary>
