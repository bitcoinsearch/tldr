    <summary>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mats Jerratsch called out Jeff Garzik for repeatedly stating that the decision on block size increase is difficult and important without offering any helpful suggestions. Garzik responded by emphasizing the importance of the block size limit in defining the fee market and stated that the size limit needs to be transitioned away from software developers to the free market. He argued that a simple hard fork would not fix higher level governance problems associated with actors lobbying developers. Eric Lombrozo also weighed in, suggesting the need for a voting system for metaconsensus and cautioning against using false choices. The email exchange underscores ongoing debates within the Bitcoin community about how to govern the protocol's development.</summary>
