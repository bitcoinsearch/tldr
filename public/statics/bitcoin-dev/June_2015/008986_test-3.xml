    <summary>On June 21, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a post from an address not subscribed to the list. He stated that the server should have auto-rejected the post and if it went through, there might be something wrong with the configuration. The email contained the usual footer for the mailing list, providing links to subscribe and unsubscribe. Additionally, there was an HTML attachment that was scrubbed, so its content is unknown. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is hosted by the Linux Foundation and allows developers to discuss Bitcoin-related software development.</summary>
