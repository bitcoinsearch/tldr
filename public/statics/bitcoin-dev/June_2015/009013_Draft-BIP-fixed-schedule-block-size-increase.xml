    <summary>On June 22, 2015, Gavin Andresen proposed that the maximum size of Bitcoin blocks shall be 8,000,000 bytes at a timestamp of 2016-01-11 00:00:00 UTC, and shall double every 63,072,000 seconds (two years, ignoring leap years), until 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC. The maximum size of blocks in between doublings will increase linearly based on the block's timestamp. After 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC, the maximum size of blocks shall be 8,192,000,000 bytes. The issue was raised about what would happen if a block following a size increase trigger is back in the past before the size increase. In response to that, Peter Todd suggested using a comparison of the timestamp against the median time, which is guaranteed by the protocol rules to monotonically advance.</summary>
