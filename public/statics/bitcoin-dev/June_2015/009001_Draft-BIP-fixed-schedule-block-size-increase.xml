    <summary>The BIP-100 proposal suggests using a window of 12000 blocks, which is equivalent to 83 days instead of the standard 1000. This makes the threshold lower than usual for hard-forks, leading to possible activation even if less than 75% of miners agree. However, it also means that the vote has to be sustained for longer and gives a longer notice period. The two weeks given for an upgrade warning seems low and there may be an alert on the network. It is unclear if old nodes can detect an upgrade through version numbers or headers only. A "fail" condition could be implemented where, for example, 750 of the last 1000 blocks set bits 4 and 14, which would count as a rejection by 75% of miners. Alternatively, if the rule doesn't activate by 11th Jan 2017, then it is disabled.</summary>
