    <summary>In an email exchange from June 1, 2015 between Gavin Andresen and Oliver Smith, they discussed the ideal maximum block size for Bitcoin. Andresen suggested a maximum of 8 or 4, scaling up slightly less than Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth predicts for the next 20 years. He chose 20 because his testing shows it to be safe and the costs reasonable. Oliver suggested that he would prefer if the power of two were kept, with block sizes increasing from 1MB to 2MB to 4MB to 8MB and so on. However, this was only his personal preference and it remains unclear what the final consensus was.</summary>
