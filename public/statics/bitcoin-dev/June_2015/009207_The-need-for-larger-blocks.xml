    <summary>In an email exchange from 2015 between Jorge Timón and an unknown recipient, the idea of the majority imposing their will on the minority in regards to Bitcoin was discussed. While Timón argued that the majority has no right to dictate to the minority, the recipient countered that Bitcoin does not provide any inherent rights, but rather a choice to participate or not. They also questioned how the majority could be prevented from overriding a minority group, suggesting that it ultimately comes down to incentives and the value of the system. The longest chain with the greatest number of users valuing the token ultimately wins.</summary>
