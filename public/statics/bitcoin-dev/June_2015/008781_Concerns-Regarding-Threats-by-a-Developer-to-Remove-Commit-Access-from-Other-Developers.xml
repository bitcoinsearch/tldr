    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of Bitcoin-XT, a controversial hard fork of the chain. The main concern is that it could potentially split or override the network, and only a few people with recognition would be able to make such a change. The email also mentions that Mike and Gavin had wanted to make a fork in 2014 for different reasons. The discussion then turns to open-source decision making, and how anyone can maintain their own version of the code if they disagree with changes made or not made. Finally, Wladimir expresses his disapproval of a hard fork of the chain, stating that he had no problem with Bitcoin-XT when it was just a patch-set with no consensus changes.</summary>
