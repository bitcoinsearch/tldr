    <summary>In this email thread, the discussion revolves around the proposed Bitcoin-XT hard fork and alternative proposals to avoid it. The initial proposal for a hard fork was made as a last resort if the Bitcoin-core maintainers refused to lift the 1Mb limit. However, there are alternate proposals such as BIP100 or a modified version of Gavin's that ups the limit to 8Mb instead of 20Mb. Some major changes to the non-consensus code can also be made to handle situations when blocks fill up, allowing wallet software to continue working with a send-and-forget use pattern. The only proposal gaining momentum towards consensus is BIP100.The conversation then moves on to who is planning to move to Bitcoin-XT if the hard fork happens. There are concerns raised about personal ownership of the proposed fork and how security and incident response will be dealt with during the duration of the unilateral hard-fork. It is suggested that anyone wishing to fork the protocol should reconsider whether they are truly ready to test/flex their reputation/skills/resources in this way. There is also a discussion about technical miscommunication and evaluating each other's messages more carefully, especially in the world of Bitcoin. The conversation ends with a routine signature and contact information.</summary>
