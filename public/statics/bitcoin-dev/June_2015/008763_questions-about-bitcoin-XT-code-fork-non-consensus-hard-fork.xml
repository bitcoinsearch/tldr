    <summary>In a recent correspondence on the Bitcoin development mailing list, several developers discussed the possibility of reducing or limiting the growth of the blockchain. In one message, Aaron Voisine praised the recent work done by Patrick Strateman to limit mempool size, but questioned whether ejecting transactions from the mempool rather than preemptively refusing them would result in inconsistent transaction propagation and an increase in rebroadcasts. Another developer suggested that it might be reasonable to tell peers what the minimum fee needed for acceptance would be for a particular node. In response to the suggestion that replace-by-fee (RBF) could be used to estimate fees correctly on the first try, Alex Bosworth argued that RBF is an interactive iterative process that is not ideal for mobile wallets where users don't know up front what fee they're going to pay. He also pointed out that, on the receive side, it's much worse since the sender can't be relied upon to do the replacing.</summary>
