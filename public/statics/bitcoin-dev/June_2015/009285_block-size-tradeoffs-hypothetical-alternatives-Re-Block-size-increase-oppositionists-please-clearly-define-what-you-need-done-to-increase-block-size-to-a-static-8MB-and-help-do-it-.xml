    <summary>The concept of "decentralization" is gaining popularity, especially in the context of Bitcoin. This cryptocurrency differentiates itself by preventing double spending without involving a trusted third party. The author of this text has been researching how decentralization can be defined and measured. They share a link to a paper on measuring decentralization of government functions, which provides a framework for defining decentralization metrics in a standard way. While not directly related to Bitcoin, the paper could be useful in understanding how decentralization can be measured.</summary>
