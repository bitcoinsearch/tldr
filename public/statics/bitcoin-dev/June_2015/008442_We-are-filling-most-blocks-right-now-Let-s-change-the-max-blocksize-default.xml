    <summary>Currently, there are high transaction rates being experienced resulting in nearly all blocks being full according to blockchain.info. To combat this issue, it is suggested that the default max block size be increased to 1MB. This will provide more space for the 731MB blocks and avoid being limited by those who do not change their settings from the default option. This suggestion aims to prevent any limitations caused by individuals who are not paying attention to the ongoing discussions regarding this matter.</summary>
