    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient, the topic of Chinese miners losing internet access is discussed. Hearn argues that no one has a right to mine if they cannot do the job, and that mining is more of a responsibility than a right. The conversation touches on the idea that mining is competitive and self-correcting, and that if miners in China cannot compete due to lack of bandwidth, it is their loss. Hearn suggests that the miners could run a node on a server in Taiwan and connect the hardware to it via a VPN, but the conversation ends with both parties agreeing to disagree.</summary>
