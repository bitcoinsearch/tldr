    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn expressed his frustration with the lack of clarity on how decisions are made in Bitcoin Core and who exactly the "core developers" are. He also raised concerns about what would happen if the decision-making process went wrong. However, Pieter Wuille argued that the means for doing a hard fork is convincing the network to run modified code, whether that be a new version of Bitcoin Core or a fork of it, and that maintainers should not be the ones to decide the network's rules. Additionally, Wuille and Gregory Maxwell both stated that they would revert any consensus rule changes implemented without good expectations that the network would adopt them. There are currently working proposals being discussed, but no network change has been proposed with consensus.</summary>
