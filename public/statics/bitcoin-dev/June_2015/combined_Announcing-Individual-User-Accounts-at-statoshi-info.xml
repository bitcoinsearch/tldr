    <summary>Jameson Lopp, a software engineer at BitGo, has announced the support of individual accounts on Statoshi.info. This application provides insight into the operations of Bitcoin Core nodes and Lopp's goal with Statoshi is to give information about the metrics or instrumentation of these nodes. Devs can now create, save and share their own dashboards by following the instructions provided in the Medium post. For those who are unfamiliar with Statoshi, two posts are linked to provide more information. The developer invites anyone who thinks there should be additional metrics or instrumentation added to Statoshi to submit a pull request or issue on GitHub. This move is expected to increase the efficiency of Bitcoin Core nodes and provide more transparency for users. Overall, this new update will allow for more customization and flexibility in monitoring Bitcoin Core nodes.</summary>
