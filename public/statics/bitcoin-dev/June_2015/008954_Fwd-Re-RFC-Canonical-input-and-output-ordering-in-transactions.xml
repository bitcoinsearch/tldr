    <summary>A conversation between Rusty Russell and Jorge Timón was forwarded to discuss the Canonical Input and Output ordering in transactions. During the conversation, Jorge Timón raised a question about commitments that don't use OP_RETURN (i.e., pay2contract commitments). In response, Rusty asked for an explanation of it, which Jorge provided through a short explanation and code from Blockstream's contracthashtool. The code can be used to permute a transaction based on some secret. Rusty further suggested that an informational BIP with simple code could be created as a plan B. However, Jorge expressed his liking towards plan A.</summary>
