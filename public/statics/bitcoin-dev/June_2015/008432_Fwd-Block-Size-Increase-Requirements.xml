    <summary>In this context, there is a conversation between Bitcoin developers on the topic of block size increase requirements. Mike Hearn expresses his opinion that miners in China have no inherent right to mine if they can't do the job and Warren Togami Jr. agrees with him. However, Warren Togami Jr. also mentions that it would be nice if miners outside China can carry on regardless of their internet situation. Thy Shizzle responds to the conversation by saying that building something that dis-incentivizes mining is not a good idea and it's naive to say "too bad so sad" to miners who are being outcompeted. Later, Warren Togami Jr. clarifies his statement by saying that nobody has the inherent right to mine if they can't do the job. He further adds that if miners outside China can't get the trivial amounts of bandwidth required through their firewall and end up being outcompeted then it's too bad, we'll have to carry on without them. Mike Hearn suggests that miners in China can always run a node on a server in Taiwan and connect the hardware to it via VPN or so.The person who started the thread expresses disappointment at Mike Hearn's statement and says that it's insensitive. They also apologize to anyone who misunderstood their post, explaining that it was sarcasm and they didn't mean to exclude anyone.</summary>
