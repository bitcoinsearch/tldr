    <summary>On June 10th, 2015, Andy Schroder suggested switching the Bitcoin-development mailing list to a new provider in order to solve issues such as delay in delivery, confusion caused by ads at the footer of messages, and broken digital signatures due to list server modifications. Additionally, he proposed a pay-per-message or byte solution that could motivate people to be concise with their messages while limiting spam. Another member, s7r, argued against moving to a paid solution and encouraged people to join the community and contribute ideas freely. Meanwhile, Wladimir J. van der Laan had no opinion on the matter but noted that all downloads from SourceForge had been deleted due to concerns about the website's security. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, also signed off on the email.</summary>
