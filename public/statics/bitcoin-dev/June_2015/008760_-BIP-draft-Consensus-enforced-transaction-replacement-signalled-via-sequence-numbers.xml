    <summary>On June 17, 2015, Mark Friedenbach requested the assignment of a BIP number for a work that had been publicly discussed, its code available and reviewed, and several community issues resolved. He asked the BIP editor to assign a number to allow the BIP consensus process to proceed. The suggested BIP number was 68, unless there were objections.</summary>
