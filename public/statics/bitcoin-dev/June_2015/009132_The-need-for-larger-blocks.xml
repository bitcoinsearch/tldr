    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin developer, has suggested that blockchains are ultimately dispute resolution mechanisms and the vast majority of crypto negotiation will be taking place at levels lesser than global consensus in the future. Block size issue is really a usability issue at this point and requires to solve two fundamental things: there's no model for how we'll introduce a fee market, even though the design of Bitcoin fundamentally depends on fees for its survival (at least in the current form of the design) and there's no mechanism for how to perform fee bidding and estimation. Lombrozo also suggests that if they ever intend to take Bitcoin mainstream, they will most likely experience at least a short time of exponential growth, until they either reach an inherent limitation or until they saturate.</summary>
