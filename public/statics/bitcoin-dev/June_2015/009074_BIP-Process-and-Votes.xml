    <summary>This conversation thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the process for establishing a new testnet network and the consensus decision-making process for implementing changes to Bitcoin Core. One user provides an example of changing all the testnet chain parameters to create a separate testnet network, and another user uses this to test block propagation latency. The discussion then shifts to the need for a well-defined process for testing and telemetry before voting on consensus changes. One user expresses frustration with the perceived lack of a coherent plan or process, particularly around consensus-code changes, which must be unanimous. They argue that a defined process is necessary to reduce risk and wasted effort, but others counter that the carefully constructed process currently in place does work and is well-documented. They point out that changes to non-consensus sections of Bitcoin Core can be merged with a few reviews, tests, and ACKs from recognized developers, while consensus-changes undergo an extremely long discussion period involving all relevant stakeholders, with deployment only after no significant objections remain. Consensus-code changes are made unanimously to ensure that everyone is made aware of the change and consents to it. The thread also touches on the issue of personality-driven discussions and the incentive for new developers to come in, as they may be paid by companies who want to influence the code. One user argues that until personality-based arguments can be separated out, defining a real process will be difficult. Another user raises the question of who should get to vote on approval to commit a BIP implementation into Bitcoin Core and whether a simple majority is sufficient for approval. The conversation ends with links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and other resources.</summary>
