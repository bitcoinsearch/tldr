    <summary>The proposal suggests a new process for submitting draft BIPs that affect the block chain consensus rules or the peer-to-peer protocol and require changes to Bitcoin Core. The proposal defines criteria for the verdict that will be delivered by the Bitcoin Core maintainer within three weeks of submission. The maintainer must provide a clear, specific list of actionable steps for the author if the BIP is rejected, including instructions for how to create a patch set and initiate a hard fork where necessary. Once rejected, a BIP may live on in the BIPS repository, with its entry sorted below others. The BIP author may update the BIP with a summary of any resulting discussion, but the author's wording of the summary is final and not subject to meta-debate.</summary>
