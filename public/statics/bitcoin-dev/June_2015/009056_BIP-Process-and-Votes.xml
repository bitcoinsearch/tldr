    <summary>In a thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user Raystonn posed a question regarding the process for approving a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) implementation into Bitcoin Core. The discussion centered around who should be allowed to vote on approval, and what constitutes a sufficient majority for approval. There is no formal voting process in place; instead, developers commit changes that they believe the community will accept and use. Users have the power to "fire" developers by choosing different devs or software. This process follows the standard open source method. The thread also noted that BIPs are accepted into the BIP repository with a low "reasonable" threshold, while code is accepted into the Bitcoin Core repo when it is likely that the community will accept a change.</summary>
