    <summary>The author proposes the use of time-locked encryption to create a serial chain of time-lock encrypted GPG keys at N minute intervals. This method can be used to encrypt ECDSA keys that could then be employed in multi-signature contract schemes, providing a decentralized and trustless way to execute refunds in contract protocols. The author suggests that this method could also be utilized to build unbreakable DACs where participants are incentivized to decrypt themselves, eliminating the need for perpetual third-party management. Despite the potential flaw in the integrity of the timechain, the author believes that if generated securely by a reputable party, companies could entirely secure their systems using this method. The author provides several sources for further reading on the subject.</summary>
