    <summary>The conversation between Greg and Wladimir revolves around the concept of perfect representation of an entire community. Greg argues that it is a strange bar to set, as it would mean that nothing can be controversial if a different group disagrees. Wladimir clarifies that while something can still be controversial even with N-1 NACK's, the entire network needs to agree to switch to new software. This leads to a discussion on whether the majority should dictate the minority or vice versa. Ultimately, the conversation ends with the possibility of a software fork being an inevitable resolution.</summary>
