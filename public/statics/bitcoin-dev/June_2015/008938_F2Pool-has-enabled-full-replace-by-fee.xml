    <summary>In a discussion about the design of the Bitcoin network's ability to withstand double-spend attacks, Eric Lombrozo argued that the network should be designed with this requirement in mind. However, another participant disagreed, citing Satoshi's statement that as long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they will generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The participant clarified that they interpret "attacking the network" as attempting to rewrite valid, proof-of-work-timestamped history, rather than alternative policies. They also emphasized that unconfirmed transactions are not yet part of history and that ordering them without a universal clock is impossible, which is why proof of work is used. Finally, they noted that alternative policies are not attacks on the network.</summary>
