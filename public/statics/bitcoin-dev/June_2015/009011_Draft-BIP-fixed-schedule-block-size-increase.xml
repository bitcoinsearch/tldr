    <summary>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Kalle Rosenbaum, some issues with the Bitcoin specification were discussed. Firstly, there was confusion about the use of "t_start" in the specification, which Andresen agreed to fix. Secondly, Rosenbaum raised concerns about miners being able to manipulate the max block size by manipulating the time stamp in the block header within valid limits. This could potentially result in negative max block sizes after activation. Andresen suggested that instead of complicating the code and spec, the activation date should be the later of the miner supermajority and January 11, 2016, with the first big block two weeks later.</summary>
