    <summary>In a discussion about incentivizing people to run full nodes, Kevin Greene suggests that punishing users who use Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets is not an ideal approach to encourage them. He argues that SPV is currently the best way for mobile phones to participate in a decentralized network and penalizing them would make the user experience more confusing and annoying. However, he questions who would provide the nodes for SPV wallets if a billion mobile phones wanted to run them tomorrow and suggests that paying for connectivity wouldn't be any more confusing or annoying than transaction fees. He proposes that if some full nodes started offering paid connection slots, users who opted for it would have an easier time connecting than those who didn't, similar to how paying transaction fees makes it faster and more probable for it to get mined.</summary>
