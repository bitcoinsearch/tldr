    <summary>In an email conversation between Dr. Adam Back and Eric Lombrozo, they discuss the idea of companies killing off layer 2 technology in Bitcoin because it doesn't fit their short-term goals. Lombrozo argues that these ideas are too powerful to be killed forever and will survive in a different network under a different name. He also points out that there is still a lot of untapped brainpower available to make serious contributions to the Bitcoin movement, and just because someone runs a Bitcoin startup doesn't mean they have low standards or are lazy. Lombrozo believes that someone will eventually create something better than what we can imagine now, and that first mover advantage and the network effect are overrated. He cites examples such as the Mac vs Windows PC, Yahoo! vs Google, and MySpace vs Facebook, with Bitcoin potentially being relegated to the history books and museums.</summary>
