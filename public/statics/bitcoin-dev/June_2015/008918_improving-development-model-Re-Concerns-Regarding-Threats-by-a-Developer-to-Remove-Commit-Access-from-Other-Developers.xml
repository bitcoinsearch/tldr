    <summary>In an email exchange on June 19th, 2015, Mike Hearn expressed his concern regarding the position of Blockstream employees who he claimed believed that hard forks should never happen and that all transactions should go through a new network. Hearn stated that if his own company was working on new ideas that required a hard fork, he would be dismayed to see the blocksize hard fork happen before those ideas were ready as it would make it harder to convince people to implement them later. He suggested that if this reason were the true motive behind the Blockstream's opposition towards the blocksize hard fork, then they have been hiding their true motives for making such a fuss about the issue. Hearn stated that he had no evidence to support his thoughts, but it was a valid question just like Adam's query into the motives of others involved in Bitcoin. The email exchange highlighted the ongoing debate around the implementation of a blocksize hard fork in Bitcoin, with some opposing parties arguing that it would create security issues while others believed it was necessary to accommodate the growing number of transactions.</summary>
