    <summary>The author of a block size BIP has requested improvements to the process for clarity and transparency. While a BIP is being written by Gavin, the current BIP 1 is unclear and in need of improvement. The procedure calls for public vetting and community feedback before submitting a BIP for review, but the entire Bitcoin community is not on the list, leading to criticism for lack of wider feedback. Once a BIP is written, it must meet certain criteria and represent a net improvement, but the BIP process does not state how acceptance will happen or how decisions are made in the case of disagreement over a consensus BIP.</summary>
