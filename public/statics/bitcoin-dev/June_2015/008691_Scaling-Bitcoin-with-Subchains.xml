    <summary>On June 15, 2015, Pieter Wuille sent an email stating that either you validate everything or you don't validate anything when it comes to blockchain. He claimed that sidechains do not provide a useful compromise and add complexity and huge delays. However, Jeff Garzik responded by saying that although he agrees with the added complexity of sidechains, they can be a solution for scaling long-term. Jeff compared sidechains to git repos and merges, where having aggregation chains that arbitrarily fork and then rejoin the main chain is feasible and useful. While this solution is still a ways away from production, Jeff believes it should not be dismissed as a solution for scaling in the future.</summary>
