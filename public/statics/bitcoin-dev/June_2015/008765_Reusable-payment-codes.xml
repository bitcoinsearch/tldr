    <summary>In this message exchange, Peter Todd expresses his inclination to shelve work on BIP63 for now due to the huge amount of work he'll likely have responding to the blocksize issue. He suggests that someone else could take it up since a (&gt;=2)-part standard describing the reusable codes aspect and separately how the ephemeral key is transmitted to the recipient makes sense to him. Odinn responds with disappointment and queries why Peter could not post a donation address since several people offered to send donations to see the BIP (63) advance. Peter suggests that Odinn or someone else can take it up if they are interested in working on it. If someone has interest in working on it, Peter requests that they go to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1083961.0 and reply there.</summary>
