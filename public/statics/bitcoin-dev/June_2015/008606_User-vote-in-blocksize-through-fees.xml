    <summary>The discussion among members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list is focused on the current state of miner incentives and their potential to influence the voting process. Eric Lombrozo notes that miners currently collect very little revenue from fees, and therefore have more of an incentive to block transactions or spam their votes rather than adapt to the preferences of transaction senders. He suggests that users would need to significantly increase their transaction fees in order to change this. However, without wallets that can make decent suggestions in this regard, this feature will be almost inaccessible to most regular users. Jannes Faber imagines Peter's proposal involves counting only the votes in the blocks, not the transaction votes themselves, which could lead to miners excluding counter-voting transactions at the risk of losing money. Matt Whitlock adds that while miners could fill their blocks with garbage transactions that agree with their vote, they wouldn't receive any real income as they'd be paying their own money as fees to themselves. To get real income, miners would have to vote in accordance with real users.</summary>
