    <title>FYI - Mailing List Move Preparations</title>

    <summary>The #bitcoin-dev community has decided against linking the old and new email lists during a transition period, instead opting to announce the switchover soon and reject all posts to the old list with a message directing them to the new one. The switchover is scheduled for Tuesday, June 23rd, 2015, with an exact time to be determined. Archives will be exported and imported into the new list server before it is opened, and users are encouraged to subscribe now and make test posts to help test configuration options to fix spam filter-related issues. Any posts to the new list prior to the final switchover will be wiped from the archives. Those with opinions on this decision are invited to join the discussion in Freenode #bitcoin-dev and speak to Warren Togami.</summary>
