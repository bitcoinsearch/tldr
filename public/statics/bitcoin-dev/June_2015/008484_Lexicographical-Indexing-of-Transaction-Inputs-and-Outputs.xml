    <summary>Kristov Atlas, a contributor to the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project and a security engineer at Blockchain.info, has written a draft of a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to standardize the sorting of transaction inputs and outputs for privacy and security reasons. Wallet clients currently lack a standard for ordering inputs and outputs, resulting in a discernible blockchain fingerprint that can leak private information about their users. Kristov's proposed solution is deterministic lexicographical sorting, which uses hashes of previous transactions and output indices to sort inputs, and value and locking scripts to sort outputs. He has requested feedback from a wider audience before aiming for a bip number to be assigned and having the proposal accepted into https://github.com/bitcoin/bips. The full text of the proposal can be found at https://github.com/kristovatlas/rfc/blob/master/bips/bip-li01.mediawiki.</summary>
