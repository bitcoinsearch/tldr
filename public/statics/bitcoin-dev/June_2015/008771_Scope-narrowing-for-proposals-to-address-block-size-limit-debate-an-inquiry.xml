    <summary>The post presents an inquiry regarding the possible narrowing of proposals that are likely to "bear fruit" in addressing the whole block size limit debate meaningfully. The author asks if there are some proposals that are more likely to succeed than others and presents examples such as Jeff Garzik's BIP 100, Adam Back's simplified soft-fork one-way peg, and Gavin Andresen's 8 MB block size limit adjustment. However, this assumes developers are willing to abandon contentious proposals like the "hard fork to XT w/ 20 MB." The author acknowledges Wladimir J. van der Laan's statement that pushing a hard fork in the face of controversy is a folly and danger to the network. The post ends with an invitation for thoughts and comments.</summary>
