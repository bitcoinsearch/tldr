    <summary>The author of this text is attempting to gather feedback in order to create an informational BIP about why and how hardforks can be deployed. The scope of this discussion is only hardforks and softforks in a more abstract way, so the author asks that users do not discuss block size issues in this thread. Sometimes block size changes are used as examples because no other example came to mind. However, non-blocksize-related examples for the same cases are welcomed, and if we go into too much detail they stop being useful as examples. The author invites readers to make suggestions or bike-shed some of the terms. The full text can be found on the author's Github page at https://github.com/jtimon/bips/blob/bip-forks/bip-forks.org.</summary>
