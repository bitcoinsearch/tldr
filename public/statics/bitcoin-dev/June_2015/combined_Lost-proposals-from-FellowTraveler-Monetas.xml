    <summary>Fellow Traveler, a member of the community, has been waiting for nine months for progress on proposals related to BIP-drafts found at https://github.com/Open-Transactions/rfc/tree/master/bips. However, they cannot locate any discussion or information regarding "Base58 Serialization for Transaction-Based Color Descriptors" or "Order-based Smart Property Coloring" or the draft names bip-ccids despite searching their email and list archives and asking others.In an email thread from 2015, Gregory Maxwell asked about the status of BIP-drafts related to Base58 Serialization for Transaction-Based Color Descriptors and Order-based Smart Property Coloring. Fellow Traveler had been waiting for nine months for progress on these proposals and there seemed to be no discussion or activity on them. Despite searching his email and mailing list archives, Maxwell found nothing. The only two proposals that were sent were attached to a post on Sourceforge.The rest of the proposals in the repository at Open-Transactions/rfc and Monetas/rfc were never submitted because alternative identifiers were used instead of BIP numbers. It is unclear where the breakdown occurred but Fellow Traveler is considering creating threads for each proposal under the assumption that there was a mailing list error. The email from Maxwell had a PGP signature at the end.</summary>
