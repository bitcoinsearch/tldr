    <summary>In an email exchange on June 4, 2015, Daniel Stadulis made a comment that was deemed off-topic and inappropriate by Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist. Stadulis's original message is not provided, but Garzik's response suggests it was not appropriate for a technical mailing list. Garzik also includes a signature noting his role as a BitPay employee and providing a link to the company's website.</summary>
