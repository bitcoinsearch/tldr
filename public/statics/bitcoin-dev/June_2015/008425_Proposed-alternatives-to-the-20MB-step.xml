    <summary>It seems that a proposal to raise capacity in the Bitcoin ecosystem is causing controversy among core developers. While some see it as a no-brainer and necessary for the system's growth, others believe they have veto power over changes to Bitcoin and are out of step with the wider community. This disagreement could lead to a fork in the system. However, the value of Bitcoin is not solely based on decentralization, but also on its usage. There are proposals for layer 2 and offchain solutions, such as LN and ChainDB, but incentivizing developers to implement them may not be effective. It would require a lot of effort and be technically risky, and may not even align with the interests of those who initially got involved with Bitcoin. Additionally, new solutions may constantly emerge, making it difficult to keep up with the ever-changing landscape. Therefore, while there are potential solutions, implementing them is not a straightforward task.</summary>
