    <summary>The Tor team encourages active participation from Tor nodes, preferably exit, middle and guard nodes rather than just client nodes. The documentation for Bitcoin.SE does not deal much with configuration tweaking Tor as out of the box Tor participates actively in the Tor network. Tor is not solely implemented for web browsing and there are other uses such as the Tor configuration item `LongLivedPorts` and its implications. It is not necessary to tweak this option for Bitcoin although it may be done. A long-term solution proposed to link the Bitcoin traffic with something like node-Tor which is much more lightweight, easier to use/configure/maintain and doesn't require the onions RDV concepts and addresses. Using Tor for something else other than browsing is seen as a workaround by some individuals. There is an ongoing effort to upgrade the Bitcoin P2P protocol to support other address types including onion v3. Bitcoin client core currently supports the use of tor hidden service and supports v2 hidden service. There is progress being made to create a new bitcoin node which will use v3 hidden service instead of v2. Efforts are also being made to support longer addresses used by i2p and tor v3.</summary>
