    <summary>The author suggests linking Bitcoin traffic with something like node-Tor as a better long term solution. Node-Tor is much lighter and easier to use/configure/maintain, not using tons of libraries prone to security/maintenance issues. The author proposes a separate network using the Tor protocol over TCP, WebSockets and WebRTC, making it possible also for browsers to relay the traffic. Nodes discovery could be linked to the bitcoin peer discovery system, and for a p2p network, two hops would be enough. The author does not think that the Tor network is designed and adapted to support bitcoin nodes but there is effort ongoing to upgrade the Bitcoin P2P protocol to support other address types, including onion v3. The post on this ML under the title "addrv2" provides further information and review and contributions to that effort are welcome. Bitcoin client core supports use of tor hidden service and v2 hidden service. The author is in progress of creating a new bitcoin node which will use v3 hidden service instead of v2. The author is looking at bitcoin core and btcd to use and asks if any of these or current node software support the v3 onion addresses for the node address. The author suggests implementing part of the bitcoin protocol, like https://peersm.com/wallet, for light clients and connecting it in a secure way to bitcoin nodes to retrieve info from the utxo set and send txs.</summary>
