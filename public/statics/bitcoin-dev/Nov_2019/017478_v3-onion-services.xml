    <summary>Bitcoin Core currently supports v2 Tor hidden services, but not yet v3. The use of v3 ephemeral service is not necessary for node connectivity, but allows for hidden listening so that other nodes can connect privately without using the public internet or exposing the node's public IP or ports. While it is not urgent to add v3 support, it will eventually be essential as Tor drops support for v2. Bitcoin Core's limit of 128-bit addresses in the p2p protocol requires a rework to support longer v3 onion addresses. For now, those who want a Tor-only full node are best to use v2 onion services. It is possible to use both v2 and v3 onion services simultaneously in the same Tor configuration file.</summary>
