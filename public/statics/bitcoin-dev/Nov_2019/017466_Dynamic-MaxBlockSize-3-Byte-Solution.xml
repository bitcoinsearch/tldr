    <summary>The conversation between Hampus Sj√∂berg and Luke pertains to the current block size of Bitcoin which is 1 MB. While Hampus believes that the average block size will go down when exchanges start using Lightning or Liquid, Luke disagrees as long as spam continues to pad blocks full. When discussing the possibility of increasing the block size, Hampus suggests that it should only be done through a hard fork, to which Luke points out that there may not be a consensus for a blocksize increase hardfork due to past malicious attempts. They also discussed the use of extension blocks, with Hampus arguing that they are unreasonably convoluted while Luke argues that they are still a softfork since old nodes can still follow the mainchain. Ultimately, they both agree that any changes made should have consensus in order to maintain the stability and security of Bitcoin.</summary>
