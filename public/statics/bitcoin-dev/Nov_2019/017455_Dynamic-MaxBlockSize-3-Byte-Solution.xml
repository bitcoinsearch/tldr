    <title>Dynamic MaxBlockSize - 3 Byte Solution</title>

    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has received a proposal for Dynamic MaxBlockSize, which involves adding a 3 byte variable factor to the white space in the current block. The proposal aims to address concerns about block size and scaling without compromising security or changing existing rules. However, some members of the community have expressed skepticism towards the proposal, with one member stating that it fundamentally misunderstands what scaling is. Another member believes that fees will need to be the main part of miners' reward at some point, and that keeping them forever low will compromise network security. There are also concerns about decentralization if blocks get too big. While Segwit increased possibilities for using space more efficiently, it remains to be seen if advanced offchain constructions such as channel factories are enough to deal with block size issues in the future. Overall, there appears to be divided opinion on whether or not the proposed solution is worth pursuing.</summary>
