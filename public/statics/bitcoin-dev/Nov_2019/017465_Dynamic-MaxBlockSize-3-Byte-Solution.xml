    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Hampus Sjöberg suggested keeping the block size low for now but increasing it in the future when needed, preferably through an extension block. However, Luke Dashjr disagreed and stated that extension blocks are not softforks and are too convoluted for no real gain. He believes that when the time comes to increase the block size, it should only be done through a hardfork. The idea of a hardfork block size increase may face challenges in getting consensus due to hijack attempts made in the past. Dashjr also pointed out that the current block size is not low. They both hope that when exchanges start using Lightning or Liquid, the average block size will go down.</summary>
