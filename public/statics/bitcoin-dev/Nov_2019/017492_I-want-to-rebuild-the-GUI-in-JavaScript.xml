    <summary>A front-end for Bitcoin is available at https://bitcoin.electronrelocation.com, but the developer has stopped development due to time constraints. The live demo accepts payments and sends them via QR codes. The source code is available via AGPLv3 at https://git.esotericnonsense.com/pub/bitcoin-top.git. A discussion on whether to rebuild Bitcoin Core GUI using the JavaScript Electron framework was held on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One suggestion was to have Electron drive the UI by running bitcoind and communicating with it through RPC, but there are concerns about achieving feature-parity with the Qt implementation. Additionally, a secure dependency management solution should be in place for such a GUI. There is some question as to whether this new Electron UI would ever replace the Qt UI, but it could exist as an independent client.</summary>
