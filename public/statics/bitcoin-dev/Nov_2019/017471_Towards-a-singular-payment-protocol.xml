    <summary>The proposal to add a new URI scheme for wallet developers is not seen as beneficial by Ben. He identifies three main problems with the proposal. Firstly, other schemes will continue to exist alongside this new one, creating additional work for developers without making their lives any easier. Secondly, as payment systems become more complex, simple URI schemes like this will become less suitable and future-proof. Finally, there is no reasonable way to define the attributes and potential errors that may arise, leading to incompatible and misunderstood implementations. Overall, Ben does not see the merits of this proposal.</summary>
