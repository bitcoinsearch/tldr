    <summary>A proposal for a dynamic max block size solution called "DMBS" has been put forward on the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Trevor Groves. The proposal suggests adding a 3-byte variable factor to the white space in the current block, which would allow for the adjustment of the maximum block size based on market demand. The ruleset evaluates the total block transaction fees and the average transaction fees of the last 100 blocks, and adjusts the max block size accordingly if certain conditions are met. The proposal also includes safety measures to prevent bloat and limit changes to one every 3 hours. The community is being asked for feedback on whether the current block can accommodate the 3-byte variable and if solving the scaling issue is worth using the extra space.</summary>
