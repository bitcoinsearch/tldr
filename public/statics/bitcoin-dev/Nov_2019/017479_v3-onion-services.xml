    <summary>Blockchain Commons has incorporated v3 tor authentication to control a full node remotely using their Bitcoin Standup project, which is currently available only for macOS but will soon be launched on other platforms. The project's documentation can be found on their GitHub page. A video demonstrating how to securely connect remote full nodes to the iOS wallet Fully Noded can also be found on YouTube. For more information on v3 authentication, AnarchoTechNYC's GitHub page provides further details. The development was announced by Christopher Allen.</summary>
