    <summary>The inclusion of version bytes in the xpub in the GLOBAL_XPUB field was questioned, with some suggesting that keeping only the chain code and public key may be sufficient. However, others argued for keeping additional data such as prefixes that define if the key is used for testnet or mainnet. The version bytes were deemed unnecessary and potentially problematic due to conflicting versions on different xpubs in the PSBT. Some have yet to form an opinion on whether or not to include additional data outside of the public key and chain code, but believe it's worth discussing any rationale for including or omitting it. It was also suggested that attaching network data to the PSBT could be better served by using a new key.</summary>
