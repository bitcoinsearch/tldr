    <summary>The writer is interested in rebuilding Bitcoin Core GUI using the JavaScript Electron framework to understand the pros and cons of moving from Qt to Electron. They are seeking information on whether this has been tried before or if there are ongoing efforts in this direction. One approach could be for Electron to drive the UI by running bitcoind and communicating with it through RPC. However, the writer is unsure if such an implementation can achieve feature-parity with the Qt implementation, which has the advantage of direct access to Bitcoin Core code. The writer shares their ideas before proceeding and invites any information on the topic.</summary>
