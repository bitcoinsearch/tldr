    <summary>The bitcoin client core currently supports v2 hidden service using tor. However, the author is in the process of creating a new bitcoin node that will use v3 hidden service instead of v2. The author is exploring options between bitcoin core and btcd to use for this new node. The author is also interested in knowing if either of these or current node software support the v3 onion addresses for the node address and I2P addresses. If not, the author wants to know what it would take to get the software to support the longer addresses used by i2p and tor v3.</summary>
