    <summary>In an email conversation, two individuals discussed Bitcoin protocol standardization. The first individual argued that no individual can dictate "the right way" since Bitcoin is an open protocol. Other protocols won't be deprecated without a strong reason to switch. On the other hand, the second individual believed building a Bitcoin wallet was different from building a cryptocurrency wallet. Therefore, the complexities faced by other cryptocurrencies were not a concern for them.A proposal has been made for a new payment protocol that is not tied to a specific blockchain and can be used with either fiat or cryptocurrency. It includes the ability to make multiple payments and use multiple currencies in a single transaction. The protocol also allows for fees to be paid by either the sender or recipient, with common trusted third parties calculating valuation and fees. However, Ben identified three main problems with the proposal. Firstly, other schemes would continue to exist alongside this new one, creating additional work for developers without making their lives any easier. Secondly, simple URI schemes like this would become less suitable and future-proof as payment systems become more complex. Finally, there is no reasonable way to define the attributes and potential errors that may arise, leading to incompatible and misunderstood implementations.The proposal to merge cryptocurrency URI schemes is being discussed in response to concerns raised by Ben Dewaal. The idea is to merge the major proposed standards into a single standard, which will allow efforts to be focused on a single protocol. This is seen as an opportunity to drop what is not working from existing schemes and move forward with a unified system.In another discussion, one individual opposed the implementation of a second behavior, believing that the current one is superior. They argued that the proposed changes would only add confusion and complexity where it is neither needed nor wanted. The other individual disagreed and believed that a well-written specification should be able to foresee issues of conflict and design around them.Overall, there seems to be a disagreement between the two individuals on whether a second behavior is necessary and whether it would add unnecessary complexity. While one argues for the importance of a well-written spec, the other sees no need for it at this time and prefers to stick with the current lightning invoices.</summary>
