    <summary>In a forum post, a user expressed their desire to rebuild Bitcoin Core GUI using the JavaScript Electron framework. They hope to gain an understanding of the pros and cons of moving from Qt to Electron. However, many Bitcoin Core contributors and users are not in favor of using a browser and JavaScript to achieve a UI with simple user-stories. The user was advised to work on a third-party project and let their Electron UI connect to Bitcoin Core over RPC, using ZMQ or helping to get long polling into Bitcoin Core to avoid pulling. It is unlikely that adding an Electron/JavaScript UI to the Bitcoin Core repository will happen. Two related links were also provided for further reading.</summary>
