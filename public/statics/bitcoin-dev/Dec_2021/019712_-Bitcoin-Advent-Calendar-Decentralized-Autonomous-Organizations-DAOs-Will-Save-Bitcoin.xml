    <summary>In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin expressed his excitement about opportunities for capital formation within Bitcoin. He believes that this is a big deal and something worth paying attention to as it allows individuals to run a little company with shareholders inside of Bitcoin, which helps us inhabit the "be your own bank" part of Bitcoin. He notes that none of this particularly requires CTV (Consensus-enforced Transaction Outputs), but it does require the type of composable and flexible software that he aspires to deliver with Sapio.The implementation approach for Sapio seems interesting, as it reminds the author of concepts like bitcoin bug bounties. The author wonders if there is some kind of Sapio client to be run alongside a Bitcoin full node similar to how a Lightning node would operate, and whether the computation, bandwidth, and liveness requirements for someone running Sapio contracts are more or less comparable to Lightning.The author intends to take a closer look at the https://github.com/sapio-lang/sapio if it seems like a recommended starting point. In terms of business matters, Jeremy Rubin mentions that there are two more posts coming up, both focused on getting this stuff out into the wild more. If anyone has thoughts on BIP-119 activation, they can share them publicly or privately. Those who like or dislike BIP-119 and wish to "soft-signal" yes or no publicly may do so on https://utxos.org/signals by editing the appropriate file(s) and making a PR. Alternatively, they can comment somewhere publicly that can be linked to or send it to Jeremy Rubin, who will make the edits.</summary>
