    <summary>The discussion is focused on the difference between a newly created system and p2pool. Some users argue that the new system is just a reinvention of p2pool and should credit it as prior art. Monero is implementing their version of p2pool, which allows for viable solo mining. The basic idea behind p2pool is to have several chains with 20% of the hashrate, and if there are 100 p2pool chains, each chain gets 0.2% of net hash. If a user is okay with 20s block times, they only need 0.00067% of network hash to get a payout every 10m.</summary>
