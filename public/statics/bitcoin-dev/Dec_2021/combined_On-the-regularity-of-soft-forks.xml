    <summary>The Bitcoin development mailing list is focused on discussing issues related to software engineering principles in soft forks. The email thread revolves around the complexities of making changes to the consensus protocol of Bitcoin, which requires a hard fork to change. One of the challenges with introducing a consensus change through a soft fork is achieving community consensus. The debate on the mailing list highlights the need for better terminology to describe the different types of soft forks and cautions against bundling changes in soft forks.Matt Corallo argues against frequent soft forks with a single or minimal set of features, advocating for infrequent soft forks with batches of features instead. In contrast, AJ believes that combining proposals when the combination is better than the individual proposals were is obviously good and related proposals should be combined into a single activation if it is easier to think about the ideas as a set.The issue of miner signaling during soft fork activation has also caused controversy, with many users and even developers misunderstanding its purpose. Prayank emphasizes that miner signaling is not a form of voting for or expressing support for a soft fork, but simply a tool for signaling readiness. He notes that there needs to be sufficient community consensus before facilitating miner signaling to avoid misinterpretation by users.Overall, the discussion emphasizes that security-critical software like the Bitcoin protocol requires careful consideration and testing before implementation to avoid significant issues. Decentralized security critical consensus changes cannot be treated like any other software project. Soft fork features should be tested thoroughly on testnet, signet, custom signets, sidechains, etc., both on a standalone basis and a bundled basis.The community agrees that the risks of soft forks should be minimized, and there should be a minimum time between a soft fork implementation finalization and determining community consensus. This gives everyone enough time to look at it and raise objections if needed. Specific examples are given, such as the bundling of schnorr, Taproot, MAST, OP_SUCCESSx, and CHECKSIGADD, which have synergies and were bundled together.The email exchange also discusses the issue of miner signaling during soft fork activation. Prayank emphasizes that miner signaling is simply a tool for signaling readiness and should not be facilitated until there is sufficient community consensus on the soft fork to avoid misinterpretation by users. The discussion concludes that while bundling related proposals with synergies can be beneficial, each proposal should be considered on its own merits before being bundled together.There are concerns surrounding miner signaling during soft fork activation, with many users and even developers misunderstanding its purpose. The issue of who gets to decide for users during bip8 activation has also caused controversy, leaving many users confused. The bundling of multiple features together in soft forks is discussed, with the concern that too many features bundled together can lead to difficulties in debugging if something goes wrong. The author argues that soft forks that are non-invasive should be treated differently and can be tested thoroughly on testnet, signet, custom signets, sidechains, etc., on a standalone basis and a bundled basis. However, consensus changes should not be bundled, especially when it comes to activation parameters, as it amplifies the community resources needed to do review. Security-critical software, such as decentralized consensus changes, cannot be treated like any other software project. Instead, caution, proper testing, and community consensus are necessary before activating any new features.A member of the Bitcoin community expressed their opinion on various topics related to the network's consensus changes, arguing that soft forks should be done as and when required. They also disagreed with the idea of coming to a consensus as a community on what the minimum time between soft forks should be. In response, the other person disagreed with some of their points and argued that maybe bitcoin needs to move faster now than it should in the future, and the cost of having the community remain vigilant against harmful changes is worth the extra speed. They also disagreed with the notion that it's not possible to have cultural norms in a decentralized network like Bitcoin, saying that the bitcoin community has already come up with standards that attempt to adhere to such as doing soft forks instead of hard forks wherever possible.</summary>
