    <summary>The email thread shared by Prayank23 discusses the use of Bitcoin transactions for playing chess and how it can contribute to increasing demand for block space. The sender asks for an email address to get approval or permission for certain types of Bitcoin transactions such as opening and closing Lightning Network channels or using OP_RETURN. In response, it is stated that as long as a transaction is valid, standard, and pays fees, there should be no issues with what is being achieved with the transaction. However, frivolous use of block space is not encouraged.Prayank23 shares a link to a GitHub page outlining their project to play chess on the Lightning Network. The primary goal of the project is to test Bitcoin transactions while having fun and contributing to increasing demand for block space. However, as Koala Studio tried chess on LN in 2019 but shutdown in August 2019 and Etleneum still has chess but works differently, the project may have to replace chess with any 2 player game that works for such setup and can be played with patience over few hours/days. The email also notes that zero-fee transactions no longer work and that all transactions will pay required fees in the long term. Moreover, OP_RETURN is used by many projects and is excluded from UTXO set. It is clarified that Prayank23 won't be working on this project as they are busy with another project and recently started contributing to Wasabi.The email is signed by Lord His Excellency James HRMH (&amp; HMRH) of Hougun Manor &amp; Glencoe &amp; British Empire and Mr. Damian A. James Williamson from Willtech, go-overt.com, duigco.org DUIGCO API, and other projects. The email contains contact information for Willtech, including a phone number and fax number. It notes that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered. The email is signed by Prayank, whose PGP key is included.</summary>
