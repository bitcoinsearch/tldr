    <summary>The context shared by Prayank23 is about a project that involves testing Bitcoin transactions using a game of chess on the Lightning Network. The primary goal of the project is to contribute to increasing demand for block space while having fun and learning new things. However, as Koala Studio tried chess on LN in 2019 but shutdown in August 2019 and Etleneum still has chess but works differently, the project may have to replace chess with any 2 player game that works for such setup and can be played with patience over few hours/days. Prayank23 also clarifies that zero fee transactions do not work anymore, and all transactions will pay fees that are required long term. Additionally, OP_RETURN is used by many projects and is excluded from UTXO set. Prayank23 won't be working on this project as they are busy with another project and recently started contributing to Wasabi.</summary>
