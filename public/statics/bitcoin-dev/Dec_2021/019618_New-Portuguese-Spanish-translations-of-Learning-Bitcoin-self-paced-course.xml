    <summary>Blockchain Commons has released translations of their free "Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line" course in Spanish and Portuguese. The course teaches about Bitcoin development starting with bitcoin-cli and moving on to using computer languages to access the RPC API. With 460 million native speakers of Spanish and 230 million native speakers of Portuguese, and with 29 different countries where one or both is an official language, the new translations will considerably widen the scope of Learning Bitcoin's coverage. This will invite many new developers to work together on Bitcoin using the international language of computer code. The current iteration of Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line is now a full year old, so they want to update it to talk about the newest Bitcoin work, including Taproot, Schnorr signatures, miniscript, and more. They are also considering offering some brief weekly seminars in 2022, looking at individual sections of Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line and answering questions.If you think increasing the pool of Bitcoin developers is important, please consider becoming a patron of Blockchain Commons, and let them know it's because of your interest in this course.</summary>
