    <summary>A developer named Eugene has dropped a project he's been working on which involves implementing a human versus chess engine in Solidity that mints interactive NFTs of representations of the contract's internal states. However, it is unclear why NFTs are involved in this project. Suggestions were made to try implementing the project on Lightning as well. When asked why he isn't working on Bitcoin, Eugene responded by saying that Bitcoin development can be fun, but mostly it's not. Multiple contributors have stepped down from their engagement recently due to the struggle it takes to ship even the smallest features. It's hard to tell people, especially younger folk just entering the space, to work on Bitcoin full-time. Funding in open source projects is an issue which exists outside Bitcoin as well and is being addressed by several individuals and organizations. Eugene believes that even if people have issues with Bitcoin development, they can be solved. He then goes on to explain that NFTs are a phenomenon that people should care about. For example, scaling challenges in Ethereum led to the development of Zero Knowledge Roll-Ups, privacy issues like Tornado Cash, and more. However, according to Prayank, the trend towards NFTs is primarily driven by the desire to get rich and there is nothing new or innovative about it.</summary>
