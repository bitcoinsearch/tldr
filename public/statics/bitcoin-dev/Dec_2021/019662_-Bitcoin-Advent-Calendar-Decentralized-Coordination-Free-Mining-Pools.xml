    <title>[Bitcoin Advent Calendar] Decentralized Coordination Free Mining Pools</title>

    <summary>In this post, the author introduces a novel form of mining pool that can operate as a map-reduce over blocks without any infrastructure. The concept is expected to alleviate centralization pressures usually faced by pools. However, there are some open-ended questions concerning how to select and analyze the choice of window and payout functions. By combining the payment pool payout with this concept, there is practically very little on-chain overhead from this approach as the chain-load for including payouts in every block is deferred for future cooperation among miners. Although this can be considered cooperation itself, the cooperation happens out of band from mining and block production so it really is coordination free to mine.</summary>
