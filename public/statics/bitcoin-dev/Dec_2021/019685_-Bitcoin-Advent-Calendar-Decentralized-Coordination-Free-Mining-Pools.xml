    <summary>The author suggests including a small number of block headers directly as op_return, and utilizing metadata to help miners with lower hashrate participate. The purpose of on-chain data is to eliminate the need for external network software for mining pools. This method would be effective if the data is somewhat bounded. The data has no consensus meaning and is client-side validated by the DCFMP block filter. Participating pools could vote on how difficult shares should be as a metaparameter to the pool over blocks, but analysis gets more complex with that.</summary>
