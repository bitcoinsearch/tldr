    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Christian Moss brought up the issue of scalability for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the context of the RGB protocol. Moss questioned whether RGB could scale NFTs as each transaction to transfer ownership of an NFT would require an on-chain transaction. In response, Peter Todd, one of the co-founders of the RGB protocol, pointed out that they intend to address this issue in the future by using scalable single-use-seals. Todd provided a link to his 2017 blog post that explains how these seals can be used to transfer assets off-chain while still maintaining their integrity and security. It remains to be seen when and how these seals will be implemented in the RGB protocol, but it is clear that the developers are actively working on solutions to improve the scalability of NFTs and other similar assets.</summary>
