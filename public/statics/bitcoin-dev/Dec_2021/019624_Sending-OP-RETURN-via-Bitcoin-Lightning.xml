    <summary>The discussion thread revolves around the possibility of using OP_RETURN to create and trade NFTs on Bitcoin via Lightning, and if it could be divisible. The potential of defining a protocol for OP_RETURN ownership transfer via lightning is also discussed. The conversation includes questions on whether OP_RETURN can be used in opening or closing transactions within a channel or network of channels and if they have ownership. The need for a parallel protocol layer that stores and reads all Bitcoin transactions and those involving the node's channels as well as the ones with the OP_RETURN is highlighted. The thread provides links to RGB, a project that could be researched for more information on these topics.</summary>
