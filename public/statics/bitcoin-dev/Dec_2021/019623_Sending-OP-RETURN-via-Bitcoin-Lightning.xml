    <title>Sending OP_RETURN via Bitcoin Lightning</title>

    <summary>In this email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Héctor José Cárdenas Pacheco is questioning the use of OP_RETURN in creating and trading NFTs on Bitcoin. He asks whether it would be possible to make transactions with this opcode via Lightning, specifically wondering if opcodes like OP_RETURN could be inside a channel's opening or closing transaction and if that op_return could change hands within that channel or network of channels. While OP_RETURNs do not have ownership according to the bitcoin network, it is possible to define a protocol that associates an OP_RETURN with ownership, which could then be transferred via lightning by sending associated currency via lightning. It is also possible to give OP_RETURN divisible ownership through a defined protocol. If possible, this would need a protocol layer parallel to Bitcoin/Lightning that stores and reads all Bitcoin transactions, including ones that involve the node's channels as well as the ones with the OP_RETURN.</summary>
