    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, has announced the scheduling of a recurring meeting every two weeks on Tuesdays at 12:00 PM PT starting January 11th to discuss BIP-119 review and deployment topics. Participants are invited to send in topics they would like to cover before each meeting for inclusion in the preliminary agenda. The meetings will be moderated closely to remain on topic while covering all relevant issues. Participation in these meetings does not signify endorsement of BIP-119's inclusion or any specific roadmap but rather aims to carry on the 'gradient descent process' of consensus in an open, interactive, and productive format. Logs will be available via gnusha. Interested parties are encouraged to drop a private note to Jeremy or reply to his email.</summary>
