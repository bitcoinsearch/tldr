    <summary>In an email conversation between Yancy and Prayank, it was revealed that the p2pderivatives DLC application is still being developed on Github using a single oracle. Although Yancy has not been keeping up with the project, he provided links to the repository for the client, server, and oracle components of the project. Prayank then discussed the use of multi-oracles in discreet log contracts and mentioned the p2pderivatives project. He also questioned whether OP_CTV would make a difference in the p2pderivatives project if implemented in Bitcoin, to which Yancy responded that while it was not necessary, some aspects of the project could benefit from it. Furthermore, Prayank asked about unilateral derivatives and how they would work since he believed that a peer would always be needed to take the other side of the trade. They both expressed interest in exploring derivatives as a lesser explored area of Bitcoin projects that could solve many problems. Lastly, links were shared to powswap.com and the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
