    <title>[Bitcoin Advent Calendar] What's Smart about Smart Contracts</title>

    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, is doing a one-a-day blog post series until Christmas. He believes that some of the posts might be appropriate for discussion in the Bitcoin development community. Unfortunately, he forgot to start the calendar series syndicated there too. The first few posts are less Bitcoin development-related and philosophical, so he suggests starting around Day 6. Rubin will post the rest up to Day 10 on the platform today and do every day starting tomorrow. An archive of all posts can be found at https://rubin.io/archive/. Every post will have [Bitcoin Advent Calendar] if readers wish to filter it. Rubin's day 6 post discusses why smart contracts (in extended form) may be a critical precursor to securing Bitcoin's future rather than something to do after making the base layer more robust.</summary>
