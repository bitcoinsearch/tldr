This development aims to make channel opening more efficient and could prove to be a significant advancement for payment channels. The post, available on rubin.io, delves into the concept of non-interactive channel creation and its implications when paired with the payment pool idea.Rubin's post highlights the potential benefits of this development, including faster channel openings and the ability to set up multiple channels at once. He also notes that this approach can reduce transaction fees and improve privacy by eliminating the need for on-chain transactions.Overall, Rubin seems optimistic about the future prospects of this development and its potential impact on payment channels. This development may have important implications for the broader blockchain ecosystem, particularly as it relates to improving scalability and efficiency.</summary>
