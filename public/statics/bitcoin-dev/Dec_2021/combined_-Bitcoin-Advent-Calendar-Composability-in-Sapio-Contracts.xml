    <summary>Jeremy Rubin's latest post discusses how Sapio modules can be used in a composably manner and invites feedback on this active area of research for the Sapio platform. However, he expresses dissatisfaction with the "JSONSchema Type System" despite its remarkable flexibility. According to him, a better type system could enforce guarantees more strongly and introduce formal correctness. Comparing it to things like ERC-20, Eth interfaces aren't particularly binding as functions could do anything. Jeremy welcomes any thoughts or ideas on better ways to accomplish this.In addition, Jeremy encourages general feedback on the series outside of the band. There are upcoming posts in the pipeline that are less development-focused than earlier posts he excluded. He is willing to filter them if people feel overwhelmed but would lean towards posting the remaining pieces for continuity. If anyone feels strongly about a couple of posts that might be a topical reach for this list, they should let him know. Overall, Jeremy Rubin is looking for feedback and suggestions on his work on the Sapio platform.</summary>
