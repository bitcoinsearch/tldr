    <summary>Sapio is a compiler toolchain that requires only one-time execution, after which the user can send money to the contract. This system is similar to Solidity in Ethereum. Sapio Studio is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with Sapio contract outputs. This is comparable to Metamask/web3.js in Ethereum. However, it should be noted that Sapio is not comparable to Lightning. For those interested in learning more about Sapio, it is recommended to start with learn.sapio-lang.org.</summary>
