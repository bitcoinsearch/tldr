    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Christian Moss and Peter Todd discussed the use of single-use seals for asset transfers on the Bitcoin ledger. Todd explains that such seals require an on-chain transaction to post proof of publication to the ledger. However, he notes that scalability is possible because multiple proofs of transfer can be batched into a Merkle tree and added as a single transaction to the ledger. The aggregation process is trustless with respect to validity, and users have the ability to choose their level of censorship risk while also mitigating it with multisig schemes that use multiple aggregators in parallel.</summary>
