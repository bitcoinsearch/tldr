    <title>Sending OP_RETURN via Bitcoin Lightning</title>

    <summary>The author is pondering the possibility of using OP_RETURN to make Lightning transactions for NFTs on Bitcoin, such as RarePepes and SoG. The author poses specific questions regarding the use of OP_RETURN within Lightning channels, including whether it could be included in opening or closing transactions, if it could change hands within a network of channels, and whether it could be divisible. The author suggests that this would require a protocol layer parallel to Bitcoin/Lightning that stores and reads all transactions involving the node's channels and OP_RETURN, similar to CounterParty's use of the primary ledger.</summary>
