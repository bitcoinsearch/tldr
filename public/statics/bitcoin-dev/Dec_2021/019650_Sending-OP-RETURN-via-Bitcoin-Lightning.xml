    <summary>The conversation is about the multisig scheme and the Single Use Seals. The seals commit to the next seal, and for on-chain aggregation seals, a common aggregation service provider should be chosen ahead of time to mitigate availability and censorship risk. The use of "multisig" schemes that use multiple aggregators in parallel can also mitigate censorship risk. Christian Moss asks whether single use seals require an on-chain transaction to post the proof of publication to the ledger when an asset is transferred. Peter Todd confirms this and explains that many proofs can be batched into a merkle tree and added to a single tx going into the ledger. Users can choose what kind of censorship risk they're willing to take. The conversation ends with Alex Schoof's signature.</summary>
