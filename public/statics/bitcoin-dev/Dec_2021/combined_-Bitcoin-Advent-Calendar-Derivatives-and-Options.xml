    <summary>The message discusses the implementation of a threshold oracle in Bitcoin, which can be obtained from a third party or could be self-referential to ensure trustworthiness by relying on multiple oracles rather than one. The same approach is used in discreet log contracts for multi-oracles. A project called P2P derivatives is being developed on Github using a single oracle, but there is interest in exploring the use of multi-oracles and the potential benefits of unilateral derivatives. Although CTV is not necessary for this project, its implementation would make certain aspects nicer and open up new possibilities for opening these contracts unilaterally. In addition, developer Jeremy Rubin discussed building options and derivatives in the Sapio platform, with no further details provided in the brief message shared via Twitter. In an email conversation between Prayank and Jeremy, they discussed the implementation of threshold oracles in Bitcoin for derivatives trading and the benefits of unilateral opens, which allows one party to pay the other into a derivative without them being online. They also discussed the working of unilateral options and how it must be used in conjunction with DCFMP and PowSwap where miners could commit to 'trade specs' and an Automatic market maker inside the DCFMP could attempt to match that miner to a counterparty who wants the opposite hashrate hedge. Furthermore, Yancy mentioned in a Bitcoin dev mailing list that the p2pderivatives DLC application is still under active development and provided a GitHub link to the project. Another user named Prayank added that rust-dlc is also under active development and supports multi oracle contracts and other features found in the DLC specs. Thibaut chimed in to mention that rust-dlc invites Jeremy to attend their monthly DLC spec meeting to discuss how CTV could improve the Bitcoin derivatives ecosystem and what could be reused from DLCs. This discussion highlights the continued development and exploration of derivatives in the Bitcoin community. Lastly, links were shared to powswap.com and the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
