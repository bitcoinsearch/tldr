    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, has written a blog post covering a number of different new proposed primitives that he believes the community is actively considering and are relatively well researched. The post is a mini high level SoK (State of Knowledge) and contains basic details of these proposed primitives. He invites readers to suggest any other proposals that may have been overlooked. The post can be found on his website at rubin.io/bitcoin/2021/12/05/advent-8/.</summary>
