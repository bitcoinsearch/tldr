    <summary>In his latest post, Jeremy Rubin discusses the topic of giving away bitcoin after death. He shares interesting primitives that can spark a discussion around different inheritance schemes that might be useful. One note he thinks is particularly discussion-worthy is how the UTXO model makes inheritance backups fundamentally difficult to do compared to a monolithic account model. The post also includes a link to his blog where readers can learn more about the topic.</summary>
