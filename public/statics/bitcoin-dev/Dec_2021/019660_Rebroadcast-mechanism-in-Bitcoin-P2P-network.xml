    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Aymeric Vitte stated that using the Tor network for Bitcoin or any protocol not related to the Tor Browser does not make sense for various reasons. When asked for citation, Vitte did not provide any. However, he did mention that he has personally experienced network blocking of bitcoin peers and Tor is one way to reconnect with the network in such cases.Despite this, reasonable rebroadcasting of nonlocal transactions can be beneficial as it makes their transmission more robust and slightly harder to track their origin, although it does not make them anonymous. Vitte emphasizes that every extra measure taken to secure transactions is a good thing since everything eventually fails.</summary>
