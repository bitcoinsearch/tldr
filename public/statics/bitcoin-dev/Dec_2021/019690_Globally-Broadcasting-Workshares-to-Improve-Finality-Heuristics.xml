    <summary>During a chat with Nic Carter, Jeremy Rubin proposed an interesting concept regarding Bitcoin Core that could provide more accurate finality estimates and warnings if hashrate abandons the chain tip. By setting up Bitcoin Core to gossip headers for work shares, the system would be able to notice missing work, which is observable regardless of whether dishonest miners choose to publish their work on non-tip shares. The GUI could then provide users with additional warning if they accept a payment during a sudden hashrate decrease, advising them to wait longer before accepting the payment. It is not clear whether this concept has been discussed before.</summary>
