    <summary>In a message to Jeremy, Rune references a concept that he believes may be related to what Jeremy is discussing. The reference link leads to a post on the BitcoinTalk forum, which presumably provides more information on the concept in question. However, without further context it is difficult to determine exactly what the concept is or how it relates to Jeremy's discussion.</summary>
