    <summary>The author of this message is inviting Bitcoin developers to join a recurring meeting every two weeks starting January 11th, to discuss BIP-119 review and deployment topics. Participants are encouraged to send any topics they would like to cover beforehand, and the preliminary agenda will be circulated prior to the meetings. The purpose of the meetings will be to coordinate review, testing, and iron out any wrinkles around release timelines and procedures based on the author's request for comment. Meetings will be moderated tightly to remain on topic, but all relevant topics will be welcome. Participation in these meetings does not signify any sort of endorsement of BIP-119's inclusion, nor a specific roadmap, but rather aims to carry on the 'gradient descent process' of consensus in an open, interactive, and productive format. Logs will be available via gnusha. Interested parties can drop the author a private note or reply if they plan to attend.</summary>
