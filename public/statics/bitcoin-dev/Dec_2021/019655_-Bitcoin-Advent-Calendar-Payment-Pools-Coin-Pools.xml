    <summary>The post discusses the concept of building payment pools or coin pools in Sapio, with more advanced features to be showcased in future posts. Payment pools aim to compress chain load into single UTXOs, making it easier for users to recover their coins securely. Payment pools also offer a natural evolution path for federated rollups with unilateral exits, where state transitions could be enforced by covenants or ZK systems in place of N-of-N signatures. The author encourages readers to experiment with creating custom payment pools in Sapio and mentions the possibility of incorporating an EVM into the state transition function. Specific names like payment channels and lightning network should be used for specific protocols instead of using generic terms like payment pools/coin pools.</summary>
