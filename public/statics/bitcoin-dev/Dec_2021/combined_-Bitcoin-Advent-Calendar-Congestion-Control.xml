    <summary>This post is a follow-up to previous content on congestion control and CTV. The author, Jeremy Rubin, provides code samples in Sapio of constructing a payout tree and believes that congestion control is currently understated in importance and potential. The post aims to be more approachable than technical and discusses how congestion control primitives can be significant for large volume and value businesses to close out liabilities reliably without being impacted by transient chain weather. The next few posts will build on this with Coin Pools, Mining Pools, and Lighting, which leverage congestion control structures with multi-party opt-outs for added punch. The demand for high volume and high-value transactions isn't served well by the lightning network since the large values of flows would be difficult to route and might prefer being deposited directly into cold storage given the amounts at stake.Rubin provides links to previous posts on the topic for further reading.</summary>
