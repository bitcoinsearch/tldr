    <summary>Bitcoin is a protocol that should be secure, backwards compatible, forward compatible, and agreed by consensus. These properties are particularly important for Bitcoin, not just because it is a payment network, but also because more eyes on code creates security and helps with protocol design. The Taproot and Sapio proposals are considered good and there is a call to work together towards constructive, positive, secure, and forward compatible upgrades to Bitcoin.</summary>
