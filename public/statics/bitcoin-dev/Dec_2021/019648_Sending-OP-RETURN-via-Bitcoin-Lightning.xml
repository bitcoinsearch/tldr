    <summary>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, responded to a question on the scalability of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the context of the RGB protocol. Todd explained that RGB intends to scale NFTs and similar assets in the future via scalable single-use-seals. He referred to an article he wrote back in 2017 explaining how single use seals require an on-chain transaction to post the proof of publication to the ledger. However, batch processing can be used by adding the merkle root into the single transaction going into the ledger, thus allowing scalability. The article provides a detailed explanation of this process.</summary>
