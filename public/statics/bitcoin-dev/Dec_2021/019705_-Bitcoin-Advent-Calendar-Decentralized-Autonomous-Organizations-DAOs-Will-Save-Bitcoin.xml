    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, has written a blog post about the potential for capital formation in Bitcoin. He believes that running a little company with shareholders inside of Bitcoin is a big deal and helps to inhabit the "be your own bank" part of Bitcoin. This does not require CTV but does require flexible software, something he aims to deliver with Sapio. Rubin also mentions that there are two more posts to come, focused on getting this out into the wild more. If anyone has thoughts on BIP-119 activation, they can soft-signal their opinion publicly or privately. The links to edit files for individuals/devs, organizations, and miners/pools are provided.</summary>
