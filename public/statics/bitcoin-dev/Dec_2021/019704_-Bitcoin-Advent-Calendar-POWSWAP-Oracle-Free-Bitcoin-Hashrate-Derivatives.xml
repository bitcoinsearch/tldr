    <title>[Bitcoin Advent Calendar] POWSWAP: Oracle Free Bitcoin Hashrate Derivatives</title>

    <summary>In his latest post, Jeremy Rubin details how to create fully trustless hashrate derivative contracts that can be embedded on-chain, inside of channels, options, or inside of DCFMPs. These contracts can be used without CTV, but are improved with it. However, Jeremy has not analyzed the profitability of these contracts, nor how to price and risk them, or if a two-sided market among miners exists. He leaves this to someone else's expertise. The post can be found at https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2021/12/21/advent-24/.</summary>
