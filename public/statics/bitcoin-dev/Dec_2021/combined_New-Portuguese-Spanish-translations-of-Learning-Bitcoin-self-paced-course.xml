    <summary>Blockchain Commons has announced the release of translations of their free "Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line" course in Spanish and Portuguese. The course is designed to teach developers about Bitcoin development, starting with bitcoin-cli and moving on to using computer languages to access the RPC API. With 460 million native speakers of Spanish and 230 million native speakers of Portuguese, the new translations will significantly broaden the scope of Learning Bitcoin's coverage. This will allow many new developers to work together on Bitcoin using the international language of computer code.The current iteration of Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line is now a year old, so Blockchain Commons plans to update it to talk about the newest Bitcoin work, including Taproot, Schnorr signatures, miniscript, and more. Additionally, they are considering offering brief weekly seminars in 2022 that will look at individual sections of Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line and answer questions.If you believe that increasing the pool of Bitcoin developers is important, you can become a patron of Blockchain Commons and let them know that your interest in this course motivated your decision.</summary>
