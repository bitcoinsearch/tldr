    <title>Proposal: Full-RBF in Bitcoin Core 24.0</title>

    <summary>The email contains a response to a Bitcoin-related discussion from Peter Todd, who suggests enabling full-RBF until a specific time limit is reached. This approach has been suggested before by Matt Corallo. The email also mentions the mempool, which exists on gossip and does not contain transactions until they are mined and included in a block. Information can disappear from the mempool, and consensus is used to assure fungibility in Bitcoin. The email includes contact information and links to various projects, including willtech.com.au, go-overt.com, and duigco.org DUIGCO API. Finally, the email notes that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered.</summary>
