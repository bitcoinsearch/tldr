    <summary>The discussion revolves around a proposed mining pool coordination system that aims to increase payout regularity and lower the on-chain footprint by combining payouts from multiple pools. While it offers some benefits, it does not get rid of the need for mining pools altogether. A suggestion is made to use this concept off-chain to enable solo mining through a public network of solo miners who publish "weak blocks" to that network. However, there is a missing piece in terms of ordering weak blocks to make the window possible. One concern raised is the safety of throwing block rewards into a channel and being able to spend them immediately, which could be solved by reducing the on-chain wait time for spending block rewards instead. The proposal is criticized for being less than useless and not satisfying any of the goals outlined. It is suggested that the proposal should focus on one problem for which it is demonstrably the right and best solution. The complexity of the proposal is also discussed in the context of non-interactive channels and payment pools.</summary>
