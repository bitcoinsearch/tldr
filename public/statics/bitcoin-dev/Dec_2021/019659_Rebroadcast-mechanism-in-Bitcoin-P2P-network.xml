    <summary>The use of the Tor network for Bitcoin or any protocol unrelated to the Tor Browser does not make sense for various reasons. However, using the Tor protocol outside of the Tor network and inside browsers for wallets makes sense for anonymizing nodes. In this case, anonymizing nodes can already be existing bitcoin nodes. The rebroadcasting approach on the network reveals a relation between nodes and transactions, implying that they are the origin. Even though hiding the relation with IP addresses is not sufficient, it has its downsides like susceptibility to partition/Eclipse/DoS attacks. Pieter Wuille suggested that moving to a model where mempools/nodes themselves are responsible for rebroadcasting is a great solution to improving this specific problem. It would help fix a specific leak, but this isn't a black and white property.</summary>
