    <summary>Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has expressed his excitement for the potential of capital formation within Bitcoin. He believes that running a little company with shareholders inside of Bitcoin is a big deal and helps to inhabit the "be your own bank" part of Bitcoin. This does not require CTV but does require flexible software, something he aims to deliver with Sapio. Rubin also mentions that there are two more posts to come, focused on getting this out into the wild more. In terms of business matters, if anyone has thoughts on BIP-119 activation, they can soft-signal their opinion publicly or privately. The links to edit files for individuals/devs, organizations, and miners/pools are provided.Sapio is a compiler toolchain that requires only one-time execution, after which the user can send money to the contract, similar to Solidity in Ethereum. Sapio Studio is a graphical user interface that allows users to interact with Sapio contract outputs, comparable to Metamask/web3.js in Ethereum. Those interested in learning more about Sapio can start with learn.sapio-lang.org. Rubin's approach to implementing Sapio is interesting as it seeks to provide composable and flexible software for running a little company with shareholders inside Bitcoin. The author wonders if there is some kind of Sapio client to be run alongside a Bitcoin full node similar to how a Lightning node would operate, and whether the computation, bandwidth, and liveness requirements for someone running Sapio contracts are more or less comparable to Lightning. If anyone has thoughts on BIP-119 activation, they can share them publicly or privately. Those who like or dislike BIP-119 and wish to "soft-signal" yes or no publicly may do so on https://utxos.org/signals by editing the appropriate file(s) and making a PR. Alternatively, they can comment somewhere publicly that can be linked to or send it to Jeremy Rubin, who will make the edits.</summary>
