    <summary>The proposal discussed in this context suggests creating a separate blockchain called "superblocks" that would progress linearly, keeping block headers instead of transactions. The idea is that a block creator would collect uncollected blocks into the next superblock and receive a reward proportional to how many they include. This could be done using merge mining or signing schemes. Using block headers instead of hashes would prove that a proper amount of work was done to produce it. Furthermore, the article discusses various ways to define windows and reward functions, including paying less to blocks found in more rapid succession. The design of sub-block pooling helps micro-pools split resources non-custodially in every block as part of the higher order DCFMP. It's also possible to add an 'uncle block' type mechanism in an incentive compatible way to encourage the inclusion of the heaviest blocks.Regarding space usage, there is a critique about the viability of a payment pool mechanism to cut-through chain space. The proposal suggests that "strongly online" counterparties could coordinate more efficiently, but it questions whether miners, the nexus of decentralization for Bitcoin, would prefer to use custodial services for pooling over bearing a cost of extra potential chainload.One potential issue with the proposal is throwing block rewards into a channel and being able to spend them immediately. All coinbase rewards are unspendable for 100 blocks, enforced by consensus. Lastly, the proposal suggests picking one problem for which CTV is demonstrably the right and best solution, instead of trying to be all things to all people.Finally, the proposal is actually simple when considered in a broader context. Non-Interactive Channels and Payment Pools are useful by themselves, as are the operations to merge them and swap balances across them. Therefore, most of the complexity in this proposal relies on tools that will likely be used in everyday situations regardless of DCFMP.</summary>
