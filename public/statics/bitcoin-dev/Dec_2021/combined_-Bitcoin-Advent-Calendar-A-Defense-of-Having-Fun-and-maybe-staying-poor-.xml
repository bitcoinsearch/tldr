    <summary>A developer named Eugene has discontinued his project of implementing a human versus chess engine in Solidity that mints interactive NFTs of representations of the contract's internal states. Although it is unclear why NFTs were involved in this project, suggestions were made to try implementing the project on Lightning as well. When asked why he isn't working on Bitcoin, Eugene responded by saying that Bitcoin development can be fun, but mostly it's not and multiple contributors have stepped down from their engagement recently due to the struggle it takes to ship even the smallest features. Funding in open source projects is an issue which exists outside Bitcoin as well and is being addressed by several individuals and organizations. Eugene believes that even if people have issues with Bitcoin development, they can be solved. Furthermore, Eugene explains that NFTs are a phenomenon that people should care about, citing examples such as scaling challenges in Ethereum led to the development of Zero Knowledge Roll-Ups, privacy issues like Tornado Cash, and more. However, according to Prayank, the trend towards NFTs is primarily driven by the desire to get rich, and there is nothing new or innovative about it.In a recent post, Jeremy Rubin speaks about having fun every now and then as a treat, which has garnered positive feedback from readers. The post is less technical and more philosophical in nature. Rubin mentions that he will continue to syndicate the remaining posts to this list based on private feedback he received from more than one person. Overall, it appears to be a lighthearted message encouraging readers to take time to enjoy themselves amidst their work and responsibilities.</summary>
