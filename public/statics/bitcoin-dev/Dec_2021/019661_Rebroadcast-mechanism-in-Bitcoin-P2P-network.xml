    <summary>The Tor network is not a recommended solution to bypass censorship for Bitcoin as it is very centralized, small, watched and controlled. Extra measures like rebroadcasting may add something to the solution but can also help catch/track users if not well designed/thought. Using the Tor protocol independently of the Tor network and from browsers acting as nodes is proposed as a better solution. The node-Tor project, which is more than ten years old, offers insight into the potential dangers of the Tor network. Studies show that the more one tries to hide, the easier it is to get caught, even on decentralized networks like bittorrent. It is important to note that extra measures can make it harder to track the origin of nonlocal transactions, but it does not make them anonymous. Overall, every extra measure is a good thing, but everything eventually fails.</summary>
