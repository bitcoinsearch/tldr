    <summary>The sender of the email responds to a previous message regarding the benefits of longer windows for mining pools and how it can hedge against hashrate changes. They also acknowledge the impact of pooling on variance when fees are greater than subsidy and how this can smooth out revenues over longer periods. The author suggests that this can help with the "mind the gap" problem and incentivize transaction inclusion. However, they express confusion about the proposal mentioned in the rest of the email, requesting clarification on the goals of the payout function and how it meets those goals.</summary>
