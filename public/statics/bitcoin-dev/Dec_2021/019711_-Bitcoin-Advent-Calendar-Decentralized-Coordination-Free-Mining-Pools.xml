    <summary>Introducing signing into mining could result in cases where someone is powerful enough to produce blocks but unable to do so because signing is needed. This changes the consensus from "the heaviest chain" to "the heaviest signed chain", meaning computing power alone is no longer enough as permission to mine is also required. This may be suitable for testing but not for the main network. DCFMP does not have any network system that impedes normal bitcoin mining and has opt-in rules for sharing block bounties in exchange for future shares.</summary>
