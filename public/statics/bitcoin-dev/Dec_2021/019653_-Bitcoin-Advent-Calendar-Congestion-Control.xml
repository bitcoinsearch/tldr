    <summary>This post serves as a follow-up to previous content on congestion control and CTV. The post aims to be more approachable than technical but includes code samples in Sapio of constructing a payout tree. Jeremy Rubin, the author, believes that congestion control is currently understated in importance and potential. The next few posts will build on this with Coin Pools, Mining Pools, and Lighting, which leverage congestion control structures with multi-party opt-outs for added punch. Even in the base case, these congestion control primitives can be significant for large volume and value businesses to close out liabilities reliably without being impacted by transient chain weather. The demand for high volume and high-value transactions isn't served well by the lightning network since the large values of flows would be difficult to route and might prefer being deposited directly into cold storage given the amounts at stake. Rubin provides links to previous posts on the topic for further reading.</summary>
