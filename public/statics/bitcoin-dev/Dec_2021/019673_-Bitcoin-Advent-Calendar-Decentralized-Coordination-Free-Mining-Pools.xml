    <title>[Bitcoin Advent Calendar] Decentralized Coordination Free Mining Pools</title>

    <summary>The author of an email has reproduced Bob's original email for context, which discusses the definition of a pool and how it relates to reducing profit variance by miners. In this case, there are no shares available to subdivide profits, so the only information available to decide payouts is the blocks themselves. Making miners pay other miners within the window N results in N^2 payments to miners, creating block-space inefficiency. While this proposal smooths out fee revenue, it is complicated and expensive, ultimately reducing fee revenue due to extra block space used for miner payouts.</summary>
