    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, in a recent post on Rubin.io, emphasizes the importance of packaging Sapio applications and envisions software like Bitcoin Core being able to run Sapio modules natively, offering users extended functionality based on that. He also expresses his admiration for WebAssembly (WASM) and suggests that implementing the semantics of pieces of bitcoin code as WASM modules would help guarantee that those pieces of the code are entirely deterministic. Although he is currently building out the wallet as Sapio Studio, Rubin dreams of using WASM for consensus upgrades. Rubin thinks this could be something for Simplicity to consider, with WASM being the host language for JET extensions. Overall, Rubin's post highlights the potential benefits of utilizing WASM for bitcoin code.</summary>
