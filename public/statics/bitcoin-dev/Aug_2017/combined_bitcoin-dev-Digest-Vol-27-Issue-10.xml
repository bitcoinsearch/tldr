    <summary>In the future, it is predicted that computers will become much faster, possibly 2^100 times faster, which may make it easier to crack old wallets. To avoid this, people should be mandated to use newer and more secure wallets. Additionally, turning coins into mining rewards could be a better solution than having them hacked. Despite these measures, the owner of the bitcoin should have the right to choose whether to upgrade their wallet or leave it open for hackers to assume the coins. It is important to note that the bitcoin network should not act like a hacker and assume ownership of the coins. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide how they want to protect their assets in the digital world.</summary>
