    <summary>The potential improvement of the bitcoin blockchain database (BBD) size can be achieved by implementing a new routine: an annual split of the BBD. This is due to the inconvenience caused by the 140gb full wallet. The BBD will be split into two parts, the old blocks before the date of the split, and the new blocks starting from the first technical block with all rolled totals on the date of the split. It is also possible to transfer tiny totals that are unprofitable to the miners, cutting the long tail of tiny holders. The old blocks will be packed into annual megablocks and stored in the side archive chain for FBI investigations or other goals.</summary>
