    <title>BIP proposal for Lightning-oriented multiaccount multisig HD wallets</title>

    <summary>In an email sent on August 29, 2017 to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Simone Bronzini discussed the issue of mixing SegWit and non-SegWit addresses on the same BIP44 structure. This mixture could cause problems with the recognition of UTXOs by old wallets, leading to the proposal of BIP49 which separates the key space. However, this separation will lead to old UTXOs not being recognized by new wallets because they will no longer implement old standards. The solution would be to move away from bip39 and bip43 and include a version number in the mnemonic seed.</summary>
