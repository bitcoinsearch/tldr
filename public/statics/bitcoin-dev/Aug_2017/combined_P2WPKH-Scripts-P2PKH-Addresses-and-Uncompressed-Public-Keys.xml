    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list and forum were host to several discussions regarding Native P2WPKH scripts and their use in transactions. A user named Alex Nagy asked if these scripts should only appear in redeem scripts or if they were also valid and identifiable if encoded in TxOuts. Another user, Gregory, replied that it is allowed in TxOuts, but cautioned against assuming the recipient understands the new format. Peter Todd chimed in, noting that he uses native P2WPKH segwit outputs for his OpenTimestamps calendar servers as a way to save transaction size.However, issues arise when attempting to issue Native P2WPKH outputs to someone without a specific address. In an email exchange with Gregory Maxwell, Alex Nagy asked if Bob could safely issue Native P2WPKH outputs to Alice if she gives him a specific address. The answer is no because if Alice gives Bob a specific address, she is essentially saying that she will only accept payment to the scriptPubKey associated with that address. Payment to any other scriptPubKey may not be recognized by Alice. Additionally, uncompressed keys could render the payment unspendable.BIPs 141 and 143 state that P2WPKH scripts may only derive from compressed public keys, making it difficult to know which key to use when given a P2PKH address derived from an uncompressed public key. Transactions that break the rule of using only compressed public keys in P2WPKH and P2WSH will not be relayed or mined by default, leading to potential future funds loss. Therefore, users must not use uncompressed keys in version 0 witness programs to avoid this risk.In summary, Native P2WPKH scripts can be used in TxOuts to save space in transactions, but caution must be taken when issuing them to specific addresses. The use of uncompressed keys in version 0 witness programs is unsafe and could lead to the loss of funds.</summary>
