    <summary>The author is responding to a query about shortening transactions in Bitcoin by proposing changes to the hash reference system, UTXO table and reward mechanism. They suggest that blocks should refer to the hash of the balance sheet instead of the previous block's hash and that a new signature must be placed on the shortened transaction. The author also notes that shortening can only happen within one block, but there are issues with nLockTime transactions and non-standard transactions. The proposed changes would affect many aspects of Bitcoin, including wallets, UTXO references, and the proof of work system.</summary>
