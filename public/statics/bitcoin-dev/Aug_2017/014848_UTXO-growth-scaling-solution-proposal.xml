    <summary>A proposal was made via the bitcoin-dev mailing list to burn "stale" coins in order to keep mining rewards up and encourage movement of bitcoins in the economy. However, some members expressed concern that this idea goes against the principles of Bitcoin as it allows for someone else to take control of a user's coins for reasons outside their control. The discussion then shifted towards the potential threat of quantum computing on the security of Bitcoin, with one member stating that burning coins may only be a good idea in the event of such a threat. The conversation ultimately concluded with the suggestion that this topic would be better suited for bitcoin-discuss rather than bitcoin-dev.</summary>
