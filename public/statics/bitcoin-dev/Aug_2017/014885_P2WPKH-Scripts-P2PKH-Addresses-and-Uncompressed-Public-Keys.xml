    <summary>In a forum discussion on bitcoin-dev, a user named Alex Nagy asked if Native P2WPKH scripts should only appear in redeem scripts or if they were also valid and identifiable if encoded in TxOuts. The purpose of this would be to save space in transactions with many outputs. Another user named Gregory replied that it is allowed in TxOuts, but cautioned against assuming the recipient understands the new format. If someone wants to save space using this method, they should first ask for a new BIP173 address from the recipient rather than converting a P2PKH address without consent.</summary>
