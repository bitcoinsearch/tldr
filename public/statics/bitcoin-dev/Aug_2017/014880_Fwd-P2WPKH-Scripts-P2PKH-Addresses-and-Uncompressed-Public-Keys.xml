    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alex Nagy asked if Bob can safely issue Native P2WPKH outputs to Alice when Alice gives Bob 1MsHWS1BnwMc3tLE8G35UXsS58fKipzB7a. In response, it was stated that it is not possible to pay people to a script pubkey that they did not specify. Constructing an alternative one that they didn't specify but in theory could spend would be considered unsafe and flawed. Technical issues may sometimes cause wallets to display some outputs they did not generate but could spend, but these are specific cases and not generic for all cases. It is impossible for wallets to tell what they did or did not issue due to durability to backup recovery. Thus, wallets will not see the payment and may have no mechanism to recover it even if the recipient is informed of the payment. Additionally, using an uncompressed key could make it unspendable later on.</summary>
