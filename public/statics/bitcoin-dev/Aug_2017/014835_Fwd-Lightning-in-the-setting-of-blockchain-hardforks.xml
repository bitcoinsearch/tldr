    <summary>Christian Decker welcomes Martin Schwarz to the Lightning-dev mailing list and agrees with his proposal of using the first forked block as the forkchain's genesis block to avoid disruption. In cases where channels are open during the fork, a single channel is opened and will have to be settled twice. If no replay protection was implemented on the fork, then the last commitment can be used to close the channel. However, if replay protection was implemented then commitments become invalid on the fork and people may lose money. Martin Schwarz queries how Lightning can work on or across distinct permanent forks of a parent blockchain that share the same genesis block with hardforks branching off the Bitcoin blockchain. He suggests changing the definition of chain_id to the hash of the first block of the new branch and requiring replay and wipe-out protection. The discussion also includes whether slow block times pose an issue, whether Lightning can transact on "almost frozen" block chains suffering from a sudden loss of hash power, and whether there have been any previous discussions or studies of Lightning in the setting of hardforks. Bryan's contact information is provided at the bottom of the email thread.</summary>
