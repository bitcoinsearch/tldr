    <summary>The ZeroLink project is an effort to combine and organize all the research on Bitcoin privacy, with the aim of providing complete anonymity on-chain. The project defines a pre-mix wallet that can be incorporated into any Bitcoin wallet with minimal implementation overhead. Post-mix wallets have strong privacy requirements to ensure that mixed out coins do not lose their uniformity. The Wallet Privacy Framework defines the requirements and recommendations for both types of wallets. Coins are moved from pre-mix wallets to post-mix wallets through mixing. Most on-chain mixing techniques can be used, but ZeroLink also includes its own mixing technique called Chaumian CoinJoin, which is considered the most performant, fastest, and cheapest one. ZeroLink covers many topics, including mixing technique, coin selection, private transaction and balance retrieval, transaction input and output indexing, broadcasting, and UX recommendations. The goal of ZeroLink is to ensure users' privacy is not breached on the blockchain or network level. SamouraiWallet and HiddenWallet have committed to implementing and complying with ZeroLink. BreezeWallet has also shown significant interest in the project. The proposal can be found on GitHub.</summary>
