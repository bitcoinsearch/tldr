    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Riccardo Casatta proposed an optimization for transmitting continuous block headers. He suggested that after the first header, subsequent headers could avoid transmitting the previous hash and instead allow the receiver to compute it by double hashing the previous header. This could result in bandwidth savings of about 40% for long streams of headers. Additionally, he proposed an http API with fixed position chunks to speed up sync for new clients downloading the first 477637 headers, enabling them to fast sync the headers with about 10 http requests. In response to a question about whether "full security" was necessary for timestamping, Casatta noted that timestamping is used to prove date and integrity of private databases containing a lot of value, and in those cases he would recommend using Bitcoin's "full security."</summary>
