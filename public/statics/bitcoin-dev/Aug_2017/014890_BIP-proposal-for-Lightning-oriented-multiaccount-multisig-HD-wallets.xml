    <summary>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list focused on the proposal of BIP49 which suggested to separate the key space for SegWit addresses to avoid mixing them with non-SegWit addresses. However, it was pointed out that this would lead to old unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) not being recognized by new wallets as they discard support for old standards over time. To address this issue, the suggestion was made to move away from bip39 and bip43 and include a version number in the mnemonic seed. The idea of versioning on mnemonic seeds was considered useful and recommended to be discussed separately.</summary>
