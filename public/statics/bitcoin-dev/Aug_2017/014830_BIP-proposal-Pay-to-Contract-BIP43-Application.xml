    <summary>The email conversation is about a method to embed cryptographic signatures into public keys based on HD Wallets - BIP32. The application uses two cryptographic signatures from both sides for practical purposes. The proposed construction includes contract base, payment base, and payment address which can only be reclaimed by the customer_contract_signature. The current application is not very durable as it doesn't store anything, instead, the customer downloads and manages the files. Gregory Maxwell raises concerns about the security of the construction, its applications and durability issues. omar shibli describes an abstract idea where levels are defined in BIP32 path, contract_id is an arbitrary number within valid indices and contract commitment address is computed using a cryptographic hash function. He also provides an example to illustrate the process. The full BIP draft is available on GitHub and they seek feedback to develop a standard.</summary>
