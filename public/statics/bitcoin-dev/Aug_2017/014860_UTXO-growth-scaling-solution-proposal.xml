    <summary>The discussion on whether or not to implement a feature that would make coins "expire" after a certain period of time has sparked debate among members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Some argue that such a feature would require significant warning and transparency, as well as a future-hard-fork X*N years ahead of time. Others suggest that it only makes sense to discuss creating a "never expire" transaction output if such a feature were being seriously considered. The possibility of scanning the blockchain for usage patterns in UTXOs is also addressed, with some pointing out the difficulty in doing so due to P2SH putting the script in the signature on spend. There is also discussion on the acceptance of CheckLockTimeVerify transactions and the potential security risks involved in forcing those who took coins offline to bring them back online. Overall, the conversation highlights the complexities and challenges of implementing a feature that would significantly alter the way in which bitcoin operates.</summary>
