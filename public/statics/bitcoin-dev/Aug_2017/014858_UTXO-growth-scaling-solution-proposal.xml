    <summary>A discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list focused on the possibility of implementing free transactions based on old priority rules. The initial concern was that forcing people to move coins around would be a tax on coin holders, however, it was argued that the fee for one transaction per decade would not matter and could be low priority. The proposal involved re-allowing free transactions based on old priority rules, with the oldest outputs getting higher priority and a potential reduction in unspent transaction output (UTXO) size. To ensure miners allow these transactions, one proposed rule was that the block must contain free transactions on old UTXOs to reclaim from the scavenged pool, which would reduce the reward for mining empty blocks before previous block transactions are validated. Another idea suggested was a two-step transaction where a fee is paid to register a UTXO refresh and returned from the pool on a later block to allow free scavenging of own addresses while discouraging miners from refusing free transactions. There was no consensus on how to implement this proposal without limiting the burden on consensus rules.</summary>
