    <summary>In the next 200 years, computers may become 2^100 times faster making it easier to crack old wallets. To prevent this, people should be forced to use newer, higher security wallets and turning coins into mining rewards is a better solution than them being hacked. However, the owner of the bitcoin should have the freedom to choose whether to upgrade their wallet or leave it open for the first hacker to assume the coins. The bitcoin network should not act like a hacker to assume the owner's coins.</summary>
