    <summary>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a question was raised on whether Bob can safely issue Native P2WPKH outputs to Alice if she gives him a specific address. The answer is no, and the issue of compressed vs uncompressed is irrelevant in this case. If Alice gives Bob a specific address, she is essentially saying that she will only accept payment to the scriptPubKey associated with that address. Payment to any other scriptPubKey may not be recognized by Alice.</summary>
