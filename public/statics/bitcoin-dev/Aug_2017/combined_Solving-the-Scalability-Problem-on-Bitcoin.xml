    <summary>The email thread discussed a proposal to solve the scalability issue in Bitcoin. The current size of the blockchain is around 140GB and growing exponentially with the number of users and transactions created, which could reach a Terabyte sooner than expected. To solve this problem, Adam Tamir Shem-Tov proposes the concept of "trusted" nodes, where one can choose some nodes to connect and from which block they want to download. These nodes would do this at their own risk, but there are ways to minimize the risk, like checking the latest blocks for matching hashes in sites like blockchain.info, or downloading and comparing the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) from all connected nodes.However, Thomas Guyot-Sionnest points out that pruning is already implemented in nodes, where only unspent inputs and the most recent blocks are kept. There was also a proposal to include UTXO in some blocks for SPV clients to use, but that would be additional to the blockchain data. Shem-Tov's proposed solution involves combining and pruning the blockchain in its entirety every 999 blocks to one block (Genesis block not included in count). Once block 1000 has been created, the network would be waiting for a special "pruned block," and until this block was created and verified, block 1001 would not be accepted by any nodes.The proposal suggests adding a Genesis Account which will be the new sender to fix the issue of removing all intermediate origins and making funds untraceable and hence unverifiable. The way bitcoin works is that the funds are verified by showing that they have an origin; this "origin" needs to provide a signature, otherwise the transaction won't be accepted. Hence the Genesis Account, which is not really an account, would replace old ones and allow any node creating this Exodus Block to sign with it. However, Guyot-Sionnest argues that it's not just the addresses and balance that need to be saved, but also each unspent output block number, tx position, and script that are required for validation on input. That's a lot of data to save every 1000 blocks, and it doesn't even guarantee being able to drop older blocks.The proposal also suggests changes to the hash reference system, UTXO table, and reward mechanism to shorten transactions in Bitcoin. It is noted that shortening can only happen within one block, but there are issues with nLockTime transactions and non-standard transactions. The proposed changes would affect many aspects of Bitcoin, including wallets, UTXO references, and the proof of work system.In conclusion, while the proposal to reduce the size of the blockchain is a good idea to address the scalability issue in Bitcoin, implementing it has its challenges. The issue with node pruning is that it is not standardized, and for a new node to enter the network and verify the data, it needs to download all data and prune it by itself. Additionally, there is no way to determine the authenticity of the blockchain midway, and keeping all blocks until a hard-coded checkpoint in the code means that as nodes upgrade and prune more blocks, older nodes will have difficulty syncing the blockchain. Shem-Tov's proposed solution involves combining and pruning the blockchain in its entirety every 999 blocks to one block, but this also has challenges such as saving each unspent output block number, tx position, and script required for validation on input.</summary>
