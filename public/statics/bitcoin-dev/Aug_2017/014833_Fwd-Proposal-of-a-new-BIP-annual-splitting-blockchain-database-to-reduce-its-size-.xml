    <summary>The email discusses a possible improvement to the Bitcoin blockchain database (BBD) size. The proposed routine involves an annual split of the BBD, where old blocks are separated from new blocks and packed into annual megablocks for storage in a side archive chain. The new blocks are kept with all rolled totals on the date of split. Additionally, tiny totals may be transferred to miners or deleted to cut the long tail of tiny holders. This approach aims to address the inconvenience of having a 140GB full wallet by allowing almost all nodes to hold only the rolled database while much less archive nodes hold a full expanded database. While the prune option can save disk space, the first synchronization still requires downloading the full database. Therefore, this approach offers an alternative solution to reducing the database size and improving convenience for users.</summary>
