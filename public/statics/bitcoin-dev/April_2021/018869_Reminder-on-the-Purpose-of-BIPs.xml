    <summary>David A. Harding has made recommendations regarding the BIP process and protocol documentation. He suggested adding more BIP editors, starting with Kalle Alm, seeking Luke Dashjr's resignation as BIPs editor, and treating protocol documents outside the BIPs repository as first-class BIP documentation. The third recommendation provides an escape hatch for those who think the process has failed. Anyone writing protocol documentation can post their idea to the mailing list and assign themselves a unique decentralized identifier starting with "bip-". They may also define a shorter alias that they encourage people to use in cases where the correct document can be inferred from context. The author then publishes the document to any place they like, although they are strongly encouraged to make any document source available under an open license to ensure others can create their own modifications. Implementations of BIPs link to the BIPs they implement to ensure researchers and developers can find the relevant protocol documentation. To help maintain quality and consistency between documentation, the BIP editors provide a BIP document template, guidelines similar to the existing BIP2, and an easy-to-run format linter. This decentralized BIPs alternative helps address some longstanding problems with the BIPs system.The recommendations were developed based on conversations with a few stakeholders in the BIPs process, but the author did not attempt a comprehensive survey and does not claim to speak for anyone else.</summary>
