    <summary>In a thread primarily focused on creating software and standards that support existing practices in the bitcoin community, a comment from Zac was deemed off-topic. Jeremy, the original poster of the thread, suggested that there have been other related posts recently where Zac's comment might be more appropriate. Zac's comment was not further elaborated upon. The thread continued with its original focus, and apologies were made for any confusion caused by the off-topic comment.</summary>
