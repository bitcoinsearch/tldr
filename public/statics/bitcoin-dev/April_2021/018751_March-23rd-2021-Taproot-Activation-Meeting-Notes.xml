    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Claus Ehrenberg expressed his desire to know if Taproot will eventually be activated or not. He suggests that activation should occur if either miners or users decide for it, and a chain split is the fairest way to resolve any conflicts. This would involve running Soft Fork Signaling (ST) and User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) concurrently. While this approach would provide a safe date for Taproot activation, it is uncertain whether or not users or miners want it.</summary>
