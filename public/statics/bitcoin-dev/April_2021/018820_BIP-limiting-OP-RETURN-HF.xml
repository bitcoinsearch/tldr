    <summary>The concept of merged mining involves utilizing a hash to create another chain. However, if only one hash is allowed per block, there may be competition between those who wish to use it, resulting in "fee-bidding." Currently, merged mining only requires one hash for a merkle root, which is stored in the coinbase. Simplifying this process would involve implementing two rules: no OP_RETURN transactions allowed and committing data in the coinbase transaction.In terms of payment, the question arises as to whether a transaction that burns bitcoins for the tx fee would be necessary. This also presents a storage concern.</summary>
