    <title>Update on "Speedy" Trial</title>

    <summary>The author of an email sent to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list provides an update on the status of Speedy Trial, a proposal aimed at expediting changes to the Bitcoin network. The timeline for the proposal is outlined, with a community meeting held in February establishing consensus that BIP 9 was "dead" in favor of BIP 8. In March, Russell O'Connor proposed "Speedy Trial" as a way to move forward quickly with no clear consensus on the LOT parameter in BIP 8. As of April, there are two open pull requests in Bitcoin Core for implementing Speedy Trial, but limited opposition to using block height has prevented any progress from being made. The author suggests that if this situation persists, it may be necessary to restart discussions about a user-activated soft fork.</summary>
