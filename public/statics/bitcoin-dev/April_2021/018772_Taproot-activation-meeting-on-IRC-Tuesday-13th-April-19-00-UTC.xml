    <summary>Michael Folkson has announced his plan to attend the Taproot activation meeting on IRC on Tuesday, April 13th at 19:00 UTC. He encourages other reviewers to review Core PR #21377 and recommends any alternative release be fully compatible with the activation parameters in Core if that PR is merged into Core. The focus of the meeting will be ratifying the Taproot activation plan previously discussed at the March 16th meeting. Miners will have 18 months in which to signal and accelerate activation. If not, taproot will activate regardless. The channel is also open for ongoing discussion 24/7 and there is a web chat client available. Bitcoin Mechanic has set up the meeting to discuss an alternative release to Core with Taproot activation code. Discussions will include deciding when Core should no longer be a consideration. Michael Folkson's contact details are also provided.</summary>
