    <summary>Amidst a proposal to form a stewardship committee of frequent contributors to oversee the appointment of editors, Bitcoin developer Amir Taaki has proposed that Bitcoin Core be dissolved as the official Bitcoin project and that the community be free to elect their preferred version of Bitcoin. He blames lack of vision and long-term roadmap for the problems within the Bitcoin Core team and suggests that developers commit to a fully specced standard that all implementations move towards using. Meanwhile, David A. Harding asks Greg Maxwell if he continues to oppose the addition of Kalle Alm following the merger of PR1104. In response, Maxwell expresses his opposition to adding Alm at this time, stating that those who believe doing so will resolve the situation are mistaken. The original proposal can be viewed on GitHub. In light of these developments, it is suggested that facilitation, mediation, and organization help is badly needed in the core development team. A good facilitator is said to open communication paths between all parties, leaving everyone satisfied with decisions. It is also suggested that people with such expertise can even be hired directly. However, compromising on quality is not recommended; one should always try to look for something better.</summary>
