    <summary>In an email exchange between Russell O'Connor and David A. Harding, the issue of estimating activation time for Bitcoin's Minimum Time Periond (MTP) was discussed. O'Connor pointed out that the estimation provided by ten-minute estimators is not accurate because it does not account for the time until the next retargeting period. He also highlighted that the "time_until_next_retargeting_period" variable could straddle between 0 days and 14 days if MIN_LOCKIN_TIME ends up close to a retargeting boundary, which could result in a two-week error in estimating activation time. O'Connor compared MTP LOCKIN with height-based activation and argued that the latter provides more accurate estimates consistently and smoothly as activation approaches. In contrast, MTP LOCKIN only guarantees a minimum two-week notice prior to activation. O'Connor emphasized that the simplicity and ease of reasoning about height-based activation make it a better option than MTP LOCKIN.</summary>
