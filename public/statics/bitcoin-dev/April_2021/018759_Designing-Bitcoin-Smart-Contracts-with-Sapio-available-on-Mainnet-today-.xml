    <summary>Sapio is an innovative tool that allows Bitcoin developers to create smart contracts in an intuitive, safe, and composable way. It challenges the notion that creating complex smart contracts for Bitcoin is impossible and opens the door for a myriad of new ideas to be easily defined. Sapio works today on mainnet without any protocol changes and will work with BIP-119 OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and Taproot when they are available. The language has evolved substantially since its introduction. One can learn more about what's possible by reading Designing Bitcoin Smart Contracts with Sapio and watching My Reckless VR Talk. A Congestion Control Tree contract with 25 recipients is currently being executed on mainnet using Sapio, which is the first Sapio contract to run on mainnet ever. The source code, arguments, compiler outputs, and transactions of this contract can be reviewed here. The repository includes examples for derivatives, vaults, coin pools, games, side chains, and more. These examples are not intended to be production-grade contracts yet but are demonstrative of what can be built and how. Developers can open up PRs with their ideas or issues encountered while implementing them.Tux, an experimental GUI, can be used to inspect, simulate, and interact with smart contracts. The software is still early work-in-progress, so it is advised to tread lightly and use regtest. Enough components work today to share the project and invite more developers to contribute or support it. Sapio is developed free and open-source for all bitcoiners by Judica.org. The milestone of the first mainnet Sapio contract was achieved with the help of Ryan Grant, BitMEX, ACINQ, Delphi Digital, Backend Capital, Jeremy Rubinâ€™s GitHub sponsors, and other supporters both fiscal and technical. The excellent work done on Miniscript and the rust-bitcoin ecosystem is also highlighted.</summary>
