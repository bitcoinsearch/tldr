    <summary>In a recent email exchange between Christopher Gilliard and Peter Todd, Gilliard expressed his intention to propose a layer 2 solution for timestamping that would integrate into other services. Todd responded by noting the existence of an existing aggregated timestamping service but also highlighted the limitations of timestamping for proving uniqueness. He then provided a link to his own proposal for a scalable single-use seal asset transfer. Todd also mentioned that the current high transaction fees serve as a deterrent to prevent excessive data embedding in the Bitcoin blockchain through consensus changes.</summary>
