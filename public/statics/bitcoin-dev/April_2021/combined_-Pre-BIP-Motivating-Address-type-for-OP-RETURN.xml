    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the use of OP_RETURN outputs and whether a non-transaction data structure should be introduced to store data on-chain while maximizing payload size versus on-chain size. The proposal suggests that this data structure should be almost as expensive in use per payload-byte as the next-cheapest alternative, which is currently using OP_RETURN with weight units. However, concerns were raised about the 10,000-byte limit applied when EvalScript is run and abuse of bech32m addressed outputs.The benefits of OP_RETURN include allowing more data in scriptSig (up to 80 bytes) versus 40 bytes for a BIP141 payload and exemption from the dust limit. However, there are also concerns over the potential for block chain graffiti. It was suggested that tools should default to meaningless representations of OP_RETURN data, such as displaying it in hex, to address the issue of offensive and illegal text in OP_RETURN data.The discussion then moved on to whether the OP_RETURN output should have a fixed length or support arbitrary length strings. It was suggested that if it doesn't support the full range, someone will complain later and there will have to be a v2 address. Another point of discussion was whether it should be possible to pay into such an OP_RETURN or categorize OP_RETURNS as a non-payable address type. It was argued that including arbitrary data in the blockchain is not currently useful for typical end-users and applications that want to use OP_RETURN with Bitcoin Core can already call create(psbt|rawtransaction) with the `data` field.Regarding parsing block data, it was suggested that there's no need to change Bitcoin Core's current representation of OP_RETURN outputs, which is just showing the hex-encoded script in RPC output. For any program needing OP_RETURN output, hex format is going to be the next best thing to getting it in raw binary. The increasing transaction fees were noted to push uses of OP_RETURN off the network or into more efficient constructions, so optimizing its use may not be necessary. However, some uses like stealth addresses or open timestamps may still merit some sort of standard address type.In a separate conversation, Dave discussed with Jeremy the structure of PSBTs and the possibility of creating a standard OP_RETURN address format. He expressed interest in the idea of an address format of OP_RETURN as long as it is not underwhelmingly motivated or lead to block chain graffiti. A demonstration was provided showing the creation of an 11,000 byte OP_RETURN on regtest, and the discussion ended with a call for further consideration of the motivation behind such a standard and its potential impact on block chain graffiti.The original poster of the thread expressed annoyance with having to program around OP_RETURN addresses, but acknowledged their historical significance and potential future use for metadata like stealth addresses. Another participant raised concerns about the wide range of possibilities that can be represented by script and the potential for inappropriate messages to be encoded in bech32m addresses.In a separate thread, Zac's comment was deemed off-topic, and the discussion continued with apologies for any confusion caused by the off-topic comment. Overall, the discussions emphasized the need for further consideration of the motivation behind such standards and their potential impact on the blockchain.</summary>
