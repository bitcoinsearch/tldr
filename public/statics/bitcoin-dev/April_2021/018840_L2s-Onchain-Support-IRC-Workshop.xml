    <title>L2s Onchain Support IRC Workshop</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the need for improvement in the tx-relay and mempool acceptance rules of the base layer, which have become major security and operational concerns for Lightning and other Bitcoin second-layers. The suggestion is to organize an in-person workshop to discuss these issues with the presence of both L1/L2 devs, but since it may not be possible this year due to travel restrictions, a series of one or more IRC meetings are proposed instead. The proposed topics of discussion include Package relay design or another generic L2 fee-bumping primitive like sponsorship, deprecation of opt-in RBF toward full-rbf, guidelines about coordinated cross-layers security disclosures, and guidelines about L2 protocols onchain security design. The goals of the meetings are to reach technical consensus and establish a philosophy design and associated documentations (BIPs, best practices, etc.) before seeking community consensus as it likely has ecosystem-wide implications. A timeline is also proposed, with a two-week consultation period, followed by the proposition of workshop agenda and schedule, and the actual IRC meetings in late May to early June. The email also contains links to relevant resources, including a GitHub repository with documents to assist the workshop and simulations of transaction pinning and mempool partitions attacks.</summary>
