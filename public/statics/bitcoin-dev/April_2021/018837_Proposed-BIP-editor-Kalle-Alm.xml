    <summary>Luke Dashjr proposed the addition of Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to help merge pull requests into the bips git repository. As there is no explicit process for adding BIP editors, Dashjr suggested using BIP 2's Process BIP progression, which allows a proposal to achieve rough consensus on the development mailing list and change status from Draft to Active. While a new Process BIP could be opened for each new editor, prior precedent exists for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors, making this unnecessary. Dashjr requested objections be raised soon if anyone disagreed with his proposal.</summary>
