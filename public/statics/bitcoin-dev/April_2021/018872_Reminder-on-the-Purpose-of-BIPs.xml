    <summary>David A. Harding has recommended changes to the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process, stating that it has failed and proposing solutions. The recommendations include adding additional BIP editors, seeking Luke Dashjr's resignation as BIPs editor, and treating protocol documents outside of the BIPs repository as first-class BIP documentation. The third recommendation provides an alternative to the current BIP process, allowing anyone writing protocol documentation in the spirit of the BIP process to post their idea to the mailing list and assign themselves a unique decentralized identifier starting with "bip-". The author then publishes the document to any place they'd like, although they are strongly encouraged to make any document source available under an open license to ensure others can create their own modifications. Implementations of BIPs, whether original repository BIPs or decentralized BIPs, link to the BIPs they implement to ensure researchers and developers can find the relevant protocol documentation. To help maintain quality and consistency between documentation, the BIP editors provide a BIP document template, guidelines similar to the existing BIP2, and an easy-to-run format linter. This proposal helps address some longstanding problems with the BIPs system, such as many casual Bitcoin users and developers thinking of documents in the BIPs repository as authoritative and some development teams wanting complete control over their own documentation.</summary>
