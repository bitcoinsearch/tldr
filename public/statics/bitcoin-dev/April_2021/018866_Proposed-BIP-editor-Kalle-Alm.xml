    <summary>On April 23rd, 2021, Luke Dashjr announced via bitcoin-dev that he intends to add Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to help with merging pull requests into the bips git repository. Another individual expressed their approval of this decision and noted that it is a positive development to see someone else interested in the BIP maintainer role. They also disagreed with the idea that a bot could perform the merging function just as effectively as a human, arguing that it would be more vulnerable to various types of malicious activity.</summary>
