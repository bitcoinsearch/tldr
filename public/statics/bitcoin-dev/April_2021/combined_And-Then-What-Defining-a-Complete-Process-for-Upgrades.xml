    <summary>An email was sent by Jeremy Rubin to the bitcoin-dev mailing list proposing a new upgrade mechanism for Bitcoin. The proposed mechanism includes a series of state transitions over two years with two soft forks and two quieting periods aimed at achieving consensus among miners and node operators. The proposal is compatible with Taproot's ST and aims to help form rough consensus around what to try next. The specific parameters are up for debate, but the relevant state transitions are captured in the diagram provided. The most contentious part of this proposal may be the PoW Fork, which emphasizes that committing to being on a minority chain due to a rule activation with low hashrate would cause tangible disruption. Questions are raised about missing state transitions, feasibility of making changes without restarting the whole process, length of periods, adjusting signaling thresholds, optimal forced signaling blocks, allowing min active height within signaling time, circumstances where skipping the second ST period may be desirable, and precedence of neg-ST over purple edge from ST2 bit 2 to Quieting 2.The letter addressed to Jeremy discusses the struggle to identify the complete set of problems that the process of organizing discussion around a repeatable process for soft-fork upgrades is attempting to solve. The writer argues against LOT=false deployment and the idea of miners having veto power over proposals. The proposal above is not seen as solving any meaningful progress on a consensus change process, particularly since it does not include a mechanism for gathering reliable information about user-preference in a sybil resistant way. Forced signaling is discussed, but its merit is unclear to the writer. The email concludes with a call for someone to write the software for the proposed mechanism.</summary>
