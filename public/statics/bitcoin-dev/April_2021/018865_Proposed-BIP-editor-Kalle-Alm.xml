    <title>Proposed BIP editor: Kalle Alm</title>

    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr proposed adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to assist in merging pull requests into the BIPs git repository. He suggested using BIP 2's Process BIP progression, which allows for a proposal to achieve rough consensus on the mailing list before becoming active. Dashjr noted that there is no explicit process for adding BIP editors, but there is prior precedent for editors appointing new editors. Sjors commented that having a single editor is not ideal and there are currently 110 open pull requests to the BIPs repo. Dashjr requested any objections be voiced soon.</summary>
