    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, in a message addressed to Bitcoin Developers, stated that there are currently no agenda items or technical issues to address. He mentioned that the Bitcoin Core team has successfully gotten Release Candidate 1 with Speedy Trial MTP in the pipeline. Rubin recommended reading https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1104 for more details on changes to BIP 341 hashed out by joint agreement of many community members. He also suggested taking the opportunity to enjoy the holiday given the high tensions. Yancy expressed his agreement with Jeremy's statement, acknowledging that it is time for people to enjoy the holiday. The tone of Yancy's message was appreciative and informal, using the word "cheers" to sign off. The message was brief and to the point, without any additional details beyond what Jeremy had originally stated.</summary>
