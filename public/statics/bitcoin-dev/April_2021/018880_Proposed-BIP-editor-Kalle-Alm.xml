    <summary>Amir Taaki, a former Bitcoin developer, criticized the Bitcoin Core team for its lack of vision and long-term roadmap. He proposed that Bitcoin Core be dissolved as the official Bitcoin project and urged for a period of self-reflection to determine where the problems began. In response, others in the Bitcoin community have suggested forming a stewardship committee comprised of frequent contributors to oversee the appointment of editors for the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Meanwhile, there has been controversy over adding Kalle Alm as an editor to the BIP process. Greg Maxwell opposes this addition and believes it will not resolve the situation regarding PR1104, which has already been merged. There is no official Bitcoin project, and individuals are free to elect their preferred version of Bitcoin.</summary>
