    <summary>Ivan has been working on an Electrum server implementation that uses zmq and libbitcoin as its backend. He has developed the Obelisk, which is available on GitHub. The aim of this project is to enable the use of the Electrum wallet with libbitcoin servers directly, without needing a protocol/server between a client and daemon. Ivan plans to keep track of new Electrum/ElectrumX protocols and implement them in Obelisk as they come. While it seems relatively simple to merge Obelisk into Electrum in current Electrum git, it's a breaking change that invalidates all old servers. Despite this, Ivan believes querying a libbitcoin server directly is not a bad idea at all. He welcomes feedback and review for Obelisk, which is around 1000 lines of Python 3 code with no external dependencies besides pyzmq.</summary>
