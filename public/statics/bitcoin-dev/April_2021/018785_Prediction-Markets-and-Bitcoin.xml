    <summary>The CEO of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Nwabudike Morgan, once stated that human behavior is economic behavior and competition for limited resources remains a constant. This statement holds true in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology where every joule of negentropy is a carefully measured resource. While it is essential for development to be free and experiment with new techniques, the people funding the development must impose the direction of the development. The negotiation between these two aspects is difficult and often unclear which is why prediction markets are necessary to advance the negotiation process. ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network, believes that prediction markets or tokens could assist in adding to the already existing information but cannot decide or replace anything. Bitcoin development should impact such markets rather than the other way around. It is the negotiation between development and the market that is challenging.</summary>
