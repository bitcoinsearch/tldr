    <summary>A proposal has been made for a new standard for soft fork activation that incorporates all the important ideas into one standard. The proposed standard is a multi-phase, multi-year standard that requires a soft fork to pass through all 14 phases before it can activate. The phases include Letâ€™s See What Happens, Start now, improve later, BIP 9 equivalent, Gently discourage apathy, BIP 91, BIP 148, Speedy Trial on mainnet and signet, Modern Soft Fork Activation, UASF BIP 8, and Second flag day. The standard is expected to take a minimum of 13 years, and if a soft fork fails during any one of these phases, it has to start from Phase 1 again. The proposed activation design must be conservative, and the standard is copyrighted with royalties paid into a quantum secure Bitcoin vanity address.</summary>
