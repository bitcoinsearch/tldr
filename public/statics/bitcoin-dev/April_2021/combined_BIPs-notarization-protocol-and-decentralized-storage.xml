    <summary>Christopher and Prayank have been discussing the use of decentralized storage for Bitcoin projects. Prayank suggests that implementing a proof of concept code in the BIP would be better, but it could also just be an LN project instead. He shares links related to decentralized storage and explains that torrents with Tor can be helpful for Bitcoin projects. He suggests an easy-to-use API for saving, reading, editing, etc. using torrents in Bitcoin projects, only involving payments when spamming is an issue. Christopher agrees with defining an API for both proposals and keeping it in a different document rather than including it in BIPs. He mentions using the BIP format for this proposal and other BIPs he is working on. However, he is open to changing the format if there's a better one for these BIPs. Christopher also mentions the incentivized moderation protocol mentioned in this BIP.During the discussion on Bitcoin development, Prayank suggested that a Lightning Network (LN) project may be more appropriate than a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). The conversation revolved around collaborations and the benefits they bring to the Bitcoin software. Luke notes that LN should actually be a collection of BIPs, indicating that the network could benefit from further standardization proposals.The writer is researching decentralized storage for a Bitcoin project and believes that torrents with Tor can be helpful for Bitcoin projects. They suggest an easy-to-use API for saving, reading, editing, etc. using torrents in Bitcoin projects, only involving payments when spamming is an issue. The writer also shares a link to JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/issues/415 as a project exploring similar options.</summary>
