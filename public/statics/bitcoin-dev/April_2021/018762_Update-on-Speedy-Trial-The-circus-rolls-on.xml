    <summary>The debate over the activation mechanism for Taproot, Bitcoin's upcoming upgrade, has led to a proposal of using a coin toss to decide between two competing pull requests. The coin toss was proposed by David Harding, who believed that both the MTP and height approaches required tradeoffs that were unresolvable to the best of current knowledge. However, some members of the community expressed their disapproval of using such informal methods in decision-making processes. While there is no known way to eliminate the tradeoffs and no way to objectively rank them, it is better to begin working on something concrete than trying to persuade everyone to adopt the same subjective ranking of the tradeoffs. The coin toss was not used in this case because the authors of the two PRs found a compromise solution that was good enough for both. It remains the case that there is nearly universal support for Taproot from every entity that has so far commented on it. Hopefully, progress on Speedy Trial will continue, and we'll soon be able to end this chapter in Bitcoin's storied history of soft fork activations.</summary>
