    <summary>A meeting was held regarding the use of a speedy trial variant, and there are no new objections to it. However, there is a desire to know if Rusty retracts or reaffirms his NACK in light of the responses. Rusty believes that prevaricating makes a future crisis less predictable and thus makes bitcoin less robust. He takes the approach that the users must make a direct intervention while Luke-Jr suggests that developers should ensure activation anyway. Speedy Trial takes a political approach to avoid facing an awkward question. Rusty suggests using LOT=false as a compromise position and continuing work on a LOT=true branch for future consideration. Although it may be less than optimal, people want Taproot activated more than they want groundwork future upgrades.</summary>
