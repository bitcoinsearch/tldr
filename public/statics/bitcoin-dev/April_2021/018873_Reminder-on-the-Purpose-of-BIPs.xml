    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process has been deemed a failure, according to Matt Corallo in a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. However, W.J. van der Laan suggests decentralizing the BIPs process and adding more editors could help with the 111 open pull requests bottlenecked on the bitcoin/bips repository. The issue of BIP authors not responding to changes is also noted, leading to suggestions that the BIP repository should mirror/aggregate author's own work trees. A workflow where maintainers tag entries as "changes needed" or "review requested," and then authors can remove the tags after making changes, might be a better solution than using PRs.</summary>
