    <title>BIP - limiting OP_RETURN / HF</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange, a user questioned why a particular Coinbase transaction had two OP_RETURN outputs. The OP_RETURN script is used for embedding data into a transaction and does not affect the transfer of bitcoins. The answer to the question was that one OP_RETURN output contained metadata about the transaction while the other held a message from a previous owner of the bitcoin, indicating that the current owner had confiscated it through a workaround. This highlights the possibility of losing ownership of bitcoin through such means.</summary>
