    <summary>On April 24, 2021, Greg Maxwell expressed his opposition to the addition of Kalle Alm due to the belief that it would not resolve the situation regarding PR1104. However, PR1104 has since been merged and Dave inquired whether Maxwell's opposition still stands. No further context or information was provided beyond this email exchange.</summary>
