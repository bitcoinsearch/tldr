    <summary>Bitcoin developers recently held their second fortnightly Taproot activation meeting to discuss several issues related to the technology. The modifications to Median Time Past (MTP) and Height were discussed, both of which are acceptable for Taproot activation according to most attendees. However, a coin flip was conducted to break the stalemate between the two options, with MTP winning. Contributors who agreed to abide by the coin flip will work to move MTP forward. There were mixed feelings about using a coinflip for a technical decision, but many agreed that both MTP and Heights were acceptable options and a coinflip was an appropriate way of putting aside minute preferences for the big picture. Jeremy Rubin emphasized the importance of rough consensus and running code. Meanwhile, Andrew Chow and AJ are working on unifying approaches to resolve contention between them regarding MTP-based ST. Rubin expressed confidence that Bitcoin's community would support the changes in line with the compromise between Andrew and AJ, and the changes should be implemented soon.</summary>
