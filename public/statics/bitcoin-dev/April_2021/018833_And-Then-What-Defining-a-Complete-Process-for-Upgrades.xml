    <summary>The letter proposes a development process that respects all groups in a balance of powers. The proposal is compatible with Taproot's ST and aims to help form rough consensus around what to try next. The specific parameters are up for debate, but the relevant state transitions are captured in the diagram provided. The most contentious part of this is the PoW Fork, which emphasizes that committing to being on a minority chain due to a rule activation with low hashrate would cause tangible disruption. Questions are raised about missing state transitions, feasibility of making changes without restarting the whole process, length of periods, adjusting signalling thresholds, optimal forced signalling blocks, allowing min active height within signalling time, circumstances where skipping the second ST period may be desirable, and precedence of neg-ST over purple edge from ST2 bit 2 to Quieting 2.</summary>
