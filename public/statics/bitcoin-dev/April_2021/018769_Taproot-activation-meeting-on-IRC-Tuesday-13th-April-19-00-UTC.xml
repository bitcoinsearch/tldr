    <summary>A Taproot activation meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 13th at 19:00 UTC. The purpose of the meeting is to ratify the Taproot activation plan discussed in the previous meeting on March 16th, also known as 2021-03 Plan Y. The focus will be on reaching a consensus on BIP8 and the remaining parameters. While there was no agreement on the LOT parameter, there seems to be a consensus on proceeding safely with LOT=True.The miners will have 18 months to signal and accelerate activation; otherwise, Taproot will activate regardless. With the majority of the economy running it, this guarantees eventual lock-in of taproot with the smallest chance of a chain split. The channel remains open for ongoing discussions 24/7, and a web chat client is available for use.The meeting's details were sent via email by Bitcoin Mechanic, using ProtonMail Secure Email. Interested parties can refer to the summary of the previous meeting via the provided link.</summary>
