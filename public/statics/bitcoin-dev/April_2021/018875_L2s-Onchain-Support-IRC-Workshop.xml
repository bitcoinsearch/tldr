    <summary>Antoine Riard, a developer, proposed a series of online meetings to discuss issues concerning the security and operational concerns for Lightning and other Bitcoin second-layers. The in-person workshops are not possible this year due to travel restrictions. Four topics have been proposed as discussion points: package relay design or another generic L2 fee-bumping primitive like sponsorship; deprecation of opt-in RBF toward full-RBF; guidelines about coordinated cross-layers security disclosures; and guidelines about L2 protocols onchain security design. A 2-week consultation period has been proposed to submit other topics related to tx-relay or mempools improvements towards L2s before finalizing the scope and agenda. The goal is to reach technical consensus and establish a philosophy design and associated documentations (BIPs, best practices, etc.). Antoine has started a collection of documents to assist this workshop, which can be found at https://github.com/ariard/L2-zoology.</summary>
