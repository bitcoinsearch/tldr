    <summary>Bitcoin developers recently held their second fortnightly Taproot activation meeting. The meeting covered several topics, including the modifications to Median Time Past (MTP) and Height, which are both acceptable for Taproot activation according to most attendees. However, a coin flip was conducted to break the stalemate between the two options, with MTP winning. Contributors who agreed to abide by the coin flip will work to move MTP forward. Meanwhile, Andrew Chow and AJ are working on unifying approaches to resolve contention between them regarding MTP-based ST. Jeremy Rubin expressed confidence that Bitcoin's community would support the changes in line with the compromise between Andrew and AJ, and the changes should be implemented soon.</summary>
