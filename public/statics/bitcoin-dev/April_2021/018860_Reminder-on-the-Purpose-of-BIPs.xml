    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo addressed accusations that he was deliberately refusing to accept changes to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Corallo denied these claims, stating that he was simply following the established BIP process and would get to all PRs in due time, likely before the end of the month. Corallo also accused certain individuals of attempting to manipulate the BIP approval process to push their own agenda, and claimed that they had been harassing him for special treatment. He stated that he would not be complicit in this deception, and would continue to process BIP PRs neutrally according to the currently-defined process.Despite some efforts by Corallo to speed up the process, he claimed that he was obstructed both times by advocates of an alternative client called "ST." These advocates, according to Corallo, intend to put Bitcoin and the BIP process under their control and abuse it as they did with Bitcoin Core's usual standards by releasing ST without community consensus.</summary>
