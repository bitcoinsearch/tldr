    <title>Reminder on the Purpose of BIPs</title>

    <summary>A GitHub user, Matt Corallo, has criticized another user, Luke Dashjr, for his handling of updates to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process. Corallo noted that while one BIP (#1104) had been updated frequently over many weeks, Dashjr had only made one comment 12 days ago, and that was a criticism ("Concept NACK") which didn't seem relevant. Meanwhile, another BIP (#1105) which had been updated less frequently had received a comment from Dashjr just 19 hours earlier. Corallo accused Dashjr of "playing dumb" and claimed that the BIP process had "failed". Dashjr responded by saying that he had been working through PRs in order of "Recently updated" on GitHub, starting with the least-recent.</summary>
