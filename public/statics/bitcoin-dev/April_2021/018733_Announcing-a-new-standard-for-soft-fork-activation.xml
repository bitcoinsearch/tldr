    <summary>The email from Michael Folkson to the bitcoin-dev mailing list proposes a new standard for soft fork activation, incorporating all the recent proposals into one multi-phase, multi-year standard. The 14 phases include BIP 8, BIP 9 equivalent, BIP 91, BIP 148 and Speedy Trial on various networks and testnets, as well as a Modern Soft Fork Activation phase which is the longest and most complex phase of the standard. If a soft fork fails at any point during activation, it must start again from Phase 1. The overall aim is to demonstrate Bitcoin's ultimate conservatism in its activation process. Folkson suggests that this rigorous standard will get a BIP number in time.</summary>
