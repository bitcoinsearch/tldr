    <summary>A meeting is scheduled for this Tuesday as per the email sent to bitcoin-dev mailing list. The agenda of the meeting includes three items. Firstly, AJ's update to MTP time which has been substantially updated and simplified using a purely MTP-based approach. Secondly, selecting between MTP and Height is to be discussed with a focus on reaching a consensus on either approach. Lastly, the timeline discussion will occur after reaching a consensus on item 2. In case of failure to reach a consensus, scheduling realities will be discussed. Anyone who cannot attend the meeting is free to leave a comment on any agenda item below or suggest other things to be discussed.</summary>
