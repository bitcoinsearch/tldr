    <summary>On April 23, 2021, Jeremy Rubin via bitcoin-dev acknowledged the addition of Kalle Alm as a qualified reviewer and editor to assist in merging PRs into the bips git repo. This announcement came after Luke Dashjr proposed to add Kalle as a BIP editor. Since there is no explicit process for adding BIP editors, Dashjr suggested using BIP 2's Process BIP progression, which states that a proposal can achieve rough consensus on the mailing list if it has been open to discussion for at least one month with no unaddressed substantiated objections. While a new Process BIP could be opened for each new editor, Dashjr believed it was unnecessary since there is prior precedent for BIP editors appointing new ones. Anyone who disagreed was encouraged to speak up soon.</summary>
