    <summary>A user named NACK has revealed that they have lost the private key to their emergency backup pre-signed transactions, which contained two OP_RETURN outputs. They claim to have stored these transactions in a vault, but unfortunately lost the key due to an "unfortunate boating incident." However, a proposed rule change could result in the confiscation of NACK's funds.Meanwhile, Christopher Gilliard has created a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) and shared it on Github. The proposal, which can be found at https://github.com/cgilliard/bips/blob/notarization/bip-XXXX.mediawiki, appears to be related to notarization. Gilliard has invited comments and suggestions on the proposal.It is unclear whether there is any connection between NACK's situation and Gilliard's BIP, or if they are simply unrelated occurrences happening within the same timeframe. Nonetheless, the bitcoin-dev mailing list has been notified of Gilliard's proposal and discussions may ensue.</summary>
