    <summary>In a message addressed to Bitcoin Developers, Jeremy Rubin stated that there are currently no agenda items or technical issues to address. The Bitcoin Core team has been successful in getting Release Candidate 1 with Speedy Trial MTP in the pipeline. Rubin referred readers to https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1104 for more details on changes to BIP 341 that were hashed out by joint agreement of many community members. He also recommended that everyone take the opportunity to enjoy the holiday given the high tensions.</summary>
