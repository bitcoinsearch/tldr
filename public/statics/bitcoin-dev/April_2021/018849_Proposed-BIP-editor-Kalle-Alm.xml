    <summary>There is a discussion about whether the BIP maintainership role should be given to a bot or not. The job seems like it could easily be done by a bot, considering the explicit criteria for the role. Recent human behavior has shown that a move towards automation may be necessary. However, there are some concerns about adding certain individuals to the team, such as Kalle Alm, and how it will impact the situation with Luke-jr's inappropriate behavior regarding PR1104. This discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and was expressed by Greg Maxwell.</summary>
