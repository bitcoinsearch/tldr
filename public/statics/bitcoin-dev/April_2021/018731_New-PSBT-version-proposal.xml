    <summary>In an email exchange, Lloyd Fournier expressed agreement with the removal of the global transaction and storing input/output data together in new unified structures for Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs). However, Fournier wondered about the possibility of incorporating output descriptors into PSBTs. Output descriptors are useful in determining maximum satisfaction weight for inputs to properly align fees as they're added. While there hasn't been any discussion on including them in this revision, Sipa previously explained to Fournier that PSBTs already have all the necessary information from a descriptor, such as determining maximum satisfaction weight from the witness/redeem script fields. As descriptors are more useful in higher level applications, while PSBTs are useful for communicating with signing devices, there is no need for PSBTs to support descriptors.</summary>
