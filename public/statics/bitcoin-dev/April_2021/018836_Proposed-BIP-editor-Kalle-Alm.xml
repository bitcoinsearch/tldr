    <title>Proposed BIP editor: Kalle Alm</title>

    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr proposed adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to help merge PRs into the bips git repository. Dashjr suggested using BIP 2's Process BIP progression to achieve rough consensus on the matter since there is no explicit process for adding BIP editors. However, he also noted that prior precedent exists for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors. Jeremy Rubin acknowledged that Kalle is a qualified reviewer/editor and well-suited for the role. No objections were raised.</summary>
