    <summary>Christopher and Prayank have been discussing the concept of decentralized storage for Bitcoin projects. Prayank suggests that an implementation or proof of concept code in the BIP would be better, and also suggests that it could just be a LN project instead of a BIP. He shares some links related to decentralized storage and explains that the kind of decentralized storage that he thinks can be helpful for Bitcoin projects uses torrents for files and communication required (with Tor). He also suggests having an easy-to-use API to save, read, edit, etc., something in a Bitcoin project using torrents, and only involving lightning network and payments when spamming can be an issue. Christopher agrees with Prayank on the idea of defining an API for both proposals and keeping it in a different document rather than including it in BIPs. He also agrees with Prayank's opinion on Tor. Christopher mentions that he used the BIP format for this proposal and other BIPs he is currently working on, and there are several "Application" BIPs, which is why he decided it made sense. However, he is open to changing the format if it's decided that there's a better one for these BIPs. Christopher also mentions the incentivized moderation protocol, which is mentioned in this BIP.</summary>
