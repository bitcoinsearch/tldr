    <summary>In response to a comment made by Greg Maxwell on the addition of Kalle Alm as an editor, a member named JC proposed forming a stewardship committee of frequent contributors to appoint a small set of editors with permanent oversight. This process would prevent controversies from arising in the future and make proceedings clear. JC's proposal has been moderated off the list but can be viewed on GitHub. David A. Harding asked if Greg still opposed the addition of Kalle Alm now that PR1104 has been merged. The discussion takes place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
