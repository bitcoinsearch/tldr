    <summary>Zstandard (zstd) is a block compression algorithm that offers better properties than its competitors, particularly for decompression, according to Pavol Rusnak, the co-founder and CTO of SatoshiLabs. The GitHub repository for zstd is provided in the context.A recent discussion on Bitcointalk revealed that Blockstream satellite codebase has an alternative serialization that works on a single transaction and saves approximately 20%. This method avoids violating layering, preserves single transaction access, and is compatible with transaction relay. The format optimizes predictable hashes, achieving savings that no generic compressor could ever achieve. However, most of the savings from generic compressors come from repeated pubkeys and addresses, which may be reduced by taproot due to shrinking multisig and signature aggregation in the future.Using generic compression interfaces like zlib across networks has had a disappointing security track record. In the past, multiple discussions have revolved around using generic compressors, as evidenced by the list archive and bitcoin-core Github. Recently, Nitsopoulos Konstantinos suggested compressing new blocks using the 7z file type by up to 18%, reducing the size of the blockchain under 290GB if it's converted into a 7z archive-chain. However, programming compression was too difficult for him, and he hoped someone else would do it. He also believed that transactions could be compressed by replacing addresses and coins wherever possible with their own unique sequential index, reducing the size of a transaction between two existing addresses to half or maybe a quarter of its current size.</summary>
