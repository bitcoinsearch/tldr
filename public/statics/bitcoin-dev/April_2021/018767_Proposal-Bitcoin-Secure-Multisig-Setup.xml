    <title>Proposal: Bitcoin Secure Multisig Setup</title>

    <summary>In a recent conversation, the concern of losing multisig setup context was raised. It was noted that in the event of a fire where only steel engraved mnemonics are recovered, but wallet descriptors are lost, this could be a problem. While BIP48 and sorted_multi descriptors can save you if all devices are still present and the threshold is known or guessed, in a 2-of-3 setup where one device is lost without metadata, your coins will be lost. In the future with musig and miniscript, the setup data is just as critical as the seeds. However, if at least one device is still intact and has the configuration, you're good to go. Nonetheless, there are devices out there that can't do this and therefore it would still be useful to have them.</summary>
