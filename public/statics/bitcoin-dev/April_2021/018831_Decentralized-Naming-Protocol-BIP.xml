    <summary>A recent thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has highlighted an additional BIP created by Christopher Gilliard, which defines a decentralized naming protocol. The BIP can be found on GitHub and is associated with other recent BIPs that have been sent to the mailing list. The proposed protocol appears to be similar to Namecoin, which is a decentralized naming system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It remains to be seen how this new proposal will differ from existing systems like Namecoin and whether it will gain traction in the cryptocurrency community. As of yet, there has been no further information or updates regarding the proposed protocol.</summary>
