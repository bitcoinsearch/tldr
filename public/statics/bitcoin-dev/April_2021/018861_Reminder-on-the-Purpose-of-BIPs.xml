    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a BIP editor, has responded to accusations of deliberately refusing to accept changes approved by authors. He denies the allegations and claims that bad actors are misportraying the BIPs as an approval process to push their own agenda. He also states that he will process the BIP PR neutrally according to the currently-defined BIP process, despite being harassed by ST advocates demanding special treatment. Luke has made two attempts to make things faster but was obstructed both times by ST advocates who intend to paint him as "deliberately refusing" in order to put Bitcoin and the BIP process under their control. They have abused Bitcoin Core's usual standards by releasing ST without community consensus.</summary>
