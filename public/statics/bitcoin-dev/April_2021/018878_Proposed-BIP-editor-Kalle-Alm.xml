    <summary>The ongoing controversies surrounding Bitcoin continue as a proposal is made that the Bitcoin Core monopoly be dissolved and the community allowed to elect their preferred version of Bitcoin. This comes as criticism is leveled at the lack of vision and long-term roadmap for Bitcoin, with many good minds and cryptographers having left the project, leaving an "empty echo chamber." The proposal suggests that Bitcoin developers commit to a fully specced standard that all implementations move toward using. In addition, a recent proposal by Jaime Caring via bitcoin-dev to form a stewardship committee of frequent contributors, including Greg and 21 others, has been met with opposition. The proposal aims to prevent future controversies through a defined process and clear proceedings. However, Greg Maxwell has opposed the addition of Kalle Alm as an editor, stating that those who believe it will resolve the situation regarding PR1104 are mistaken. Despite this, PR1104 has been merged, prompting David A. Harding to ask whether Maxwell still opposes the addition. Overall, there are deep-rooted issues within the Bitcoin community that need to be addressed before any patching of processes can occur. The proposal to dissolve the Bitcoin Core monopoly and allow the community to elect their preferred version of Bitcoin may be a step in the right direction towards resolving these issues. However, there is also opposition to proposed solutions such as forming a stewardship committee, indicating that finding a resolution will not be easy.</summary>
