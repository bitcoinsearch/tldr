    <summary>Bitcoin futures markets provide an opportunity to make money and filter out noise, but require money to participate, according to a blog post by Bitcoin developer Prayank. The markets can also be manipulated by exchanges or traders with large amounts of money, and could distract from the development of Bitcoin itself. Prediction markets or tokens could help improve information about Bitcoin, but should not replace Bitcoin development. A chatroom requiring payments in satoshis could be used as a better way to filter out noise while also supporting developers.</summary>
