    <summary>On Fri, Apr 23, 2021, Luke Dashjr proposed adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to assist in merging PRs into the bips git repo. There is no explicit process to adding BIP editors, so it was suggested to use BIP 2's Process BIP progression, which allows a proposal to achieve rough consensus on the mailing list and be open to discussion for at least one month, with no unaddressed objections to become Active. There is prior precedent for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors, so this approach was deemed appropriate by Luke. Pindar Wong acknowledged Kalle's exceptional contributions and btcdeb.</summary>
