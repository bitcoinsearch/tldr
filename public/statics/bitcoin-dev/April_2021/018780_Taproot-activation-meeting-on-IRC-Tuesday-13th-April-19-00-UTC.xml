    <summary>BitcoinMechanic announced a Taproot activation meeting on IRC, which will focus on ratifying the Taproot activation plan previously discussed at the March 16th meeting. While there was never any consensus reached on the LOT parameter, there appears to be consensus on BIP8 and the remaining parameters, and more than sufficient support for LOT=True to proceed safely. Miners will have 18 months in which to signal and accelerate activation, and if not, taproot will activate regardless. With a majority of the economy running this, it will guarantee eventual lock-in of taproot with the smallest chance of a chain split. The channel is also open for ongoing discussion 24/7, and there is a web chat client available.</summary>
