    <summary>On April 16, 2021, Christopher Gilliard via bitcoin-dev proposed removing legacy multi-signature capabilities. However, Andrew Poelstra, the Director of Research at Blockstream, pointed out that doing so would be impossible without confiscating coins and gutting almost all of Script. Instead, he suggested encouraging individuals who encode arbitrary data in transactions to use OP_RETURN outputs to avoid UTXO bloat. Gilliard argued that it is not possible to completely prevent individuals from putting arbitrary data values into their transactions because of the flexibility in transaction data. The discussion ended with a quote by Justin Lewis-Webster: "The sun is always shining in space."</summary>
