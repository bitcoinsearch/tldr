    <summary>Michael Folkson expressed his discomfort regarding the ongoing controversy surrounding Taproot, a Bitcoin protocol upgrade. He stated that he is worried about the impact this could have on individuals and businesses worldwide who plan to utilize and build upon Taproot. He also expressed his desire to distance himself from the situation while keeping the mailing list informed of any further developments.Andrew Poelstra responded by stating that he wants to use Taproot and does not care about the activation parameters or block height vs MTP debate. He suggested that if a coin toss is what it takes for people to move past the controversy, then he is fine with it.Andrew Poelstra is the Director of Research at Blockstream and can be contacted via email at apoelstra@wpsoftware.net.</summary>
