    <summary>On Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrew Poelstra expressed his opinion on the Taproot activation parameters. He stated that as someone who wants to use Taproot, he doesn't care about the activation parameters and especially doesn't care about block height vs MTP. He suggested that if a coin toss is what it takes for people to move past this, that's fine by him. Michael Folkson, another member of the mailing list, expressed his discomfort with the situation surrounding the Taproot activation parameters. He mentioned that he dreaded the thoughts of individuals and businesses all over the world who have plans to utilize and build on Taproot. However, it's worth noting that while the coin toss was acceptable to many people, the two authors of actual code for the two proposals here also came to an agreement on a way forward. This means that it wasn't a "coin toss to overrule everyone on 'the other side'". In conclusion, there are differing opinions on the Taproot activation parameters, but ultimately, a way forward has been agreed upon by the authors of the proposals.</summary>
