    <summary>In an email dated April 6th, 2021, David A. Harding provided instructions for upgrading a system. He stated that the upgrade should be done by a specific date, which can be calculated using the command "date -d "$MIN_LOCKIN_TIME + 11 days". He also provided variations of this command for estimators who can calculate in ten or nine-minute increments. However, a correction was made to the ten-minute estimator's command, stating that it should be "$MIN_LOCKIN_TIME + time until next retargeting period + $((10 * 2016)) minutes" instead of just adding 10 times 2016 minutes.</summary>
