    <summary>The writer is researching decentralized storage for a Bitcoin project and expresses interest in the concept. They suggest an implementation or proof of concept code in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) would have been better, but since it involves the Lightning Network (LN), it could just be an LN project instead of a BIP. The writer shares two links that may be helpful to Christopher: bkiac/tarnhelm and ElementsProject/filebazaar. The writer mentions that they believe decentralized storage using torrents with Tor can be helpful for Bitcoin projects. They suggest an easy-to-use API for saving, reading, editing, etc. for Bitcoin projects using torrents, only involving payments when spamming is an issue. They give an example of developers wanting users to pay for every Peer-to-Peer offer they create using a DEX protocol. The writer also shares a link to JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/issues/415 as a project exploring similar options.</summary>
