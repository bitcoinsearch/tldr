    <summary>Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo has criticized the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, calling on stakeholders to "agree the BIP process has simply failed and move on." In response, David A. Harding has proposed three recommendations for improving the BIP process: adding additional editors, seeking Luke Dashjr's resignation as BIPs editor, and treating protocol documents outside the BIPs repository as first-class BIP documentation. The third recommendation involves creating a decentralized BIP alternative, where anyone can post their ideas to a mailing list and assign themselves a unique decentralized identifier starting with "bip-". Documents will be published to any place they like, with implementations of BIPs linking to the relevant protocol documentation. The BIP editors would provide guidelines, linters, and a template to maintain quality and consistency. This approach aims to address some longstanding problems with the BIPs system and give control over their own documentation to development teams.</summary>
