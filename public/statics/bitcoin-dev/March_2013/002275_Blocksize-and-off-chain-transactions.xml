    <summary>In a discussion about increasing the blocksize limit as a solution to increased transaction volume, there is disagreement over whether to go down the path of off-chain transactions or not. However, it is acknowledged that the blocksize limit will likely be raised in less than two years due to pressure from big businesses using the chain. Despite this, the vision has always been to scale up and limit the blockchain to single-digit transactions-per-second is not an option. Off-chain transactions will also be necessary for instantly confirmed transactions. The discussion is tabled until version 0.8.1 is out the door. Decentralization offers no benefit to big businesses, making them a regulation target by virtue of size alone.</summary>
