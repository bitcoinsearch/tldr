    <summary>The author of the post has been working on implementing a bitcoin daemon in erlang for some time now. The project is currently in its early stages of development, with the author using the specification from https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki, the original paper, and examining the protocol messages received from peers. Despite being only several days old, the daemon is capable of connecting and parsing messages from 3000+ peers on a 256M RAM VPS without swap. However, at this stage, the daemon does not do much besides peer discovery and protocol parsing. The author's goal is to create a scalable bitcoin daemon that can serve many thousands of peers on relatively low-end servers. In the short term, the author plans to accept incoming connections and announce their own address via an "addr" message. In the mid-term, they plan to add validation and routing (test on testnet), and release the source under an open license (AGPL). In the long term, the author aims to create a full-featured daemon.In case anyone wants to support the project with BTC, the author included a donation address (1GVmS56pvVL7YZA7YqMBXmaDedCoputKuJ) alongside the announcement. Users can check their logs for "/ebtcd:0.0.1/" to see if the daemon has connected to their machine. One bug has already been found during the development process.</summary>
