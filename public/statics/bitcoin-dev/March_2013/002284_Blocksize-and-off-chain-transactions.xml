    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed a solution to address the issue of a block causing version 0.7 to "get stuck." The solution involved releasing version 0.8.1, which would mimic the old behavior as a stopgap measure. However, it was suggested that the new version should not emulate the old behavior too precisely, as it may cause issues for nodes using version 0.7. Instead, a network with a mix of version 0.8.1 and version 0.7 nodes would remove the risk of a fork. Nonetheless, Pieter Wuille proposed patching version 0.7 as well to ensure a quick transition to version 0.8.1.</summary>
