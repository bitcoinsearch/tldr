    <title>[PATCH] Change recommended fee to 0.001 BTC</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, a user named Rune K. Svendsen suggested changing the minimum fee recommended in the Main tab of the Options dialog from 0.01 to 0.001 or even lower. He proposed doing string substitution for both the value and the unit by defining a new value solely for display or using MIN_TX_FEE or MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE in some way. He sought more opinions from other developers before proceeding to write the code. Luke-Jr replied to his suggestion, advising him to use GitHub pull requests or publish a git repository instead of mailing patches. He also suggested two commits for this change and expressed no opinion on whether the recommended fee should be changed or not. Eligius uses a lower minimum fee, but most pools/miners treat anything under 0.01 BTC as if it were no fee at all.</summary>
