    <summary>In a discussion about the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, Mike Hearn mentioned that it is stored in LevelDB and not in memory. Outputs that are never spent are not in the working set and eventually end up in the bottom levels of the database where they hardly get accessed. He also noted that if necessary, they can move outputs that are unlikely to be spent into a separate database to lighten the load on LevelDB. There was a concern raised about an attack if UTXO is not stored in fast storage.</summary>
