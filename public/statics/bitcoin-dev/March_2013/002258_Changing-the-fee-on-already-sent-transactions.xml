    <summary>In a message sent on March 12, 2013, at 9:47 AM, Peter Todd discussed the possibility of transaction replacement for the purpose of adding fees to existing transactions. According to Todd, this could be done safely without increasing the risk of double-spends by using the stubbed out replacement code. However, he also noted that adding fees was already possible by respending change, at least for miners running an Eligius branch (both 0.6.0 and 0.8.0).</summary>
