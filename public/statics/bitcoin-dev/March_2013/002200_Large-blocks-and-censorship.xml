    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin core developer, notes that auditable off-chain transaction systems are vulnerable. He argues that trustworthy ones require some on-chain transactions to be publicly known so that the total amount of reserves held by off-chain transaction providers can be audited. Even with Gregory Maxwell's suggestion of maintaining a "reserve" account backed by funds that rarely move, the spendability of those funds is in question and miners can easily block fidelity bond sacrifice transactions. Additionally, merge-mining is also vulnerable to censorship forces, making alt-chains competition censored with large blocks.</summary>
