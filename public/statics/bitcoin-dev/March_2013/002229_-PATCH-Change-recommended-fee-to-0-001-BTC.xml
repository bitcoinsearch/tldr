    <summary>In an email conversation between Rune Kjær Svendsen and Luke-Jr on March 11, 2013 at 9:17:25 PM, they discussed the possibility of doing string substitution for both the value and unit in Qt documentation. Luke-Jr suggested using a formatted string and another function to format the string. However, Rune Kjær Svendsen planned on using the method described on the "Use QString::arg() for Simple Arguments" page and putting a %1 and %2 in the translation strings to substitute for value and unit, respectively. He also mentioned wanting to define the constant in main.h alongside MIN_TX_FEE and MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE.</summary>
