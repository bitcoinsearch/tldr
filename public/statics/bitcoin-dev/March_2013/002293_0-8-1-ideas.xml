    <summary>On March 13, 2013, Luke-Jr proposed a simple solution to start a discussion. Andy Parkins responded, expressing that the biggest failure was not developing two chains but the assurance given to users by the client that their transactions were confirmed. Luke-Jr replied saying that detecting and warning about non-trivial forking could be useful, assuming it wasn't already happening. He further stated that there's no reason why end user clients shouldn't warn of such situations when they can, even if they are not always aware of the fork. It is unclear whether there is any automatic monitoring for forks, but Luke-Jr assumed that the core developers and Bitcoin Foundation would put some in place.</summary>
