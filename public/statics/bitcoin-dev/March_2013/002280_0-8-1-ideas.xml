    <summary>In a mailing list exchange, Mark Friedenbach and Luke-Jr discussed the issue of whether or not to add-to/modify the bitcoin protocol rules which all verifying implementations must adhere to. Luke-Jr suggested adding to the protocol rules while Mark suggested changing the old codebase to do what they expected it to do all along. Mark argued that there is a bug in the old codebase that needs fixing, and they should be forward-thinking and fix the bug, notify people responsibly, give them time to react, and move on, instead of codifying the bug in the protocol. Pieter Wuille joined the conversation, pointing out that Mark's suggestion would still result in some nodes accepting blocks they formerly considered invalid, and therefore, it is still a hardfork.</summary>
