    <title>New webpage:  Offline Backups</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin.org has a new webpage which includes a "You need to know!" section suggesting offline backups, but the website should also include options for offline storage such as Armory and Electrum on the "wallets" page. The current situation is considered silly, as the website recommends offline backups without providing any recommendations or dedicated pages for how to do it, leaving users to find their own way. This issue was addressed by Alan in an email to the Bitcoin.org team.</summary>
