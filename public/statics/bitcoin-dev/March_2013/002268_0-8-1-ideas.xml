    <summary>In an email conversation, Luke-Jr proposed a hard fork from block 262144 to block 393216, where any block that includes more than 24391 transaction modifications on its own will be rejected. This change will ensure that older client backports remain safe unless there is a reorg deeper than six blocks. Another participant didn't like the two stages of the proposal and suggested choosing a number closer to 4911 as it guarantees to be less than what pre-0.8 accepts, but still need not be small. The proposal would involve accepting some risk of "backport" clients getting stuck after large reorgs, which would require manual intervention to unstick them. However, the participant argued that this risk halves the complexity of the change by avoiding two hard forks. The 'never make' half of the proposal could likely be implemented without issue. The size change should be a separate process once a low-risk/low-controversy hardforking change has been proven. This would prevent another issue like the current one where the increase in block target exposed inadequate testing.</summary>
