    <summary>In an email exchange on March 23, 2013, Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik discuss the use of bitcoind for mining. Luke-Jr questions whether anyone is using bitcoind 0.7 or later for mining purposes, to which Garzik responds that several pools, including slush, BTC Guild, and ozcoin, are using it. However, Luke-Jr clarifies that these pools are not using bitcoind for producing coinbases where BIP 34 is implemented. Garzik acknowledges this but notes that it's still misleading to imply that bitcoind is nowhere in the stack. Garzik works at exMULTI, Inc.</summary>
