    <summary>In 2013, Michael Gronager suggested increasing the soft and hard limit of Bitcoin to 1 and 10MB respectively. However, Peter Todd expressed concern about jumping into unknown scaling territory immediately after experiencing a hard-fork due to previously unknown scaling issues. He argued that another chain split could be far more damaging to Bitcoin than expensive transactions due to increased competition. Todd suggested letting the issue rest for a while and taking time to work on various approaches to solving the problem. He believed that even if growth temporarily slowed, it would hardly be a disaster.</summary>
