    <summary>The Bitcoin team has announced plans for the 0.8.1 release, which includes a new CheckBlock() rule that only allows blocks compatible with old releases to be accepted into the main chain. The limit of 500k to blocks created will also be in effect until May 15. Alerts will be sent to pre-0.8 releases over the next two months telling people to either upgrade or create a DB_CONFIG file so they can handle large blocks. The binaries for the 0.8.1 version will be available late tomorrow or Monday. An expires-after-24-hours alert will be sent on Tuesday to everybody running pre-0.8, pointing to http://bitcoin.org/may15.html. Another 24-hour alert will be sent on April 15, reminding everybody again they will need to upgrade or workaround. A final alert that never expires will be sent on May 8th. After May 15, miners will be free to create blocks up to 1MB, and anybody running old versions who ignored the alerts may be left behind.Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has stated that he will not be changing the date for the upcoming "Bitcoin Independence Day" celebration on May 15. Despite acknowledging that it may be inconvenient and confusing, Andresen is firm in his decision to stick to the original date. He also expressed his lack of interest in discussing any potential changes to the timing, citing the need to focus on more important tasks, such as hard-forking to increase the 1MB blocksize limit. The move is seen by many as practice for the eventual hard-fork that will be necessary to further increase the blocksize limit.In an email conversation on March 16, 2013, between Alan Reiner and Gavin Andresen, the latter mentioned that he arbitrarily chose May 15 as the date for people to upgrade or find a workaround. Reiner suggested pushing back the date by a week, considering the Bitcoin Conference was scheduled two days after May 15, which could cause unnecessary stress if something goes wrong. However, since the page bitcoin.org/may15.html had already been created, changing the date at this point would be impractical. The email thread ends with a quote stating the causes of servitude can be attributed to the tyranny of money.In an email conversation on March 17, 2013, Frank F discussed the may15.html page on bitcoin.org. Although he believes it would be unwise to change the page at that point, he also expressed concern about the recommended configuration on the page. Frank stated that while the new lock limit should be good for up to two block deep reorgs, he doubted merchants and miners would want to get stuck if someone pulls off a three-block deep reorg. He suggested that the recommended limit should be at least 292692. Additionally, Frank believed that set_lg_max may need upward bumping, but he wasn't sure how to calculate the correct value. Frank also questioned why the example config does set_lg_dir since it could potentially cause problems if the client is using a different directory. Finally, he requested that a note be added indicating that 0.4.x, 0.5.x, 0.6.x, and 0.7.x will be receiving backports in their next stable releases before May 15.</summary>
