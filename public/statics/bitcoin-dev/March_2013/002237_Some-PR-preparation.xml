    <summary>Bitcoin suffered a short and harmless lapse that caused transaction delays of a few hours due to a bug that was fixed. The coins are safe, and it would have been difficult to exploit the incident for gain. It is important to emphasize this fact to counteract negative attention the story may receive. Preparing PR comments to post on articles immediately after they go public could make a difference in how the story is perceived. The blowback from this event is mostly psychological, but it is likely to draw more negative attention than it deserves. Articles and commenters may describe this as the end of Bitcoin, but it should be portrayed as a minor issue with no lasting impact. Someone familiar with the topic should submit an article to Slashdot about it, and sources should be sent information to preempt misinformation.</summary>
