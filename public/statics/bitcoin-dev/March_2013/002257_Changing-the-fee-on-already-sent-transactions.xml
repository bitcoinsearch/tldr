    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, suggested changing the replacement logic for Bitcoin transactions to evaluate if the candidate replacement does not remove or decrease the value of any existing outputs. This change would prevent DoS attacks by only accepting replacements that increase the fees paid by at least MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE * size. Todd strongly prefers this method over the previously proposed fast expiration method, which he believes would lower the security of Bitcoin. While there is complexity and testing required for the new replacement logic, Todd believes that getting full branch coverage of the code would be fairly straightforward. He also believes that implementing this new logic correctly would be easier than child-pays-for-parent and could reduce the urgency of including child-pays-for-parent in Bitcoin.</summary>
