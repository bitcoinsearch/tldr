    <summary>In a message dated March 12, 2013, Mike Hearn proposed two options to address the problem of SatoshiDice transactions overwhelming the Bitcoin network. The first option was to block or down-prioritize these transactions at the network level to avoid mempool exhaustion, but Hearn admitted that he did not know how to do this effectively. He suggested that since blockchain.info's My Wallet service was the source of virtually all the traffic, this could be a starting point for blocking or down-prioritizing. The second option was to ask SatoshiDice to temporarily suspend their operations until the new hard-fork was properly prepared. However, Hearn acknowledged that this approach may not be successful.Hearn noted that those who have a vested interest in Bitcoin's success might be willing to temporarily suspend their operations. It is unclear whether SatoshiDice had already stopped their operations at the time of Hearn's message.</summary>
