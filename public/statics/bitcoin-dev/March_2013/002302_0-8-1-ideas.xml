    <summary>In an email exchange on March 15, 2013, Benjamin Lindner expressed his opinion on software behavior that is not described by the source code. He stated that such behavior should not be considered as part of the rule set and any influence of external libraries on the consensus mechanism is unacceptable. It appears that no one disagrees with the idea of removing this behavior from the software. However, there are concerns about the technical complications and risks involved in doing so.</summary>
