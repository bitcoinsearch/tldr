    <summary>In an email exchange, Benjamin Lindner suggested activating a non-proportional demurrage to incentivize old transactions to be moved. However, Mark argued that this proposal was a solution in search of a problem and that UTXO growth over time is worst-case linear, while computational resources increase exponentially. Additionally, he stated that escheatment, which is what was really being proposed here, would receive a bad response from the community. Nonetheless, Lindner suggested delegating the decision to the user with a rule like: if (output limit lifetime of the UTXO to 10 years. If (output&gt;fee): unlimited lifetime. This way, when a user creates a transaction, they can decide whether they want to have limited or unlimited lifetime, which would provide an incentive to spend.</summary>
