    <summary>In a conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Jeff Garzik, the former expressed that SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is an optimal transport for Bitcoin-like messaging. He further added that almost everything can be adjusted into a message, making it highly applicable in theory. Maxwell has been a supporter of SCTP for years. However, Garzik pointed out that firewall practices often restrict new protocols like SCTP from being implemented.</summary>
