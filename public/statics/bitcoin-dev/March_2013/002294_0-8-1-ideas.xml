    <summary>In an email exchange on March 13, 2013, Roy Badami suggested the idea of a client detecting or warning about not-trivial forking. The client already warns if it has heard the fork and is on the lower difficulty side. However, extending this to alert if it is on the winning side and the fork is long enough could be wise. There is a little concern that this might be mistaken as being more dependable than it actually is.</summary>
