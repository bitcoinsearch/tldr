    <summary>In an email thread between Jorge Timón and Peter Todd, the topic of transaction fees was discussed. It was suggested that transaction outputs with a value less than the transaction fee should be made non-standard in order to prevent spam transactions. However, Timón argued against this approach, stating that it would disable legitimate use cases for payments worth less than the fees. He proposed activating a non-proportional demurrage instead, which would incentivize old transactions to be moved and destroy unspent transactions with small amounts that don't move to another address periodically. Rune also weighed in on the discussion, stating that while the proposal makes sense economically, it isn't feasible if Bitcoin wants to maintain people's confidence in the currency. He suggested letting an alt-coin implement this functionality instead. The email thread ended with a promotional message about Symantec Endpoint Protection.</summary>
