    <summary>Hardware mining rigs are designed to connect directly to a pool and it is the pool that decides all block-related decisions. The miner, or hasher, only sees an 80 byte block header along with some additional information. Bitcoin version 0.8.0 is safe to use for everything except creating blocks, which affects solo miners/pool operators. However, even they can use it if connected to the network through a 0.7 node. The author of the email plans to use 0.8.x since it will only be used for transactions and queries. It is expected that ASIC, FPGA, and pure softminers (GPU) will have their softcode updated within a couple of weeks. Finally, the email includes an advertisement for AppDynamics Lite, which can help make web apps faster.</summary>
