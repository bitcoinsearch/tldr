    <summary>The context discusses the need for hard forks and proposes a solution to prevent it. The proposal suggests patching pre-0.8 branches to support an increased lock count to avoid the problem from recurring. However, this is still considered a hard fork, and the only way to avoid it is to apply the existing lock limit to all clients forever. This would not be feasible since pre-0.8 clients cannot reorg N blocks without dividing that limit by (N * 2) + 1, leaving with a limit of around 1000 locks per block on average. Each transaction uses at least 3 locks on average, making it much smaller than the assumed 1 MB bottleneck. The urgency to increase it is high, and the blockchain has managed to survive so far due to avoiding deep reorgs.</summary>
