    <summary>Chris, as a newbie in the world of cryptocurrency, is looking for ways to download Bitcoin software without compromising his security. Being aware of the risks associated with downloading from unsecured sources, he seeks advice on how to verify SHA256 hashes and find signatures and signing keys. He hopes that these keys are available on multiple independent servers to ensure their credibility.To address Chris's concerns, he can verify SHA256 hashes by using a checksum tool to compare the hash value of the downloaded file with the original hash value provided by the developer. As for finding signatures and signing keys, he can use GPG to authenticate them. These keys and signatures can be found on the official website of the Bitcoin software or on various trusted websites.In addition to this, Chris also enquires about the possibility of read-only ssh/sftp/scp access. This type of access can be useful for transferring files securely and remotely, but it may not be applicable for downloading Bitcoin software directly. Therefore, he needs to follow the above-mentioned steps to ensure the safety of the downloaded files.Overall, Chris's concern regarding the security of Bitcoin software is a valid one, and he should take necessary precautions before downloading anything related to cryptocurrency. By verifying SHA256 hashes and using GPG authentication, he can minimize the risk of downloading malicious software and ensure the safety of his investments.</summary>
