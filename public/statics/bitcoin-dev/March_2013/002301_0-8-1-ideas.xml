    <summary>In a discussion between Benjamin Lindner and Cameron Garnham on March 15th, 2013, the subject of Bitcoin's block size limit was brought up. Cameron expressed that many people who signed up for Bitcoin believed there was a 1MB block limit and were surprised by the lock limits. He argued that these limits were unexpected and should be removed as they were not described in the source code and any influence from external libraries on the consensus mechanism is unacceptable. However, it's important to note that the lock limits were explicitly set in the bitcoind source code.</summary>
