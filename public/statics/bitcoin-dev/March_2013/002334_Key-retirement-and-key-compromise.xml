    <summary>In an email conversation from March 25, 2013, Roy Badami proposed the idea of an overlay protocol to address the issue of transactions to revoked addresses. The proposal was in response to a suggestion of changing rules to make such transactions invalid. However, another individual noted that even an overlay protocol could be drastic as it would require perpetual data to remain in fast lookup for all validating nodes. It was also mentioned that reusing addresses is usually inadvisable when using Bitcoin.</summary>
