    <summary>In the context, the use of RAM as a database cache is discussed. The concern of an attack on UTXO storage if it is not stored in fast storage is also mentioned. However, the type of attack that could occur is not clarified. It is suggested that attempting to send a lot of fake transactions that connect to unspent outputs but have invalid transactions would not be effective since it would result in disconnection and IP banning. Instead, it is noted that it is easier to disrupt a node by requesting it to send the block chain, which significantly increases ping times due to limited network threads. The author suggests prioritizing addressing potential DoS attacks on Bitcoin by fixing this issue.</summary>
