    <summary>In the context at hand, it has been proposed that transaction replacement can be allowed for adding fees to existing transactions without increasing the risk of double-spends. The idea is to utilize the stubbed out replacement code which enables the replacement of a transaction only if a transaction spending the same tx is not already present in the mempool. To elaborate on this proposal, the replacement code checks for conflicts with in-memory transactions and sets up a new transaction in place of the old one if the condition mentioned above is met. To ensure that the process is safe, it is crucial to make sure that any transaction being replaced does not have any conflicting transactions in the mempool.Overall, the proposed approach appears to be a viable solution for adding fees to transactions without risking any potential double-spending issues. By utilizing the replacement code and carefully checking for conflicts in the mempool, it should be possible to safely replace old transactions with new ones and add the necessary fees.</summary>
