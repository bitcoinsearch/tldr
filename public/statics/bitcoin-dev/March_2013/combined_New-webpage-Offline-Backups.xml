    <summary>The Bitcoin.org website now has a "You need to know!" section that advises users to have offline backups for their wallets. However, the website does not provide any recommendations or dedicated pages on how to do this. This has led to criticism from users who feel that it is silly to suggest offline backups without providing any guidance. The website should include options for offline storage such as Armory and Electrum on the "wallets" page. Alan addressed this issue in an email to the Bitcoin.org team. It is important to note that offline backups are crucial in protecting one's cryptocurrency investments.</summary>
