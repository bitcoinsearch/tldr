    <summary>In an email conversation on March 16, 2013, between Alan Reiner and Gavin Andresen, the latter mentioned that he arbitrarily chose May 15 as the date for people to upgrade or find a workaround. Reiner suggested pushing back the date by a week, considering the Bitcoin Conference was scheduled two days after May 15, which could cause unnecessary stress if something goes wrong. However, since the page bitcoin.org/may15.html had already been created, changing the date at this point would be impractical. The email thread ends with a quote stating the causes of servitude can be attributed to the tyranny of money.</summary>
