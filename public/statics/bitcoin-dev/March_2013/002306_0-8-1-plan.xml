    <summary>In March 2013, Gavin Andresen, a developer and Bitcoin pioneer, suggested that Bitcoin users should upgrade their software or find workarounds by May 15th. Gavin had chosen the date arbitrarily but felt that two months was a reasonable timeframe for everyone to make the necessary changes. However, Alan, another member of the community, suggested that Gavin should delay the deadline by one more week until after the Bitcoin Conference. Alan's concern was that if something went wrong on May 15th, it could cause unnecessary stress for people traveling to San Jose for the conference just two days later. Though the date was arbitrary, Alan believed that pushing back the deadline would be a wise decision.</summary>
