    <summary>The author clarifies that version 0.7 and below had issues, not version 0.8. They express concern with changing features in 0.8 to accommodate 0.7 errors, as it may not be a viable solution for future situations. Instead, they propose a "considerate mining" setup where pools run on either the newest or second newest version (e.g. 0.8), but connect to the rest of the network only through a node of the other version (e.g. 0.7). This ensures that no blocks will be rejected by either version and that the two combined will make up &gt;90% of the network. Once the majority has upgraded to 0.8, the proposal suggests dropping 0.7 and introducing 0.9 instead.</summary>
