    <summary>Peter Todd, on a Bitcointalk thread, discussed the idea of making transaction outputs with values less than the transaction fee non-standard. He disagreed with this approach and argued it would disable legitimate use cases for payments. He mentioned that transactions paying fees should not be considered spam, regardless of how little the quantities being moved are. Peter proposed an alternative solution to incentivize old transactions to be moved and destroy unspent transactions with small amounts that don't move to another address periodically. This proposal has been suggested before and he believes it makes more sense.</summary>
