    <summary>In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr on March 23, 2013, they were debating the relevance of Bitcoind in relation to BIP34's implementation. While Luke-Jr argued that Bitcoind was not relevant for producing coinbases, Jeff Garzik pointed out that it was misleading to suggest that Bitcoind played no role in the stack. However, both parties agreed that upgrading Bitcoind alone would be sufficient to prevent the creation of forks. It is important to note that while the addition of the height in BIP34 is implemented in the coinbase generator, rejection of invalid chains is done by the Bitcoin daemon. To avoid losing income, miners must update both Bitcoind and the pool server layer to prevent the creation of invalid blocks or mine on invalid forks.</summary>
