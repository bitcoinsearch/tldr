    <summary>During a discussion on #bitcoin-dev, it was mentioned that version 0.5 appeared compatible with version 0.8. There was confusion about whether this was only for the "fatal block" or if there were other reasons. Pieter Wuille responded, noting that the bug causing issues in version 0.7 affected all BDB-based bitcoin clients and was simply a limit in the number of lock objects that had been reached. Version 0.8 was supposed to solve all problems related to BDB, but it seems to be coming back to haunt them. He discussed the need for more space in blocks and proper handling of mem-pool transactions, suggesting that mempools are relatively small in memory usage but could risk going up with small block sizes. He also noted that the competition for block chain space is mostly a usability issue and increasing block sizes isn't guaranteed to fix it, as it may just make more space for spam. However, he suggested that the presence of the bug and the availability of a full solution in version 0.8 probably helps in achieving consensus to fix it, but urged caution in rushing things.</summary>
