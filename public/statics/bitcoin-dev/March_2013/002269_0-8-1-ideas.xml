    <summary>In a proposal sent by Luke-Jr on March 13th, 2013, he suggested three rules for Bitcoin block sizes. The first rule applied before block 262144 and stated that no block should have over 4500 transaction modifications when combined with the previous four blocks. Additionally, no block should include more than 4500 transaction modifications on its own. These rules aimed to make older clients safe under most circumstances. The second rule applied between block 262144 and block 393216, which was referred to as hard fork #1. This rule stated that no block should include more than 24391 transaction modifications on its own, which was thought to be equivalent to 1MB. However, this rule could make older client backports safe unless a reorg was more than six blocks deep.The third and final rule applied from block 393216 onward, which was referred to as hard fork #2. This rule stated that no block should include more than 48781 transaction modifications on its own, which was thought to be equivalent to 2MB. Additionally, it allowed blocks up to 2MB in data size. Peter Todd replied to the proposal suggesting the need for a separate limit for how much the UTXO set can be grown by each block. He suggested setting the UTXO growth limit fairly low, at 1/4th of the block limit, given the uncertainty around limiting the creation of txouts that cannot be spent economically.</summary>
