    <summary>The author of the given context is sharing their concerns about the current state of nodes in the network. They suggest that most nodes are not running continuously, and this could lead to a decrease in the number of active nodes if immediate action is not taken. The author believes that both mass node death and hard forks are serious issues that require immediate attention. The author predicts that unattended nodes will start dying soon and will not be restarted, which will ultimately result in a sharp decline in the number of nodes in the coming days. They emphasize the importance of taking immediate action to avoid any possible negative consequences. In conclusion, the author highlights the significance of maintaining a continuous loop of nodes and taking proactive measures to prevent node death or hard forks. The proper functioning of nodes is essential for the smooth operation of the network. Any negligence in this regard can cause severe damage to the network.</summary>
