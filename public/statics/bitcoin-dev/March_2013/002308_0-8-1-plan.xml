    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has stated that he will not be changing the date for the upcoming "Bitcoin Independence Day" celebration on May 15. Despite acknowledging that it may be inconvenient and confusing, Andresen is firm in his decision to stick to the original date. He also expressed his lack of interest in discussing any potential changes to the timing, citing the need to focus on more important tasks, such as hard-forking to increase the 1MB blocksize limit. The move is seen by many as practice for the eventual hard-fork that will be necessary to further increase the blocksize limit.</summary>
