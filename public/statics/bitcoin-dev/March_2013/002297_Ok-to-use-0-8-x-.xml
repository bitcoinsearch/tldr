    <summary>If you're doing a new install and connecting to the internet for the first time, it's important to consider whether 0.8.x is safe to use for all or select purposes in regard to the current fork issue. If not, there may be a recommended branch, tag, or commit to use until an upgrade alert is broadcasted. However, it should be noted that there are only 'branch master' and 'tag v0.8.0' available on the Bitcoin GitHub page regarding possible 0.8.x flavors. There are currently no 0.8.x branches or tags available on the Bitcoin Gitorious page. It's important to stay informed and make sure you are using the most secure and up-to-date version for your needs.</summary>
