    <summary>A proposal was made on a Bitcoin development mailing list to limit the lifetime of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) in order to address the issue of increasing the block size limit and the resulting growth of the UTXO set. However, some have criticized this solution, stating that it could hinder legitimate use cases like smart property/colored coins. It has also been noted that miners may include dust output with fees due to the skewed incentive structure, as the cost of UTXO is paid by the network and future miners. Additionally, Smartcoin users would need to move their assets before 10 years, which was deemed acceptable, while regular users do not need to worry about this. Despite concerns about UTXO growth, some argue that the current UTXO set can fit in RAM or disk, so there may not be an immediate need for a solution. The email includes links to freico.in and archive.ripple-project.org.</summary>
