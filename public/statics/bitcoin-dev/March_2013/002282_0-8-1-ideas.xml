    <summary>In a discussion about the behavior of the Bitcoin protocol, Mark Friedenbach questions which Satoshi client sets the standard. Pieter Wuille responds by explaining that the protocol is enforced by the network and is currently a mix of versions of the reference client. He expresses a desire for an authoritative set of rules that all clients could follow to ensure correctness, but acknowledges that consensus is more important in a decentralized system. Wuille notes that a specification document would be helpful, as divergent nodes in the network would be considered buggy even if they were following a flawed specification. He cites a bug in version 0.7 and earlier and asserts that version 0.8 was wrong for not following the rules of the network. Wuille suggests that the issue needs fixing in a controlled and agreeable manner.</summary>
