    <summary>In a discussion on March 13, 2013, Mark Friedenbach suggested changing the old codebase to adhere to what was expected all along instead of modifying the bitcoin protocol rules. He recommended buying enough time through miner collusion for people to update their own installations. Meanwhile, MtGox's custom implementation adhered to the canonical blockchain despite the accidental rule change in version 0.8. There is a debate about the definition of the bitcoin protocol, and how to handle client divergence from consensus. Friedenbach believes that the problem is a bug in the old codebase and should be treated as such. However, the issue requires special treatment because the new rule has implications for the protocol.</summary>
