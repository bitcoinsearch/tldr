    <summary>The issue of unspent transaction output (UTXO) increases with the block size limit according to Benjamin Lindner, who suggests it should be resolved before any increase in block size. The scalability of bitcoin is a much-discussed topic, with a desire for 2000 transactions per second and a block size of 500 MB. However, CPU, network, and archival blockchain storage are seemingly solvable issues. The problem arises when SatoshiDice-like systems carry out informational transactions that produce unspendable outputs at a rate of 400 per second, contributing to a bloat of UTXO data at a speed of 52 GB/year. This is just the unspendable outputs, and there is an urgent need for protocol-level discouragement of such spamming to allow for scaling up without excessive memory leaks.</summary>
