    <summary>The conversation between Michael Gronager and Pieter Wuille on Tue, Mar 12, 2013, revolves around the Bitcoin client's upgrade. Gronager suggests that the upgrade went wrong as version 0.7 was not adequately tested, and upgrading to it led to block rejection. However, Wuille clarifies that the bug is simply a limit in the number of lock objects that was reached but still believes a full solution in version 0.8 is available. Wuille explains that the competition for blockchain space is mostly a usability problem, and increasing block sizes isn't guaranteed to fix that; it may just make more space for spam.Wuille also suggests that dropping free/old transactions is a much better behavior than dying; even a scheme where the client dropped all or random mempool txes would be a tolerable way of handling things. He proposes that deterministic time-based rules create a double spending incentive at that time and a counter incentive to spam the network with your risking-to-be-cleared transaction as well. Wuille notes that the presence of this bug and the fact that a full solution is available in version 0.8 probably helps achieve consensus fixing it (=a hardfork) is needed, and we should take advantage of that. However, he urges the users not to rush things and keep the nodes up to date.</summary>
