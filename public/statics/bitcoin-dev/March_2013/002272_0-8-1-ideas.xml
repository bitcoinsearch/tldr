    <summary>In an email exchange on March 13, 2013, several Bitcoin developers discussed the idea of increasing the block size limit to accommodate increased transaction volume. While Luke-Jr thought that a 2 MB increase over the next few years was uncontroversial, Gregory Maxwell urged the group not to get sidetracked with controversial changes. However, one developer, Peter Todd, expressed concerns about the controversy surrounding the issue, including receiving threatening text messages from someone who opposed the block size increase. Todd noted that it wasn't just forum trolls who cared about the issue.</summary>
