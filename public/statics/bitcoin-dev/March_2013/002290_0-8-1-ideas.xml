    <summary>In a message on Wednesday, March 13, 2013, Luke-Jr proposed changing the definition of "6 confirmations" to be "six confirmations clear of any other chain" in light of the failure to assure users that their transactions were confirmed. With two competing chains, one could potentially "go pop" at any moment, rendering the confirmation count of any transaction on that chain zero. The proposal suggests making clients more permissive about acknowledging the existence of blockchains they wouldn't necessarily accept themselves, as long as the proof of work was valid, and warning users that this is occurring.</summary>
