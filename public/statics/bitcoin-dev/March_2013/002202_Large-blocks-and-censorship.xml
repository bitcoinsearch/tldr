    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Gavin, the discussion of block size and censorship resistance in Bitcoin was addressed. Hearn argues that large blocks make it easier for authorities to censor transactions and questions if this problem can be solved with technology. He suggests an analysis of block sizes based on improving technology should consider how censorship resistance will be impacted. Despite concerns about censorship, a high number of validating nodes makes discouraging unwanted traffic difficult, indicating strong censorship resistance in Bitcoin.</summary>
