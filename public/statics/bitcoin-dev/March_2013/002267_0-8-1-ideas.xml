    <summary>The proposal suggests implementing rules to regulate the number of transaction modifications allowed in a block. Before block 262144, it is suggested that a block should not result in over 4500 transaction modifications when combined with the previous four blocks. Additionally, any block containing more than 4500 transaction modifications should be rejected (a slight soft-fork). These rules aim to ensure the safety of older clients under most circumstances.From block 262144 to block 393216 (hard fork #1), it is recommended that a block should not contain more than 24391 transaction modifications on its own. This rule is meant to be equivalent to 1 MB and can make older client backports safe unless a reorg is more than six blocks deep.Beyond block 393216 (hard fork #2), it is suggested that a block should not contain more than 48781 transaction modifications on its own, equivalent to 2 MB data size. Blocks up to 2 MB in data size should be accepted, and support for clients prior to 0.8.1 should be discontinued.The proposal sets the block numbers conservatively to account for unseen ASIC upgrades. It aims to start a discussion on the regulation of transaction modifications allowed in a block.</summary>
