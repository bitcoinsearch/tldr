    <summary>The python-bitcoinlib project is a lightweight, modular and user-friendly library for pynode that aims to provide easy object interface to all bitcoin core data structures, including block, transaction, addresses, and more. The library features a full transaction script engine, ECDSA verification via OpenSSL wrapper, object interface to all known network messages, binary encoding/decoding for full bitcoin protocol interoperability, as well as full verification of main and testnet block chains via pynode. Additionally, it passes many of the tests shipped with the bitcoin reference client. Jeff Garzik, the developer behind the project, warns that the library is currently only recommended for developers and not for highly secure production sites. He welcomes pull requests, comments, questions, and donations.</summary>
