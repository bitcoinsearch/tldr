    <summary>In a conversation between Jay F and an unknown recipient, the issue of TCP/UDP port forwarding is discussed. Jay F expresses concern that most people only have access to TCP/UDP port forwarding and suggests the use of tunneling. He provides a link to a document on SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) which discusses the encapsulation of DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) over SCTP. Jay F notes that using SCTP could be beneficial for Bitcoin-like messaging as it is an optimal transport for this type of traffic. Additionally, he suggests that using SCTP could result in a data stream that looks like WEBRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) traffic.</summary>
