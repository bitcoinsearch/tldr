    <summary>Jorge Timón proposed a sudden "destruction" or re-generation of the account after a certain period instead of rejecting potential use cases for the Bitcoin chain. He preferred a small fixed demurrage fee after a specific number of blocks without moving them, but since the community is demurrage allergic, he suggested using a fee for a resource users are enjoying which has real costs for the network. Gavin Andresen opposed the idea of any kind of demurrage as it would result in negative publicity where the Bitcoin developers would be accused of destroying coins. The discussion revolved around whether smart property and colored coins are more important than physical bitcoins and how old unspent outputs pose a problem for the network.</summary>
