    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent member of the Bitcoin community, provided his gpg key on the Bitcoin.org homepage to ensure secure access. He also mentioned that the history of this key can be viewed securely on Github. Roy expressed the need for a secure page on Bitcoin.org to avoid going to Github and suggested obtaining certificates from Namecheap which would be cost-effective. Additionally, he suggested that a page on Bitcoin.org with the MD5 hashes of binaries would be helpful for those who do not use GPG.</summary>
