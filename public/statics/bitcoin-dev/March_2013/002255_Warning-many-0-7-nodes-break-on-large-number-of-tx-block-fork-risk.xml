    <summary>In a discussion on #bitcoin-dev, Jorge Tim√≥n asked if version 0.5 of Bitcoin was compatible with version 0.8. Some users had previously mentioned that the two versions appeared to be compatible, but it was unclear if this was only for the "fatal block" or if there were other factors at play. It was also reported that not all version 0.7 instances died from the Berkeley DB (BDB) error. It is expected that a post-mortem analysis will be necessary to determine which build environments and versions are incompatible. This analysis will involve feeding each environment the bloated block and comparing the results. It is hoped that there are many snapshots of the bad chain at the correct height for testing purposes.</summary>
