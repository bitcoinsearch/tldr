    <summary>The conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Roy Badami on Bitcoin transactions suggested the implementation of an overlay protocol that would make transactions to revoked addresses invalid. However, this would require adding more perpetual data that must remain in fast lookup for all validating nodes, leading to a drastic change in the rules. To address this problem, Roy suggested that addresses should contain expiry dates to avoid keeping revocation lists forever. It was also noted that reusing addresses is usually inadvisable and may result in problems, but it is still unavoidable in many cases. The payment protocol can be helpful in addressing this issue in some use cases.</summary>
