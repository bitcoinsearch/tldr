    <summary>In an email exchange on May 5, 2017, Tomas proposed a method to mark blocks that were generated without verifying the previous block. He suggested using a bit of the version field to indicate this. Bryan Bishop responded to the proposal, acknowledging that it had been previously discussed in a Bitcoin-dev mailing list post from December 2015, which he provided a link to. Bryan also included his personal website and phone number in his email signature.</summary>
