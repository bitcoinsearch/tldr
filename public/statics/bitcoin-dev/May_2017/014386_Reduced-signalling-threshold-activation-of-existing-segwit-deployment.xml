    <summary>A proposal for activating Segregated Witness (SegWit) has been suggested by James Hilliard via bitcoin-dev. The proposal outlines a method to activate the existing BIP9 SegWit deployment with a majority hash power of less than 95%. The goal is to minimise the risk of chain split and network disruption while maximising backward compatibility and still providing rapid activation of SegWit at the 80% threshold using bit 4. The proposal suggests that SegWit be activated immediately and separately from any hard fork, thus allowing for quick scaling without risking a rushed combined SegWit and hard fork that would likely cause widespread issues. A draft proposal on GitHub details the technical specification and reference implementation. The proposal is compatible with the existing "SegWit" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016 and midnight November 15th, 2017.</summary>
