    <summary>A new feature for rate limiting purposes has been proposed where nodes can solve arbitrary PoW challenges in exchange for connection slots. The proposal includes two proofs of work: sha256 and cuckoo-cycle, which can be combined to enhance security. The proposed feature is expected to cover other DoS risky services like bloom filters as well. The BIP has been shared on GitHub and feedback has been welcomed.</summary>
