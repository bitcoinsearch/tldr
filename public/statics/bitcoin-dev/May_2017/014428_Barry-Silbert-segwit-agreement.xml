    <summary>In a recent email thread on bitcoin-dev, Jacob Eliosoff asked whether it was too late to make changes to the current agreement for Bitcoin's scaling. The agreement, which has been signed by a large portion of the industry, includes activating Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold and implementing a 2 MB hard fork within six months. Eliosoff acknowledged that he too would like to see some changes, but wondered whether it was worth going through another conference to agree on a new compromise.Tom Zander, who signed the aforementioned agreement, responded to Eliosoff's inquiry. He pointed out that while everyone may want something different from the agreement, the time for making changes is not after signatures have been set. Zander argued that it would be better to use the agreement already in place, as opposed to going through another conference to come up with a new one.Zander emphasized that the current agreement is pretty straightforward and includes both SegWit activation and a 2 MB hard fork within six months. He provided a link to the agreement on Medium for reference. Zander also included links to his blog and vlog for those interested in more information.Overall, the email thread highlights ongoing discussions around Bitcoin's scalability and the importance of finding a compromise that satisfies the various stakeholders in the industry.</summary>
