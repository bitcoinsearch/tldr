    <summary>The context is about a proposal made by Karl Johan Alm for rate limiting purposes where nodes can make and solve arbitrary Proof of Work (PoW) challenges in return for connection slots. The proposal includes two types of PoW, sha256 and cuckoo-cycle, which can be combined. The proposal aims to cover DoS risky services such as bloom filters. The BIP has been posted for some time without any negative feedback. Therefore, the proposer intends to have a BIP number assigned if no objections are raised. The link to the proposal can be found at https://github.com/kallewoof/bips/blob/pow-connection-slots/bip-rate-limiting-via-pow.mediawiki. Feedback regarding the proposal is welcome.</summary>
