    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been moved to bcc as the question is better suited for forums dedicated to Bitcoin Core implementation specifics rather than a general Bitcoin development list. The work limit was removed in preparation for ancestor-feerate-mining, so comments should have been cleaned up to match the new code. People can feel free to file an issue or open a PR to update those comments at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin. DJ Bitcoin posted a question on the use of txmempool on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, specifically regarding the concept of "dirty" entries. CTxMemPoolEntry's nCountWithDescendants variable is never zero; therefore, DJ Bitcoin asked where this concept of "dirty" is defined.</summary>
