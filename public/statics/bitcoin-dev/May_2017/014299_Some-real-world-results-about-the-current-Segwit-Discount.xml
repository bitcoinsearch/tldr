    <summary>Based on a conversation between Sergio Demian Lerner and an unknown person, the capacity of Segwit with a 75% discount is calculated to be 701K non-segwit bytes, which translates to an average block size of 1.8MB and a maximum block size of 4MB. For Segwit with a 50% discount and a 2MB hard fork, the capacity is calculated to be 1.08M non-segwit bytes, which translates to an average block size of 2.9MB and a maximum block size of 4MB. It is noted that the capacity of Segwit with a 50% discount and a 2MB hard fork is 50% more than Segwit alone, but the maximum block size remains the same.</summary>
