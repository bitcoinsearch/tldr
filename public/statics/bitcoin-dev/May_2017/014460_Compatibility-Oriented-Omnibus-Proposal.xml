    <summary>The Compatibility-Oriented Omnibus Proposal aims to achieve the goals of the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement in a maximally-compatible way by minimizing disruption and loss potential. The proposal suggests phasing in a gradual blocksize increase beyond the initial 2MB cap included in Luke-Jr's proposal and committing to it to ensure unity, prevent chain-split risks and guarantee a successful SegWit activation followed by a hard fork. Almost every component of the code exists in the various constituent proposals' reference implementations, and the quickest and safest approach to achieving the goals set forth at Consensus 2017 is to leverage the existing tools and proposals for the job. The purpose of the proposal is to serve as a template for the minimum viable fork that can achieve true consensus. By working together towards mutual goals, we avoid the risk of a costly fracture. The Omnibus Proposal, designed in exact accordance with a powerful industry agreement and incorporating feedback and suggestions provided from within both the developer community and the community-at-large, stands the best chance of uniting everyone under a common front.</summary>
