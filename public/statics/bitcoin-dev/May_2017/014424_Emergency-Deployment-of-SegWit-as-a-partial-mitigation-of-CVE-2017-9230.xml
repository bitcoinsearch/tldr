    <summary>In an email thread to bitcoin-dev on May 26, 2017, Cameron Garnham claimed that ASICBOOST was the primary motivation behind the refusal by 67% of the mining hash-rate to signal for SegWit. However, Tom Zander questioned this assumption and pointed out that miners are open to an ASICBOOST disabling change and that the recent New York consensus meeting has come to a better way to activate SegWit. Zander also expressed discomfort with Garnham's use of ASICBOOST as a tool to push SegWit, stating that it taints the proposal.</summary>
