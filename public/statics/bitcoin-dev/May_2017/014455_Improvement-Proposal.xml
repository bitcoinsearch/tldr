    <title>Improvement Proposal</title>

    <summary>The improvement proposal suggests allowing users' devices, including mobile and IoT devices, to connect and participate in the BTC blockchain network without mining. The incentive for these participants could be a lottery schema running in parallel to mining within the same network and on the block-chain. A lucky participant user or miner would be randomly rewarded every specific period of time. However, participants would need to pay the price on each connection round.</summary>
