    <summary>Erik Aronesty has suggested that rate-limiting proof-of-work (PoW) should be specified as bytecode to allow nodes to plug in as many "machine-captcha" things as they please, and solvers can choose to solve or just say no. However, it is unclear what he means by this. The BIP includes methods for determining an approximate time to solve, which will discard challenges that take longer than the expiration of the challenge itself. Another approach suggested by others is requiring people to pay a nanobit. This could prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks even better and generate revenue streams for nodes. However, this approach also has unwanted side effects that need clarification. In a no-gains scenario like the BIP proposes, the node requesting PoW done doesn't gain anything from lying to the node performing the work.</summary>
