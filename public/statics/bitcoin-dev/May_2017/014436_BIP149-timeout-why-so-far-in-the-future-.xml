    <summary>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Matt Corallo, they discuss the timing of releasing code related to Segregated Witness (segwit). Corallo points out that the timeout for segwit is not as important as when the code can be released, which he predicts will be several months after the current timeout. Russell had assumed that the code would be included in the next point release.</summary>
