    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, Peter Todd and another user debated the idea of users paying for signalling of softforks. The other user argued that as long as the deployment of the softfork is widespread, the risk of users not paying is minimal. Peter Todd countered by saying that this assumption relies on the notion that the users who pay for soft-fork signalling will represent an economic majority, which may not always be the case. He suggests that if the economic majority hasn't consented to the softfork, many users will make their transactions conditional on non-signalling.</summary>
