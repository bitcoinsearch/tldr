    <summary>The discussion is about the use case for drive chains and their security. One possible use case is to have high-speed small transactions on a side chain, eventually cleared to the main chain. However, there is concern about theft, defined as an improper withdrawal from a sidechain. If a theft occurs, it could decrease the market price and future transaction fee levels for all future miners.There is disagreement over whether miners have an incentive to prevent theft. Some argue that miners with better capabilities to prevent theft would induce it to happen to give themselves political cover to push other miners off the network. Rejecting withdrawals can also put miners at risk of being kicked off the Bitcoin network entirely. One suggestion is for miners to ask people they trust if a withdrawal is correct or not. The benefits of drivechains are higher BTC prices and greater transaction fees, but the security model is considered dubious by some. Others argue that users should do user-activated-soft-forks to ensure drivechains fail. The discussion highlights efforts to involve miners as little as possible in the consensus, such as committed (encrypted) transactions and closed-seal-set/truth-list approaches. There is a question of what use cases drivechains actually serve and why those use cases cannot be done in a much safer client-side validation fashion.</summary>
