    <summary>In a recent discussion, it has been pointed out that TXO commitments can be useful without the need for a consensus protocol change. This realization was shared by someone who had previously mentioned this fact in 2013 on a Bitcoin forum thread. The link to the thread was provided as evidence. It is important to note that this information can potentially have implications for the implementation of TXO commitments in blockchain technology.</summary>
