    <summary>The author of the message provided a comment on the bip8 extension to bip9, which he considered could be improved. The author pointed out that with bip9, a bip9-ready node that sees a softfork activated that it is not aware of will see a warning. However, with bip8, nodes that implement bip8 but do not implement a certain deployment that is activated at the end of the period cannot receive such a warning. The solution that comes to mind according to the author is to reserve one of the nVersion for requiring that the bit is active for one block when a deployment is locked in this way. The author believes that the code changes required to implement this would be simple, and he is willing to help with it. The thread referred to in the beginning was avoided as it was deemed too broad. Links to the implementation and the GitHub repository were also provided.</summary>
