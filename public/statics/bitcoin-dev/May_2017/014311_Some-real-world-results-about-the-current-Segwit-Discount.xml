    <summary>The conversation thread involves Matt Corallo, Sergio Demian Lerner and Gregory Maxwell discussing the idea of changing Segwit's parameters to increase the chances of its acceptance by the broader community. Lerner suggests that limiting the changes to the minimum number of lines of code would make a consensual HF more acceptable in the current state. However, Corallo is unconvinced, stating that even if fewer lines of code are changed, a poor result will not be accepted by the community. Maxwell chimes in with a playful "Rawr" response. The thread ends with a comment about Bitcoin's gradual improvements, which were simple enough for anyone with technical background to understand at the beginning but now require a full website to explain.</summary>
