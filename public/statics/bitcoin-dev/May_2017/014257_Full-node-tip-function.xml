    <summary>The author believes that paying for services is a good idea, but Bitcoin can better serve with Lightning once it is in production. This will allow cost-effective micro-transactions and nodes to initiate payments before they are synced, which is currently impractical. A proposal was made where full nodes advertise a bitcoin address and users who download the blockchain from that node can be encouraged to send a tip to the peers based on % served. A recommended tip of 10mbit should be fine. Full nodes can also require a tip to download the blockchain, and users who don't specify a tip cannot use them. While this represents a barrier to hosting a full node for some people, they should get their money back and more as long as they stay online. This incentivizes quality, long-term hosting and encourages stable nodes to stick around longer while discouraging "installation spam" attacks on the network. Fees for other node operations can be considered if this is successful.</summary>
