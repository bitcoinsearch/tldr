    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the removal of the 1 MB block size limit check and increasing the weight limit without changing the discount or having two limits. On May 23, 2017, Luke Dashjr submitted BIP for a real 2 MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation. This is not part of any agreement he is party to, nor anything of that sort. Just something to throw out there as a possible (and realistic) option. Upon activation, a block size limit of 2000000 bytes is enforced. The block weight limit remains at 4000000 WU. This is a hardfork, and as such not backward compatible. It should not be deployed without consent of the entire Bitcoin community. Activation is scheduled for 18 months from the creation date of this BIP, intended to give 6 months to establish consensus, and 12 months for deployment.</summary>
