    <summary>The email contains a proposal for the process of transactions using OP_BRIBE_VERIFY. The proposed process involves sidechain miners broadcasting transactions with an OP_BRIBE output, which ends up in the memory pool of miners and is added to their next block. Miners then add a transaction which spends the output to one of their own addresses. An additional rule is suggested that requires OP_BRIBE checks to fail unless the output is locked 100 or more blocks. The email also includes an example output script and details on the additional rule for OP_BRIBE_VERIFY. The template for the transaction outputs is specified as OP_CHECKSEQUENCE_VERIFY.</summary>
