    <summary>In a conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty disagreed with Greg's standard answer regarding a suggestion. Erik believed that Greg's response did not apply to the suggestion and that Greg may have been too quick to judge. The suggestion in question involved replicating an IP address, which Greg believed would result in paying people to sybil attack the network. Erik could not see any benefit to this idea, as the selection of download peers is based on throughput and actual blocks served, not IP address replication. Tom Zander, who shared the conversation on his blog and vlog, did not offer any additional comments on the matter.</summary>
