    <summary>In an email conversation between Ethan Heilman and Peter Todd, Ethan proposes the use of OP_CAT to securely verify many hashes and hash preimages compactly. This would reduce the size of transactions significantly for offchain Tumblebit transactions. Ethan suggests that with OP_CAT, one would only have to store one hash in the transaction instead of multiple hashes. A version is also suggested which improves this further but is more complex. Peter asks about the maximum output size and suggests that Ethan's proposal would make a good use-case for a BIP.</summary>
