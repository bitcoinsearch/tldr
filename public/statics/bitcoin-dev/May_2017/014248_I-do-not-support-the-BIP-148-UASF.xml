    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, there was a discussion about the best approach for a UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) for SegWit (Segregated Witness). A proposal was made on GitHub to activate SegWit through a flag day for a wtxid commitment timed before the current segwit period end. Gregory Maxwell expressed that this approach addressed his main concern and was a better option than BIP148. However, Luke Dashjr disagreed and argued that if a UASF for SegWit was going to happen at all, it needed a decisive outcome, which would be given by BIP 148. He believed that using the approach in BIP 8 could create prolonged uncertainty where nobody knows the outcome when SegWitâ€™s rules are challenged by a malicious miner. If BIP 148 fails to achieve widespread support, then a BIP 8-based UASF with SegWit v2 could be considered. But, he stated that the tradeoffs right now favored BIP 148 as the best UASF deployment.</summary>
