    <summary>In a discussion between Rusty Russell, Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the group debated the most efficient way to construct UTXO commitments. One of the main considerations was the ability of lightweight nodes to validate the hash without having to access the entire UTXO set; this would not be possible if a full transaction of unspent outputs had to be sent. The group also discussed the best method for serialization and the trade-offs between simplicity, size and speed. Wuille suggested using SHA512 with 256-bit truncated output as secp256k1 X coordinate or key to seed a ChaCha20 PRNG, which is incredibly quick at producing much data when a key is already known.</summary>
