    <summary>Karl Johan Alm has proposed a new feature for rate limiting purposes in which nodes can solve arbitrary proof of work (PoW) challenges to gain connection slots. This proposal includes two types of PoW, sha256 and cuckoo-cycle, which can be combined to enhance security. The proposal aims to cover other DoS risky services like bloom filters as well. The BIP has been shared on Github and no negative feedback has been received yet. Therefore, the proposer intends to have a BIP number assigned if no objections are raised. Feedback regarding the proposal is welcome.Erik Aronesty has suggested that rate-limiting proof-of-work (PoW) should be specified as bytecode to allow nodes to plug in as many "machine-captcha" things as they please, and solvers can choose to solve or just say no. However, it is unclear what he means by this. The BIP includes methods for determining an approximate time to solve, which will discard challenges that take longer than the expiration of the challenge itself. Another approach suggested by others is requiring people to pay a nanobit. This could prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks even better and generate revenue streams for nodes. However, this approach also has unwanted side effects that need clarification. In a no-gains scenario like the BIP proposes, the node requesting PoW done doesn't gain anything from lying to the node performing the work. The combination of sha256 and cuckoo-cycle PoW challenges could help prevent DDOS attacks and generate revenue streams for nodes. The proposal aims to cover DoS risky services such as bloom filters. The BIP has been posted for some time without any negative feedback. Therefore, the proposer intends to have a BIP number assigned if no objections are raised. Overall, the proposal for rate limiting purposes using arbitrary PoW challenges seems promising and could help improve the security of the system. However, further clarifications and feedback are needed before the proposal can be finalized. The link to the proposal can be found at https://github.com/kallewoof/bips/blob/pow-connection-slots/bip-rate-limiting-via-pow.mediawiki.</summary>
