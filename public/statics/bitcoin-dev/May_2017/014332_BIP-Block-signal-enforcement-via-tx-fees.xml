    <summary>The discussion involves potential issues with nVersion signaling, which is difficult to enforce. Users are responsible for adoption of rules and paying miners for signaling certain bits can further complicate the situation. The risk of false signaling is minimal if deployment of the softfork is widespread, but it could lead to a breakdown in honesty of the nVersion system if users pay prematurely. There is concern that users paying for soft-fork signaling may not represent an economic majority and miners could take extra fees provided by a small percentage of users while violating the nVersion protocol. Additionally, the discussion highlights concerns with the inadequacy and unreadability of English language specifications; it is suggested to use the "reference implementation" as the specification instead.</summary>
