    <summary>There have been various proposals on how to improve the Bitcoin network, with some suggesting that miners could pay for additional services. However, Aymeric Vitte has criticized this idea and instead called for a greater emphasis on scaling the full nodes, which he believes should not depend on miners. He suggests that once this has been achieved, additional services could be added and paid for by miners or others. Vitte also calls for a task force/group to address these issues, stating that the accumulation of strange proposals does not help the situation. Erik Aronesty has suggested that paying for access to higher-speed relay networks would be something that many operators would do, and that baking in the ability to add service fees could encourage more people to run high quality, highly available full nodes. Tomas has proposed that miners/pools could pay non-mining full nodes to outsource transaction selection using a different Proof-of-Work (PoW), allowing them to buy proof-of-uncensored-selection and proof-of-goodwill for a small fee. Ben Thompson, however, feels that adding a cost to the blockchain, assuming that all users add a tip requirement, would lead to centralisation, while Erik Aronesty suggests that this approach could represent a barrier to hosting one's own full node. Despite these concerns, there are potential benefits to incentivising quality, long-term hosting, and it may discourage installation spam attacks on the network.</summary>
