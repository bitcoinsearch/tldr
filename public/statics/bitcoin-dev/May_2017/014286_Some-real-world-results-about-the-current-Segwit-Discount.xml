    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner shared his analysis of 1000 blocks starting from Block #461653. Among other metrics, he computed the size of witness data and non-witness data assuming P2SH inputs/outputs are converted to P2PWSH and P2PKH inputs/outputs are converted to P2WPKH. He found that the ratio of segwit to non-segwit data was 1.6999, which implies that a 75% discount is not the best option to prevent witness spam in a 4 MB block. Instead, he suggests a 50% discount would be more appropriate based on a non-witness data weight factor of 2.35. He encourages others to review and double-check his findings with the Bitcoinj source code or other utilities.</summary>
