    <summary>The author is requesting the implementation of OP_CAT to help securely and compactly verify many hashes and hash preimages. This would significantly reduce the size of Tumblebit transactions, specifically when wanting to check a transaction TxA that releases preimages x1, x2,...,x10 such that y1=H(x1), y2=H(x2),...,y10=H(x10). Currently, one must put y1,...y10 and check that the preimages hash correctly. However, with OP_CAT, only one hash in TxA would need to be stored, yhash = H(OP_CAT(H(OP_CAT(y1, y2)),y3)...y10). TxA could then just hash all the preimages supplied by TxB and confirm they hash to TxA, reducing the size of TxA from approx 10*32B to 32+10*16B. Although most of the math OP codes aren't particularly helpful due to their 32bit nature and their strange overflow behavior.</summary>
