    <summary>In an email thread, Eric Voskuil argues that mining is broken and it is difficult for people to influence miners without incurring a huge expense. He also suggests that paying people to run nodes or signal readiness is not beneficial from either personal/economic or security/decentralization standpoint. Eric's argument assumes that miners are a government or control Bitcoin in some way, which is incorrect. Miners are entrusted with enforcement of softforks, and their refusal to do so is considered an attack on the network.</summary>
