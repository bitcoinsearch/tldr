    <summary>There has been a suggestion to add an option to pay for receiving historical blocks in order to solve the problem of getting blocks. However, Gregory Maxwell from bitcoin-dev pointed out that this could lead to people being paid to sybil attack the network as it is cheaper to run one node behind many IPs than running many nodes. This suggestion has come up multiple times before. Currently, the available connection slots and bandwidth on the network appear to be sufficient to saturate any fully-validating node.</summary>
