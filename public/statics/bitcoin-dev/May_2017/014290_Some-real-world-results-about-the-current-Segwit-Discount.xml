    <summary>On May 9th, 2017, Sergio Demian Lerner sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the 75% discount chosen for multisignature transactions. The idea behind this discount is that it will help Bitcoin scale without a hard fork. However, if a blocksize increase hard fork were to occur in the future, it would be better to use a 50% witness discount instead of risking a larger block size. It is important to note that changing any parameter in a hard fork does not have any relation to the current BIP141 proposal. The 75% discount can still be used in a soft fork and changed to a different value or definition with a hard fork later.</summary>
