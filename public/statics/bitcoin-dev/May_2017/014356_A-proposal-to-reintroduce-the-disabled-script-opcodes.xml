    <summary>In 2010, a bug was discovered in Core that allowed denial-of-service attacks due to the software crashing on certain machines while running a script. The bug is documented as CVE-2010-537. The user believes that the disabled opcodes should be reintroduced with standardized behavior definitions. For instance, when executing an opcode that results in an arithmetic error, such as OP_DIV with a zero divisor, the script should exit and fail. Furthermore, string splice opcodes should verify their arguments for correctness. If these opcodes were re-introduced, it would allow for more sophisticated native smart contracts to be created, enhancing the flexibility of scripts.</summary>
