    <title>BIP149 timeout-- why so far in the future?</title>

    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, the discussion revolved around SegWit's timeout and the release of code. Gregory Maxwell suggested that the BIP149 timeout was set too far in the future and that it could be six months after release before it reached the required density for a stable transition. Rusty Russell agreed, proposing a deadline of 16th December 2017 or 16th January 2018, during which he believed the EOY holidays would not interfere. He also noted that this delay had set back SegWit by one to two months beyond what they would have experienced if they had used BIP8. Matt pointed out that the release of the code would likely take several months after the current timeout.</summary>
