    <title>Some real-world results about the current Segwit Discount</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner suggested that a soft fork to 50% should be implemented before a soft fork to 75%. This is because going from a more restrictive ruleset to a less restrictive one is more difficult and may not be fully backwards compatible. Additionally, Lerner believes that a 50% discount would be better for future scalability options, as it would prevent the block size from being unnecessarily increased to 8 MB in case of a 2X blocksize increase hardfork. Johnson Lau pointed out that any parameter can be changed in a hardfork, so this discussion does not necessarily relate to the current BIP141 proposal. However, Lerner still suggests a more conservative 50% discount if Segwit is not activated by November. The exact impact of these changes on max transactions/second will depend on real world usage patterns.</summary>
