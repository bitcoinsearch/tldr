    <summary>The proposal presented is deemed imperfect by the writer, as it rewards signalling whereas the end goal is activation. The writer suggests a different approach that would reward activation and proposes an opcode to create an assurance contract for activation of a softfork. They acknowledge their limited knowledge about Bitcoin's codebase but believe the suggested spec is workable. Additionally, the writer highlights the possibility of inverse logic wherein a vote against a softfork can be cast. The writer concludes that it is better to pay on activation or failure to activate, rather than mere signalling, as activation or rejection of activation is the ultimate goal.</summary>
