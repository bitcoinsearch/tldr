    <summary>The OP_BRIBE protocol allows for collaboration between a sidechain participant, Sam, and a mainchain miner, Mary. By paying Mary a predetermined amount of BTC, Sam can ensure that their sidechain block becomes part of the largest chain. However, anything not on the longest mainchain is discarded. To address this issue, "SPV squared" construction requires the mainchain to track a minimal amount of data, including the block number of recent sidechain blocks for the last 65,536 mainchain blocks.Disinterested mainchain miners can temporarily stop acknowledging withdrawals from a sidechain with a single bit of information, "distress=true." Drivechain handles sidechain reorgs while keeping Bitcoin miners blinded. The discussion centers around implementing drivechain and the need for a soft fork to add a new sidechain. Miners are likely to self-impose limits on nodes and each other to maximize total revenues. Blockstream's zk-SNARKs could enable launching a new sidechain without modifying Core code, but unrestrained smart contract execution may destabilize Bitcoin. Therefore, the proposal suggests reducing the size of datacenters by removing surge suppressors and UPS's to avoid defining them as rooms with &gt;$XXX of equipment. Miners can soft fork in a sidechain they have no intention of merged mining or BMMing, and the other 90% hashpower has no inherent reason not to allow the experiment to run. Mainchain miners only need to maintain minimal data about sidechains, excluding transaction data or arbitrary messages.</summary>
