    <summary>The author has proposed a BIP that suggests a way to reference transactions that have been successfully inserted into the blockchain. The format of the proposal utilizes Bech32 encoding and is designed to be both short and useful for human usage. The draft also includes a C reference implementation. The author has taken special care to ensure that this BIP can be extended naturally to support future upgrades to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Sidechains, or even other blockchain projects. However, the current draft only specifies support for the Bitcoin Main Chain and the Test Network. The author hopes that the bitcoin-development mailing list participants find this draft BIP interesting and useful. The BIP can be read in full at https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/Bech32_Encoded_TxRef/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Postion_References.mediawiki. If assigned with a BIP number, some small updates to the specification will be made in accommodation.</summary>
