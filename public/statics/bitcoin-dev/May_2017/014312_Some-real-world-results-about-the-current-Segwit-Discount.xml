    <summary>In a conversation between Sergio Demian Lerner and Matt Corallo, the former made a comment that Bitcoin was never perfect but always good enough. He said it allowed gradual improvements that anyone with technical knowledge could understand. Corallo disagreed, saying that while fewer lines of code could be changed, if the result was "shit," it would have a low chance of being accepted by the community. Corallo added that Segwit had a key feature that was important for Bitcoin's long-term reliability and throwing it away would only make things worse. Gregory Maxwell also chimed in, adding a playful remark to the conversation.</summary>
