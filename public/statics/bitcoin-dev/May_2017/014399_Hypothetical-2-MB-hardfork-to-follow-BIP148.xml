    <summary>This is a draft BIP proposal for a 2 MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation. The author does not personally recommend this and someone else will need to champion it before it can be assigned a BIP number. The abstract explains that the proposal enforces a block size limit of 2 MB for legacy Bitcoin transactions with a block weight limit of 4000000 WU. The calculation of block weight is modified so that all witness data is measured as 1 WU, while all other data is measured as 4 WU. The witness commitment in the generation transaction is no longer required and instead, the txid merkle root in the block header is replaced with a hash of the witness reserved value, the witness merkle root hash, and the transaction ID merkle root hash. The proposal is deployed by flag day, in the block where the median-past time surpasses 1543503872 (2018 Nov 29 at 15:04:32 UTC), assuming that when this flag day has been reached, Segwit has already been activated via BIP141 and/or BIP148. This is a hardfork and not backward compatible and should not be deployed without consent of the entire Bitcoin community. Activation is scheduled for 18 months from the creation date of this BIP, intended to give 6 months to establish consensus, and 12 months for deployment. The author has left the motivation and rationale sections blank and encourages whoever champions this proposal to complete them.</summary>
