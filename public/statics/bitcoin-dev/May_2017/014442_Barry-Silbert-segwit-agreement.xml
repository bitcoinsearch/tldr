    <summary>In a recent email exchange, James Hilliard explained that the main issue with SegWit lies in the fact that 0.13.1+ has many segwit related features already active. He also outlines the need for multiple activation codepaths to test for issues when SW is activated. Responding to these concerns, Tom Zander suggests a solution by picking one bit4 activation logic based on 80% and with no end-date as opposed to having all those activation codepaths. He adds that bip9 (bit1) based activation is unlikely to trigger before the expiration date anyway. In conclusion, he believes that proper architecture of the solution can solve trivial worries and should not be a reason for saying NO to a better SegWit activation.</summary>
