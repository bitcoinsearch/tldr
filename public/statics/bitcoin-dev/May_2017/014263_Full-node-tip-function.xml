    <summary>The idea of incentivizing individuals to run full nodes in the Bitcoin network has been discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Several suggestions have been made, including allowing operators to charge for better service and generating a template block that miners could buy for proof-of-uncensored-selection and proof-of-goodwill. One proposal suggested having full nodes advertise a Bitcoin address and encouraging users to send a tip to the peers that served them, with a recommended tip of 10mbit. While this could provide an incentive for quality, long-term hosting, it may also represent a barrier for some people to host their own full node due to the added cost. Nonetheless, having an incentivizing system in place could encourage more people to run high-quality, highly available full nodes, which is considered one of the most important tasks for developers.</summary>
