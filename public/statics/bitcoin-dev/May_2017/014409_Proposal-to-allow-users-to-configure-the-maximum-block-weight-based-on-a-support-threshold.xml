    <summary>On May 23, 2017, Tomas via bitcoin-dev proposed a mechanism that would allow users to configure the maximum block weight at a support threshold. This proposal does not give more power to miners or reduce decentralization as miners still rely on their blocks being accepted by economic nodes to sell their minted coins. The BIP can be found on Github. Erik Aronesty suggested using UTXO bits instead of block thresholds to coordinate size changes; he only proposes an optional way to synchronize changes without the need for off-chain agreements which seems like a simple improvement over the current situation. Miners cannot change the block size or any other rule without the support of the users because their blocks and coins would be rejected. Someone can make it seem to a miner like 99% of nodes are ready for a larger weight even though that's false. Erik agrees that the user agent signaling isn't very important, and most of us aware that we cannot rely on counting them.</summary>
