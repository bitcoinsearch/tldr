    <title>BIP149 timeout-- why so far in the future?</title>

    <summary>Gregory Maxwell, a developer on Bitcoin's blockchain, questioned the timeline of BIP149 after observing SegWit adoption rates. He suggested that it could take up to six months after release for the transition to be stable enough. Another developer, Rusty Russell, agreed and recommended a December 16th, 2017 deadline (or January 16th if during EOY holidays). This delay pushes back SegWit by one or two months beyond what would have happened if BIP8 was used in the first place.</summary>
