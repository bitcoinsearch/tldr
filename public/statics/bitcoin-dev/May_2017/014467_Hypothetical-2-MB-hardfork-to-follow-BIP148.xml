    <summary>The discussion in the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around whether to keep blockmaxsize post-HF and how to prevent quadratic hashing. James MacWhyte suggested that adding a transaction-size limit of 10kb would solve the problem, while another member pointed out that changing the rules would invalidate pre-signed transactions. However, regardless of the specific solution, it was agreed that quadratic hashing is not a compelling reason to keep blockmaxsize post-HF and alternative solutions should be explored.</summary>
