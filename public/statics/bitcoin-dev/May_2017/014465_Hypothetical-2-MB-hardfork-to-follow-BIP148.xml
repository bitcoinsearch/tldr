    <summary>The discussion among developers on the bitcoin-dev mailing list centers around the need for a transaction size limit. Jorge Tim√≥n asks why the existing code at line 1661 in validation.cpp is not enough, to which Luke responds that transactions are bottlenecked by their size as hashing a transaction comes with a CPU time cost based on its size. He suggests that it may make sense to factor sigops into the limit. James MacWhyte proposes adding a transaction-size limit of 10kb to solve the quadratic hashing problem, but Jean-Paul Kogelman points out that this would invalidate any pre-signed transactions currently out there. Instead, he suggests making the limit 100kB, which has always been policy-forbidden and should not be expected to be acceptable in the future. Additionally, Luke suggests specifying a minimum transaction size of 8 bytes, which is the minimum for any sane output.</summary>
