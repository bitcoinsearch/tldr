    <summary>Luke-Jr, a Bitcoin Core Developer, has proposed a new BIP draft for OP_CHECKBLOCKVERSION. The purpose of this proposal is to allow the community to put economic pressure on miners to deploy softforks without resorting to the extreme measure of a UASF. The BIP draft can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-cbv/bip-cbv.mediawiki.However, given the potential for malicious miners to block this softfork, it is suggested that it should be deployed using BIP 8 to ensure eventual activation even if hostility is encountered. This proposal is intended to be an alternative to BIP 8 in the long term, but it is not meant to make BIP 148 obsolete, considering the timeframes involved.An implementation is available based on top of BIP 115's implementation and can be found at https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/compare/cbah...luke-jr:checkblockversion. This proposal presents a viable solution to the challenge of deploying softforks by putting economic pressure on miners.</summary>
