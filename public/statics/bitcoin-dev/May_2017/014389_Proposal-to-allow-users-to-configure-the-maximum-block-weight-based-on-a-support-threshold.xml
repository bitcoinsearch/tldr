    <summary>The proposal by Tomas van der Wansem suggests allowing each user to configure the maximum block weight at a support threshold. This mechanism would prevent off-chain debates by giving users the freedom to choose their own parameters while maintaining coordination of any changes. The BIP can be found on GitHub and it is important to note that this proposal neither gives more power to miners nor reduces decentralization. Miners still rely on their blocks being accepted by economic nodes to sell their minted coins, and this proposal doesn't change that.</summary>
