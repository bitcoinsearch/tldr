    <summary>In this email thread, Matt Corallo and Sergio Demian Lerner discuss the implementation of Segregated Witness (Segwit) in Bitcoin. Lerner proposes changing the parameters of Segwit as it is to increase the chance of a consensual hard fork being accepted with minimal code changes. Corallo disagrees with this approach and argues that changing fewer lines of code for a suboptimal result is not the right direction. He emphasizes the importance of Segwit as a key feature for Bitcoin's long-term reliability. Despite their disagreement, Lerner clarifies that he is not advocating, but rather mediating the discussion. The email also includes some lighthearted banter between the participants.</summary>
