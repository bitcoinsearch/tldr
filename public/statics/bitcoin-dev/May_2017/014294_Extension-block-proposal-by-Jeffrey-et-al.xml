    <summary>The message discusses the issue of making the return outputs transparent to unupgraded wallets. The proposed solution is to send them to something that is non-standard today. The mainchain segwit is important as it enables atomic swap between bitcoin and xbitcoin. The extension block specification/code is being revised to coexist with mainchain segwit to require exiting outputs to only be witness programs. This will reduce the likelihood of the legacy wallet issue assuming most segwit-supporting wallets would implement this rule before the activation of segwit. Switching to witness programs only may be a good balance between fungibility and backward-compat.</summary>
