    <summary>The author processed 1000 blocks starting from Block #461653 and computed several metrics, including the supposed size of witness data and non-witness data (onchain), assuming all P2SH inputs/outputs are converted to P2PWSH and all P2PKH inputs/outputs are converted to P2WPKH. However, this analysis doesn't take into account that LN transactions may affect the current state, increasing the segwit/nosegwit ratio. The author found that acMainChainSpace =352608924, acSegwitSpace =599400403, and Ratio segwit/nosegwit=1.6999. Based on this, the author implies that the 75% discount is not the best option to prevent witness spam in a block of 4 MB, as stated in https://segwit.org/why-a-discount-factor-of-4-why-not-2-or-8-bbcebe91721e.Instead, the non-witness data weight factor should be 2.35, which leads to a 50% witness discount. The author encourages anyone to re-compute this with another utility to cross-check and recommends Antoine Le Calvez (p2sh.info) to double-check.</summary>
