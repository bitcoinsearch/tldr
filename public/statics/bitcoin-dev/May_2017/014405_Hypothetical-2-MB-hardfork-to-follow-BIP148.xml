    <summary>In a recent discussion, Luke Dashjr wrote up BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for a real 2 MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation. He mentioned that this is not part of any agreement he is party to, nor anything of that sort. He also suggested that 1 MB blocks are still too large and this blunt-style hardfork is quite risky even with consensus. However, if the community wishes to adopt a 2 MB block size hardfork unanimously, this is probably the best way to do it right now. The only possible way to improve on this IMO would be to integrate it into MMHF/"spoonnet" style hardfork (and/or add other unrelated-to-block-size HF improvements). The author has left the Author blank, as he does not intend to personally champion this. Before it may be assigned a BIP number, someone else will need to step up to take on that role. Motivation and Rationale are blank because the author does not personally think there is any legitimate rationale for such a hardfork at this time. This is a hardfork, and as such not backward compatible. It should not be deployed without consent of the entire Bitcoin community. Activation is scheduled for 18 months from the creation date of this BIP, intended to give 6 months to establish consensus, and 12 months for deployment.Deployment of this BIP is by flag day, in the block where the median-past time surpasses 1543503872 (2018 Nov 29 at 15:04:32 UTC). It is assumed that when this flag day has been reached, Segwit has been activated via BIP141 and/or BIP148.Upon activation, a block size limit of 2000000 bytes is enforced. The block weight limit remains at 4000000 WU. The calculation of block weight is modified: all witness data, including both scriptSig (used by pre-segwit inputs) and segwit witness data, is measured as 1 weight-unit (WU), while all other data in the block is measured as 4 WU. The maximum size of a transaction stripped of witness data is limited to 1 MB. In conclusion, Luke Dashjr has proposed a BIP for a real 2 MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation. This is a hardfork and not backward compatible. The deployment of this BIP is by flag day. Upon activation, a block size limit of 2000000 bytes is enforced.</summary>
