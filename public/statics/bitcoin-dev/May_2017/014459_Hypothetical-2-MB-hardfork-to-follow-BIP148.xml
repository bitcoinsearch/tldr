    <summary>A proposal has been made for a 2 MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation. The proposal suggests that the community should adopt a 2 MB block size hardfork if they unanimously agree to do so, and outlines the best way to execute the hardfork. It is noted that this type of hardfork is risky and blunt, and requires consensus from the entire Bitcoin community. The abstract of the proposal states that upon activation, a block size limit of 2,000,000 bytes will be enforced, while the block weight limit will remain at 4,000,000 WU. The maximum size of a transaction stripped of witness data is limited to 1 MB. In response to the proposal, Jorge Tim√≥n via bitcoin-dev questioned why the redundant 1 MB size limit check could not simply be removed, and the weight limit increased without changing the discount or having two limits. Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev expressed his preference for a 2 MB lock-in that uses BIP103 for timing and suggested that up to 20% per year can be absorbed by averages in bandwidth/CPU/RAM growth. Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev wrote up the BIP for the real 2 MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation, but did not intend to personally champion it.</summary>
