    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner and Matt Corallo expressed concerns about changing the parameters of Segwit after deployment. Lerner suggested that it might be better to make any necessary changes before deploying Segwit rather than waiting for a hard fork later. However, he also acknowledged that limiting changes to the existing code would make a future hard fork more likely to be accepted. Gregory Maxwell added his own comment to the thread, but it is unclear whether it was related to this particular discussion.</summary>
