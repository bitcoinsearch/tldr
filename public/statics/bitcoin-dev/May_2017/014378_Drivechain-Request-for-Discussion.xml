    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tier Nolan and Paul Sztorc debated the differences between attacking Bitcoin and sidechains. While Nolan argued that an attacker would only be able to reverse recent transactions in Bitcoin, which would cause the price of Bitcoin to fall, Sztorc countered that a rich attacker could do the same thing on mainchain Bitcoin when there is no block subsidy. The conversation turned to the issue of stealing from chains with no value-add, prompting Nolan to argue that sidechains should only exist if they positively impact Bitcoin's value. On the other hand, Sztorc pointed out that the value of a sidechain is directly linked to the fact that it has 100% reserves on the Bitcoin main chain, making it a target for theft.</summary>
