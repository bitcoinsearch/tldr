    <title>Improvement Proposal</title>

    <summary>A proposal was made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to allow users to connect and participate in the same BTC blockchain network without mining. The proposal suggested a lottery system that would run parallel to mining, with rewards given to lucky participants randomly at specific intervals of time. However, Yann pointed out that Sybil attacks could prevent this from working, even if there was some way to prove that an entity performed the transaction validation. Proving the relay of transaction data to others is also vulnerable to sybil attack.</summary>
