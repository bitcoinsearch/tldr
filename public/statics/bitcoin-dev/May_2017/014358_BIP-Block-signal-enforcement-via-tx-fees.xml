    <summary>The email thread discusses different approaches to ensuring that the timeout for versionbits is specified. One approach suggested is to bundle a pair of similar transactions, one with transaction version bits set and another with locktime set. Another approach is to use input height, which invalidates a transaction in a block if the soft-fork has not timed out or activated, the block does not signal bit N, the transaction nversion does signal bit N and at least one input to the transaction has a height &gt;= S. This approach also allows for bit reuse and is compatible with using bitcoin days destroyed as a weighting measure. The above is a fail-open timeout rather than fail-closed. If this isn't what you want, double-spending should be fine. It should be reasonable to offer a higher fee for signalling without risking that non-signalling miners will be able to claim that high fee eventually. The incentives about tying user-signalling for a soft-fork to miner signalling for a soft-fork are not entirely sound. Using nversion seems a lot more user-friendly than requiring script changes. The above timeout procedure requires getting a recent coin as setup, but that's pretty trivial.</summary>
