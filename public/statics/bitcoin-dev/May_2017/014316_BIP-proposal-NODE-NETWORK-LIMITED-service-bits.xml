    <summary>The proposed BIP for peer signaling NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_LOW &amp; NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_HIGH requires that the signaling node be able to serve at least the last 7,056 blocks or roughly 49 days. The author suggests that instead of using a fixed number of days, it might be better to use a deterministically chosen set of historical blocks along with a 7-day buffer. Current Bitcoin-Core pruned full nodes guarantee a minimum of 288 blocks, which allows them to signal NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_LOW with their current configuration, but this will no longer be true when segwit activates. Peers following this BIP should connect only a limited amount of their outbound connections to peers signaling one or both of the NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_* service bits if they expect to request less blocks than the signaled number. However, it is not entirely clear whether it refers to peers downloading blocks or serving them. Light clients who are not checking the nServiceFlags (service bits) from a relayed addr-message may unwillingly connect to a pruned peer and ask for filtered blocks at a depth below their pruned depth.</summary>
