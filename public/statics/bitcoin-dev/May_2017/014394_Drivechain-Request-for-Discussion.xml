    <summary>In an email conversation with ZmnSCPxj, Paul Sztorc discusses the technical details of Bitcoin's sidechain technology and his proposed two-way pegged sidechain system, drivechains. OP_BRIBE is discussed as a way to allow miners to be paid in exchange for their help in guaranteeing that a sidechain block is added to the largest chain. The purpose of OP_BRIBE is to allow "Sam" (on the sidechain) and "Mary" (a mainchain miner) to work together. Sam would pay X BTC to Mary, if Mary could provide Sam with some guarantee that Sam's sidechain block [defined by h*] would make it into the largest chain. The slow withdrawal times associated with the sidechain are also noted.</summary>
