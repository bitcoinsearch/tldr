    <summary>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, developer James Hilliard proposed an implementation that would activate segregated witness (segwit) at an 80% threshold and signal at bit 4 in order to minimise chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backwards compatibility and still providing for rapid activation of segwit. Hilliard's draft proposal is available on Github, and he has authored a BIP called "segsignal". The proposal specifies a method to activate the existing BIP9 segwit deployment with a majority hashpower less than 95%. Hilliard notes that segwit increases the blocksize, fixes transaction malleability, and makes scripting easier to upgrade, among other benefits.</summary>
