    <summary>A proposal has been made to activate the existing BIP9 segwit deployment with a majority hashpower less than 95%. The aim is to minimize chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backwards compatibility and still providing for rapid activation of segwit at the 80% threshold using bit 4. By activating segwit immediately and separately from any hard fork, the scaling process can be accelerated without risking widespread issues. The proposed implementation is 100% compatible with a "UASF movement" since it turns all supporting miners into equivalent BIP148 enforcers, thereby allaying any fears that this would subvert a UASF. The proposed "agreement" would require a hard fork be locked in on the same bit (bit 4), however, ideally, such a 2MB increase should be scheduled using BIP103-esque logic: Gradually increasing from 1MB to 2MB over the course of at least a couple years, beginning 6 months from lock-in. This will give developers ample time to evaluate and react to network impacts.</summary>
