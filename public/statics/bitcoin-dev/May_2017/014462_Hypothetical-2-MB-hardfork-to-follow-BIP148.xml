    <summary>The discussion is about the quadratic hashing problem in relation to the 1MB classic block size. The writer suggests that the current block size prevents this issue from being any worse than it is now. However, adding a transaction-size limit of 10kb would eliminate the problem altogether. The solution proposed seems clear and straightforward, implying that there won't be any challenges implementing it.</summary>
