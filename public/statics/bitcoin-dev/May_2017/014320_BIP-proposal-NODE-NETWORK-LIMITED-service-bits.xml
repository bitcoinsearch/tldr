    <summary>On May 11, 2017, Jonas Schnelli proposed a BIP to improve the signaling of valuable services by pruned peers. The proposal can be found on Github. However, there were concerns about the instructions for relay addresses in the proposal. It was suggested that the instructions should not instruct individuals to relay specific addresses but rather relay addresses they would connect to. This way, it is assumed that if an address is useful to an individual, it will likely be useful to others. This approach avoids the possibility of someone being directed to relay information they do not find useful.</summary>
