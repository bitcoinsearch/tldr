    <summary>On May 22, 2017, James Hilliard proposed an implementation to activate Segregated Witness (SegWit) at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4. The goal was to minimize chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backwards compatibility and still providing for rapid activation of SegWit. By activating SegWit immediately and separately from any hard fork, they could scale quickly without risking a rushed combined SegWit+HF that would almost certainly cause widespread issues.This document specifies a method to activate the existing BIP9 SegWit deployment with a majority hash power less than 95%. SegWit increases the block size, fixes transaction malleability, and makes scripting easier to upgrade as well as bringing many other benefits. This BIP provides a way for a simple majority of miners to coordinate activation of the existing SegWit deployment with less than 95% hash power. While this BIP is active, all blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected. This BIP will be deployed by a "version bits" with an 80% activation threshold BIP9 using bit 4. This deployment is compatible with the existing "segwit" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016, and midnight November 15th, 2017. Miners will need to upgrade their nodes to support segsignal otherwise they may build on top of an invalid block. While this BIP is active users should either upgrade to segsignal or wait for additional confirmations when accepting payments.Historically, IsSuperMajority() has been used to activate soft forks such as BIP66 which has a mandatory signalling requirement for miners once activated, this ensures that miners are aware of new rules being enforced. This technique can be leveraged to lower the signalling threshold of a soft fork while it is in the process of being deployed in a backwards compatible way.This document is dual licensed as BSD 3-clause, and Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal.</summary>
