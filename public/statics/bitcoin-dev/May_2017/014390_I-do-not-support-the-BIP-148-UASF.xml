    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, core developers were debating whether or not to allow an optional configuration switch that would signal and enforce BIP148. Steven Pine questioned who they were trying to protect users from with this switch, and why they couldn't allow a user config switch to be set. The discussion is about protecting users of the base Bitcoin Core implementation, as enabling a potentially harmful option could put them at risk. Users have come to appreciate this implementation for its peer review-based strict development process, and making a hasty decision due to time constraints may have undesirable consequences. Opinions among regular contributors are split, indicating caution and consideration should be taken before making a decision.</summary>
