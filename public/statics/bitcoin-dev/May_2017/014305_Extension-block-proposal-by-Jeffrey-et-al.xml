    <summary>A proposal has been made for an extension block that would enable atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Xbitcoin, but there are concerns over the maturity rule which would require outputs to only be witness programs. To make it transparent to unupgraded wallets, the return outputs have to be sent to something that is non-standard today, such as not P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, bare multi-sig, and v0 P2WPKH and v0 P2WSH. However, this could cause issues with legacy wallets. Christopher Jeffrey has suggested revising the extension block specification/code to coexist with mainchain segwit and requiring exiting outputs to only be witness programs, which he believes could mitigate the issue assuming most segwit-supporting wallets would implement this rule before the activation of segwit. Segwit isn't activated yet and segwit-capable wallets aren't widely deployed for production, so there is a window of time where this rule can be implemented.</summary>
