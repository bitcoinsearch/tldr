    <summary>On May 9, 2017, a message was posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list by Raystonn regarding a study released the previous week. The study discussed attacks at the network layer and countermeasures that could be taken to increase security. One of the suggested countermeasures was the use of encryption to secure communications between nodes. Links to the specific Bip proposals for this were provided: bip-0150.mediawiki and bip-0151.mediawiki. No further information about the study or its findings was given.</summary>
