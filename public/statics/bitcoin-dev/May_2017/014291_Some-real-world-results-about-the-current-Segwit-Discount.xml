    <summary>The discussion on the Segwit discount continues with Sergio Demian Lerner proposing a soft-fork to 50% now and another soft-fork again to 75% discount later, if required; this is because it does not affect the maximum transactions per second. While Lerner suggests that Segwit as it is today should be activated, he suggests choosing a more conservative 50% discount for the next attempt if Segwit is not activated before November. Johnson Lau responds by stating that any parameter can be changed in a hardfork, and therefore, it has no relation to the current BIP141 proposal. He suggests using 75% in a softfork and changing it to a different value or redefining the definition of weight with a hardfork later.</summary>
