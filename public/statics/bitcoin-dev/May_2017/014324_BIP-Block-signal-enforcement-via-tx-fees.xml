    <summary>In a discussion about the proposed BIP8 softfork activation mechanism, Peter Todd stated that version signaling is already technically unenforceable and there are no good ways of ensuring miners actually adopt the rules they're claiming to signal. He further added that it's users who ultimately adopt rules, not miners, and attempting to pay miners to signal certain bits will further confuse this point. Thus, enforcement remains primarily by users. The risk that users would pay for signaling of softforks prematurely is minimal if it waits until the deployment of the softfork is widespread. At worst, it creates risks similar to a UASF, but so long as UASF is the alternative, this way seems strictly better.In addition, Peter Todd commented on the inadequacy and unreadability of English language specifications in the proposed BIP8 specification. He suggested deleting it and instead marking the "reference implementation" as the specification. In response, ZmnSCPxj made a minor editorial nitpick regarding the repetition of a paragraph in the Bitcoin mainnet section of the proposal and suggested fixing it.</summary>
