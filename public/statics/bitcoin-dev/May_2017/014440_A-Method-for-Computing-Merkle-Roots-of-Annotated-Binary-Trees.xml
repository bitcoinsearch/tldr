    <summary>On May 28, 2017, Russell O'Connor and Peter Todd had a discussion regarding the math operations used in the computation of MerkleRoot in bitcoin-dev. Russell O'Connor explained that he usually means concatenation when using "⋅" and Cartesian product when using "×". When asked for clarification on the specific meaning of Cartesian product, O'Connor defined it as "the type of pairs of A and B in the sense of type theory as used in Standard ML or Haskell or other typed languages." He also clarified that sha256Compress is a function that takes two arguments, a 256 bit word and a 512 bit word, and returns a 256 bit word, which is the compression function defined by the SHA256 standard.</summary>
