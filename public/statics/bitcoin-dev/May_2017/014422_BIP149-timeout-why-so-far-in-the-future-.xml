    <title>BIP149 timeout-- why so far in the future?</title>

    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a Bitcoin developer suggested that the BIP149 activation date could be brought forward. Originally set far out enough to avoid people fixating on the date rather than the substance of the proposal, the activation date could potentially be reduced to six months or less from November 2017. The developer argued that since around 70% of nodes upgraded to BIP141 in five to six months, there is good evidence that the community will upgrade quickly to BIP149 given their eagerness for SegWit and the fact that some are already running BIP148. The email was sent using Swiss-based encrypted email service, ProtonMail.</summary>
