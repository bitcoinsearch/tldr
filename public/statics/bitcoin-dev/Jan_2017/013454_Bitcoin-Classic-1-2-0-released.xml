    <summary>In a message on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Aymeric Vitte expressed concern over the number of full nodes in the Bitcoin network and what would happen if someone were to control a majority of them. However, another member of the mailing list responded that the level of control over a majority of full nodes is irrelevant as it would be easy and cheap for someone to spin up a bunch of nodes and take control if they wanted to. No further information was provided in the message or attachment.</summary>
