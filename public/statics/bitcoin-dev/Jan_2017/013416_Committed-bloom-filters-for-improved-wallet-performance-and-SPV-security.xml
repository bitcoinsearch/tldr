    <summary>The ability to have instant transactions is crucial for many real-world use cases, despite the risk of fraud. This is especially true for merchants who accept credit card payments and ship goods, as the transaction can be reversed up to 60 days later. Bitcoin serves a wide variety of use cases with different profiles for time sensitivity and fraud risk. There are also concerns over the privacy trade-off of displaying unconfirmed transactions in wallets, as users have very little to gain from this knowledge until the transaction is in a block. The BFD concept, which reworks the lightweight Bitcoin client model in a secure, efficient, and privacy-compatible manner, has potential for deployment in handling 0-conf/mempool filtering. However, it remains to be seen what the preferred/recommended way would be to handle this, as user experience is an important consideration. Using BIP37 bloom filters just for mempool filtering could result in unwanted privacy-setup.</summary>
