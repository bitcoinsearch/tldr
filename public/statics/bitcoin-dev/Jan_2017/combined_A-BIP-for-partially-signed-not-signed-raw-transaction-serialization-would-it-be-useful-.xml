    <summary>A need for a standardized specification for unsigned transactions was proposed by 木ノ下じょな via bitcoin-dev due to the recurring issues on various projects that support multisig with users responsible for partial transaction transport. Different serialization methodologies are used in partially signed multisig raw transactions and not-signed raw transactions regardless of scriptPubkey by Electrum, Copay, Coinb.in, Bitcoin Core, etc. The proposal for standardization aims to ensure all unsigned transactions are of the same form and the signature section of the transaction should contain all the required information to make the signature. Prior to proposing a BIP, opinions were gathered to know if there is a need for one.In January 2017, Jon proposed to gather opinions before submitting a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aimed at getting everyone on the same page when serializing partially signed multisig raw transactions. He suggested that everyone should be on the same page when serializing not-signed and partially signed transactions so that the person could look at the data alone and know what is necessary and how to manipulate it to sign and complete the transaction. Thomas Kerin recommended that Jon should look at his previous work on the problem, where he had written a BIP similar to Jonas's hardware signing BIP. Kerin also suggested that Jon should consider using a protocol to request signatures, perfect for a BitGo wallet to use to talk to a GreenAddress wallet. Additionally, Jon has shared his PGP public key block in the context, which can be used to encrypt messages for the owner of the associated email address.</summary>
