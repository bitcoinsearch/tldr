    <summary>Luke Dashjr suggested that an ever-increasing block size limit would be equivalent to spam filling blocks up to the max and miners not enforcing reasonable limits. He stated that Block75 would have decreased the limit, given the growth rate over the past year. However, he questioned the definition of "spam" and asked for data that supports this hypothesis. Dashjr did not foresee any possibility of supporting such a fundamentally broken proposal, since the block size limit exists to restrict miners and it makes no sense to put it in their control. Though there would still be a block size limit, it would change slightly every two weeks, but miners could not profit from it under the Block75 proposal.</summary>
