    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, adiabat suggested that if a light client stores filters in the same way as block headers, there's no need to go all the way back to height 0. The index could be implemented efficiently for cold wallet spending once the full index is available. Currently, Mycelium allows users to spend funds from a paper wallet or a BIP39 sentence but at the cost of sharing all addresses with servers. The proposed index would make it feasible to implement a private, cold storage spending feature. Additionally, the index could be further partitioned by P2PKH, P2PK, P2SH, leading to a minor privacy leak for a reasonable reduction in index size.</summary>
