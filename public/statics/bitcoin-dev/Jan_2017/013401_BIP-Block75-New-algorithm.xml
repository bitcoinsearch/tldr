    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, user t. khan proposed Block75 which would set the maximum block size to ever-increasing limits. The proposal also allows for decreasing the maximum block size but it should never be too small that a reasonable generation transaction cannot fit. Activation of the proposal would occur once 900 of the last 1,000 blocks mined signaled support, with a grace period of 4,032 blocks. However, some users expressed doubts about the proposal and stated that it is fundamentally broken since the block size limit exists to restrict miners; putting it in their control makes no sense.</summary>
