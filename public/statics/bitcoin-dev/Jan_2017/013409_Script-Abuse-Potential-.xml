    <summary>A potential attack vector involving the use of a specific pk_script was discussed on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The script in question includes multiple instances of the OP_2DUP opcode, and it was suggested that this could be used to overwhelm nodes with large amounts of data. However, it was noted that there is a limit of 201 opcodes in a script, meaning that the maximum number of OP_2DUP instances would be 198. Additionally, the MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE is set at 520 bytes, meaning that the worst case scenario for this particular script would be approximately 10MB. It was also mentioned that bugs related to op_dup/op_cat could pose a greater threat.</summary>
