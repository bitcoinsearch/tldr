    <summary>On Jan 26, 2017, Luke Dashjr posted three hardfork-related BIPs on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The first BIP is a block size limit protocol change that addresses criticisms of segwit and may reduce the block size limit initially to a more sustainable size in the short-term, and gradually increase it up over the long-term to 31 MB. It also extends the witness discount to non-segwit transactions, but since it includes a hardfork, the eventual block size increase needs community consensus before it can be deployed. The second BIP is a preparatory change that should allow trivially transforming certain classes of hardforks into softforks in the future. Lastly, the third BIP is an anti-replay softfork which can be used to prevent replay attacks whether induced by a hardfork-related chain split, or even in ordinary operation. Although Luke immediately recommends adoption of the first BIP, peer and community review are welcome to suggest changes. He is posting the second BIP for review and comments only, and he does not yet recommend its adoption.</summary>
