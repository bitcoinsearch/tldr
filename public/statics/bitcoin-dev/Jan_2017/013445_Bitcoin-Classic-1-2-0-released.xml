    <summary>The release of Bitcoin Classic version 1.2.0 has been criticized for lacking clarity about its compatibility with the current Bitcoin network and its consensus rules. It is a hard fork on mainnet with no safe activation, including other unsafe changes, and no BIP for the hard fork, thus presenting a dangerous and irresponsible move. The absence of release notes and changelog in the GitHub repository also makes it difficult for average users to know what's under the hood or what has changed. Bitcoin Classic claims to provide users with a way to get onto the Bitcoin network using a high-quality validating node for a large set of use cases and presents top-notch quality processes in this release to help anyone running Bitcoin. However, the lack of transparency and evidence of community-wide consensus for the hard fork raised concerns about the software's safety and reliability.</summary>
