    <summary>A proposal has been made for implementing extra block space through a soft-fork without compromising existing security assumptions and being transparent to existing wallets. The new wallets taking advantage of the extra block space will have a different user experience. The proposal defines terminology such as main block/tx/UTXO, extension transaction/block/UTXO, bridging witness program, integrating UTXO/transaction, returning transaction, fees collection in xblock, and xblock commitment.The email discusses the controversial idea of an extension block, which would allow for more block space through a soft fork. While soft forks are generally preferable to hard forks, the extension block proposal enters into "coerciveness" territory. The email argues that this sets us up for some pretty terrible precedent; the idea that miners will start soft-forking in sidechains is a massive risk. Finally, the email emphasizes that while this may be an interesting academic topic, there is a significant social cost associated with implementing an extension block.On a different note, the proposal describes a method for sending bitcoins from the main UTXO to an xUTXO, where people can trade inside the xblock just like in the main block. The integration of UTXO and transaction is explained in detail, including special bridging witness programs for returning transactions and fees collection in xblock. The proposal also discusses the challenge of sending money back from the xblock to the main block, which requires 100-block maturity for the returning UTXO.The author acknowledges that this drastically changes the user experience and suggests the use of a decentralized market to exchange value between the blocks. The proposal raises questions about simplifying the design without compromising security, eliminating the 100-block maturity requirement, and reducing the maturity time. The direction flag is needed to ensure that the recipient won't be paid with a returning transaction unless explicitly requested and may be combined with the serialized witness version to save one byte. Overall, the proposal is presented for discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
