    <summary>Several individuals, including Johnson Lau, have expressed their disagreement with a hardfork proposal submitted by Luke Dashjr. The proposal involves a block size limit protocol change that would gradually increase the block size limit to 31 MB over time, while also extending witness discount to non-segwit transactions. Critics argue that this proposal would be inappropriate and ineffective for several reasons. Firstly, miners may view the proposal as too little, too late, as reducing the block size limit could alienate them. Secondly, the concept of spam transactions is not a real issue for miners, but rather an arbitrary distinction made by Dashjr. Thirdly, the proposal assumes that the current 1MB limit is already at its upper limit, which is not true. Finally, there is no incentive for individuals to run full nodes, so restricting blockchain size would be futile, especially since businesses have migrated towards running nodes. Overall, critics believe that the proposal would hamper Bitcoin Core and drive miners towards using Unlimited instead.</summary>
