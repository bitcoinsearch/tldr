    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a developer of Bitcoin, suggests that Zero-knowledge proofs are not helpful in the security of the system if applied naively. He explains that the missing data will mean part of the UTXO state can no longer be updated by other miners and thus they can't mine all transactions. This is why part of the economic pressure that users exert on miners is subverted by SPV/lite-clients. Additionally, Dashjr points out that ZK proofs will only work if they are made sufficiently powerful to allow scalable sharded systems like his own Treechains to be implemented. However, he also mentions that it is yet to be proven whether ZK proofs can accomplish this as the Zcash scheme may soon require upgrading due to advances in cryptographic analysis.</summary>
