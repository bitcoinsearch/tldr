    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr stated that Satoshi's vision of full nodes publishing proofs of invalid blocks for SPV nodes to verify is not possible. Dashjr believes that the only way for nodes to have full-node-security is to be a true full node, and having only full nodes in data centers is not realistic without centralizing Bitcoin. Natanael responded by suggesting Zero-knowledge proofs and various types of fraud proofs as alternatives. He mentioned that there are not many cases where fraud proofs would be unreasonably large for a networked system like Bitcoin. However, ZK proofs still fail in one case where an attacker can create a block withholding a single transaction, making it impossible for non-full nodes to prove there is missing data without fetching and checking the entire block themselves.</summary>
