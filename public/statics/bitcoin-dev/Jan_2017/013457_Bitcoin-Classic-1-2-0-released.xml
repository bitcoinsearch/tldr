    <summary>The email conversation between Eric Lombrozo and Eric Voskuil via bitcoin-dev on January 7, 2017, has been leaked. In the email, Eric Lombrozo asks the participants to take their discussion elsewhere, perhaps to bitcoin-discuss. He states that the mailing list is not the appropriate platform for rehashing discussions that have taken place several times before- it's meant for the discussion of new proposals and ideas. In response, Eric Voskuil raises concerns about the number of full nodes, arguing that there is no incentive to run them, and what would happen if someone were to control a majority of them. Eric Lombrozo responds by stating that the level of control over a majority of full nodes is irrelevant because if it were truly a measure of control over Bitcoin, then someone would simply spin up a bunch of nodes and take control at a trivial cost.It appears that the conversation was contentious, with some members wanting to discuss new proposals while others wanted to revisit old ones. However, Eric Lombrozo reminded the group of the purpose of the mailing list, which is to discuss new ideas and proposals. The leaked email has sparked debates amongst the cryptocurrency community.</summary>
