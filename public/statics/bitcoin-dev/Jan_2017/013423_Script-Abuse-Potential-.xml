    <summary>On August 15, 2010, Satoshi added the OP_CAT limit of 520 bytes at the same time that OP_CAT was disabled. The previous limit was 5000 bytes. In a bitcoin-dev mailing list on January 3, 2017, Johnson Lau mentioned that there could only be not more than 201 opcodes in a script and for OP_CAT, it should be checked if the returned item is within the 520 bytes limit. Jeremy Rubin responded that the elements alpha proposal to reenable a limited OP_CAT to 520 bytes is somewhat controversial. Rubin also stated that an unfortunate script could not do much as the MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE was 520 bytes. The worst one could do with this would be to (10000-520*2)*520*2 bytes ~=~ 10 MB. Steve Davis asked if a certain pk_script could be a potential attack vector. The discussion continued regarding this topic on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
