    <summary>The proposal is a pre-BIP for implementing extra block space through a soft-fork, without breaking existing security assumptions and being transparent to existing wallets. The new wallets taking advantage of extra block space will have a different user experience. The proposal defines terminology such as main block/tx/UTXO, extension transaction/block/UTXO, bridging witness program, integrating UTXO/transaction, returning transaction, fees collection in xblock, and xblock commitment. The proposal suggests that sending money from the side chain to the main chain is the most tricky part and presents solutions to overcome this challenge. The proposal also raises questions about simplifying the design, eliminating the 100-block maturity requirement, and reducing the 100-block overkill.</summary>
