    <summary>In a recent email exchange between Eric Lombrozo and Tom Zander, Lombrozo expressed his concern that the release announcement for Bitcoin Classic did not make it clear that the software is incompatible with the current Bitcoin network and its consensus rules. However, Zander responded by stating that this was not the case and clarified that Bitcoin Classic is indeed compatible with the current Bitcoin network and its consensus rules. Zander, who maintains a blog and vlog on cryptocurrency, provided links to both platforms in his email signature: https://zander.github.io/ and https://vimeo.com/channels/tomscryptochannel.</summary>
