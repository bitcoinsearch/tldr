    <summary>A message was sent to Tom warning him not to post release announcements for software that is incompatible with the current bitcoin consensus rules as it may encourage other altcoins to do the same. Despite this, Bitcoin Classic version 1.2.0 has been released, marking a change in strategy for the company. The new version includes various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as a decentralised block size solution where node operators decide on the maximum size. Bitcoin Classic aims to provide users with a high-quality validating node for a large set of use cases and offers various projects with the beta label for those interested. More information on this release and Classic can be found on their Github page, and a video providing background information can be viewed on Vimeo.</summary>
