    <summary>In an email thread on January 7, 2017, Bitcoin Classic developer Btc Drak stated that there is no activation threshold in Bitcoin Classic. However, others have argued that while there may not be a formal one, there exists an informal and practical threshold. Some individuals believe that a formal vote or algorithm for decision-making resembles central planning and is too rigid for real world use. While it may be suitable for simple upgrades, the block size debate requires a more nuanced approach.The author of the email, Tom Zander, believes that miners cannot simply start mining with Classic and create something Core doesn't understand without negative consequences. He argues that those who misunderstand the social and economic parts of Bitcoin may ask why this would be a problem. Furthermore, he notes that the block size issue is ongoing and difficult to resolve, but does not see the point in addressing it as some central cabal that can make decisions for or against it. Overall, Zander views Bitcoin Classic as a tool for achieving a specific end, rather than a solution in itself. He maintains a blog and vlog dedicated to cryptocurrency-related topics.</summary>
