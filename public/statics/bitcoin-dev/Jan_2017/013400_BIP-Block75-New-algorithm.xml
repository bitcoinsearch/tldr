    <summary>The proposal of Block75 is to manage the maximum block size without human intervention, rather than allowing miners to have direct control. Under this system, miners can still choose to mine smaller blocks if they wish, but it will cost them in terms of fees from transactions that were not included in their blocks. The purpose of a maximum block size is to prevent a single nefarious miner from creating an overly large block that could potentially break the network. Tom Zander responded to this proposal, noting that it does not actually change the block size, only the maximum block size. He questioned why miners cannot simply be given full control of the maximum block size directly, as they have had this control (except for the 1MB limit) throughout the history of Bitcoin. He also wondered why there should be a maximum block size in the protocol at all.</summary>
