    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about Anti-Money Laundering/Know-Your-Customer (AML/KYC) requirements for mining pools, Tom Harding questioned why such regulations have not been implemented yet. Some regulators are already looking into it, but they would need multinational cooperation or China's decision to attack a budding technology. Regulating mining is new and requires a decent understanding of blockchains. Additionally, Bitcoin is still relatively small, and there is minimal reason to target it for regulation outside of Darknet Markets. However, as Bitcoin grows, regulated mining is likely to become a genuine risk.</summary>
