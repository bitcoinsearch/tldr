    <summary>The author of a script wiki is questioning if multiple pushdatas in op_return would normally be considered standard. They are unsure as the code does not explicitly state that only one pushdata is allowed, but they acknowledge that the script wiki may not be up to date. The policy.cpp file on Github does not seem to limit the number of pushdatas allowed in op_return. A user named Chris asked if there would be any objections to making op_return outputs with two pushdatas standard, with the same maximum data size. Luke Dashjr responded by stating that standards (BIPs) need to describe a specific use case and protocol for doing so. He notes that most nodes have a default policy that allows such outputs.</summary>
