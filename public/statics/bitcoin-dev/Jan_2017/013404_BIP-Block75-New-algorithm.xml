    <summary>In a discussion on 2 January 2017, t. khan stated that the maximum block size should be determined by math rather than humans, specifically miners in this case. The goal of Block75 is to manage the maximum block size without any human intervention. However, Tom Zander questioned whether it was truly math creating the input if it was completely free and human-created. He also questioned why the maximum block size needed to be part of the protocol, suggesting that a simple policy set by node operators would suffice. The purpose of having a maximum block size is to prevent a single nefarious miner from creating an overly large block that could break the network.</summary>
