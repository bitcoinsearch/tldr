    <summary>The discussion is about whether a maximum block size limit should be part of the protocol or just a policy set by node operators. It is argued that if a block is rejected based on a condition, then it is considered part of the consensus protocol. Policies are things that can vary from node to node without affecting the validity judgement of blocks. The proposal of Block75, which would change the block size limit every two weeks, is criticized for giving miners complete control over the limit. This defeats the purpose of the block size limit, which exists to restrict miners and prevent spam and growth in resource requirements.</summary>
