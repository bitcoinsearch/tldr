    <summary>In a message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr discussed Satoshi's original vision of a system where full nodes could publish proofs of invalid blocks that would be automatically verified by SPV nodes. However, Dashjr noted that this vision has proven impossible and there is currently no viable theory on how it might be fixed. As a result, the only way for nodes to have full-node-security is to actually be a true full node, which makes the plan of only having full nodes in datacenters unrealistic without transforming Bitcoin into a centralized system.Dashjr also mentioned the use of fraud proofs, which rely on the format of blocks and can be used to prove validity or detect double spending or broken syntax or logic. He stated that there aren't many cases where fraud proofs are unreasonably large for a networked system like Bitcoin, and if zero-knowledge proofs can be applied securely, then there may not be any exceptions at all for when the proofs would be unmanageable.</summary>
