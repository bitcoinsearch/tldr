    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Aymeric Vitte, questioned why the number of full nodes is not a concern and what would happen if someone were to control a majority of them. In response, Eric Voskuil stated that the level of control over a majority of full nodes is irrelevant, as it would be easy for someone to simply spin up more nodes and take control at trivial cost. Another member then requested that they take this discussion elsewhere, as the mailing list is meant for the discussion of new ideas and proposals, and not to rehash discussions that have already taken place.</summary>
