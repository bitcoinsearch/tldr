    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol has several critical limits that are scattered throughout it. These limits fall under two categories, namely the script level limit and the output value limit. The script level limit includes restrictions such as size, nOpCount, stack plus alt-stack size, and stack push size. If these limits are exceeded, they will not affect the limits of other levels. On the other hand, the output value limit states that any single output value must be greater than or equal to zero. These limits can be further expanded through a softfork by adding more metrics. By doing so, the maximum value is always taken into account. It is essential to keep these limits in mind when using the Bitcoin protocol to ensure that they are not exceeded.</summary>
