    <summary>The Bitcoin-Dev mailing list is being used to discuss the concept of 0-conf transactions. The debate centers around whether or not end-users should rely on 0-conf. James MacWhyte believes that the purpose of this discussion is to build base functionality so wallet developers can provide usability to their end-users. He also believes that instead of debating what wallet designers should do, we should provide tools and let the market sort out any issues that arise. Chris Priest explains that 0-conf is a method for determining the probability that a valid transaction will be mined in a block before that transaction gets mined. He also mentions that there is no "security catastrophe" with 0-conf transactions. Eric Voskuil disagrees with Priest's view and calls it an example of a Bitcoin security catastrophe.</summary>
