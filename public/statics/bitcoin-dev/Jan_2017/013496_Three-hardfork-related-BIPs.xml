    <summary>Luke has proposed three different Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) related to hardforks. The first proposal is about a block size limit protocol change, which would gradually increase the block size limit over time up to 31 MB. It also addresses some criticisms of SegWit, such as giving the witness discount only to SegWit transactions and allowing spam blocks larger than legitimate ones. However, this proposal requires community consensus because it involves a hardfork. Luke recommends immediate adoption but welcomes peer and community review for potential changes. The code changes are available on GitHub.The second proposal is a preparatory change that allows trivial transformation of certain classes of hardforks into softforks in the future. This change relaxes rule enforcement for full nodes after enough time has passed to guarantee they are no longer enforcing the full set of rules anyway. However, implementing this proposal has proven complicated, and Luke does not yet recommend its adoption. He has posted it for review and comments only. The third proposal is an anti-replay softfork that prevents replay attacks by using a new opcode (OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT) for the Bitcoin scripting system. This prevents replay attacks induced by a hardfork-related chain split or even ordinary operations. The text is available on GitHub.</summary>
