    <summary>In January 2017, Jon proposed to gather opinions before submitting a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aimed at getting everyone on the same page when serializing partially signed multisig raw transactions. He noted that different methodologies were being used for serializing not-signed and partially signed transactions regardless of scriptPubkey by Electrum, Copay, Coinb.in, and Bitcoin Core. In response, Thomas Kerin suggested that Jon should look at his previous work on the problem, where he had written a BIP similar to Jonas's hardware signing BIP. Kerin also recommended that Jon should consider using a protocol to request signatures, perfect for a BitGo wallet to use to talk to a GreenAddress wallet.The provided context is a public key block in PGP format, containing a long string of characters that represent the actual public key and a series of metadata about the key. The metadata includes the email address associated with the key, the date it was created, and the algorithm used to generate it. PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy, is a popular encryption tool that enables users to send secure messages over the internet. To encrypt messages using PGP, users need to generate a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone who wants to send a secure message to the user, while the private key must be kept secret.When using PGP, users can encrypt their messages using the recipient's public key, which can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message. Overall, the provided context is a PGP public key block that can be used to encrypt messages for the owner of the associated email address.</summary>
