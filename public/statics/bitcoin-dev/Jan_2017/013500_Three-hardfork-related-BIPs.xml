    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a bitcoin developer, responded to criticism of his proposal to reduce the block size limit to 300kb in an email exchange with Andrew Johnson. Dashjr argues that it is unlikely that the limit will drop all the way down to 300kb as it requires a hardfork consensus, software release, and activation by miners using BIP9, which he says is unlikely to happen before April 2017. He also suggests that such a drop would probably be good for the network in the long-term as it is necessary to maintain current first-time node synchronization costs even with technological improvements. Dashjr refutes claims that we are already at capacity, arguing that a reduction of block size could squeeze out spam and unsustainable microtransaction use, while legitimate usage of the blockchain's security should continue along fine.</summary>
