    <summary>Bitcoin Classic version 1.2.0 has been released with new features, bugfixes and performance improvements. This release is a change in strategy for Bitcoin Classic, moving from the conservative block size proposal to one where Classic innovates and provides a long-term solution for the market to choose and leave behind the restrictions of the old. The most visible change is the decentralised block size solution where node operators decide on the maximum size. Bitcoin Classic is focused on providing users a way to get onto the Bitcoin network using a high-quality validating node for a large set of use cases. This version includes various projects with the beta label which need to be enabled in the config by those who want to test them. The release notes are available on Github at https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/releases/tag/v1.2.0.Classic presents top-notch quality processes in this release to help anyone running Bitcoin.
