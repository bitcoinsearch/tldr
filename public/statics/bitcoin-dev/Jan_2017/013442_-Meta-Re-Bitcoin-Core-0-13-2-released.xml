    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, suggests that release announcements are not appropriate for the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Instead, people who want to receive release announcements can subscribe to the bitcoin-core-dev list and/or the Core announce mailing list. He recommends sending release announcements to bitcoin-discuss but not bitcoin-dev.On January 3rd, 2017, Wladimir J. van der Laan announced via bitcoin-dev that Bitcoin Core version 0.13.2 was available. This new version includes various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. However, this version is no longer supported by Windows XP, a system that Microsoft ended support for on April 8th, 2014. The company will no longer release critical security updates, so using a Bitcoin wallet on a Windows XP machine is considered irresponsible. Additionally, Bitcoin Core randomly crashes on Windows XP. Starting from Bitcoin Core 0.13.0, Windows XP is no longer supported, and users are advised to upgrade to a newer version of Windows or install an alternative operating system if possible. Furthermore, Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 onwards does not support OS X 10.7, as it was intended to work on 10.7+, but severe issues with the libc++ version on 10.7.x keep it from running reliably. 0.13.1 now requires 10.8+ and will communicate that to 10.7 users, rather than crashing unexpectedly.One of the notable changes in the new version of Bitcoin Core is the change to wallet handling of mempool rejection. When a newly created transaction failed to enter the mempool due to limits on chains of unconfirmed transactions, the sending RPC calls would return an error. The transaction would still be queued in the wallet and, once some of the parent transactions were confirmed, broadcast after the software was restarted. This behavior has been changed to return success and reattempt mempool insertion at the same time transaction rebroadcast is attempted, avoiding the need for a restart. The release notes include detailed information on the changes that affect behavior, not code moves, refactors, and string updates. The Consensus includes the backport of IBD using chainwork instead of height and not using header timestamp. The RPC and other APIs include various fixes such as not returning the address of a P2SH of a P2SH, keypoololdest denoting Unix epoch, failing when ParseHash length is not 64, adding an option to return non-segwit serialization via rpc, and complaining when unknown rpcserialversion is specified.The Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 release includes several bug fixes and improvements to the network code, build system, wallet, and testing and QA. In terms of block and transaction handling, changes include a fix for relaypriority calculation error, disabling fee estimates for a confirm target of 1 block, and sending tip change notification from invalidateblock. In P2P protocol and network code, missing cs_main lock was added to ::GETBLOCKTXN processing, an explicit request for RSA1024 private key was made in torcontrol, and compact block tweaks were rebased. Fixes for p2p-compactblocks.py test timeouts on Travis were also implemented, as well as decoupling peer-processing-logic from block-connection-logic. Orphan parent fetching now asks for witnesses, RelevantServices is used instead of node_network in AttemptToEvict, and handling of invalid compact blocks has been fixed. Changes to the build system include fixing qt5.7 build under macOS, updating for OpenSSL 1.1 API, and preventing FD_SETSIZE error building on OpenBSD. The GUI received updates such as making warnings label selectable, fixing coin control sort issue, using correct conversion function for boost::path datadir, updating bitcoin-qt.desktop, and plugging many memory leaks. In the wallet, RelayWalletTransaction now attempts to AcceptToMemoryPool, Fundrawtransaction no longer terminates when keypool is empty, txid is returned even if ATMP (AcceptToMemoryPool) fails for new transaction, and coins that have fewer ancestors are preferred with sanity check txn before ATMP. Testing and QA changes include waiting for specific block announcement in p2p-compactblocks, fixing use-after-free in scheduler tests, adding assert_raises_message to check specific error message, and adding script tests for FindAndDelete in pre-segwit and segwit scripts. Other miscellaneous changes include allowing bitcoin-tx to create v2 transactions, updating secp256k1 subtree, and removing calls to getaddrinfo_a.
