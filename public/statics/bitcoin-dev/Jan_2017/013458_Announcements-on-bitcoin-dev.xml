    <title>Announcements on bitcoin-dev</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list is meant for discussing all types of Bitcoin protocol-related issues, including those that require hard and soft forks. The BIPs process allows for proposing, discussing, and peer reviewing consensus rule changes across multiple implementations. However, the recent announcement of a new version of Bitcoin Classic has sparked complaints from some who believe it is not consensus-compatible and lacks community consensus. As a result, the moderators have clarified that announcing or advertising software that is consensus-incompatible is off-topic, but discussion of hard forks, peer review, and related topics remains on-topic. The list is lightly moderated and encourages technical or academic posts related to Bitcoin protocol development, while discouraging non-technical issues, jokes, and rehashing settled topics without new data. Meta-discussions are better suited for the Bitcoin-discuss list.</summary>
