    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list is a platform for discussing all types of Bitcoin protocol-related issues, including hard and soft forks. The BIPs process is used to propose, discuss, and peer review consensus rule changes across multiple implementations. However, the recent announcement of a new version of Bitcoin Classic has sparked complaints from some who believe it is not consensus-compatible and lacks community consensus. In response to this, moderators clarified that announcing or advertising software that is consensus-incompatible is off-topic on the mailing list. However, discussion of hard forks, peer review, and related topics remains on-topic. The list is lightly moderated and encourages technical or academic posts related to Bitcoin protocol development while discouraging non-technical issues, jokes, and rehashing settled topics without new data. It is important to note that meta-discussions are better suited for the Bitcoin-discuss list. Overall, the Bitcoin-dev mailing list serves as a platform for experts to come together and discuss various aspects of Bitcoin protocol development.</summary>
