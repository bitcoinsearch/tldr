    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, researcher Andrew Johnson pointed out that the conclusion that the network can handle 4MB blocks today is a mischaracterization of research conclusions. Johnson stated that the maximum value for blocksize that the network can safely handle (at that time) is some value that is no more than 4MB. This conservative estimate is due to the fact that the research only studied one aspect of the effect of blocksize on the network at a time, and the true safe value is the minimum of all aspects. For instance, the 4MB limit doesn't account for quadratic hashing for large transactions in large blocks.</summary>
