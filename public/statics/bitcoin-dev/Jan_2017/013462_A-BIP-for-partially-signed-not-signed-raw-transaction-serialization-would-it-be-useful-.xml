    <summary>There have been recurring issues on various projects that support multisig with users responsible for partial transaction transport. Jon, a user, is seeking opinions before proposing a BIP. Different methods are being used by Electrum, Copay, Coinb.in, Bitcoin Core, etc. for serializing partially signed multisig raw transactions, as well as not-signed raw transactions regardless of scriptPubkey. Jon suggests that everyone should be on the same page when serializing not-signed and partially signed transactions so that the person could look at the data alone and know what is necessary and how to manipulate it to sign and complete the transaction. Jon has also shared his PGP public key block in the context.</summary>
