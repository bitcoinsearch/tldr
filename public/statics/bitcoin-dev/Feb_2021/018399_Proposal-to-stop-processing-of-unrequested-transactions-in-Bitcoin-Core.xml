    <title>Proposal to stop processing of unrequested transactions in Bitcoin Core</title>

    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard proposed a change for Bitcoin Core 22.0+ that would stop the processing of unrequested transactions at TX message reception. Currently, an attacker can send expensive-to-validate junk transactions to a node through multiple inbound connections. The change is motivated by reducing the CPU DoS surface of Bitcoin Core around mempool acceptance. The proposal would break the tx-relay capabilities on the p2p network and require adaptation from some Bitcoin clients who aren't bothering with an INV/GETDATA sequence. Antoine hopes to gather feedback on this proposal and notes that a permissioned peer (PF_RELAY) will still be able to bypass such restrictions.</summary>
