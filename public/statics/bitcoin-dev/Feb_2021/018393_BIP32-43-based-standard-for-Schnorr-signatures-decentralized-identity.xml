    <summary>In this email exchange, Dmitry and Maxim discuss the hardening of the testnet path for a proposed project. Dmitry suggests that unhardened paths could reduce robustness and add complexity to the test software, while also making it difficult to test code paths that depend on hardened derivation. He also argues that requiring privkey access to hardened paths in test software is acceptable because this behavior is expected in production. Maxim agrees with Dmitry's points, but suggests changing the 'purpose' part of the path and leaving the rest unchanged instead of using unhardened paths. However, he is unsure if the purpose is the correct place to indicate testnet and proposes reserving a single dedicated value for any testnet within the 'blockchain' field using a hardened path.</summary>
