    <summary>A discussion took place between Dr. Maxim Orlovsky and Peter Wuille on the topics of key derivations, security, key tweaks in context of Schnorr signatures &amp; Taproot. As a result, some action points and plans were developed. It was suggested that there is a need for a BIP-43 based new BIP with a new purpose field for keys used in Schnorr signatures. It was strongly advised to never reuse keys for privacy/organizational reasons. The distinct standard derivation paths help in simple cases but are not a full solution in the most general case. If the keys are separated by a hardened step, then there is no concern at all. But if they are not separated, it becomes more complicated. It is advisable to make sure ECDSA key and Schnorr keys use distinct hardened derivation steps to stay within the realm of provably security.</summary>
