    <summary>In the Airgapped Wallet Community, investigations are ongoing regarding solutions for the common practice of reusing the same xpub for all multisigs. The community is particularly interested in a multi-round commitment scheme that aligns with the UX of musig for users. There have been scattered discussions on the topic, including one on GitHub. However, nothing has progressed as far as the current version being developed. Blockchain Commons has given a Concept ACK but is less clear on the specifics and will review further. It should be noted that the community plans to release a descriptor and multisig centric iOS and Android reference wallet soon, so solving this issue correctly and ensuring interoperability with others is crucial for their roadmap. Christopher Allen made this statement.</summary>
