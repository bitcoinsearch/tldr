    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal was made to have miners signal activation for two years before it becomes mandatory for their blocks to be valid. This proposal is aimed at avoiding any potential issues that may arise from clients interpreting the consensus change differently. The idea is that miners who are against the consensus change can run a client with the MUST turned into a MUST NOT, preventing activation even if signaled by other miners. This proposal would allow both sides to cleanly separate and continue operating on the same chain. The discussion also touched on the technical complexities of this proposal, with some concerns about compatibility issues between lockinontimeout=true and lockinontimeout=false nodes during a chainsplit. Matt Corallo expressed his opinion that while there are risks involved in implementing such a command line option for short-term consensus rule changes, it may not be worth putting resources into fixing these issues since taproot is not a critical feature. Overall, the conversation was focused on finding ways to ensure a smooth activation process for taproot while minimizing any potential disruptions or conflicts within the Bitcoin community.</summary>
