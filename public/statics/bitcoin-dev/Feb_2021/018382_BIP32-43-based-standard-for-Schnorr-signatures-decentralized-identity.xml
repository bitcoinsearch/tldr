    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a Bitcoin developer, suggested an unhardened testnet path from a certain point until the end of the derivation path so as to simplify test software. However, another developer disagreed, stating that this would reduce robustness and add complexity to the test software. Instead, it was suggested to change the "purpose" part of the path while leaving the rest unchanged for better robustness. The need for private key access to hardened paths in test software was also emphasized as it is expected behavior in production.</summary>
