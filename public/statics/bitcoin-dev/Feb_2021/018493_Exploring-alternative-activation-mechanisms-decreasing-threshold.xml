    <summary>On February 27, 2021, Luke Dashjr, via bitcoin-dev expressed concern over the activation of softforks lacking signalling. According to him, this creates ambiguity as it is unclear if the softfork has been activated at all. However, he suggested that the ambiguity can be resolved by seeing one block in the heaviest valid chain. He also mentioned that there are numerous volunteers in the space who would collectively commit a few blocks' worth of hashrate to know.Dashjr further noted that the proposed solution loses the flexibility of BIP8 to move the timeoutheight sooner after the initial deployment. Nonetheless, he clarified that it does not interfere with concurrent UASFs using any combination of timeoutheights.</summary>
