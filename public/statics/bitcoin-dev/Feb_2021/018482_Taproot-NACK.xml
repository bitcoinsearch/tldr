    <summary>According to a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Jeremy Rubin, Taproot does not enable Monero-like privacy features any more than what already exists in Bitcoin. At its core, Taproot is a way to make transactions with embedded smart contracts less expensive while marginally improving privacy dependent on user behavior. However, it does not obfuscate the transaction graph as in Monero. Such "Monero-like" transaction graph obfuscation may already exist in Bitcoin via other techniques (coinjoin, payjoin, coinswap, lightning, etc) with or without Taproot. The point is further moot, and the reporting may need to be rescinded. The author of the original email expressed concern that if transactions were obfuscated from scrutiny, governments would have unlimited impetus to ban Bitcoin.</summary>
