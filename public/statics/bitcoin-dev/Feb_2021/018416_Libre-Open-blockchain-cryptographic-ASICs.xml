    <summary>In an email conversation between two individuals, Bryan Bishop expressed confusion over the content of the other person's emails. He stated that none of the February emails were sent to ozlabs according to the archives there. In response, the individual apologized for any confusion and explained that they did not mean to send the email to the list at all. They also provided a link to the threads for the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which are stored on the Linux Foundation website. Despite the mistake, the individual expressed regret for taking up people's time with their email.</summary>
