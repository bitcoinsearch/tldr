    <summary>Michael Folkson and Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces are discussing the activation of the Taproot soft fork for Bitcoin via email. The focus is on the lock in on timeout (LOT) mechanism, which can be set to true or false. They agree that activating this feature requires a consensus change and should be approached like any other significant change to avoid negative consequences.To provide additional information, Michael shares links to a summary of a meeting held on February 16th on IRC and a code review of Bitcoin Core PR #19573 planned for Tuesday, February 23rd at 19:00 UTC on the IRC channel ##taproot-activation. The discussion revolves around whether LOT should be set to true or false, but there is no unanimous agreement. Michael suggests proposing LOT=false as the activation mechanism would be the best option to activate the Taproot soft fork as early as possible. In a separate message on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael encourages all participants to engage in productive and good faith discussions before and after meetings. He emphasizes the importance of collaboration in the Bitcoin development community. Michael includes his email address, PGP key, and Keybase username for added security.</summary>
