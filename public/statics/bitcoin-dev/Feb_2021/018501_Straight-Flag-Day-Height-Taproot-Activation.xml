    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed the potential implementation of a mandatory signaling flag day for Taproot, which would require all miners who have not taken active action to generate invalid blocks. Some members of the group argued that a flag day would be simpler and easier to communicate to all network participants than using activation parameters based on what percentage of economically relevant nodes are running an upgrade by a certain date. However, others raised concerns about the potential for network disruption and confusion, as well as the fact that releasing a flag day without releasing the LOT=true code leading up to that flag day means that clients would not be fully compatible with an early activation that could be proposed before the flag day is reached. There was also discussion around the BIP-8 protocol, which is partially in service of "early activation," but some members were skeptical that early activation is/was ever a good idea and suggested that a fixed activation date may be superior for business purposes, software engineering schedules, etc. Additionally, there were arguments for and against BIP-8=false, which could activate immediately but may not provide enough time for a secondary review process in case of a deadly bug. Despite these concerns, it was generally agreed that a flag day may be the best option at this time, and using LOT=true could allow for early activation if desired. The group also emphasized that LOT=true for Taproot is not a precedent-setting occurrence for any future forks.</summary>
