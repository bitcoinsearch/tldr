    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is focused on choosing between LOT=true and LOT=false for Taproot activation. Keagan McClelland argues that social consensus drives technical consensus, implying that there is no rational reason to oppose Taproot. Jeremy believes that the risk of forking is low with either plan, but favors LOT=true as the safest choice. The email suggests that users should start cooperating again to continue using the optimal strategy. The analogy of prisoner's dilemma is used to illustrate the importance of cooperation in this situation.</summary>
