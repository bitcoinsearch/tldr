    <summary>In response to a question about whether or not Bitcoin Core would consider releasing an option that would allow users to turn off the LockTime feature, Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, stated that Bitcoin Core has a long-standing policy of not including options that could potentially harm users. He believes that allowing such an option would go against the work that Bitcoin Core developers do, which is to recommend courses of action that have reasonable levels of consensus and are technically sound.Corallo acknowledges that people are free to run software that allows them to fork themselves off of Bitcoin, but he doesn't believe that Bitcoin Core should encourage this behavior. He also notes that there is strong historical precedent for people deciding to run other software around forks, so misinterpretation is not very common. Adam Back suggests that Bitcoin Core include a LOT=true option to avoid assumptive control via defaults. He believes that not having such an option could be interpreted as "developers on average disapprove, but if you, the market disagree, go figure it out for yourself," which is not a good message for being defensive and avoiding mis-interpretation of code repositories or shipped defaults as "control." However, Corallo believes that people are welcome to run their own software, but he doesn't anticipate that the loud minority on Twitter and other platforms will have enough financial weight behind their decisions to do anything but switch back if they find themselves on a chain with no blocks.</summary>
