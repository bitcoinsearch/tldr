    <summary>On February 19, 2021, Matt Corallo sent an email to bitcoin-dev regarding an issue with the email thread. Bryan clarified that the email was not off-list and reminded the users that some of them may be digest subscribed or not subscribed at all, which makes it necessary for them to create a new email thread to reply unless they want to forge the email headers to match the thread. Bryan's Twitter handle is also provided in the email signature.</summary>
