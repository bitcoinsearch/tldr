    <summary>The ongoing debate on whether to activate Taproot with LOT (LockinOnTimeout) set to true or false has been discussed in a recent meeting and a follow-up meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, February 16th. Arguments for LOT=true include completely eradicating the possibility of Taproot failing to activate within a year, avoiding edge case scenarios where different proportions of users change to LOT=true at different times, and not putting users in a position where they feel they need to change LOT. Arguments for LOT=false include the probability of Taproot not being activated by miners being small, even in the worst-case scenario, and if miners fail to activate Taproot despite pledging support and there being overwhelming community consensus for it, it would set a precedent that miners cannot be relied upon to activate soft forks. Other parameters such as activation threshold and start time will also be discussed during the meeting. It is emphasized that the discussion on LOT should not derail the overwhelming consensus that Taproot will be activated this year. In a recent post on the Bitcoin development mailing list, user Michael Folkson shared a link to a discussion on Reddit regarding Taproot activation pools. The community should prefer clarity over speed when it comes to implementing changes.Another user, Dave, highlighted a separate point regarding defaulting to LOT=false in Taproot activation. This would make non-activation possible even if people run the code provided by developers. A successful activation under these circumstances would prove that at least some miners or UASFers voluntarily took actions that were outside the scope of developer control. This argument bolsters the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin and reduces the chance of bad actors pressuring developers into making unwanted changes. Dave also argued that the fact that Bitcoin Core is free software gives anyone who obtains a copy of it the legal right to modify it, run it, learn from it, and share additional copies for any purpose. Each time someone exercises these rights to create alternative Bitcoin implementations or forkcoins, they demonstrate that users could change the system or resist changes to it in opposition to the current developer team if necessary. It is important to consider only objective criteria when deciding on deployment or status quo. So long as the activation is clearly and prominently documented, users have taken the action to accept the protocol change.Furthermore, the community has already demonstrated a clear and undisputed support for the activation of Taproot. If there was/is any question of whether that is true or not, it is premature to be planning activation of ANY type. The worst-case scenario is having to wait over a year for Taproot to be activated, but redeployment could create a situation where users believe they have already upgraded for Taproot but do not enforce it due to not understanding the need to upgrade yet again. Setting LOT=false with a threat to change it to true later is antagonistic against miners. With LOT=true, expectations are simply made clear and miners can cooperate by making valid blocks as they do day-to-day already. BIP 8 makes it explicitly easy for people to reject the soft fork if they don't like it, so any claim of being "forced" is a non-starter to an honest person.</summary>
