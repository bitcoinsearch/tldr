    <summary>Antoine Riard, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed a change for Bitcoin Core 22.0+ that would stop processing unrequested transactions at TX message reception to reduce the CPU DoS surface of Bitcoin Core around mempool acceptance. This change is motivated by reducing the vulnerability to multiple inbound connections from attackers who send expensive-to-validate junk transactions to a node. The proposal would break the tx-relay capabilities on the p2p network and require adaptation from some Bitcoin clients who aren't bothering with an INV/GETDATA sequence. Antoine hopes to gather feedback on this proposal and notes that a permissioned peer (PF_RELAY) will still be able to bypass such restrictions.In an email thread regarding the potential privacy implications of a change that would ease the discovery of a node's tx-relay topology, Antoine suggested that the same outcome can already be achieved by sending an INV and observing if a GETDATA is replied back to guess the presence of another peer with already the knowledge of the txid or connecting to this other peer and waiting for an announcement. Pieter expressed concern about the privacy implications of the change and asked for clarification on why it is not a concern. Despite this concern, Antoine does not see how the proposed change would ease attackers' work compared to already-existing heuristics. The transaction announcements/requests logic is worthy of more study about its privacy properties, particularly with recent changes and upcoming Erlay changes.Pieter expressed uncertainty about the privacy implications of a potential change in behavior when issuing a getdata request. He requested more information on why this is not a concern, but it is unclear what specific privacy concern Pieter is referring to, and the other party in the discussion asked for clarification. Overall, Antoine is eager to gather feedback on his proposed change and hopes that it provides enough time for adaptation before the old tx-processing behavior becomes the minority.</summary>
