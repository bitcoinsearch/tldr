    <summary>The ongoing discussion regarding Taproot activation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list has proposed a release that requires users to set either `taprootlot=1` or `taprootlot=0`. Michael Folkson argues that setting LOT=false in protocol implementations such as Bitcoin Core is the best move, while Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces warns against assuming that users must upgrade to the choice submitted into code. The activation mechanism is a consensus change like any other change and must be resolved in the same way, otherwise the community risks arriving at the darkest timeline. The Taproot activation meeting held on February 16th did not reach a clear consensus on whether LOT should be set to true or false, with further meetings required for in-depth exploration of arguments.Michael Folkson believes that proposing LOT=false is the only option at this time to finalize Taproot activation parameters and propose them to the community. Delay appears counterproductive in the collective aim to activate the Taproot soft fork as early as possible. However, it's important to prepare for bad scenarios in advance and minimize trust in human actors, as an activation mechanism can be contentious like any other change.If there is contention about whether to be stubborn or lenient with miners for Taproot and in the future, it's preferable to not activate anything at all. Nevertheless, in 10 or 20 years, when other blockchains implement features like Taproot, we may become envious enough to put aside our differences on how to behave towards miners and finally activate Taproot.</summary>
