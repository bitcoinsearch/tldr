    <summary>A proposal was made in which ENCRYPTION_KEY is generated using SHA256 encryption scheme, but it was considered to be vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. A more secure method was suggested where ASCII description provided by user and a 256-bit random number (NONCE) are used to generate ENCRYPTION_KEY through hmac-sha256 encryption scheme. The Coordinator then distributes DESCRIPTION and NONCE to the signers. Christopher Allen expressed his concern regarding xpub reuse into multisig wallets while discussing airgapped or stateless wallet's trustless solution. Hugo Nguyen proposed a shared secret approach in which TOKEN doubles as a session ID and helps establish a common state on both sides. Pavol Rusnak signed off with his contact details.</summary>
