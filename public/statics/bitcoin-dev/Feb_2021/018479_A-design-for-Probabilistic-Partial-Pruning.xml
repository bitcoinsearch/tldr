    <summary>Keagan McClelland, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, proposed an idea to address ongoing storage costs for full nodes and the problem of pruned nodes. Currently, there are only two options for node settings: prune everything except the most recent blocks or keep everything since genesis. However, Keagan suggests allowing nodes to randomly prune some blocks from history based on a unique seed and threshold expressed as a percentage of blocks the node wants to keep. This would increase data redundancy and alleviate some pressure on full archive nodes during IBD. Keagan is working on a draft BIP for this proposal and welcomes feedback on the protocol design and barriers to implementing it in Core. Another member of the mailing list, Igor, suggests reading Ryosuke Abe's paper proposing a DHT scheme to solve a similar problem.</summary>
