    <summary>The writer expresses their liking for the mechanism of the Decreasing Threshold proposal. They appreciate the honesty in the gradual increase of activation pressure once a feature with high demand and safety is ready. This proposal helps avoid brinkmanship by making the activation predictable and incremental. The writer notes that avoiding the hard fork dynamic, which LOT=true requires, can prevent some chain splits, but activation under political opposition may still depend on a UASF (User Activated Soft Fork). The writer suggests that if they were to line up a UASF for a feature, they would want nodes out there running this softer Decreasing Threshold activation before it fails. They also note that this proposal is not as unresponsive to miner wisdom as LOT=true. It asks miners to arbitrate both version adoption and whether nodes that haven't upgraded face risks in an early activation. If miners find themselves in dramatic unanimity, they have the influence to technically fail any activation.</summary>
