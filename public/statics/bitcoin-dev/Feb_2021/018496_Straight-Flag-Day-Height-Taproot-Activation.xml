    <summary>In a recent email to bitcoin-dev, Matt Corallo proposed activating taproot through a traditional, no-frills flag day activation with a flag day of August 2022. However, this proposal received a Concept NACK from Luke Dashjr who pointed out that it still has the same problems as BIP149. According to him, signal is important to activation and such a chain does not indicate activation at all, leaving it unresolved and debatable whether activation has occurred or not. Dashjr also emphasized that high node-level-adoption bar is one of the most critical goals in a BIP 8 approach, which is only jeopardized if people continue to push for a LOT=False deployment. Additionally, he noted that users demanding alternative consensus rules or configuration flags to change consensus rules on individual nodes with an expectation of use makes the situation complicated in the context of BIP 8.</summary>
