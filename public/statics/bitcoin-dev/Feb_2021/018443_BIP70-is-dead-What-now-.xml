    <title>BIP70 is dead. What now?</title>

    <summary>The author of the post expresses dislike for BIP70 due to its complexity and lack of a clear main feature. However, the author believes that one useful aspect of BIP70 is that payment requests are signed, providing proof in case an exchange's address is hijacked. The author suggests that if this feature were implemented by an exchange, it would guide their decision to use that exchange over competitors. The author also notes that no exchange has implemented this feature, possibly due to the shortcomings of BIP70. The author questions whether a similar standard could be achieved for on-chain payments, as Lightning Network payment requests are signed without requiring SSL or interactivity. Finally, the author offers to remove BIP70 support from Electrum if there was another standard for signed requests.</summary>
