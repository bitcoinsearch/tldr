    <summary>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin developer, responded to Luke Dashjr's proposal about BIP8-based activation. Corallo suggested a flag day activation in place of any BIP8-based activation. Dashjr expressed his disagreement with the proposal, stating that forcing signaling or any form of signaling does not guarantee the safety of a soft fork. He added that miners' role in avoiding the risk of forks is not the determining factor in ensuring that the fork has activated. Furthermore, the signaling methods used in BIP 8/9 only imply whether mining pools have configured their stratum software to signal or not. Corallo believed that forced-signaling or signaling, in general, cannot replace having a broad set of upgraded nodes across the network. It is crucial to examine upgrade patterns across the network after a fork. Pieter wrote an informative post some time ago that goes into depth about the security of soft forks. However, the determining factor in ensuring that the fork has activated is whether a vast majority of economically-active nodes enforce the rules of a new fork.</summary>
