    <summary>Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr has expressed concern about the potential chaos that could arise from non-signalled activation of soft forks in the future. This creates ambiguity on whether the soft fork has been activated or not, leading to conflicting perceptions of the rules and potentially resulting in anti-soft-fork and pro-SF nodes ending up on the same chain. To avoid this, Dashjr suggests seeing one block in the heaviest valid chain.The author of the article discusses the risks and downsides of implementing soft forks in cryptocurrency, suggesting delaying activation until all objections are resolved or committing to activation on-chain based on specific criteria. They provide examples of past controversial soft forks, including halting segwit deployment due to covert ASICBoost.A new activation mechanism for soft forks called "decreasing threshold activation" has been proposed by Gregorio Guidi, which operates similarly to BIP8. This method requires a clear majority of signaling hashrate for activation to happen, making it relatively safe. The proposed method simplifies the activation mechanism and eliminates the need to work with different client releases and issues associated with deployed nodes with different consensus parameters. It also removes the motivation to create UASF clients that force activation and provides users and miners with time to safely fork themselves off from the chain followed by Core if they choose not to upgrade.The proposed method has received some pushback, with some expressing uneasiness with the MUST_SIGNAL mechanism and the related automatic chain split on activation. However, the pseudocode for the proposed method has been included in the email thread, and the hope is that it will be adopted as the default mechanism, requiring little discussion on how to activate future soft forks. The writer expresses their liking for the mechanism of the Decreasing Threshold proposal, appreciating the honesty in the gradual increase of activation pressure once a feature with high demand and safety is ready.The proposal for the decreasing threshold approach is easy to implement, requires no parameters to set, and removes motivation to create UASF clients that force activation. The mechanism works similarly to BIP8 but with the STARTED -&gt; LOCKED_IN threshold starting at 100% and gradually decreasing by 24 blocks on each period. Activation will only occur when there is clear majority signaling hashrate, ensuring relative safety.The bitcoin-dev mailing list is a forum for discussing technical aspects of Bitcoin development. Gregorio Guidi's proposal was discussed on this forum, with Luke Dashjr raising concerns about its ambiguity when there is no signaling, which is similar to the problems that BIP149 faced. He also mentioned that it loses the flexibility of BIP8 to move the timeout height sooner after initial deployment. However, overall, the proposal achieves the objective of always ending in activation without resorting to MUST_SIGNAL and chain splits, even with low miner signaling.A code snippet provided in the context is related to the process of determining whether a soft fork has been "locked in" or "started". The variable "threshold" is calculated as a function of the number of elapsed periods and is used as a condition for determining if the soft fork should be considered "locked in". Compared to LOT=true, activation is pushed further in time when it is less safe. The approach mitigates the risk of reorgs and involuntary forks around activation, and activation is quicker and cleaner than LOT=true when it is relatively safe to do so.</summary>
