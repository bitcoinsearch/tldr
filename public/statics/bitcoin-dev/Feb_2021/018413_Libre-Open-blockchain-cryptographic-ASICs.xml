    <summary>ZmnSCPxj requested Luke to forward moderated (off-topic) messages to libre-soc-dev at lists.libre-soc.org instead of bitcoin-dev-moderation. ZmnSCPxj also discussed the use of scan mode and proposed a masking technique using an AND gate and a gating flip-flop. The gating flip-flop would prevent any scan data from being extracted if the circuit is not in test mode. The output should be glitch-free as long as the gating does not transition from 0 to 1 during normal operation. It might be beneficial to invert the sense of gating and use a NOR gate at the output, which could be smaller than an AND gate. However, overoptimizing this small circuit may not be necessary since even the largest ICs usually have only 4 to 6 scan chains.</summary>
