    <summary>Bitcoin Core contributors have been discussing whether to set a default of lot=true or lot=false for the activation of Taproot. A majority of them have effectively NACKed setting a default of lot=true, making lot=false the only possible default at this stage. However, forcing users to choose between the two options before using the software is not viable. Instead, an idea has been floated to set a config option that would allow users to easily change the default to their preferred option. A non-Core project called BitcoinActivation plans to release lot=true as a default, which means there will be lot=true nodes on the network regardless of what Core does. In theory, Core could choose not to release any activation code due to the lack of consensus on the lot default or out of concern for a possible chain split if miners failed to activate for a year. If Core chooses not to release anything, Taproot will only activate if users and miners run non-Core software.The author expresses their opinion that Core releasing nothing and putting all users in a position where they must run non-Core software to activate Taproot is highly suboptimal. Although there is a small but non-zero risk of a chain split if miners fail to activate within a year if Core releases a default of lot=false, the long-term benefits of Taproot outweigh the downside risk. Ultimately, activating Taproot may not be the best choice if the community's appetite for risk and disruption is zero.</summary>
