    <summary>ZmnSCPxj explains to Luke that a focus on power efficiency will not reduce energy consumption in Bitcoin mining. He provides an example of a miner with access to 1 watt of energy and a current hardware that gives 1 Exahash for 1 watt of energy usage. If a new technology is available where a hardware can give 1 Exohash for only 0.5 watt of energy usage, the rational choice for miners would be to buy more units instead of reducing their watt consumption. This means increasing power efficiency for mining does not reduce the amount of actual energy that will be consumed by Bitcoin mining. ZmnSCPxj also mentions that if Luke is not referring to mining energy, a computer running BitTorrent software 24/7 would consume about the same amount of energy as a fullnode running Bitcoin software 24/7, which is not particularly high relative to a lot of other things. ZmnSCPxj expresses his preference for being involved in eco-conscious blockchain and crypto-currency products.</summary>
