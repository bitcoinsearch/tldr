    <summary>The post discusses the potential issues with the Launching of Taproot, where a minority of nodes select the opposite of what Core releases. The post highlights an asymmetry with LOT=true/false analysis and examines two cases - 80% on LOT=false, 20% LOT=True, and 80% on LOT=true, 20% LOT=False. It is suggested that LOT=true having a sizeable minority running it presents major issues to majority LOT=false in terms of lost blocks during the final period and a long-term fork. Majority LOT=true has no long-term instability on consensus. The safer parameter to release seems to be LOT=true, but because devs are sensitive to control narrative, LOT=false is preferred by them. To validate the emotions, it is fine to be angry about LOT=true and not like it, but we should either accept that it is most likely to create consensus OR find a new game theoretic activation strategy with better pro-social equilibriums. The post concludes by suggesting that the ultimate risk of forking is low given probability to activate before timeout, so we should just pick something and move on, accepting that we aren't setting a precedent by which all future forks should abide.</summary>
