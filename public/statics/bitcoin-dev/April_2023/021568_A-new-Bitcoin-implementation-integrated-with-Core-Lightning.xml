    <title>A new Bitcoin implementation integrated with Core Lightning</title>

    <summary>The email thread is a discussion between Michael Folkson and Kostas Karasavvas about the potential benefits of integrating full nodes and Lightning nodes. Folkson suggests that a tighter coupling between the two could eventually make sense, particularly with upcoming proposed changes to default policy, primarily for Lightning, and a soft fork activation attempt of APO/APOAS. Separation of concerns always makes sense to manage complexity, but having two separate P2P networks and protocols wouldn't make much sense in this scenario. However, Karasavvas argues that having strong incentives would be necessary to counter the complexity argument.Folkson also discusses the dysfunction on the Bitcoin Core project, stating that decisions seem to be increasingly made behind closed doors or in private IRC channels. He suggests that a Knots style consensus compatible fork of Core with limited additional functionality might be a better option than integrating full nodes and Lightning nodes. Folkson acknowledges that there are still questions around safely removing cruft from the codebase while maintaining a less crufty fork of Bitcoin Core. Additionally, he raises concerns about mixing C and C++ code, suggesting that it would be better if Core Lightning was written in the same language as Bitcoin Core.Overall, the email thread provides insight into the ongoing discussions about improving the scalability and functionality of Bitcoin's network.</summary>
