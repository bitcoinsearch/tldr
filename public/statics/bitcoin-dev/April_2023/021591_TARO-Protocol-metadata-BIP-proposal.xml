    <summary>A proposal for a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) has been made by Adam Ivansky regarding the metadata structure of assets traded on TARO Protocol, which runs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The BIP for TARO can be found on Github, but it does not explicitly talk about the format of metadata for the assets. Ivansky has been operating a wallet for TARO called Tiramisu Wallet on testnet and has put together a list of fields that the metadata should have based on his observation. Users care about the ticker, asset name, description, image representing the asset, and information on who minted the asset. Therefore, Ivansky proposes a BIP for TARO Protocol asset metadata to be structured as a JSON stored as a string. The proposed structure includes fields such as ticker, type, description, data, hash_data, external_url, attributes, and minter_info. This is loosely inspired by the standard use by OpenSea, but in the case of TARO, there is less of an incentive to make the metadata small, as this data is not written to the blockchain directly. The Tiramisu wallet on testnet currently uses some of these JSON fields. Ivansky requests feedback on the proposal from the mailing list.</summary>
