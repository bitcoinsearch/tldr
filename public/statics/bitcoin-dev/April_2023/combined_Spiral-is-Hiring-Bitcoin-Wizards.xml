    <summary>Spiral, a non-profit Bitcoin organization within a major tech company, is hiring Bitcoin experts for various projects. The organization contributes to Bitcoin by writing code, funding projects and individuals, educating, entertaining, and testing the limits of what a tiny team can do to impact the future of money. Spiral's full-time engineering team has focused on developing LDK, a kit that simplifies how developers add the Lightning Network to apps and wallets. This year, they plan to build an R&amp;D team within Spiral to improve Bitcoin's security, decentralization, privacy, scaling, and expressivity beyond LDK.The job responsibilities include identifying and driving forward multiple projects in collaboration with the Spiral team and the greater Bitcoin development community. Applicants should have a deep technical understanding of Bitcoin and be comfortable engaging on Bitcoin topics and channels such as bitcoin-dev or lightning-dev email lists, local bitdevs, or in a "wizards" channel such as IRC #bitcoin-wizards. Strong people skills are a must as many projects will require attaining developer consensus, including the Bitcoin consensus protocol, Bitcoin p2p policy, and the LN protocol.Applicants should know which projects theyâ€™d like to work on and be able to identify three projects worth their time, explain why they benefit Bitcoin, and how their involvement would improve them. Example projects include scaling innovation, security innovation, privacy innovation, and Bitcoin expressivity innovation. The position is a full-time role with full-time worker benefits, and Spiral supports working from anywhere, but applicants need a home base in a country whose talent pool Block can legally hire from. Interested applicants can apply at spiral.xyz by sending an email with the top 3 project ideas they want to work on along with supporting evidence that they'll successfully complete them. Overall, Spiral is looking for passionate and knowledgeable individuals who are interested in contributing to Bitcoin's growth and development.</summary>
