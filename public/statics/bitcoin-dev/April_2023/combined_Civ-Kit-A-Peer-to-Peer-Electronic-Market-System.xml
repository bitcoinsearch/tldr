    <summary>In a recent discussion about the CivKit architecture, participants explored the concept of front-running in peer-to-peer marketplaces. Front-running refers to entering into a trade with advance knowledge of a block transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security. In the context of Bitcoin/Civkit, front-running could involve a bulletin board operator discovering a batch of market offers and seizing the opportunity by forwarding a HTLC across a Lightning payment path to enter the trade before publishing the offer on their board.The conversation also touched on the roles of different actors in the marketplace. Mary the Maker publishes a limit order to buy a derivative, which Bob the bulletin board operator can choose to execute. If Bob decides not to execute, he relays the order to Terry the Taker and other subscribers to his market. Terry then has the option to execute the trade against Mary's limit order, or if he chooses not to, Mary's order sits on the bulletin board.While some participants expressed concern about front-running, others saw it as a sign of active participation and liquidity in the market. They argued that finding what products people are interested in trading and providing them with a good user experience is more important than completely eliminating front-running. Additionally, they suggested that comparing bulletin board operators like Bob and Terry based on metrics like execution quality would encourage better prices and draw more market activity.To mitigate front-running, participants discussed two potential security paradigms. One approach involves duplicating the announcement of offers to multiple concurrent boards operated by independent identities and monitoring latency anomalies. Another approach proposes running the bulletin boards as a federation using Honey Badger BFT or similar technologies.Overall, the CivKit architecture provides a flexible framework for peer-to-peer marketplaces, allowing for customization of parameters like propagation latency monitoring and federation rules to adapt to different types of trades and market participants' preferences. The configuration of these parameters will depend on real-world deployments and the specific needs of the market.Antoine Riard, Nicholas Gregory, and Ray Youssef have been working on a peer-to-peer market system that enables censorship-resistant and permissionless global trading. The design combines the Nostr architecture of simple relays announcing trade orders to their clients with Lightning onion routing infrastructure. The market boards are Nostr relays with a Lightning gateway, each operating autonomously and in competition. The trades are escrowed under Bitcoin Script contracts, relying on moderations and know your peer oracles for adjudication.One feedback received on the paper publication was the lack of emphasizing front-running resistance as a fundamental property desired for a peer-to-peer marketplace. The level of front-running resistance aimed by the market participants will heavily depend on the types of trades considered. Some types of trades may be exposed to less front-running risks but would require accurate risk modeling of the underlying goods.To mitigate front-running risks, two security paradigms are proposed. The first one involves duplicating the announcement of offers to multiple concurrent boards operated by independent identities and monitoring the latency for anomalies. Latency anomalies can be detected by watchtower-like infrastructure, and misbehaving boards can be disqualified from future announcements. Another paradigm suggests running the bulletin boards as a federation under Honey Badger BFT, where incoming board offers become consensus items that must be announced to all federation members before adoption.The researchers propose the introduction of a Web-of-Stakes to enable the scoring of trades, counterparties, and service operators. This reputation paradigm could be composed with decentralized identifiers to incorporate state-of-the-art Web-of-Trust techniques. They also suggest an incentive framework for service operators through privacy-preserving credentials backed by Bitcoin payments, following the lineaments of IETF's Privacy Pass.The whitepaper delves into the architecture of the system and acknowledges the contributions of peer reviewers. The team plans to release code and modules gradually, building on top of the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr libraries. They aim to collaborate with the community to standardize libraries and ensure interoperability between clients in the long term. Feedback on their work is highly encouraged.</summary>
