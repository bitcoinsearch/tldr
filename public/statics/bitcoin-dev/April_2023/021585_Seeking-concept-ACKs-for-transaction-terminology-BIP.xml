    <summary>Josie, a participant in Bitcoin developer education programs, has noticed that students often struggle with reconciling different terms used in various resources. To address this issue, she suggests having a reference document early in the curriculum to reduce cognitive load and establish a shared terminology. Josie emphasizes the importance of the "synonyms" field as it helps map various resources to a common vocabulary. In response to a conversation about establishing a shared vocabulary for transactions, Murch drafts an informational BIP proposing terminology for various components and aspects of transactions. The proposal aims to establish a shared vocabulary to avoid confusion, acknowledging that there are already contradictory established terms. Murch shares the draft on Github and asks for feedback on the proposal's creation.</summary>
