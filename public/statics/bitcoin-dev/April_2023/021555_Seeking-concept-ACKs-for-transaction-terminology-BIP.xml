    <summary>Murch from bitcoin-dev has proposed a BIP for establishing a shared vocabulary to avoid confusion regarding various components and aspects of transactions. The proposal aims at proposing terminology for such components as there are many competing terms, including contradictory ones, which make it difficult to establish a common vocabulary. The purpose of the proposal is not to achieve a perfectly consistent selection of terms but rather to establish a shared vocabulary among participants. The draft of the BIP is available on GitHub, and Murch has asked for feedback from the community on whether they would be interested in the creation of such a BIP. Vincent has expressed his agreement with the proposal, stating that he recently found out that he was using a different word to refer to `scriptPubKey`, which only he was using.</summary>
