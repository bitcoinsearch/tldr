    <summary>MyCitadel, a Bitcoin wallet developed by Pandora Prime SA, has released an updated version 1.3 that supports account-based multi-sigs with time-locks and complex miniscript descriptors. This release extends the support to allow the same signer to participate in multiple spending conditions in SegWit v0 contexts. The new version enables the creation of complex time-locked conditions involving the same signers in different spending policies.The software also provides support for exporting Bitcoin Core/BIP380-compatible wallet descriptors, which include Taproot script tree and miniscript fragments. The desktop version of MyCitadel was created a year ago, making it the first bitcoin wallet fully written in Rust using GDK3 framework, and the first with a support for both branched tapscripts and gracefully degrading time-locked multi-sigs.MyCitadel was designed to avoid touching private keys and seeds, and instead is based on "descriptor wallet library," created by the LNP/BP Standards Association. It provides compile-time type-level guarantees avoiding usage of private keys in wallet descriptors and miniscript fragments. The wallet works with hardware signers and can produce and export PSBT files, which may be signed elsewhere, including air gapped devices or even command-line hot-wallet signers if needed.The new release enables the creation of degrading time-locked multi-sigs in SegWit v0 context, where the same device/signer can participate in multiple conditions with different timelocks and multisig thresholds. The problem of not being able to create SegWit policies re-using the same extended key was mitigated by introducing account-based spending policies, using a different account from the same signer in different script branches.If anyone wants to check out the updated version, play with it, or leave feedback, they can go to the release GutHub discussion, which links to the released binaries. The release was made possible due to the help provided by the NYM project team, which provided valuable ideas and financial support for continued MyCitadel development.</summary>
