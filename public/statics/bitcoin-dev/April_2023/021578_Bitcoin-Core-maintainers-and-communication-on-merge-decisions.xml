    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson expressed concern about the perception of the Inquisition being "the one and only" staging ground for consensus changes in the Bitcoin open source project. To this, another member suggested that competition is the answer to concerns about the bad effects from a monopoly. The suggestion was to create a fork and do a better job. The member also pointed out that every successful consensus change to date has been staged through the developers' own repository, followed by the core pull request process. Therefore, the option still exists for developers to make changes without going through the Inquisition. Overall, it seems that while the Inquisition plays an important role in the Bitcoin development process, there are alternative ways for developers to propose and implement changes. Competition and collaboration among developers can lead to better outcomes for the Bitcoin community as a whole.</summary>
