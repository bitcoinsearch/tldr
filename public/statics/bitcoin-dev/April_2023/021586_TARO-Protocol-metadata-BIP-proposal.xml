    <summary>Adam Ivansky, founder of Tiramisu Wallet, has proposed a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for the metadata structure of assets traded on TARO Protocol. While the TARO BIP does not explicitly discuss the format of asset metadata, it must be agreed upon to trade assets such as NFTs, stablecoins, and synthetic assets. After testing different use cases and observing external users, Ivansky suggests that the metadata should include fields such as ticker, asset name, description, image representation, and information about who minted the asset. He proposes that the metadata be structured as JSON stored as a string and formatted according to his proposal. This is loosely inspired by OpenSea's metadata standards, but includes actual image data in the metadata. The Tiramisu wallet uses some of these JSON fields.</summary>
