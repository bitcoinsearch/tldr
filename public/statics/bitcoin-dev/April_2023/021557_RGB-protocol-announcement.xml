    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky has released RGB v0.10, which can be downloaded and installed from their website. The goal of RGB is to build a programmability layer for Bitcoin and Lightning that will enable other use cases besides tokens such as DAOs and decentralized identities. However, client-side validation may not be sufficient to enforce conditions in a trustless multiparty setting, as Bob's example demonstrates. Dr. Orlovsky is also working on the design of a layer 1 that will be compact and ultra-scalable, which should be perfect for client-side-validated applications. However, there are concerns about the status of the implementations of RGB. There is minimal documentation available, and previous reviewers have been directed to watch videos or read the code. Testing appears to be lacking in several applications, and there is a significant difference between the number of lines of code in the RGB and LNP nodes compared to four other LN implementations, although this could be attributed to the larger teams working on them. Despite four years of active development, weekly community calls, and talks at all mainstream bitcoin-only events and conferences, awareness about RGB in the bitcoin community is still very small, and the project's ambition and scope creep may be preventing it from serving its original purpose effectively.</summary>
