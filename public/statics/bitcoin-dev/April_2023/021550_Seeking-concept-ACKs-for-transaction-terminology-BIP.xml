    <summary>Murch, a person who participated in conversations about transactions over the years, has proposed a terminology for various components and aspects of transactions. The proposal aims to establish a shared vocabulary to avoid confusion as there are many competing terms that refer to `scriptPubKey`. The proposal is an informational BIP that does not aim for a perfectly consistent selection of terms due to established contradictory terms. Murch has provided a draft for the proposal on GitHub and asked if anyone would be interested in the creation of such a BIP.</summary>
