    <title>Bitcoin Core maintainers and communication on merge decisions</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin Core project has been experiencing challenges with communication, leading to criticism from some members of the community. One developer expressed concern about the global process and lack of maintainers involved in reviewing pull requests (PRs), suggesting that companies involved in Bitcoin should designate at least one person for this purpose. Another developer argued that having maintainers provide commentary on every merge would increase the burden on them and lead to burnout and resignations. Currently, there are 320 open PRs and 366 open issues, making it difficult to keep up with all activity within the repo. Maintainers make judgement calls on whether a PR has had enough review, considering both the number of ACKs and the quality and competence of the reviewers. Long-time maintainers stepping away could lead to delays in merging PRs. Additionally, not every feature request will be implemented, and if there is a desired feature, individuals may need to implement it themselves or pay someone to do it for them.</summary>
