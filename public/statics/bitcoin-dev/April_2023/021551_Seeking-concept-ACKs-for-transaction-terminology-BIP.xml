    <summary>Murch via bitcoin-dev has proposed the creation of an informational BIP that aims to establish a shared vocabulary for various components and aspects of transactions. Murch notes that there are many competing terms, which can cause confusion during conversations. The proposal does not aim for perfect consistency but rather a shared vocabulary to avoid confusion. Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, expressed interest in such a BIP, leaving the work of refining the terminology to others. A link to the draft of the proposal can be found on GitHub.</summary>
