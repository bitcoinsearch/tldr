    <summary>The communication challenges on Bitcoin Core have been highlighted by Michael Folkson, who stated that there is little commentary provided when pull requests are merged or left for long periods without merging. He speculates that this may be due to poor communication skills, a desire to avoid accountability, or fear of legal action resulting from mistakes made during merges. The lack of transparency and accountability has led to frustration amongst pull request authors and resulted in contentious soft fork activation attempts, such as the CTV pull request which was ultimately called off at the last minute. Folkson argues that maintaining transparency and accountability is crucial for the success of Bitcoin Core and suggests that if these issues persist, it may be necessary to invest more heavily in consensus compatible forks of Core. Nonetheless, he acknowledges that the issue is not specific to any individual(s) and may be exacerbated by external malicious actors. In the meantime, he notes that bip 119 and bip 118 are two potential solutions for certain use cases, with bip 118 being particularly beneficial for lightning, a killer app that makes batch channels more efficient.</summary>
