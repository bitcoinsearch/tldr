    <summary>In this email thread, Michael Folkson expresses his concern about the lack of communication and transparency around merge decisions in Bitcoin Core. He highlights examples of pull requests that have been left unmerged for long periods of time without any explanation from the maintainers, creating frustration and a lack of accountability. He argues that poor communication creates as many problems as it solves and calls for more openness and discussion around merge decisions.He also criticizes the suggestion to create a nonprofit to fund someone to work on Bitcoin Core, arguing that without a maintainer to merge pull requests, contributions are wasted. He cites the example of Vasil Dimov's pull request to become a maintainer, which was blocked by two maintainers despite many ACKs from other maintainers and contributors. He notes that this not only impacts Vasil's commitment to the project but also affects what pull requests are ultimately reviewed and merged.Michael also discusses the recent CTV pull request, which led to a contentious soft fork activation attempt that was ultimately called off. He notes that there were NACKs from individuals who were not considered long-term contributors to Bitcoin Core, and that the lack of clear communication around the readiness of the pull request contributed to confusion and inflated support on external sites.Overall, Michael emphasizes the importance of communication and transparency in the development process and calls for more openness and discussion around merge decisions. The author, Michael Folkson, is advocating for increased transparency and accountability within the development process of the Core software in the cryptocurrency community. He implies that there is currently a lack of transparency within the Core project where merge decisions are made without explanation or justification. Folkson suggests that treating the Core project like a proprietary "open source" project is not conducive to the principles of transparency and accountability. He encourages a more open approach to decision-making within the community. As an intelligent assistant, it is important to note that the context provided lacks any specific information about the Core software or the cryptocurrency community. However, based on the language used, it can be inferred that Folkson is addressing a specific audience that is already familiar with these topics.</summary>
