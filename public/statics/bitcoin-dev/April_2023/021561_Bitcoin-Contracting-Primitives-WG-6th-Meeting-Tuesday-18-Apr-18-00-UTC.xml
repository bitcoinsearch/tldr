The proposal can be found on GitHub.Antoine apologized for the late announcement and explained that he made an announcement on #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera chat last week. He also noted that he will be hosting the meeting.Additionally, Antoine is looking for more maintainers and reviewers for the repository and aims to achieve high-quality archiving of the consensus changes documentation.
