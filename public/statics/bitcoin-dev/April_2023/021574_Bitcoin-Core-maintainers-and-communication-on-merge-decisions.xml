    <summary>The communication challenges within Bitcoin Core are not new, with maintainers often merging pull requests without providing any commentary on their decision. Michael Folkson highlights the lack of accountability and transparency among some current maintainers and suggests this has contributed to poor communication. He notes that some pull requests have been left in "rebase hell" for months without explanation. While there is an element of external malicious actors at play, Folkson concludes that transparency and accountability need to be taken more seriously, or else a consensus-compatible fork of Core may be necessary. Folkson provides several examples of contentious pull requests that have not been adequately addressed, including one to add Vasil Dimov as a maintainer and another related to CTV.</summary>
