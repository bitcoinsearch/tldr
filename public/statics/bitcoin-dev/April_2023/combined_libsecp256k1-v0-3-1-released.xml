    <summary>Bitcoin Core has announced a new version, 0.3.1, of libsecp256k1. This release is a bugfix after version 0.3.0, which was not previously announced. The full release notes for both versions can be found on the GitHub page. The reason for this release is due to the discovery that Clang 14 and later could optimize out a specific timing side-channel protection mechanism, making applications vulnerable to a side-channel attack. However, this issue has been fixed in version 0.3.1. Users of the library are strongly recommended to upgrade if their code may be compiled with Clang 14+. It should be noted that Bitcoin Core release binaries are not affected by this issue. The update aims to fix the vulnerability related to Clang 14 and later. Users are advised to download the latest version to secure their code from any potential attacks. The detailed release notes for both versions can be accessed on the GitHub page.</summary>
