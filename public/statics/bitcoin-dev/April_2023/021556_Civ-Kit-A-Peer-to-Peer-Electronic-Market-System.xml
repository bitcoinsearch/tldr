    <summary>A group including Nicholas Gregory and Ray Youssef is developing a new peer-to-peer market system that aims to enable censorship-resistant and permissionless global trading. The design combines the Nostr architecture with Lightning onion routing infrastructure to grant a high level of confidentiality to market participants. The market boards are Nostr relays with a Lightning gateway, each operating autonomously and in competition. Trades are escrowed under Bitcoin Script contracts, relying on moderations and know your peer oracles for adjudication. The scoring of trades, counterparties, and services operators should be enabled by the introduction of a Web-of-Stakes, assembled from previous ideas. A consistent incentive framework for service operators is proposed by the intermediary of privacy-preserving credentials backed by Bitcoin payments. The whitepaper goes deep into the architecture of the system. They plan to release code and modules according to the best Bitcoin open-source and decentralized standards established by Bitcoin Core and collaborate with everyone in the community to standardize libraries and guarantee interoperability between clients with long-term thinking. Feedback is welcome.</summary>
