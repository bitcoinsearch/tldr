    <summary>In an email thread with Steve and Bitcoin developers, alicexbt made a statement that money means different things for people in the world and wants bitcoin to be considered as money. One of the developers responded by stating that fungibility is a property of money, and NFTs are not fungible and thus cannot be considered as money. alicexbt argued that inscriptions do not affect the fungibility of Bitcoin since there is no token standard being used, and inscribed sats can be sold or used like normal Bitcoin on exchanges. The use of inscribed sats is different from Ethereum tokens as they will never go to zero, and one can always consolidate them to use as normal Bitcoin.The fungibility of Bitcoin is debatable, and some post-mix UTXOs are censored on some exchanges, making it easy to identify them. However, alicexbt is working on a coinjoin implementation to address this issue. Although some users believe in ordinal theory, which is a parallel universe where they try to learn how Bitcoin works, developers are interested in building things such as BIP, DEX, and projects implementing PSBT.alicexbt requested that people be allowed to do what they want with Bitcoin without changing consensus rules, as it would help Bitcoin. Finally, alicexbt stated that they do not live in a first-world country and do not attend bitdevs but have always wanted Bitcoin to be accessible to all.</summary>
