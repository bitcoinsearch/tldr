    <summary>A new version, 0.3.1, of libsecp256k1 has been announced by Bitcoin Core. This release is a bugfix after version 0.3.0, which was not previously announced. The full release notes for both versions can be found on the GitHub page. The reason for this release is due to the discovery that Clang 14 and later could optimize out a specific timing side-channel protection mechanism, making applications vulnerable to a side-channel attack. However, this issue has been fixed in version 0.3.1. Users of the library are strongly recommended to upgrade if their code may be compiled with Clang 14+. It should be noted that Bitcoin Core release binaries are not affected.</summary>
