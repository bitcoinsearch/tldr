    <summary>Michael Folkson, a long-term contributor to Bitcoin, expressed concerns about the lack of communication from maintainers and long-term contributors on the bitcoin-inquisition/default signet. He requested for criteria for merging proposed default policy changes or consensus changes to be discussed and made transparent. Anthony Towns suggested that creating competition is the only answer to concerns about bad effects from a monopoly, but Michael believes that it would be ideal to have more transparency in merge decisions on the default signet. He also mentioned the chaos caused during the CTV activation and hopes that lessons are learned so that another contentious soft fork activation attempt on mainnet can be avoided. Michael's email address, Keybase, and PGP key were included at the end of his message.</summary>
