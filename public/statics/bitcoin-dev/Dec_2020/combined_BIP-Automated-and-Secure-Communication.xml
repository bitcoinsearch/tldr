    <summary>A Reddit user named Prayank has posted a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list asking whether there would be enough interest in proposing a BIP related to automated and secure communication used in Soroban. Despite some past controversy involving Samourai, he believes that doing everything that helps Bitcoin is important. A BIP could help other Bitcoin projects in the future, such as joinmarket, coinswap, snickr, among others, according to a medium article linked in the post.The Samourai team has tweeted that it has no interest in proposing a BIP related to Soroban previously, but Ben, one of its members, has also tweeted that a BIP would make sense. Moreover, the source code for a client library in Java is available here, and the source code for the Go-based server component is available here. Prayank has requested assistance in creating a BIP if anyone is willing.The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around whether a BIP should be proposed related to automated and secure communication used in Soroban, a project by Samourai wallet. While some members believe that this is not a proposal to improve the Bitcoin protocol, others like Ben have tweeted that a BIP would make sense. To clarify, anything that makes sense to coordinate between different programs is BIP material, not just the core Bitcoin protocol. However, some members caution that this mailing list may not be the right venue for proposing such a BIP.Samourai, a Bitcoin wallet provider, has declined to propose a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) related to automated and secure communication used in Soroban. The reason being that it is not a proposal to improve the Bitcoin protocol, and writing a specification for it would be inappropriate for the mailing list. Nonetheless, Prayank via bitcoin-dev wants to know if people are interested in such a BIP because it may help other bitcoin projects in future. Ben, who works at Square Crypto, also mentioned that a BIP would make sense. Prayank emphasizes on doing everything that helps Bitcoin, irrespective of Samourai's controversial past. According to him, the medium article mentions that it could help other projects like joinmarket, coinswap, snickr etc. The source code for a client library in Java for Soroban is available at https://code.samourai.io/wallet/soroban-client-java while the Go-based server component's source code is available at https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-soroban. Prayank asks if anyone is willing to help create a BIP for such an implementation to be used by other bitcoin projects.</summary>
