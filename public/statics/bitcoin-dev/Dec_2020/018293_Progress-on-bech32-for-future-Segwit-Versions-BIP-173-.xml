    <summary>On November 6, 2020, Mike Schmidt via bitcoin-dev wrote about his experience sending Bitcoin test transactions and the notable results. He suggests that there is no need to maintain the old-software-can-send-to-future-segwit-versions property since some software not only didn't support it but also sent coins into a black hole. Rusty's proposal to change the checksum for v1+ unconditionally gains agreement from Mike as it protects old senders from the insertion issue by failing. Mike suggests using the constant M=0x2bc830a3 instead of 0x3fffffff as previously suggested. More information on this can be found on https://gist.github.com/sipa/14c248c288c3880a3b191f978a34508e. If there are no objections, he plans to write up a BIP soon.</summary>
