    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Andrew Poelstra had a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the proposed text for consensus-only validation extension. Pieter Wuille was not sure if this extension will replace the inconclusive-due-to-consensus-and-standardness-differ state or not. Andrew suggested a way to specify it, where every signature has a well-defined result of valid, invalid, or inconclusive. If validators do not understand anything, they may choose to report it as inconclusive. Andrew updated his PR at Github with four differences, including compacting all the validation states into three categories, removing extensions sections, removing "to_sign" transaction from wire serialization, and not complicating the protocol for obscure things like bare public keys or multisigs.</summary>
