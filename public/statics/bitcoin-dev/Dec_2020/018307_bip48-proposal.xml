    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Fontaine proposed BIP48, which draws inspiration from BIP44 and aims to document modern multi-sig derivations. The proposal is seen as formalizing existing tacit standards, consistent with a previous pull request, and likely related to a separate proposal by prusnak that received a NACK. The author of PR#253 had indicated they would open a separate proposal but it appears this did not happen. Luke Dashjr reminded users not to self-assign BIP numbers and asked if the proposal was compatible with the aforementioned pull request. A link to the proposal's draft was provided in the thread.</summary>
