    <summary>In this conversation, Fontaine proposes a BIP, bip48, for documenting modern multi-sig derivations. They share a rough draft of the proposal and receive feedback from other community members, including Luke Dashjr, who reminds them not to self-assign BIP numbers. Dentondevelopment confirms that the proposed BIP is compatible with another pull request on Github, and suggests that bip48 would be fitting if it is unused. Fontaine notes that the proposal is still a work in progress and they are incorporating feedback from Pavol and others before sharing the next draft. All communication is done via email and secured through ProtonMail. A link to the Github repository containing the proposal is also provided.</summary>
