    <summary>In a recent proposal by Andrew Chow via bitcoin-dev, a new version of PSBT (v1) has been suggested to address some deficiencies found in the current PSBT v0. The primary change proposed is to have all input and output data for each in their respective maps, instead of having to parse an unsigned transaction and lookup some data from there, and other data from the correct map. This change disallows PSBT_GLOBAL_UNSIGNED_TX in the new version and proposes fields such as PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_VERSION, which is a 32-bit little-endian unsigned integer for the transaction version number and must be provided in PSBT v1 and omitted in v0. While these changes sound great and make working with PSBTs easier, Andrew Poelstra suggests that the version numbering should be consistent, and GLOBAL_TX_VERSION should be set to 2 instead of v1, as nobody thinks of the existing PSBT as "version 0".</summary>
