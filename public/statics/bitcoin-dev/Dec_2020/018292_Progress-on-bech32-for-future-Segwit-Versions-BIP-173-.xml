    <summary>The email thread discusses an alternative to length restrictions suggested for Bech32's checksum algorithm. The current algorithm uses M=1, but it has a weakness where any number of 'q' characters can be inserted or deleted before the final character 'p'. An analysis of various error classes has been performed to determine the optimal constant that minimizes the largest number of weaknesses. The recommended constant is M = 0x2bc830a3. This constant has several properties including detecting up to 4 substitution errors and valid codes with the new constant fed without modification to software that uses the old constant 1. The code used for the analysis and verification of the results can be found on GitHub.</summary>
