    <summary>Samourai, a Bitcoin wallet provider, has declined to propose a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) related to automated and secure communication used in Soroban. The reason being that it is not a proposal to improve the Bitcoin protocol, and writing a specification for it would be inappropriate for the mailing list. However, Samourai team had earlier tweeted their lack of interest in proposing such a BIP. Nonetheless, Prayank via bitcoin-dev wants to know if people are interested in such a BIP because it may help other bitcoin projects in future. Ben, who works at Square Crypto, also mentioned that a BIP would make sense. Prayank emphasizes on doing everything that helps Bitcoin, irrespective of Samourai's controversial past. According to him, the medium article mentions that it could help other projects like joinmarket, coinswap, snickr etc. The source code for a client library in Java for Soroban is available at https://code.samourai.io/wallet/soroban-client-java while the Go-based server component's source code is available at https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-soroban. Prayank asks if anyone is willing to help create a BIP for such an implementation to be used by other bitcoin projects.</summary>
