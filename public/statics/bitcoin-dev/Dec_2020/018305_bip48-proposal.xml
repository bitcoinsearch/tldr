    <summary>A proposal for BIP number 48 has been made by Fontaine, inspired by BIP44, for documenting modern multi-sig derivations. The proposed BIP can be found on a GitHub repository provided by Fontaine. However, Luke Dashjr has pointed out that BIP number 48 has not been assigned and self-assigning BIP numbers is not allowed. It is unclear whether the proposed BIP is intended to be compatible with another GitHub repository for BIP253.</summary>
