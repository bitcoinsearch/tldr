    <summary>Fontaine expressed gratitude for the link provided by Pavol Rusnak regarding the documentation of 48 path usage. The document proposed by Fontaine, called bip48, aims to document modern multi-sig derivations, inspired by bip44. Pavol Rusnak pointed out that their document also documents script_type=0 for raw BIP-11 multisig, which is not widely used but could still be included in the proposed BIP. The email thread took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The message was sent using ProtonMail for secure communication.</summary>
