    <summary>A proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for a standardized wallet API has been shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal outlines an interface in JavaScript that would allow Bitcoin wallets to expose their address derivation and signing functions to external applications, providing a clear API for wallets to implement and allowing applications to be agnostic to wallet specifics. The proposal also notes the need for sensitive functions such as signing to always prompt the user for confirmation. Mandatory methods include `wallet_getAddresses`, `wallet_signMessage`, `wallet_signPSBT`, and `wallet_getConnectedNetwork`. The proposal emphasizes the need for great care when exposing wallet functionality externally due to the potential security and privacy risks for users.In response to the proposal, Aymeric Vitte suggests considering anonymity from the browser by looking at https://github.com/Ayms/node-Tor. Monokh, who posted the original proposal, welcomes feedback and input from the community. Luke Dashjr cautions against encouraging people to write or use web browsers for their wallets and suggests reviewing earlier work in this area.Another suggestion made by Monokh on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is to give origin access to all public keys but with the option to expose only selected derivation paths. This could potentially enhance the user experience while ensuring security and privacy.Aymeric Vitte, based in Sophia-Antipolis, France, has shared a range of tools and resources for working with Bitcoin, Zcash, and torrents on GitHub. These include Peersm, node-Tor, and dynamic blocklists. With these resources, developers can create more secure and private applications using cryptocurrencies and other decentralized technologies.</summary>
