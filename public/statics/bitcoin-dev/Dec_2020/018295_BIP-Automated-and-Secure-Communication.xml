    <summary>In a post on Reddit, Prayank has asked for opinions on whether there would be enough interest in proposing a BIP related to automated and secure communication used in Soroban. Despite some past controversy involving Samourai, he believes that putting aside differences and doing everything that helps Bitcoin is important. A BIP could help other Bitcoin projects in the future, such as joinmarket, coinswap, snickr, among others, according to a medium article linked in the post.Â The Samourai team has tweeted that it has no interest in proposing a BIP related to Soroban previously, but Ben, one of its members, has also tweeted that a BIP would make sense. Moreover, the source code for a client library in Java is available here, and the source code for the Go-based server component is available here. Prayank has requested assistance in creating a BIP if anyone is willing.</summary>
