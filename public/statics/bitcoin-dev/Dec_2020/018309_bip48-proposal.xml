    <summary>In an email thread on December 16 and 17, 2020, Fontaine proposed BIP48, inspired by BIP44, to document modern multi-sig derivations. The proposal was shared via a static link and then later through a GitHub repository where others could make comments and suggestions. In response, Luke Dashjr reminded Fontaine not to self-assign BIP numbers and asked if the proposal was compatible with another pull request. Fontaine responded that they only had guidance from the README and that BIP48 would be fitting if it was unused. They also noted that the proposal was still a work in progress and that they were using feedback from Pavol and others to update it.</summary>
