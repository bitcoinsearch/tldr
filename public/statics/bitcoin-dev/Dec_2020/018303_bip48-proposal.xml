    <summary>Fontaine has proposed a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) called bip48, which is inspired by bip44. The purpose of this proposal is to document modern multi-sig derivations. A rough draft of the proposal is attached to the email and comments and input are welcome. No information is given about the content of the proposal except for the fact that it is related to multi-sig derivations. The email also includes two attachments, one of which is an HTML file that has been scrubbed and the other is a non-text attachment called bip-0048.mediawiki, which is an application/octet-stream that is 6667 bytes in size.</summary>
