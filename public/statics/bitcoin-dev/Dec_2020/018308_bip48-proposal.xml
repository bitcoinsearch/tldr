    <summary>A proposal for a new BIP, called bip48, has been put forward to document modern multi-sig derivations. The proposal takes inspiration from bip44 and aims to provide more clarity on the usage of 48 paths. Pavol Rusnak, co-founder and CTO of SatoshiLabs, has applauded the effort and pointed out that their documentation of 48 path usage also includes script_type=0 for raw BIP-11 multisig, which they believe should be documented in the proposed BIP as well. The draft of the proposed BIP has been attached to the email sent by Fontaine, who welcomes comments and input.</summary>
