    <summary>On December 22, 2020, Pieter Wuille made a proposal on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the "consensus-only validation" extension. Andrew Poelstra responded with his thoughts on standardness vs consensus rules and his desire to enforce standardness rules for anti-malleability reasons. However, he acknowledged that it is difficult to enforce these rules as an implementer because libbitcoinconsensus does not expose them. He also agreed with Wuille's idea of allowing validators to signal when a signature appears to use future consensus rules and using the "inconclusive" state as an elegant way to achieve this. Both agreed that confirming validators should never disagree on valid vs invalid and Poelstra added a commit to his PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1048 which reflects their thoughts.</summary>
