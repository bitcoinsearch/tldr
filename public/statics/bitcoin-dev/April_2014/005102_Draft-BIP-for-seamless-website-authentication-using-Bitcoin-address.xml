    <summary>A proposed BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) has been put forth by Eric Larchevêque as a way to authenticate users with one Bitcoin address from their wallet. The idea is that it would simplify the process of authentication for users and improve the Bitcoin ecosystem. Currently, services require users' Bitcoin addresses and request an email/password to store it. However, if a standard protocol is not established, it would be difficult to envision a pure Bitcoin locker rental or booking hotel rooms via Bitcoin and opening the door through the paying address. Some argue that the problem Larchevêque is trying to solve is already solved by SSL client certificates. One of the suggested solutions is to use something like client certificates or the FIDO alliance's specifications, which would allow a user to download the code and participate in things they want securely and reliably without needing third-party software. Gavin Andresen believes using a bitcoin address repeatedly is something they're trying to move away from and using a bitcoin address as a persistent identity key feels like the wrong direction to him.</summary>
