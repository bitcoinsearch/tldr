    <summary>In an email thread from 2014, various Bitcoin developers discussed the idea of changing the default unit for wallet applications to 1e-6 BTC. The discussion included potential names for this new unit, such as "bits," "microbes," and "micros." Some developers were in favor of using "microbitcoin" instead, but all agreed that any appropriate nickname would develop in due course. While some expressed concern about overloading the word "bits," others felt that it was sufficiently different from regular usage that it wouldn't be confused by consumers. The conversation also touched on the importance of understanding orders of magnitude in the context of Bitcoin, with some arguing that learning about mBTC and ÂµBTC could be considered a basic mathematical skill in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency. While some developers were eager to integrate alternative units into their wallets, they preferred to wait until there was a unified push for it from other developers rather than changing the default right away. Overall, while there was some debate over what to call the new unit, the developers seemed to agree that moving to a smaller default unit was a positive step for Bitcoin.</summary>
