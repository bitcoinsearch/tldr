    <summary>Slush, a Bitcoin developer, initiated a discussion on implementing a standard for wallet software to facilitate sharing wallets. After discussing details with wallet developers off-list, it was agreed that the structure m/'/'// fulfilled requirements for all wallet developers, including myTrezor, Electrum, Multibit, Wallet32, and others willing to adapt once standardized. However, while there is an agreement that a standard would be useful, not every aspect of it was agreed upon. For example, different clients will implement things differently, such as bitcoinj holding all keys in memory and Electrum using a chain for its private purpose. Therefore, if a complete agreement cannot be reached on a standard and its extension, Slush proposed keeping chains separate until each developer has a feel for the specific requirements before trying to standardize.</summary>
