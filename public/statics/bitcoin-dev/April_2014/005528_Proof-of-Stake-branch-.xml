    <summary>Stephen L. Reed, a member of the Bitcoin community, plans to create a Bitcoin branch that provides a sandboxed testbed for researching the best Proof-of-Stake (PoS) implementations. PoS is currently a prohibited yet disputed change to Bitcoin Core. However, Reed believes that circumstances may arise in the future which could lead to a shift in user opinion towards moving PoS from the prohibited list to the hard-fork list. To gauge support for PoS, Reed conducted a poll on bitcointalk.org, which suggests some minority support for Bitcoin Proof-of-Stake. He invites any interested parties to comment on the thread. Before branching the source code, Reed asks if creating the branch would be harmful. His goal is to develop, test and document PoS while exploring its vulnerabilities and fixing them in a transparent fashion.</summary>
