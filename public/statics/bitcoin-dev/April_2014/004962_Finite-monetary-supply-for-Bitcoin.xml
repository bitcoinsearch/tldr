    <summary>A controversial proposal was made by Pieter Wuille to turn Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency. He believes that the current subsidy schedule is no longer acceptable and wrote a small draft BIP with this proposal. The text of the proposal can be found on GitHub. Despite Bitcoin core developers being some of the most active TypeScript coders around, Wuille sees this as an important step forward. Wuille cites Dogecoin as an example of how easy it is to make such changes and thinks that Bitcoin should demonstrate its commitment to adopting innovative features like non-inflation regardless of their origins in other crypto-currencies. Wuille's proposal has caused controversy but he believes it is worthwhile exploring.</summary>
