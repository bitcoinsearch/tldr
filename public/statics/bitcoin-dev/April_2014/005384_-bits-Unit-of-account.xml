    <summary>The problem of mixed use of BTC, mBTC and µBTC leading to misunderstanding is addressed by Bitsofproof. The idea proposed is to have a single unit called satoshis which has no smaller than 1/100 fractions, benefiting the adoption. Danny Hamilton suggests that since most of the wallets display amounts in µBTC quantities, it would be obvious that a µBTC is a different magnitude than a BTC, and people will make the mental adjustment to the new order of magnitude even if they don't specifically know that µ means micro, or that micro means 1e-6. Nicknames will form organically like milly (or millie) and mike (or micky) as nicknames for mBTC and µBTC. There isn't any good reason to be coding a nickname like "bit", "xbit", or "mike" into wallet software.</summary>
