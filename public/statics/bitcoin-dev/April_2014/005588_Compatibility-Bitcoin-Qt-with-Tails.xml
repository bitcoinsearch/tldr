    <summary>In an email exchange between Wladimir and Kristov, Wladimir mentioned that he has modified the gitian build to work with Qt 4.6 instead of Qt 4.8 in a pull request. He provided a test build of master with that pulls gitian descriptor which should work on Debian Squeeze/Tails Linux. Kristov thanked Wladimir for building the binary, stating that the initial problem with Qt was resolved and he was able to load the GUI that chooses his datadir. However, after choosing the default datadir, it segfaulted. The segfault came after the "sendto: Operation not permitted" message since Core won't be able to connect to the internet without going through Tails' Tor SOCKS proxy. When Kristov specified the SOCKS proxy through the command-line, there was a brief flash of the GUI before it segfaults again. The "Bus::open" and "IBusInputContext::createInputContext" messages are atypical and might be related to the segfault. Sample terminal output was provided for the latest Tails (0.23).</summary>
