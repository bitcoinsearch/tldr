    <summary>Tamas Blummer, the creator of Bitsofproof, developed a merchant system that hands out BIP32 addresses. This system eliminates the gap size problem because it has an additional database that tracks requests, which means there is no added cost for storing the key coordinates used by them. Additionally, keys can be accessed in random order without requiring a scan. In response to a comment about setting the gap limit too high, Tier Nolan points out that this would not be a small extra cost if a merchant had hundreds of accounts on multiple devices. The goal is to have a single system that is compatible over a large number of systems.</summary>
