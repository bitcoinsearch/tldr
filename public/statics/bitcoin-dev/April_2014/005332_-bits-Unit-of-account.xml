    <summary>In an email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Pieter Wuille about the use of terminology for Bitcoin, Tamas suggested using "xbit" as a slang word that links with the official XBT. He explains that it rationalises XBT and is unique, and he associates from x to six, supporting the 1e-6 divisor of Bitcoin. However, Pieter disagrees, stating that what units will be called colloquially is not something developers will determine. While it may well be that people in some geographic or language area will end up calling 1e-06 BTC "bits", Pieter thinks they need a more distinctive name than "bit". He argues that having colloquial names is fine, but "US dollar" or "euro" are far less ambiguous than "bit".</summary>
