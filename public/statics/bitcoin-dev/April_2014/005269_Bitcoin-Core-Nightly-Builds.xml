    <summary>The Bitcoin Core developers are planning to release v0.9.2 with mostly bug-fix, cleanup, and translation updates in a few weeks. Even non-developers can help in testing the master branch through unofficial nightly builds, which will aid in finding bugs and polishing things up faster. Translators can also use the latest code to see what strings need to be translated as they approach the next stable release. For more details, visit the provided link to the BitcoinTalk forum where this information was announced by Warren Togami.</summary>
