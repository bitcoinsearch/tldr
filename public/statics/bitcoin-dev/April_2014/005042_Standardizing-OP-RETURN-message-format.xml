    <summary>Maciej Trebacz proposed a process BIP to standardize OP_RETURN transactions for better interoperability between services. He suggested a common, extensible protocol that can be used by anyone. The generic format would be like this: OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA[length] {2-byte message type} {data}. He further proposed a list of message types that can be parsed by everyone because the format is open. However, it was suggested not to make it easier for third-parties to determine what the OP_RETURN messages are for as it might lead to censorship. Additionally, it was recommended not to restrict oneself to OP_RETURN as it is not certain that it will survive in its present form.</summary>
