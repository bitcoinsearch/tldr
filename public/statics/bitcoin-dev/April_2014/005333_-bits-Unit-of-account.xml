    <summary>Tamas Blummer, in response to a message from Un Ix, suggests that "xbit" would be a suitable unit for everyday use while "XBT" would serve as the ISO standard. In his opinion, the use of "XBT" as a synonym for BTC is not yet established until it is used by major financial news provider Bloomberg. However, Un Ix raises concerns that people may confuse "xbit" and "XBT" as referring to the same unit of measure due to their similarity in spelling.</summary>
