    <summary>In an email conversation, Jorge Timón and Gregory Maxwell discussed the definition of "honest miners" and how they prevent double-spending. Maxwell argued that miners do not prevent double-spending by proof of work but ignore it instead. He also disagreed with Timón's definition of honesty in Bitcoin as being based on first-seen transactions. Maxwell believed that if all miners were willing to double-spend for a fee, then Bitcoin would fail because paying miners to rewrite the chain at will would render it useless. He explained that even well-buried transactions could be profitably double-spent, making the current algorithm imperfect but workable in achieving the actual goal of preventing double-spends.</summary>
