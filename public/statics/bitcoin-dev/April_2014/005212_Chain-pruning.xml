    <summary>It has been suggested that forming blocks into "superblocks" that are chained together would allow participants with limited resources to serve full portions of the blockchain, rather than limited pieces. However, the main problem with this proposal is that the block chain mostly consists of random bytes (hashes, keys) which do not compress well enough to change the fundamental physics. Mike Hearn has suggested that in a hypothetical future where the chain is truly gigantic, it could be stored on tape and spooled off at high speed through direct DMA from tape drive to NIC. However, this is not currently feasible.</summary>
