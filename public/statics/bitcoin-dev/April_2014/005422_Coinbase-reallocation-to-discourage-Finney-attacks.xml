    <summary>In an email thread discussing a technical proposal on distributed consensus algorithms, Mike Hearn requests that the conversation stay focused on the topic at hand. In response, an email recipient accuses Hearn of being reckless and dismissive of the real-life implications his work may have for people. The email recipient also expresses frustration with what they see as a lack of transparency in the conversation. The email ends with a reminder to use email encryption to protect online privacy.</summary>
