    <summary>In an email conversation on April 21, 2014, Pieter, a developer, expressed his opinion on the colloquial usage of units in the context of Bitcoin. He stated that what units will be called colloquially is not something that developers will determine, as it varies depending on language and culture. He also mentioned that he thinks using "bits" as the official name in software would be strange and potentially confusing. Pieter suggested that a more distinctive name is needed for the 1e-06 BTC unit. He used the example of calling dollars "bucks" in bank software to illustrate his point.</summary>
