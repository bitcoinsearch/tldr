    <summary>Bitcoin Core 0.9.2 is soon to have a feature freeze on May 13th, 2014, and native non-English speakers are encouraged to join Transifex to clean up translations in all languages for both Bitcoin and Litecoin. Volunteers can try nightly builds of Bitcoin Core as it heads towards 0.9.2, but it is not recommended for their production wallet. Joining Transifex as a translator and adding an account to the language is also necessary. By joining the Translator mailing list, volunteers will receive announcements when translations are needed for Bitcoin, as well as notifications if other Bitcoin Project things in Transifex need translations.</summary>
