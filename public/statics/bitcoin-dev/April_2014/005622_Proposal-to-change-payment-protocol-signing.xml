    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a developer of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), has called for clarification on how to sign payment requests in BIP70. There is currently a discussion on Github regarding the issue of what to do with the signature field before signing. The current code sets the signature to an empty string, but Andresen believes this is a mistake and should instead clear the signature field so that it is not serialized at all. Andresen is seeking input from those who have implemented the payment protocol in order to change the spec and reference implementation while BIP70 is still in draft status. He notes that this type of mistake is why BIPs take time before being declared as "Final."</summary>
