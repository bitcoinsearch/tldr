    <summary>Several wallet developers have discussed and agreed on the standardization of the structure for fulfilling their requirements. The developers include myTrezor, Electrum, Multibit, Wallet32, and others who are willing to adapt once anything is standardized. The discussion has been closed, and the paths will be implemented into their software. In a related conversation, slush mentioned that there's no need to use different BIP32 roots for different altcoins, and one xpub should suffice for Bitcoin/Testnet/Litecoin at once. By having the "cointype" distinction in the bip32 path itself, the privacy issue of reusing the same pubkey across blockchains is prevented. However, Pieter Wuille did not understand what gain this separation would provide.</summary>
