    <summary>During a discussion on Bitcoin's registration as a vendor, Mike Hearn expressed doubts that it would work since Bitcoin is not a vendor. However, according to RFC 6838, the Bitcoin Foundation or Gavin himself could register a vendor tree for Bitcoin. If the foundation were to register, obtaining the subtree named vdn.bitcoin would be unproblematic. Despite this, there was doubt over whether time should be spent on the matter since the chances of a string collision are low. The current mime types were deemed sufficient. Ultimately, registering as a vendor appeared to be more about following proper procedures than anything else.</summary>
