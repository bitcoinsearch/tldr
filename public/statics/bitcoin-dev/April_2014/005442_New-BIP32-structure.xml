    <summary>In an email conversation on April 23, 2014, Tamas Blummer and Luke-Jr discussed the functionality of bitcoin wallets. Luke-Jr stated that any wallet would be able to import all coins but it would not use any account other than 0. He explained that once the UTXOs are in the wallet, they are no longer associated with the address or any details of how they were received. However, Blummer disagreed with this statement stating that the wallet would need to know how it got the UTXO in order to spend it. To this, Luke-Jr countered that the wallet would only require the scriptPubKey and secret(s) to satisfy it, and not necessarily how it got the UTXO.</summary>
