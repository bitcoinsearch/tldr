    <summary>A user named Oliver Egginger reported that bitcoin-qt produces an unnecessary alert on many systems, which says "URGENT: Upgrade required". This alert is frightening for normal users and it motivates people to try harmful workarounds. Egginger suggested turning off this message if possible. Patrick replied to the mailing list, saying that the alert system filters based on the client's version number. The Ubuntu bitcoin ppa is dynamically linked to openssl, unlike the binaries available from bitcoin.org. He also mentioned that there is no way currently to notify only 0.9.0 w/ static linking without also notifying 0.9.0 w/ dynamic linking.Jameson added to the conversation by informing everyone that Matt just pushed out new builds to the Ubuntu PPA. Therefore, he believed that this issue should resolve itself shortly. The email thread ends with two links to learn graph databases and the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
