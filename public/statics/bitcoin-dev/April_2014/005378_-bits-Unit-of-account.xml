    <summary>In a discussion about the use of "bits" as a unit of account in Bitcoin, Chris Pacia suggested that most people don't use the term "bit" on a daily basis except to refer to "a little bit of." However, Wladimir disagreed and said that this is an anglocentric way of thinking. In the Netherlands, "bit" refers to something you put in a horse's mouth and is also used as an imported word in the information sense, but not for money. The conversation then ended with an advertisement for a free book download about graph databases.</summary>
