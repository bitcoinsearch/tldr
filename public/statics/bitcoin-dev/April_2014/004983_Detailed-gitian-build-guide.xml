    <summary>Wladimir is working on a guide to help people install and set up a Debian VM for gitian building. This guide can be used on any operating system that has VirtualBox. The hope is that this will make it easier for people to get started with gitian builds. The rendered version of the guide can be found at https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/blob/2014_04_debian_gitian_build_doc/doc/gitian-building.md. Comments and patches are welcome, and if there are any problems encountered while following the guide, users are encouraged to let Wladimir know.</summary>
