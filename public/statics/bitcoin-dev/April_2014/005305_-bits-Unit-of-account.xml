    <summary>In an email thread, Mike Caldwell expressed his opinion that the potential overload or conflict of the term "bit" is not a significant issue for the general population. Despite searching for alternative names like "naka" and "toshi," he found none satisfactory. He then considered using "credit," which is already established in video games and sci-fi literature, making it familiar to people. Another option was "cubit" or "crebit," but the latter has dual meanings of both credit and debit. A Wikipedia list of fictional currencies was also provided for consideration.</summary>
