    <summary>In an email exchange between Wladimir and devrandom, the former provides instructions on how to create a basic virtual machine that can be used for gitian builds. It is suggested that automation could be achieved using vmbuilder and/or vagrant, but the purpose of the provided steps is to provide an exact guide that can be followed by anyone without requiring scripting languages. While it may be possible to automate some portions of the process, Wladimir hopes that Gitian itself will become easier to use over time, thereby reducing the number of steps required in the first place.</summary>
