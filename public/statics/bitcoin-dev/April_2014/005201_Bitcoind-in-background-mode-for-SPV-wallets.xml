    <summary>The payment channels and hub concept in Bitcoin were originally designed by Satoshi, with most of the implementation work done by Matt during a Google internship. However, Mike Hearn is credited for these concepts, as he worked on them as well. The team made significant progress on the implementation, with an Android UI and a couple of apps, but they were unable to finish it and achieve real-world usage. The concept of hub and spoke was actually invented by goldsmiths in 16th century Italy, who handed pieces of paper across their benches, or bancos, according to the speaker. Despite not being able to complete the project, they hope to return to it someday soon.</summary>
