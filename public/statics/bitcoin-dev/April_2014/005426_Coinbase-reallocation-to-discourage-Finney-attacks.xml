    <summary>The email conversation that took place in 2014 on the Bitcoin-development mailing list was about a proposed change in the way miners can orphan a block. The discussion revolved around the question of whether it is better to orphan an entire block, causing distress to users, or just cause distress to the evil miner. One member of the group stated that having an open discussion and exploring all possibilities before implementing a change is important. However, another member of the group accused those in favor of the change of reckless endangerment and not taking into consideration the real-life implications of their actions. He urged for transparency and said that what they were doing had significant consequences for many people. The thread ended with a reminder to keep the discussion focused on the original proposal and for everyone to be civil in their discourse.</summary>
