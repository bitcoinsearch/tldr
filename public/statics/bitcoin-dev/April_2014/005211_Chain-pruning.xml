    <summary>The block chain is mostly random bytes which makes it difficult to compress. While it does compress a bit, it is not enough to change the fundamental physics. However, the entire chain doesn't have to be stored on expensive rotating platters. In the future, it could potentially be stored on tape and spooled off at high speed. This would require a direct DMA from tape drive to NIC.</summary>
