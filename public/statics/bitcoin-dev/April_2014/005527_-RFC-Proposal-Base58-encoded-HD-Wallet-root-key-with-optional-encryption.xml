    <summary>The Bitcoin community has updated its specification to front-load all the key pre-stretching, a suggestion made by Gmaxwell. The user's password will now be protected by 10,000 rounds of salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, as well as the main KDF. This ranges from scrypt 2^14/8/8 to scrypt 2^18/16/16 and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 2^16 to 2^21. The update is designed to allow more powerful devices such as laptops and mobile phones to do all the key-stretching on their own, while weaker devices with access to another device with more computing power can safely export the rest of the process to that device.</summary>
