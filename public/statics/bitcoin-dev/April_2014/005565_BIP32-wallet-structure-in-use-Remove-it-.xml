    <summary>On Github, a comment was made about the BIP43 pull request regarding adding a "purpose" of 0' which would correspond to the BIP32 recommended tree structure for a single account wallet. This will allow for backwards compatibility and interoperability for existing single account BIP32 implementations. However, it would require a new BIP and wouldn't follow the BIP43 recommendation unless BIP0 is obtained.Mike Hearn responded to this by questioning how popular cloning wallets between devices will be in the future. He believes that people may want to use different UIs to access the same wallets, and sharing key trees could be part of that. However, full-blown wallet metadata sync would also be needed, resulting in a complex compatibility matrix.</summary>
