    <summary>In a message dated April 7, 2014, Mike Hearn discussed the primary resources needed for running a full node in Bitcoin. While disk space and bandwidth are important, the bottleneck is actually IOPS. Many casual users do not have spare machines to dedicate to running a full node, nor is it acceptable for them to be unable to use their device for other tasks while bootstrapping the node. The message also includes a PGP signature and an attachment containing application/pgp-keys. Finally, the message encourages supporting online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and provides a link to learn more about it.</summary>
