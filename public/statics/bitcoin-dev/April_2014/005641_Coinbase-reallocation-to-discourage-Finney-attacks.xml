    <summary>In an email thread, Mike Hearn wrote about how every time miners and nodes ignore a block that creates &gt;formula() coins, it's a majority vote on a controversial political matter. He also added that rejecting a block at validation is very different from reinterpreting a block that has already passed validation. Nodes ignoring a block that creates &gt;formula() coins is rejection at block validation, which is the protocol working as intended. Meanwhile, nodes reinterpreting a block that has already passed validation is almost the polar opposite of this, as they're ignoring the protocol and making up their own meaning for stuff. This is dangerous because it undermines Bitcoin's validation and its proof-of-work (PoW).</summary>
