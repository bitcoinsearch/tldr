    <summary>Running a private server involves various processes like listening to the p2p network for incoming transactions, validating them and organizing mempool, performing transaction selection, and relaying blocks to auditors. These processes are not tested in a reindex. However, a reindex can give an optimistic upper bound if one wants to measure validation performance. If someone wants to measure the number of peak tps that could be processed without taking block sides or network latency into account, they can simply reindex or replay the chain. This process has been done many times before according to Mike Hearn who asked this question on April 17th, 2014.</summary>
