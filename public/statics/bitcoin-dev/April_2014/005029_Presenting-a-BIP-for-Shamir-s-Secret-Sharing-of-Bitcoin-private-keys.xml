    <summary>In an email exchange on April 4, 2014 between Gregory Maxwell and Matt Whitlock, the former expressed concern over private key secret sharing scheme not being compatible with threshold ECDSA. To this, Whitlock raised concerns regarding supporting secrets of sizes other than 256 bits, citing a likely use case for decomposing BIP32 master seeds which could be up to 512 bits in size. Maxwell suggested that the computation should be done over a small field for computational efficiency and implementation simplicity reasons if no homomorphic function is used and the data split up. If this route is taken instead of encoding BIP32 master keys, it would be prudent to encode the encryption optional version, and Friedenbach's error-correcting capable scheme could be used for a new armored private key format. However, Maxwell also noted that it would be nicer if a decoding scheme that supported list decoding without increasing the complexity of basic implementation could be found.</summary>
