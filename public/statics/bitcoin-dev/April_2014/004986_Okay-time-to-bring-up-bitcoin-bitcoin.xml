    <summary>In this email exchange, Kevin shares a link to his fork of Bitcoin core on GitHub and invites feedback on it. Jeff Garzik criticizes the choice of URL, calling it a "phishing attempt" that "no one should visit." Laszlo Hanyecz questions whether the site serves up exploits selectively, with whoever is the target getting something special. Kevin defends his project as serious and well-intentioned, and expresses his belief in Bitcoin. The email thread includes links to various mailing lists related to Bitcoin development.</summary>
