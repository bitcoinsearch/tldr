    <summary>The headers first loading enables the node to run Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) from the beginning and it can become a full node by time, as per the newest versions of Bits Of Proof (BOP). However, pruning disqualifies the node as a source for bootstrapping another full node. Mike Hearn expressed concern about the high cost of bandwidth for downloading and validating the entire blockchain from scratch. He suggested that implementing headers-first would reduce redundant downloading and network-wide transmission traffic, while implementing chain pruning would allow people to control upload bandwidth consumption by reducing the amount of disk storage they allow. Meanwhile, Hearn's PayFile project aimed to address these problems.</summary>
