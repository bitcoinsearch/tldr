    <summary>The discussion revolves around the idea of cloning wallets between devices and its potential popularity in the future. Currently, there is no provision for sharing a wallet between different platforms like Hive, blockchain.info, and Bitcoin Wallet for Android. Users have to choose one or manually split their funds. However, many people would prefer using different UIs to access the same wallets, which can be achieved by sharing key trees and full-blown wallet metadata sync. As a result, a complex compatibility matrix may emerge, but it may be unavoidable.</summary>
