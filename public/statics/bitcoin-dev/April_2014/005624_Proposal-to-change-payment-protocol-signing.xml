    <summary>The argument is about the implementation of the payment protocol in several wallets, including BitPay and Coinbase. The author argues that setting an empty byte array is fine and changing such a basic thing at this point would cause chaos for early adopters, punishing them instead of rewarding them. They believe that accepting BIP 70 and moving on would be the best course of action. The adoption of the payment protocol is seen as vulnerable at this stage and any changes could seriously hurt it.</summary>
