    <summary>In 2014, the Bitnodes project updated their counting algorithm to provide better accuracy. Prior to the update, the project was reporting more than 100,000 nodes, but this number was a mostly useless metric that only counted the number of distinct addr messages in the network, which contained a lot of junk. The project also reported an actual connectable node count before the update, and it has remained consistent with the numbers used in headlines after some tweaking.</summary>
