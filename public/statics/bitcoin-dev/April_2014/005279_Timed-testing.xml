    <summary>In an email exchange on April 17th, 2014, Mike Hearn asked how to measure validation performance, specifically the number of peak transactions per second (TPS) that could be processed. It was suggested that reindexing and replaying the chain would provide an accurate measurement, which had been done many times before. The timedtest mode was considered unnecessary, except for the blocktime parameter defaulting to zero.  ChainParams' bool MineBlocksOnDemand() may be refactored into a parameter, possibly genproclimit, allowing periodic block generation and generation on demand to use the same regtest mode. A new mode would only make sense if the -private mode is useful enough for network attack simulations. However, this remains an open question.</summary>
