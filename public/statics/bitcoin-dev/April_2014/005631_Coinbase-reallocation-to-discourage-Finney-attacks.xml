    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and other parties, the topic of hashpower control in Bitcoin was discussed. Hearn stated that if the majority of hashpower is controlled by attackers, then Bitcoin is already doomed and nothing can be done at that point. However, others argued that these parties may not consider themselves attackers and instead see someone using hashpower to reassign coins as the attacker. They believe it's morally justified and a pragmatic response to reassign their own coins instead. Hearn urged for a discussion without bombastic language and generalizations to avoid definitional arguments.</summary>
