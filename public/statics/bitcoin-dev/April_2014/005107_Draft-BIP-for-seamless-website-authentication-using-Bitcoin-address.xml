    <summary>In an email thread from April 2014, Troy Benjegerdes proposes using a Bitcoin address as a persistent identity key, which he believes could make Bitcoin a "killer app" for widespread use. Ricardo Filipe agrees with this idea but wonders if a multisig seed would work instead. Eric Martindale responds to the thread, cautioning that implementing such a proposal could have significant implications for the economics of cryptofinance and suggesting that an altcoin explore the idea before changing the properties of the already precarious Bitcoin system. Overall, the discussion highlights both the potential benefits and risks of using a Bitcoin address as a persistent identity key.</summary>
