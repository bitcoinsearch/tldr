    <summary>In an email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Gregory Maxwell, the topic of whether or not SSS (Secret Sharing Scheme) should contain a specific flag for testnet was discussed. It was agreed that neither SSS nor BIP32 need such a flag since they are not addresses to send to. Maxwell noted that testnet is not normally addressed in BIPs, except for soft fork BIPs with compressed deployment schedules on testnet. For address specification, a version byte is used, and there is a common encoding for version bytes that flags the network ID in the byte.</summary>
