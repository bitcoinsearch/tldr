    <summary>The discussion in this email thread revolves around whether or not to continue supporting Windows XP as a platform for Bitcoin Core. Chris Williams argues that if the platform is supported, test passes must be run against it and bugs reported by users must be addressed, making it a test and support issue rather than a security issue. However, he notes that it doesn't make sense to support an OS platform that Microsoft no longer supports themselves. Mark Friedenbach disagrees, stating that it's safe to run Bitcoin Core as a full node on XP and that only the wallet functionality should be approached with caution. He believes that the number of people running XP, possessing systems powerful enough to run Bitcoin Core, and using the wallet functionality is small enough to not warrant discontinuing support altogether. The discussion ends with Kevin suggesting that Bitcoin simply stop supporting XP entirely.</summary>
