    <summary>On April 1st, 2014, Pieter Wuille proposed a draft BIP to turn Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency. He believed that the current subsidy schedule could not be accepted anymore. Matt Corallo suggested redesigning the whole system with a hard fork instead of a soft fork, as this would force the whole community and not just a few miners to decide. However, he questioned whether the community could reach an agreement in such a short timeframe. The proposal was met with controversy, but Wuille considered it a worthwhile idea to explore. Dogecoin had already shown how easy such changes were to implement. More information on the proposal can be found at the link provided by Wuille.</summary>
