    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd discussed the implementation of oracles in transactions. The use of EC public points was suggested as superior to hash-locked transactions for oracles, as they allow for the oracle to prove ownership by signing a challenge message and can be used to blind what purposes the oracle is being used for from the oracle itself. Rather than creating more format-specific types for transactions, Maxwell proposed a BIP to examine the possibility of removing the IsStandard() rules. These rules were implemented to mitigate transaction mutability and reduce potential scripting bugs, but with the introduction of Pieter Wuille's proposed soft-fork to prevent mutability, the value of IsStandard() has decreased. Future soft-forks will most likely involve incrementing the transaction version number or redefining OP_NOPx opcodes. Sigops should also be taken into account when calculating fees, and Luke-Jr's accept non-standard patch has code to do this already. The links to the relevant discussions and proposals were included in the email.</summary>
