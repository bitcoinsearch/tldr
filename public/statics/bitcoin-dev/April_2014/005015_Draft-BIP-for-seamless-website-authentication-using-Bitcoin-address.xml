    <summary>The author of this message argues that writing a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to encourage different wallet authors to write code for a new scheme is not the most effective way to gain traction. Instead, the author suggests proposing bounties for each wallet to support the protocol natively. The TREZOR team is mentioned as an example of a wallet provider that would need to support the new protocol for it to be widely adopted. The use of client certificates is proposed as an alternative to using a Bitcoin address for identification. Client certificates leave no trace in the blockchain and are widely supported by browsers and web servers. However, there are issues with their use, such as the fact that people prefer passwords and the UI for managing client certs in browsers is poor. Cross-device sync is also problematic. Despite these issues, the author believes that adding a simple auth protocol to a wallet will encourage people to use it at no cost. The benefits of revocation with certificates and central authority are also noted.</summary>
