    <summary>In an email sent on 8th April 2014, Angel Leon asked about uTP and its ability to help improve network performance. In response, it was suggested that users could try configuring their routers correctly, as this can significantly improve performance. The only time Bitcoind was noticed saturating the upstream link was during SCP transfers, which were stalled behind Bitcoind due to router interpretation of the "maximize throughput" flag. However, most other activities such as email, web browsing, instant messaging, and SSH showed no degradation despite Bitcoind activity. It was recommended to move the packet queue from the cable modem into the router for better packet priority and reordering decisions. Finally, it was stated that uTP reinvents the wheel and does so in userspace, where the overhead is greater. Proper QoS was deemed sufficient and rendered uTP unnecessary.</summary>
