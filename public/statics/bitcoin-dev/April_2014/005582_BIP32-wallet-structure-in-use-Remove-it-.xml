    <summary>In an email conversation between Pavol Rusnak and Tier Nolan on April 26, 2014, the topic of importing an unknown wallet was discussed. Tier Nolan suggested having a defined way to import such wallets, but Pavol Rusnak dismissed it as impossible due to the lack of knowledge about the wallet's structure. The discussion went further to include the difficulty of defining things like a gap limit in multisig P2SH usage without knowing some metadata.However, Pieter, who was part of the conversation, proposed a solution by defining something like "BIP44 import-compatible". This means that even though the application may not support all BIP44 features, it guarantees not losing any funds when imported. Similar approaches could also be used for other purpose types.</summary>
