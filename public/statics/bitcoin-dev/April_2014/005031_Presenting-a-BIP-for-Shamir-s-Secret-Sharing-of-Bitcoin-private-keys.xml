    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Matt Whitlock on April 4, 2014, Maxwell proposed using the binary extension field of GF(2^8) for secret sharing and data integrity applications. Whitlock questioned the decision due to its complexity and suggested that big-integer operations may be more practical. However, Maxwell argued that implementing a complex system with many individually testable parts is easier than implementing a single complex part. Maxwell's implementation of his BIP is in C++ and uses the GMP library for big-integer arithmetic. Whitlock asked if there was a use case for byte-wise operations rather than big-integer operations, but Maxwell did not provide a specific example.</summary>
