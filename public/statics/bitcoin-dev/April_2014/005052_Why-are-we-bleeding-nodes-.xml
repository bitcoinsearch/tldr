    <summary>Jameson Lopp expressed his concern about the consistent dropping of nodes in Bitcoin. He stated that more nodes are better, but it is difficult to determine how many nodes are needed without more information. Lopp shared his thoughts on the matter in a post he made last month. In response to this, Mike Hearn shared that at the start of February, there were 10,000 bitcoin nodes, and now there are only 8,500 and still falling. However, Pieter, who has a network crawler, hasn't seen any significant drop in nodes, stating that around 6,000 "well reachable nodes" are currently present, which is the highest number he has ever seen. In his opinion, the number of full nodes doesn't matter as long as it satisfies demand by other nodes. The real concern should be how hard it is to run one and if someone is interested in verifying that no one is cheating on the network, can they do it without significant investment?</summary>
