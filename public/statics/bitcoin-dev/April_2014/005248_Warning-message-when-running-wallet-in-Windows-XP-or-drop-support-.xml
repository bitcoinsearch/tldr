    <summary>As per a warning issued by a bank, it is not advisable to use Windows XP for internet banking. This raises concerns about the security of running a wallet on Windows XP, as it may not be secure enough to protect keys. The options include warning users and allowing them to continue, or redirecting them to a message on bitcoin.org about the dangers of using Windows XP (as Microsoft has ended its support for the operating system). However, dropping XP support completely could lead to a loss of nodes on the network, especially in countries like China and Russia where many computers still run XP. Maintainers of other wallet software must also decide whether to drop XP support and from when.</summary>
