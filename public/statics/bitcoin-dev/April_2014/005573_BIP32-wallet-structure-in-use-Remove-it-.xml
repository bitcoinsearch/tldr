    <summary>In an email conversation between Tamas Blummer and Tier Nolan, they discuss the possibility of discovering any funds associated with a seed. Blummer suggests that this is possible given set limits including gap of address use, depth of hierarchy, and gap in use of parallel branches. Nolan suggests having a defined way to import an unknown wallet and defining gap space and search ordering. They agree that given a blockchain and a root seed, it should be possible to find all the addresses for that root seed regardless of the wallet hierarchy used.</summary>
