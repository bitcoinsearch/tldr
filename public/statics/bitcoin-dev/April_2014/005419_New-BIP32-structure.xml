    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 64, which defines the hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet structure, there was debate over using a seed or master node as the starting point for serialization. While storing the seed is smaller, it removes flexibility in serialization and deserialization and limits compatibility with other altcoins. In addition, bip-32 serialization does not have a way of adding meta data to differentiate between different coins. The default gap limit of 20 for users was deemed too low, as merchants could easily send 20 addresses in a row to customers without any resulting purchases. Increasing the gap limit would only result in a small extra cost in this case.</summary>
