    <summary>The discussion revolves around the resource requirements and associated costs of running a full node for Bitcoin. One user reports that their node, based in Dallas, TX, has 240 connections and is using a little under 4 Mbps in bandwidth. However, according to their hosting provider's report, they are at 11.85 Mbps for the week, using 95th percentile billing. The report also includes the user's other servers. Another user argues that running a full node consumes a significant amount of data traffic, which can be costly. In the past 30 days, their node received 36.8 GB of data and sent 456.5 GB of data, costing them about $90 last month for bandwidth alone. Another user claims that the resource requirements of a full node are not beyond the capabilities of casual users. They argue that currently, running a full node consumes about $1 in disk space (non-recurring) and costs a couple of cents in power per month. However, the first user argues that moving half-terabyte data around in a month will not be cheap. The discussion highlights the importance of considering the costs associated with running a full node for Bitcoin.</summary>
