    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik on April 8, 2014, they discussed the issue of users not installing plugins. Jeff warned against making generalizations as it depends on the product's value. However, he noted that based on personal observations and data from Mozilla and other browsers, most users do not install plugins except for Flash. He also clarified that Google Earth is not a plugin. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
