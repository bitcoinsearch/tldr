    <summary>In an email conversation between Pavol Rusnak and Luke-Jr on April 23, 2014, the topic of implementing BIP 64 was discussed. When asked why clients needed to use the features in BIP 64, Luke-Jr suggested that Electrum could simply use account 0 for everything. However, Andreas had previously stated that either the BIP should be implemented fully or not at all. Rusnak agreed with this sentiment and added that following Luke-Jr's suggestion would not align with the principle of least surprise. If a user imported a BIP 64 compatible wallet into Electrum, which claimed to be BIP 64 compatible but only implemented a subset of the spec, the user would only see a fraction of their coins and be puzzled. Luke-Jr responded by stating that any wallet should import all coins just fine, but it would only use account 0.</summary>
