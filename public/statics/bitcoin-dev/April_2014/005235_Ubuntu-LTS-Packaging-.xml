    <summary>In an email exchange on April 12, 2014 at 2:26:07 PM, Oliver Egginger inquired about updates regarding a LiveCD for hot/cold wallet management on Ubuntu LTS basis. He provided a link to the Bitcoin Launchpad page and mentioned that he decided to maintain his own repository for the project due to the need for timely updates, particularly for critical vulnerabilities. However, Luke clarified that the mailing list is for development purposes only and suggested that the latest relevant version for packaging is 0.9.0, which can be found in the PPA that Oliver linked.</summary>
