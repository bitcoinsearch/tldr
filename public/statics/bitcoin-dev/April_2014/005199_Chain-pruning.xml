    <summary>The discussion changes to chain pruning, with the idea that it is more practical to specify blocks to keep in terms of megabytes rather than time, as nodes have a constraint on resources. The proposal suggests a new addr field to specify how many blocks from the chain head are stored, and then connecting to nodes to see if their chain head minus the number of blocks stored is higher than the current chain height. If so, a getaddr would be done to find nodes storing far enough back.</summary>
