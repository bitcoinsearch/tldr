    <summary>In an email exchange on April 22, 2014, Tamas Blummer and an unnamed recipient discuss the inclusion of a specific flag for testnet in SSS (Secret Sharing Scheme) and BIP32. The recipient agrees with Blummer that such flags are unnecessary since they are not used for sending addresses. They suggest that the convention so far has been to include a 'version' identifier to identify the purpose of the data, such as network meaning. It is noted that this is a generally reasonable custom.</summary>
