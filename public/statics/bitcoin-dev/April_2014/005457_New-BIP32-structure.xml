    <summary>In an email exchange between Pavol Rusnak and Luke-Jr on April 23, 2014, they discussed the issue of Bitcoin-qt still using independent addresses despite accounts being a bitcoind feature since before version 0.4. Luke-Jr mentioned that BIP 32 redefined "account" to mean "subwallet" instead of the traditional use of the term in Bitcoin, which caused confusion for users who could not see all their funds. He suggested that single-subwallet wallet software should have the user provide a subwallet number in addition to the seed. Pavol Rusnak reiterated his original complaint that users could be confused because they cannot see all their funds, but Luke-Jr argued that as long as the user knows he has money in different subwallets and has a way to specify which subwallet he is accessing, there should not be a problem.</summary>
