    <summary>Vitalik Buterin discussed the idea of a "punitive proof-of-stake algorithm" in an article on the Ethereum blog. However, this is not a new concept, as it was also mentioned during discussions about PPCoin when it was released in 2012 and described in Etlase2's Decrit design. Additionally, the author and Iddo have conducted research on pure proof-of-stake and found it to be feasible, but the unpublished work cannot be referred to at this time.</summary>
