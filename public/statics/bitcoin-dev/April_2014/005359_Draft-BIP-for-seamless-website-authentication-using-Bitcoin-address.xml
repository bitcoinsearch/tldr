    <title>Draft BIP for seamless website authentication using Bitcoin address</title>

    <summary>The development of BitID has made progress with a working wallet prototype based on Android Bitcoin Wallet. A short video demonstration is available for those interested in the user flow. By default, each new first auth request creates and saves a new address (SQRL-like), which could be based on BIP32 but works without it. This requires adding metadata to addresses as described in the link provided. The development also offers fields for decentralized 2FA as well as "pay as guest" checkout in conjunction with BIP70 payment request. In a discussion about client-side certificates, Jan Moller notes that safely storing and backing up secrets has been a challenge. He believes using bitcoin addresses for authentication may be confusing and potentially linking funds with identity is not ideal. He suggests using a mechanism similar to BIP32 for generating a parallel hierarchy for authentication purposes.</summary>
