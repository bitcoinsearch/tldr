    <summary>The email thread is discussing the need for air-gaps and zero-trust ecosystems to enhance security. The author suggests using real-time auditability, type 2/type 3 exchanges based on atomic-swap, trustless escrow, and mass production of trezors. Another issue being addressed is address substitution via an untrusted network/user and a weak site with 1 million lines of Swiss-cheese security app-store. The author recommends address authentication TOFU and suggests a simple native TOFU format like Alan Reiner's multiplier * base approach or something like the IBE address proposal. The author also suggests rebranding address as "invoice number" to prevent double payment of invoices. Finally, the discussion concludes with an exchange about whether XP with a Trezor would work fine and dropping XP support completely in the next major release.</summary>
