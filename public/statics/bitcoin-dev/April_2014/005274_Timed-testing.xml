    <summary>A new testing mode for Bitcoin has been implemented which produces blocks periodically and can be accessed on GitHub. The testing mode is useful for simulations such as running nodes with different mining policies or detecting performance bottlenecks by testing as many transactions that can be processed. However, it does not yet serve for hardfork or double-spend attack simulations without calculating any PoW, which would be another interesting feature for a new testing mode. The testing mode could be used to support chain races simulations by using a private mode that works like the timed mode in producing blocks. In this context, longer chains mean "more work." The question is how invasive this is to bitcoin's source code. Done properly, it could result in more readable code since the proof of work functionality needs to be properly encapsulated during the implementation process. A private mode could be pushed to the core or just the timed one and implement the private mode elsewhere.</summary>
