    <summary>The suggestion is to allow the user to select just one share, even though it may seem functionally equivalent to dispensing with the secret sharing scheme entirely. From an end-user perspective, having just one piece of paper to manage could be preferable. Allowing for M=1 would also reduce complexity in software and hardware by not needing to support multiple formats, import/export paths, and UI for different types of keys and seeds. This would provide more freedom of choice for the user.</summary>
