    <summary>In an email exchange on April 22, 2014, Tamas Blummer stated that Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are used by many chains and how alts are useful for experiments. He also mentioned that the notion of main and testnet is superseded by a wide choice of chains. However, there are not enough distinct bytes to allow for every altcoin and he believes that what they do is their own business and outside the scope of a BIP. Blummer further argued that if we were to apply the same argument to private keys as we do with altcoins, then why bother specifying a separate encoding for Bitcoin testnet private keys, since there are so many altcoins available.</summary>
