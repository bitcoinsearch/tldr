    <summary>In response to a proposal, Thomas V points out that the unit being discussed is 1e-6 Bitcoins or 100 satoshis. He emphasizes that it is meant for those who are not familiar with Bitcoin and its technology. The purpose of such a unit is to align with existing financial software and customs, as well as ISO standards for currency abbreviations. Tamas Blummer, from bitsofproof.com, suggests that 'bit' and 'XBT' meet the criteria, and asks for feedback on the suggested 'xbit' from his previous email.</summary>
