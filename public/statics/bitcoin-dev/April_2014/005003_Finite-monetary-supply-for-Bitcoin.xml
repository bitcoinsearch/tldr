    <summary>In an email exchange, Matt Whitlock pointed out to kjj that the creation date in BIP header has the wrong format and should be 01-04-2014 as per BIP 1. Kjj initially thought it was a joke but then realized that all BIPs use this format due to RFC 822 predating ISO 8601 by half a decade. Kjj suggested adopting a sensible date format but acknowledged that it would require updating scripts for half a dozen people at most. BIPs were based on Python PIPs which use a similar format but spell out the month like '1-Oct-2000'. However, they have two different date conventions within the header (one for the modified date, and one for the created date). Wladimir expressed his preference for standardizing on ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) dates and invited submissions of a pull against bips/bips that changes around the dates.</summary>
