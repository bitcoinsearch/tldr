    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Eric Lombrozo in 2014, they discussed the issue of moving beyond passwords and implementing a better security protocol for Bitcoin addresses. Hearn expressed his concern over the difficulty in getting users to adopt new security measures, even with a big team and lots of resources at Google. Lombrozo acknowledged the objections but mentioned having at least two enthusiastic wallets interested in implementing the protocol. They also discussed the idea of starting privately with a few wallets and services before formalizing the standard through a BIP.</summary>
