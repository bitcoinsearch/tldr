    <summary>Bitcoin-qt is producing an unnecessary alert on many systems which is causing fear among normal users. The message, "URGENT: Upgrade required" appears to be a false positive and is motivating people to use harmful workarounds. The stable channel seems to be affected the most. Launchpad.net has more information about this issue and how it's impacting the Bitcoin community. Oliver suggests that the message should be turned off if possible to prevent further panic and confusion.</summary>
