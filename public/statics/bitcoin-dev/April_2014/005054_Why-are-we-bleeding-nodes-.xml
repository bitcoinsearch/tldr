    <summary>Pieter Wuille and Jameson Lopp are discussing the importance of the number of full nodes in a network. Wuille believes that as long as there are enough full nodes to satisfy demand, then the actual number of full nodes doesn't matter. However, Lopp argues that without quantifying "demand," it's impossible to determine how many full nodes are needed. He suggests waiting until SPV clients start lagging or timing out due to their requests not being handled by the nodes is not a good plan. Lopp feels that not knowing the exact number of required full nodes can be irksome for an engineer.</summary>
