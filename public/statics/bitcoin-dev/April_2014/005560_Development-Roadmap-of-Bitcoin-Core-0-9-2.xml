    <summary>Tails 1.1, which is based on Wheezy, is set to release on June 10th. The release date was announced on the Tails contribute calendar. Wladimir, a member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list, asked when Tails would switch to a newer version of Qt. As Tails is Debian-based, it will switch to Wheezy/7.4, which has Qt 4.8 and is not problematic. The team is working on migration, as seen in their blueprint and Git repository. Warren Togami Jr. suggested that 4.7 or 4.8 should be the cut-off point for the old stable distributions on the desktop, since Qt 4.6 is ancient and is only used by Tails.</summary>
