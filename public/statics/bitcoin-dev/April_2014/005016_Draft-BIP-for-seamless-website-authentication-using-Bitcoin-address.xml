    <summary>The author's view is mainly about the user experience (UX) and the fact that everyone in Bitcoinland has a wallet. While acknowledging the importance of moving beyond passwords, the author cautions against underestimating the difficulty of changing user behavior. Drawing from personal experience working on Google accounts, the author notes that even convincing users to use their phone as a second factor was a significant challenge. Ultimately, the author believes that while finding a solution that is better than a password but just as convenient would be fantastic, Bitcoin addresses are unlikely to be such a solution.</summary>
