    <summary>The URL provided in the email seems to be a poor choice and appears to be a phishing attempt. The author of the email, Kevin, mentions that he has forked Bitcoin core and is working on a secure tax "mode" for Bitcoin using Autoit scripting language. He invites people to review his work which is available on http://www.githubb.com/bitcoin/bitcoin. Kevin seeks feedback on the project, both positive and negative. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, signs off on the email with his contact information at BitPay Inc.</summary>
