    <summary>In an email exchange between Luke-Jr and Pavol Rusnak in April 2014, Luke-Jr suggested that scanning chains as defined by the structure could be a possible way to implement BIP64. However, he also acknowledged that it wouldn't reduce complexity significantly. Pavol Rusnak raised concerns about the suggestion, stating that scanning for accounts and showing balances without allowing users to spend them didn't seem right to him. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. In addition, the email contained information about starting a social network using eXo Platform software.</summary>
