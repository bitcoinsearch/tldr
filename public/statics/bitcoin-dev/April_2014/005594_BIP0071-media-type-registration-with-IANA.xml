    <title>BIP0071 media type registration with IANA</title>

    <summary>In an email to a group of people, Ross expresses concern about the MIME types in BIP0071 not being IANA registered and unlikely to be accepted if submitted as is. He refers to the latest RFC on media type registration, which strictly restricts what can go in the default "application/" namespace and would require it to be an ISO standard or similar. Ross suggests that registering a Bitcoin vendor namespace with IANA and allocating MIME types such as "application/vnd.bitcoin.payment.request", "application/vnd.bitcoin.payment.payment", and "application/vnd.bitcoin.payment.ack" might be a solution. Ross asks for thoughts on this from the group.</summary>
