    <summary>Bitcoin developer, Mike Hearn, suggests using SSL client certificates for authentication instead of a Bitcoin address. However, Eric Larchevêque argues that using a Bitcoin address for authentication could greatly improve the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. He proposed a draft BIP description of an authentication protocol based on a user's Bitcoin public address that would prove to a service or application that they control a specific Bitcoin address by signing a challenge. The protocol aims to simplify sign-ups and logins to services and applications. Larchevêque believes that this authentication process will be more widely used if it is implemented by major wallets. He proposes that a standard way of using a HD wallet's deterministic seed to derive a key should be specified for the FIDO or SQRL systems once one of them gains critical mass and becomes successful.</summary>
