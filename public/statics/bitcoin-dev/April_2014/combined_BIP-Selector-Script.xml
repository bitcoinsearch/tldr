    <title>Combined summary - BIP - Selector Script</title>

    <summary>In April 2014, Tier Nolan proposed a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that allowed spenders to choose one of multiple standard scripts to use for spending the output. This proposal was required as part of the atomic cross-chain transfer protocol so that outputs could be retrieved if the process ends before being committed. The script allows multiple standard scripts to be included in the scriptPubKey and when redeeming the script, the spender indicates which of the standard scripts to use. However, Luke-Jr responded to the proposal stating that it looks reasonable from a brief skim over but does not define any use cases.In an email exchange on April 25th, 2014, Peter Todd warns that P2SH redeemScripts are limited to just 520 bytes and complex transactions may not be able to be encoded in P2SH at all. However, he notes that this is just a change to isStandard() rather than a protocol change and these transactions can already be mined into blocks. Additionally, the email contained an advertisement for eXo Platform, a Java-based open-source intranet software that could potentially be used for collaboration within a Bitcoin development team.The discussion between Luke-Jr and another individual revolves around the standardization of interoperability between software in Bitcoin. While each miner could theoretically decide their own inclusion rules, in practice most miners would accept transactions that are updated in the reference client. The malleability issue has been known for years, but it is possible to tweak the protocol to work with 3rd parties. There is ongoing discussion of a softfork to redo the Script language, which will take time and development before implementation. Luke-Jr also questions the assignment of BIP numbers and suggests keeping them numberless until assigned to avoid confusion when searching.In an email conversation, Tier Nolan and Luke Dashjr discussed cross-chain trading and its implications on interoperability between different software. Tier Nolan suggested that a BIP may not be necessary for cross chain systems unless transactions are accepted in all chains. Luke explained that BIPs do not force nodes to adopt any policy and are only meant to define standards for interoperability between software. A BIP for cross-chain trading could be useful in convincing nodes to relay the transactions. However, secure transfers require fixing the malleability issue, which is a separate issue and has been known for years. Although there is some ongoing discussion of a soft fork to redo the Script language entirely, it will take time and development before it can be seen in the wild. Finally, Luke advised against assigning numbers until they are officially assigned by the BIP editor to avoid confusion when people Google the real BIP 44 and 45.In April 2014, Tier Nolan raised a concern about the lack of use cases defined in a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). While the proposal mentioned that certain features were necessary for atomic cross-chain transfers, it did not explain how those features would be useful. Another BIP may have been needed to address this issue. However, the response to Nolan's comment clarified that the specification was simply unclear and that one use case would suffice. The proposed feature allowed spending to be controlled by the publication of information in another transaction, ensuring that transactions could only be completed atomically. A citation to a revision of the contracts page was suggested for further clarification.Overall, the discussions revolve around the standardization of interoperability between software in Bitcoin and the implementation of multi-P2SH. There is an ongoing discussion of a soft fork to redo the Script language entirely, but it will take significant time and development before it is seen in the wild. The proposed BIP allows the spender to choose one of multiple standard scripts to use for spending the output, which is required as part of the atomic cross-chain transfer protocol. However, there were concerns about the lack of use cases defined in the proposal. BIPs do not force nodes to adopt any policy and are only meant to define standards for interoperability between software.</summary>
