    <summary>It is suggested that existing SPV wallet apps should have instrumentation to report back to the home base about their running time, disk space/RAM usage, and hardware. It is believed that most SPV wallets are not left running permanently and are used on devices with limited battery life. As a result, it is unlikely that consumers will want to run full nodes. The author believes that it will never make sense to run full nodes on consumer hardware again. Instead, time should be spent optimizing so that it is more cost-effective for full node operators to run them on cheap virtualized servers.</summary>
