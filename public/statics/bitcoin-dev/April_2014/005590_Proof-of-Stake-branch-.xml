    <summary>Gmail is spamfoldering emails from Yahoo due to DMARC enforcement, making it incompatible with Sourceforge mailing lists. The two solutions are to not use Yahoo or stop using Sourceforge mailing list software. Yahooâ€™s policy forbids rewriting of mails sent from their service, which is similar to forbidding SSL MITM attacks for email. There are several ways to be compatible with this policy, but sf.net doesn't do any of them. Meanwhile, a technical discussion on Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin project thread will be established in the Project Development sub-forum of Bitcointalk. Jeffrey Paul asked if proof of stake blockchains are compatible with sidechain/two-way peg system invented by Greg. Any sidechains in such a model are cryptographically tied to the PoW system that Bitcoin's chain uses. Alternate decentralized consensus algorithms (proof of execution, proof of stake, et c) may not retain compatibility with Bitcoin in a two way peg model.</summary>
