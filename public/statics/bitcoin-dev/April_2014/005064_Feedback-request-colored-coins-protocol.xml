    <summary>In an email exchange between Flavien Charlon and Jorge Tim√≥n on April 7, 2014, the two discussed whether or not colored coins should be used to pad investments. Flavien argued that colored coins were overblown in importance, noting that they represent nothing more than a speculative floor owned by investors, not the company. He went on to explain that the cheapest a share can be is the price of the gold on which the stock certificate is printed, and if the gold is part of the capital of the company, it could be bought for a profit if the price of a share goes low enough. Jorge challenged Flavien's argument, comparing it to printing shares on gold plates, which he did not believe would make the gold "part of the capital of the company."</summary>
