    <summary>The discussion revolves around using a shared branch or separate branches for generating receiving addresses in a 2-of-2 multisig wallet. The issue with using one shared branch is that two cosigners could end up distributing the same address, which can be problematic. However, if each cosigner has their own unique seed and key hierarchy, then there is no shared branch. Instead, every address generated by either party is a 2-of-2 address using private seeds k1 and k2. To avoid the problem of conflicting receiving addresses, the proposal suggests using two separate branches that both phones will follow and watch. Each participant has a receiving line and change line, and they only distribute payment addresses from one such branch. The solution proposed involves having 2*N values for "b", so that each participant has their own branch that won't conflict with other devices. Nonetheless, all devices will still watch all 2*N branches to know the total balance of the wallet, and will use UTXOs from those branches when constructing spending transactions/proposals.</summary>
