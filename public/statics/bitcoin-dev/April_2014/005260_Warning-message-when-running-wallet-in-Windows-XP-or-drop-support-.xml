    <summary>When a user installs any software, it is important to check for the required system specifications such as RAM, disk space and processor. This ensures that the user has a good experience with the software and prevents issues with marginal machines. In a discussion about supporting Windows XP, Mark Friedenbach explains that they do not support any distribution and that it doesn't make sense to support an OS platform that the original vendor, Microsoft, no longer supports. Chris Williams adds that supporting XP would become a test and support issue rather than a security issue. Mark further states that it is safe to run Bitcoin Core as a full node on XP and that only a small intersection of people who are running XP, have systems powerful enough to run Bitcoin Core and use the wallet functionality.</summary>
