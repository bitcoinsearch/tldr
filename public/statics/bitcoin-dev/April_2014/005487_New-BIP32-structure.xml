    <summary>Thomas Voegtlin and Pieter, two Bitcoin developers, discussed the use of BIP 64 in clients like Electrum and Multibit. Thomas had asked why clients needed to use features in BIP 64 if Electrum did not want to use accounts. Pieter clarified that BIP 64 had a much stricter definition for accounts than BIP 32. In BIP 32, it is not well specified what accounts are used for, but in BIP 64, they are strictly used for subwallets and cannot be used by anything else.</summary>
