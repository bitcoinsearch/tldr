    <summary>A new version of GBT, called GBT 2.0, is being proposed with several wishlist items and ideas. These include extremely low bandwidth use through a binary protocol with compression support, a UDP-based transport protocol that sacrifices message order for lower latency, the ability to instruct miners on how to insert data in coinbase for cheaper proof-of-work auditing, always encrypted communication with optional authentication via CA/namecoin/URI, an incrementing "precommit id" to precommit settings without needing a new/custom coinbase, multiple clients sharing bandwidth on a LAN, conveying prevblock as block header for secure blockchain following, and a fee logic system that allows pools to claim coinbase distribution based on their needs while miners ensure subsidy and transaction fees add up to the required total. A dedicated mailing list has been created for interested parties to discuss these ideas before presenting them to the main development mailing list.</summary>
