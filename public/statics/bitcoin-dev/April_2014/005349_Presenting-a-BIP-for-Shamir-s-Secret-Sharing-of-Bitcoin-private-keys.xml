    <summary>In April 2014, Matt Whitlock received a suggestion from Jan MÃ¸ller regarding defining different prefixes for testnet keys/seeds. As a developer, Jan finds it useful to use the testnet every day and believes that having separate prefixes would help avoid mixing up keys meant for testnet and mainnet. Matt agreed with this point and promised to add some prefixes for testnet. The testnet encodings were added to GitHub by Matt on his btctool repository.</summary>
