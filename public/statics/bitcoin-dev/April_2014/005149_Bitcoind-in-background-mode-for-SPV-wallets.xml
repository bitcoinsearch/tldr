    <summary>Wladimir, a Bitcoin Core developer, has proposed the addition of an option to popular Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets. The feature would spin a bitcoind process in the background, increasing the full node level of security for users of SPV wallets. This would be beneficial as there has been a decrease in the number of full nodes running Bitcoin Core, which could be due to other wallets getting ahead in both features and usability. Wladimir suggests that many people might support the network by running a full node but do not want to go through the trouble of installing Bitcoin Core separately because it is also a wallet. To accommodate this "embedded" usage, Wladimir suggests bundling Stratum and allowing SPV wallets to ask Bitcoind to start it, connecting to it. By using Stratum, SPV clients might find it easier to use than creating a new API in Bitcoind, which already provides services relied upon by Stratum. It is noted that Stratum is not just for pools. The user experience would be transparent, with the wallet showing statistics about the node but not being dependent on it. Wladimir requests feedback on whether this idea sounds good and if Bitcoin Core can help accommodate the proposal. Specific interfaces, special builds, bindings, DLLs, etc., are suggested. The email ends with an advertisement for Jenkins Continuous Integration and a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
