    <summary>In an email thread dated April 7th, 2014, members of the Bitcoin community discussed the implementation of a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Nikita Schmidt questioned the choice of fields and suggested that big integer arithmetic would be necessary for base-58 encoding. Gregory Maxwell disagreed, citing an example of base-58 decoding which didn't require big integers. Matt Whitlock also agreed with Maxwell, adding that the same process could be used for encoding as well. He stated that there was no need to use big integers for this purpose.</summary>
