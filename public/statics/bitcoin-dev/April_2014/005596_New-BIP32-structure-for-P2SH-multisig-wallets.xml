    <summary>In the given context, there is a discussion about using a shared branch for everyone and how it could be a problem if two cosigners needed a new receiving address at the same time. However, the concept of a shared branch does not apply as each user/cosigner has their own unique seed and key hierarchy. Therefore, the issue mentioned would only arise if all co-signers shared the same seed, which is not the case in this scenario.</summary>
