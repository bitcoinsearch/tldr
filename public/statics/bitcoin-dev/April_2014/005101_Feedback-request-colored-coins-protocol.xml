    <summary>The author of the text is discussing the complexity of adding padding to colored coins, stating that it only requires a few extra lines of code. They argue against an alternative proposal of creating different denominations of colored coins for different share amounts, citing the practicality issue of sending fractional amounts. The author questions why one would prefer to push the complexity to higher levels and create inconvenience for users rather than simply adding a small amount of code to the color kernel. They conclude by stating they will not argue further on the topic.</summary>
