    <summary>There are various ways to obtain bitcoin without bootstrapping a full node, which eliminates the catch 22. However, to spend coins, transaction data is needed. Currently, people obtain transaction data by scanning the block chain. Obtaining transaction data without scanning the block chain means either someone is doing it for free or the transaction data is obtained directly from the person who sent the funds through the payment protocol. The latter would resolve the catch 22 but is still far from being a reality. These are the only ways to get the necessary transaction data, and any other method undermines the charge-for-the-p2p-network model.</summary>
