    <summary>In 2014, a discussion was held among Bitcoin developers regarding the security of Windows XP and its compatibility with Bitcoin wallets. Microsoft had stopped providing security patches for the operating system, leaving it vulnerable to remote exploits that would not be fixed. One developer noted that even banks were warning customers against using XP for online banking, indicating that it was no longer secure enough for such activities. The question arose whether Bitcoin wallet software should drop support for XP completely, as it could compromise the security of the network. However, there was concern that many computers, especially in China and Russia, still used XP and dropping support could cause the network to lose nodes. The discussion did not reach a definitive conclusion, but highlighted the need to consider the security implications of outdated technology.</summary>
