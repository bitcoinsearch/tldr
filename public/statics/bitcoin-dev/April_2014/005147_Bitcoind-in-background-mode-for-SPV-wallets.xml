    <summary>The decrease in the number of full nodes for Bitcoin Core wallet could be due to other wallets getting ahead in both features and usability. However, it is worrying that fewer people are running the Bitcoin Core wallet as it could lead to a weaker network. To address this issue, an option could be added to popular SPV wallets to spin a bitcoind process in the background to increase security. This would allow the user to have a local trusted node while still using the SPV wallet. Bitcoin Core may be able to help accommodate this embedded usage by providing specific interfaces, special builds, and bindings.</summary>
