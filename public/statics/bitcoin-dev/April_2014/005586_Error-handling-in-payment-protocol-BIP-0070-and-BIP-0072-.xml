    <summary>The PaymentRequests are restricted to 50,000 bytes and there seems to be no reason for payment messages to exceed that limit as per the statement. If anyone thinks otherwise, they can submit a pull request to the existing BIP. It is suggested that 50kb should be sufficient at present even though it would be good to have images and visuals in payment requests for better user interface in the future.</summary>
