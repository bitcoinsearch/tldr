    <summary>In an online conversation on April 23, 2014, Luke-Jr and Pavol Rusnak discussed the use of BIP 64 features in clients like Electrum. Pavol gave an example of how Electrum does not want to use accounts, leading Luke-Jr to question why clients need to use the features in BIP 64. However, Luke-Jr clarified that Electrum plans to have bip32 accounts while Multibit will not. In conclusion, it seems like Pavol was just using Electrum as an example and there is some discrepancy between Electrum and Multibit regarding their use of BIP 64 features.</summary>
