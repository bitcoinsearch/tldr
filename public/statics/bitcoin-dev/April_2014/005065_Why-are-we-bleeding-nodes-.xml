    <summary>In an email sent on April 7th, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed concern over the potential for Bitcoin to be "killed off" by those who refuse to use it properly. He noted that the general public does not distinguish between true Bitcoin users, who do not deposit with a third party, and those who do.Hearn believed that a Mt-Gox-scale incident was inevitable and that there were likely more hard lessons to come. However, he also saw some positive outcomes from such incidents, including malleability fixes, cleaning house at the foundation of Bitcoin, and increased public education.Despite the difficulties faced by Bitcoin, Hearn noted that more people now understand the distinction between true Bitcoin users and those who deposit with third parties. This increased understanding could help prevent future incidents and promote responsible use of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
