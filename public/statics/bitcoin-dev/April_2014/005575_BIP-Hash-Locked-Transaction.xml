    <summary>The idea of implementing a generic Policy interface that extends to StandardPolicy is being discussed. This could simplify the process of miners implementing their own policies in general. The proposal suggests that other policies such as WhitelistPolicy, ReplacebyFeeStandardPolicy, and ReplacebyFeeWhitelistPolicy could also be implemented through the generic interface.To achieve this, several functions such as script IsStandard, main IsStandardTx, and main AcceptToMemoryPool could become methods of Policy. By doing so, miners would have a simpler way of creating and implementing their own policies without having to start from scratch every time. Overall, this proposal of having a generic Policy interface could potentially streamline the process of implementing new policies within the mining community.</summary>
