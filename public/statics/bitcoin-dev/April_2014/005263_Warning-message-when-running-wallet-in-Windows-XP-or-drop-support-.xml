    <summary>A discussion was held on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the security of Windows XP and whether Bitcoin Core should detect when it is running on that system and warn users of the risks. Pieter Wuille stated that XP is not secure enough, and Microsoft has ended support for it. He suggested that Bitcoin Core should detect when the user is running on Windows XP and warn them of the risks. It was also noted that there is a similar issue with OS X 10.6, which has a less well-known end-of-life date. The warning was issued by Microsoft, and it is advised not to use such a system for protecting money. A link was provided to Microsoft's webpage regarding end-of-support help. Additionally, the email included a promotion for a free O'Reilly book on graph databases.</summary>
