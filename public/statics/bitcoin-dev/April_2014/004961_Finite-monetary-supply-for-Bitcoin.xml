    <summary>On April 1st, 2014, Pieter Wuille sent an email proposing a draft BIP with a proposal to turn Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency. In this email, he stated that he believed the current subsidy schedule could no longer be accepted and wanted to explore this worthwhile idea. The text of the proposal can be found on GitHub. However, the original context of this email is unrelated to the creation date in the BIP header having the wrong format.</summary>
