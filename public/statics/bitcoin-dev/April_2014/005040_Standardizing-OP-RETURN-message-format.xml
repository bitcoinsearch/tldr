    <summary>The author proposes to standardize OP_RETURN transactions by creating a common, extensible protocol that can be used by anyone. Currently, there are no guidelines for crafting these transactions, which leads to everyone doing whatever they believe is best for them. The proposed format would include a list of message types that can be parsed by everyone due to its open format. This will only work if it's made into an open standard, hence the BIP idea. The author has more ideas for these kinds of messages and asks if they can expect it to be included with other BIPs if they write it.</summary>
