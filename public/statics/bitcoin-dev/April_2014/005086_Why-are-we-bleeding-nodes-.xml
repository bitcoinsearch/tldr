    <summary>In an email conversation on April 7th, 2014, Tamas Blummer expressed concern about the potential for extreme load hot-spotting and resource usage caused by a binary archive bit for an archive node. Instead, he suggested extending the addr messages so that nodes can indicate a range of blocks they're serving, allowing all nodes to contribute fractionally according to their means. This would enable nodes to offer distributed storage without having to store the entire blockchain. Blummer noted that this kind of distributed storage is already needed for the most recent blocks to prevent extreme bandwidth load on archives. However, complicating matters is the fact that there is currently no room to signal arbitrary ranges.</summary>
