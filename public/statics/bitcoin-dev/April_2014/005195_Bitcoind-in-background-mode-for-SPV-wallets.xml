    <summary>In an email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Wladimir on April 10, 2014, the importance of serving headers by default but storing and serving full blocks configurable to ranges was discussed. Tamas noted his agreement with the idea, but acknowledged that it would require changes to the P2P protocol as there is currently no way for a node to signal that they store only part of the block chain. Additionally, clients would need to be modified to account for this change as they are under the assumption that every full node can send them every previous block. Wladimir asked what this would involve and if there had been any previous work towards this goal.</summary>
