    <summary>GBT 2.0 is a proposed new version with several wishlist items and ideas, including low bandwidth use through a binary protocol with compression support and a UDP-based transport protocol that sacrifices message order for lower latency. The proposed version also aims to instruct miners on how to insert data in coinbase for cheaper proof-of-work auditing, always encrypted communication with optional authentication via CA/namecoin/URI, an incrementing "precommit id" to precommit settings without needing a new/custom coinbase, multiple clients sharing bandwidth on a LAN, conveying prevblock as block header for secure blockchain following, and a fee logic system that allows pools to claim coinbase distribution based on their needs while miners ensure subsidy and transaction fees add up to the required total. To discuss these ideas before presenting them to the main development mailing list, a dedicated mailing list has been created for interested parties.</summary>
