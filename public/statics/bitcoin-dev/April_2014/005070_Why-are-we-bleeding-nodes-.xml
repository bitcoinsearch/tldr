    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Justus Ranvier discusses the increasing resource requirements of running a full node on the Bitcoin network. He notes that while this may be a problem for casual users, it is not inherently so, as most people do not engage in other forms of self-sufficiency such as growing their own food or making their own clothes. As for the current cost of running a full node, Ranvier estimates that it consumes about $1 in disk space and only costs a few cents in power per month. However, he also acknowledges that there are still challenges to overcome in terms of scaling and making the network more accessible to all users. The email thread includes a link to a cloud-based Jenkins Continuous Integration platform, which offers a solution for developers looking to automate their build, test, and deployment processes. Overall, the conversation highlights the ongoing discussions surrounding the scalability of the Bitcoin network and the need for continued innovation and development in this area.</summary>
