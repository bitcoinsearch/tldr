    <summary>Tamas Blummer, the Founder and CEO of Bitsofproof has expressed his opinion about encoding the chain in WIF and BIP32. He stated that he does not suggest encoding the chain, and considers the encoding of main and testnet in WIF and BIP32 as legacy which should be ignored. Additionally, he suggests that new BIPs should no longer carry this forward. Blummer's statement was shared on his website, bitsofproof.com, along with his signature.asc file which was signed with OpenPGP using GPGMail.</summary>
