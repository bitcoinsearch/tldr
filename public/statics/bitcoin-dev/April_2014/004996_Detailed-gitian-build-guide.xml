    <summary>On April 2, 2014, Wladimir announced that he was working on a guide to install and set up a Debian VM for gitian building. The purpose of this guide was to make it easier for people to get started with gitian builds. Wladimir shared the link to the rendered version of the guide on Github, and invited comments and patches. Additionally, he requested those who faced problems while following the guide to let him know. Miron responded to Wladimir's email with an expression of admiration.</summary>
