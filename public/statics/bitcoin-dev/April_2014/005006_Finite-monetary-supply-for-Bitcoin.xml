    <summary>In an email thread on April 4th, 2014, Wladimir expressed his preference for standardizing dates in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, agreed with Wladimir's suggestion. They both highlighted the benefits of using an all-numeric date format that is easily parseable by computers and sorts correctly in a lexicographic sort. They also emphasized that language should not be used in date formats when working with computers. Jeff Garzik provided a link to BitPay, Inc., the company he was affiliated with at the time.</summary>
