    <summary>In an email exchange between Jan Møller and Gregory Maxwell from April 22, 2014, Maxwell asks Møller for his thoughts on the Kogelman draft of BIP38. Møller responds that he commented on it back in October of the previous year but has not been tracking it since then. He also states that he is not a proponent of BIP38 and thinks encrypting a secret with a human-generated password is silly for many reasons. Møller suggests that using SSS (Shamir's Secret Sharing) is superior in every way that he can think of. It is unclear from the context whether Møller provided a list of concerns about BIP38 or if he was offering to do so upon request. The email exchange ends there.</summary>
