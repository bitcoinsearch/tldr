    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mark Friedenbach raises a question on how to find blocks that are needed for validation. In response, Tamas Blummer suggests that although validation needs to be sequential, it can be deferred until the continuous blocks before a certain point are loaded. Mark Friedenbach then proposes a solution of having nodes advertise which range of full blocks they possess, making synchronization possible from the advertised ranges. He suggests distributing blocks through pruned nodes as a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to achieve this. The email also includes an advertisement for Jenkins Continuous Integration, which automates build, test, and deployment of projects.</summary>
