    <summary>In an email exchange on April 15, 2014, Mike Belshe suggests that the Go implementation of bitcoind, btcd, has better error/diagnostics messages than the original implementation. The email chain also includes Matt Whitlock discussing a tool he and his team built in C++ that does key and address conversions, hash functions, encoding and decoding, script disassembly, BIP38 encryption/decryption, the Shamir Secret Sharing, transaction building and signing. The tool has its own wallet and UTXO cache that syncs by scanning bitcoind's block data files and can create sequences of multi-sig P2SH addresses from public seeds. The team is testing the tool by sending Bitcoin to those addresses and then finding them in the blockchain to create transactions that redeem them, which they sign with private seeds. The tool is easier to use than Bitcoind and can be run with simple command-line syntax.</summary>
