    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn expresses doubt that Bitcoin addresses can replace passwords as a means of authentication. He explains that even with a big team and lots of resources at Google, getting users to use their phone as a second factor for authentication was a difficult task as most people preferred using passwords. In response, Marek argues that two-factor authentication (2FA) does not remove the need for a password but adds another layer of security which could be too complicated for average users. Instead, he suggests that authentication based on Bitcoin wallet could be more effective since people already care about safe storage of their coins.</summary>
