    <summary>In a mailing list conversation, Gavin Andresen and another participant discussed the topic of discussing changes in the protocol. The other participant suggested moving the discussion to a more public venue, presumably their blog, but Gavin disagreed, stating that it made more sense to discuss the changes where there were people who understood the system at a detailed level. He also questioned why the other participant thought their blog was more public than the open, publicly archived mailing list.</summary>
