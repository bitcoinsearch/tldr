    <summary>A user named Laszlo Hanyecz reported that the website, www.githubb.com, resolves to addresses announced by AS53665. Further research shows that AS53665 probably has a dedi or VPS at Cogent and they have not created an IRR record for their AS or their only route. Google's Safe Browsing service also reports that there is malware associated with AS53665. This information should be taken into consideration when accessing websites associated with this AS number. The article linked discusses how Tor developers' computers were mysteriously re-routed to Virginia, indicating potential NSA interception. Finally, the message ends with a reminder to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and provides a link to learn more about it.</summary>
