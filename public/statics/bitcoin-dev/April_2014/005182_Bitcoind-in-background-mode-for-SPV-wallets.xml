    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in April 2014, slush proposed integrating torrent download of bootstrap.dat into bitcoind to improve synchronization and attract more users. However, some counter-arguments were presented, including that bittorrent is insecure and that there is a reasonable pathway to doing this all in-protocol. Other ideas were suggested, such as exposing existing instances to the internet or bundling ipv6 tunnelling into bitcoind. Gregory Maxwell responded to a separate issue regarding resource usage, stating that under the current network rules full nodes can be operated with vastly less resources than current implementations use if implementation improvements are made. The discussion prioritized improvements over the existing implementations.</summary>
