    <summary>The email conversation between Eric LarchevÃªque and slush revolves around the idea of using TREZOR for web authentication purposes. Slush suggests not to use Bitcoin addresses directly and to avoid encouraging services to use this login for financial purposes. He also advises using some function to generate other private/public key from Bitcoin's seed/private key to avoid leaking Bitcoin-related data to websites. In response, Eric raises the question of risks associated with identifying oneself with a Bitcoin address planned to be used on the website for transactions. He suggests that ideally, the user should not care about "what address do I use for this service" because in the future, the handling of raw addresses may be eliminated soon by bip70 or similar solutions.</summary>
