    <summary>In an email conversation on April 4, 2014, Mike Hearn highlighted the issue of mixing payment and identification. This was in response to a discussion on the use of different versions bytes for SINs and bitcoin addresses. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, added that the reason behind using different version bytes was to avoid any confusion between payments and identity. It is important to keep these two aspects separate in order to prevent problems from arising.</summary>
