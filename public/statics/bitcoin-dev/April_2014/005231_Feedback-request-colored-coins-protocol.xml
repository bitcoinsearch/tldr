    <summary>The email thread discusses the limitation of OP_RETURN's 40 bytes on the number of colored outputs per transaction. The author suggests using a compact format (LEB128) for the asset quantity of each output to mitigate this issue. The approach works well for small amounts of colored coins, but applications like sending dividends in colored coins may require splitting into several smaller transactions. The author believes that it is an acceptable limitation. In response to a comment suggesting that what was being done was no longer colored coins, the author explains that the difference between colored coins and Mastercoin is that colored coins are linked to transaction outputs, while Mastercoin has a notion of address balances. The explicit dependencies of colored coins allow for reliance on SPV, which is not the case with Mastercoin. The author concludes by reiterating the limitation of OP_RETURN size for some applications.</summary>
