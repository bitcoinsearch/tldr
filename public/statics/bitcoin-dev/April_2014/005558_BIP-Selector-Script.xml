    <summary>In an email conversation, Tier Nolan and Luke Dashjr discussed cross-chain trading and its implications on interoperability between different software. Tier Nolan suggested that a BIP may not be necessary for cross chain systems unless transactions are accepted in all chains. Luke explained that BIPs do not force nodes to adopt any policy and are only meant to define standards for interoperability between software. A BIP for cross-chain trading could be useful in convincing nodes to relay the transactions. However, secure transfers require fixing the malleability issue, which is a separate issue and has been known for years. Although there is some ongoing discussion of a soft fork to redo the Script language entirely, it will take time and development before it can be seen in the wild. Finally, Luke advised against assigning numbers until they are officially assigned by the BIP editor to avoid confusion when people Google the real BIP 44 and 45.</summary>
