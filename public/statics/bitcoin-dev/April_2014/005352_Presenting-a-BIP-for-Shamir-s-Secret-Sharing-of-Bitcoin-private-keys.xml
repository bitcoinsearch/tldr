    <summary>Tamas Blummer, from bitsofproof.com, believes that the usefulness of alternative cryptocurrencies (alts) lies in their ability to be used for experimentation rather than personal taste. He suggests that instead of focusing on a main network and test network, the wide variety of available chains is superseding this notion. Additionally, Blummer emphasizes the importance of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), as they are utilized by many different chains.</summary>
