    <summary>In this email thread from April 2014, Gregory Maxwell expresses concern that Electrum requires more than a full node, with additional indexes and pruning precluded. Thomas Voegtlin responds by stating that Electrum uses two large indexes: address to utxo and that adding an RPC call for "address to utxo" query wouldn't be a big deal. However, spent history would involve a much larger index, which is unlikely to end up in Bitcoin. Wladimir also weighs in on the conversation.</summary>
