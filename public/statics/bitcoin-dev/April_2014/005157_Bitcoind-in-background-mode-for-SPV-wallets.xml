    <summary>A border router that is unable to serve blocks still protects consensus rules that Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes are not capable of. If the network were to comprise only SPV nodes, a majority coalition of miners could potentially increase their rewards without restraint. However, archives require an alternate solution. According to Tamas Blummer from bitsofproof.com, SPV provides an adequate API for building complex features not available in the core. Border router clients using SPV can create their own archives and indices based on their chain interests, thereby eliminating the need for the border router core to store and process any data unnecessary for consensus. The storage requirements of the border router would be as low as optimal storage of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). Nevertheless, Mark Friedenbach argues that storing zero full blocks does not contribute anything to the network.</summary>
