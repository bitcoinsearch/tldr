    <title>BIP0071 media type registration with IANA</title>

    <summary>In an email sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Ross Nicoll expressed concern about the MIME types in BIP0071 not being IANA registered and unlikely to be accepted as-is. The latest RFC on media type registration restricts what can go in the default "application/" namespace, wanting it to be an ISO standard or similar. However, there are vendor namespaces that look much more feasible, such as Powerpoint 2007's "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation". Nicoll suggested registering a Bitcoin vendor namespace with IANA and allocating MIME types such as application/vnd.bitcoin.payment.request, application/vnd.bitcoin.payment.payment, and application/vnd.bitcoin.payment.ack. Despite this suggestion, others in the thread expressed doubt that this would work, as Bitcoin is not a vendor. In addition, the chance of a string collision is extremely low, and the current mime types are fine.</summary>
