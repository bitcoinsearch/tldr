    <summary>The email, dated 10 April 2014, was sent by Mike Hearn. The email discusses the idea of using micro-payments to incentivize committing resources to the bitcoin network. However, a core security assumption of bitcoin is that information is easy to spread, making censorship impractical. If nodes charge for data, this assumption will be failed. Additionally, if a business charges for blockchain data and can make a profit via micro-payments, there are perverse incentives to drive away its competitors. Giving a peer a whole block would allow them to sell access to that information in turn. There is a misconception that contributing back to the network is an all or nothing thing. Over a year ago, scalability was already solved, except for how to scale up and keep mining decentralized.</summary>
