    <summary>The writer, Tamas Blummer, uses multiple test chains while testing his software, including the official test net, a standalone net in-house, and even chains created on the fly for unit tests. He sees no need to distinguish serialization of keys while using any of them. He invites those with deeper insights into why this is needed to share their thoughts. Mark Friedenbach responds, noting that Testnet vs mainnet is quite a separate issue than bitcoin vs altcoin, which few altcoins seem to have figured out.</summary>
