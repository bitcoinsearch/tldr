    <summary>In this conversation thread, Flavien Charlon clarifies that the assets in question would be listed on the "Asset" section of a company's balance sheet. Jorge Tim√≥n questions Flavien's assertion that bitcoins held by a company become part of its capital, comparing it to printing shares on gold plates. Mark Friedenbach chimes in to explain that bitcoins owned by a company are nothing more than a speculative investment owned by the investors, not the company itself. Flavien argues that the importance of padding with colored coins is overblown. The discussion centers around whether or not bitcoins should be considered assets or investments, and whether they can be used as collateral for shares in a company.</summary>
