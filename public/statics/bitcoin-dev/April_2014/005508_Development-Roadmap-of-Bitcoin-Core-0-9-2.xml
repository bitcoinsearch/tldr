    <summary>In an email conversation between Wladimir and Warren Togami Jr. on April 24, 2014, the two discussed the need for a cut-off point regarding the use of old stable distributions on the desktop. Warren suggested 4.7 or 4.8 as the cut-off point, noting that Qt 4.6 was ancient, having been released in February 2010. The only known users of this old version were Tails users. Wladimir wondered when Tails would switch to a newer version of Qt and if it would be during the timeframe when they switch to Wheezy/7.4, which has Qt 4.8. He provided two links showing Tails' work on migrating to the new distribution.</summary>
