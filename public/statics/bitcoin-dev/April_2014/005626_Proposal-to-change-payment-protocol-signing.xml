    <summary>In an email exchange discussing the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 70, Mike Hearn argues that changing the signature field now would be too difficult and cause chaos for early adopters. He suggests that setting the signature field to an empty byte array is fine, as the payment protocol is already being implemented by various wallets and companies such as BitPay and Coinbase. Ryan X. Charles, a software engineer at BitPay, is included in the email thread. The email ends with a promotional message for automated cross-browser testing.</summary>
