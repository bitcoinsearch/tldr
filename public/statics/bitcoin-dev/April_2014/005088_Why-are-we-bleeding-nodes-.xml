    <summary>In an email conversation with Tamas Blummer, it was discussed that once a single transaction is pruned in a block, the block becomes ineligible to be served to other nodes. The transactions that are pruned can vary depending on the wallet(s) of the node and a bitmap of pruned/full blocks may be more useful than ranges. However, this is not how pruning works in Bitcoin-QT or any mature implementation. Pruning can occur on a whole block basis, regardless of whether all the transactions in it are spent or not.</summary>
