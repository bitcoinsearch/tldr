    <summary>Tamas Blummer, a blockchain expert, responded to Tier Nolan's suggestion of having a defined way to import an unknown wallet. Blummer stated that it is possible to discover any funds associated with a seed, provided there are set limits to the gap of address use, depth of hierarchy, and gap in use of parallel branches; he recommends using limits of 20, 6, and 0 respectively. Blummer noted that there is already a gap in parallel branches that fails with BIP64 as it starts with m/64'/... without having m/63'.</summary>
