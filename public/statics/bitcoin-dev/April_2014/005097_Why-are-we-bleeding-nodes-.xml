    <summary>The email conversation between Tamas Blummer and Mark Friedenbach discusses the validation of blocks in relation to pruning transactions spent until block n. Validation must be sequential, however, it can be deferred until the blocks before a point are loaded and continuous. Finding those blocks can be done by having nodes advertise which range of full blocks they possess, allowing for synchronization from the advertised ranges. The highest block should be approached with validation and the stopping point for pruning should be set 100 blocks before it to leave room for reorgs. Tamas Blummer's website is bitsofproof.com.</summary>
