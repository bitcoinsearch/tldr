    <summary>In an email conversation, Mark Friedenbach discussed the idea of improving block propagation times by distributing partial proofs of work and 'priming' memory pools with transactions. He noted that this is essentially what p2pool does, resulting in a lower stale rate and roughly 1% better return than a zero-fee mining pool. Paul Lyon suggested allowing peers to request the list of transaction hashes that make up a block and then making a follow-up request for any unknown transactions, potentially improving block propagation times. However, Pieter had tried a similar approach before and found it to be slower than simply sending the data immediately and redundantly if the nodes' mempools were not aligned. The conversation took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
