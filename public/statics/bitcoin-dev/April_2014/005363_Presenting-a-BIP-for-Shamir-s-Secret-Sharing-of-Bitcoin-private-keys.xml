    <summary>The conversation starts with a suggestion to add some prefixes for testnet. The speaker expresses concern about increased AVB namespace usage in the latest draft and proposes differentiating main/testnet in the prefix byte. They suggest using ST instead of TS. The next speaker welcomes forks of their draft BIP but admits they don't have the inclination to research GF(2^8) secret sharing schemes and write an implementation at present. However, they are willing to fork it. The third speaker provides information about the maximum number of shares possible over GF(2^8), which is 255. They suggest this makes M and x biases unnecessary.</summary>
