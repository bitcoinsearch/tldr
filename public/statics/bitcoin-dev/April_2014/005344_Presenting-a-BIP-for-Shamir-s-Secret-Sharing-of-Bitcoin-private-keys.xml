    <summary>The author of the post expresses their interest in implementing a useful BIP for bip32 wallets. They note that it is important to protect a secret, such as an HD master seed or private key, in a way that allows for recovery in case of partial theft or loss. They make suggestions for different prefixes for testnet keys/seeds and allowing M=1 for usability purposes. The author also mentions that they have no strong opinions on using GF(2^8) over Shamir's Secret Sharing, but find the simplicity of GF(2^8) appealing.In a response to the post, Nikita Schmidt questions if the author believes base-58 encoding and decoding is easier than Shamir's Secret Sharing due to small divisors. The author responds by acknowledging that base-58 encoding and decoding is smaller and easier than Shamir's Secret Sharing over GF(P256) due to the small divisor and lack of modulo arithmetic.</summary>
