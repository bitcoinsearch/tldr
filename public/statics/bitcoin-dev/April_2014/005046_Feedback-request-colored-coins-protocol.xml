    <summary>In an email exchange, Flavien Charlon and Mark Friedenbach discussed the former's proposal to include asset tagging information in blockchain. Friedenbach pointed out that including unvalidated information would bloat the blockchain and suggested that using fixed increments for share sizes was not future-proof. He also referred Charlon to the Bitcoin-X mailing list and a padded order-based coloring scheme worked out there. Charlon responded by stating that there was a good reason to include asset tagging information in the blockchain so that clients don't need external information to recognize colored coins. He found the padding in the proposed scheme quite clumsy and unintuitive and suggested a more general solution where the color value is entirely separate from the satoshi value and encoded separately. He also suggested having various scales as an easy workaround and argued that those 54 BTC (5.4 BTC if the dust is now 540 satoshis) become part of the capital of the company and can always be recovered by uncoloring the shares.</summary>
