    <summary>There is a need for a lightweight bitcoin router or "core" that can be easily deployed anywhere. The idea of bundling core with SPV clients would not improve anything as the blockchain catching would turn the computer unusable every time the wallet is started. This is why people choose SPV wallets over full blockchain wallets. Instead of attracting fresh instances, it may be easier to convert hidden nodes to publicly reachable nodes. There are already running nodes that could be motivated to expose their existing instances over the internet. Wladimir proposed an interface to a bitcoind to allow 'running with full node', which could be useful for other (SPV) clients as well. It does not preclude looking for other solutions.</summary>
