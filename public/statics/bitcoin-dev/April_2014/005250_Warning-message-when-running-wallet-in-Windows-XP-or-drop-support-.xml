    <summary>In an email exchange between Melvin Carvalho and Wladimir, the issue of whether XP with a Trezor would work fine was discussed. Wladimir stated that this was a rare edge case because people who are security conscious enough to buy a Trezor will not run XP. He also added that there might still be a way for malware to compromise the user even with a Trezor on an XP system. Wladimir proposed adding a warning message for the 0.9.2 release, urging users to upgrade to Win8.1 or something else, and then dropping XP support completely in the next major release 0.10.0.</summary>
