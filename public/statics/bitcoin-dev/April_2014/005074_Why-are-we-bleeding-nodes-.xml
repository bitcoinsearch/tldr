    <summary>In a discussion thread dated 04/07/2014 09:57 AM, Gregory Maxwell mentioned that the problem of people not running full nodes is an implementation issue. This issue arises due to the absence of headers first and parallel fetch. However, he clarified that this is not a requirement issue but rather a consequence of the current implementation. The discussion revolved around the current state of the bitcoind code base and its future version.</summary>
