    <summary>Jorge Timón proposed a change to the "IsStandard" script in an email on April 26, 2014. He suggested replacing the "AcceptToMemoryPool" function with an "IsStandard(scriptPubKey, scriptSig)" method, as the only "isStandard" part of the process is the "check inputs" method. The current standard script methods are also used for extracting addresses for wallet management. Timón proposed that the standard script check could be made easier if it just checked for pattern matches. He asked if there were any objections to this change, aside from the concern that it doesn't go far enough.</summary>
