    <summary>The author discusses the potential security risks of using a shared spend/CoinJoin type transaction in Bitcoin, as it could allow anyone who participated in the transaction to access certain areas or information. They also mention the issue of outsourcing the running of a Bitcoin wallet and losing control of private keys. The author proposes the use of client certificates for identification instead of Bitcoin addresses, as they leave no trace in the block chain and are already widely supported by browsers and web servers. However, the use of client certs is not more widespread due to issues such as people preferring passwords, poor UI for managing them, and difficulty with cross-device sync. The author notes that there are no obvious fixes within Bitcoin for these issues.</summary>
