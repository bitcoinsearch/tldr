    <summary>The author of bitcoinj, a popular Bitcoin wallet library, has explained why he does not intend to implement subwallet or account support. He argues that the API already enables users to create and use multiple wallets, with key rotation allowing for multiple BIP32 seeds and hierarchies at once. Additionally, subwallets can be confusing for users and do not match the analogy of bank accounts, as transferring money across them leaks private data and costs miners fees. The only justification for subwallets is to avoid outputs being merged together to make payments, which requires an understanding of how the Bitcoin protocol works and its privacy implications. Furthermore, the author cites MultiBit's decision to remove multiple wallet support due to user confusion and support issues. Although some TREZOR users may be requesting this feature, its implementation could be more trouble than it is worth.</summary>
