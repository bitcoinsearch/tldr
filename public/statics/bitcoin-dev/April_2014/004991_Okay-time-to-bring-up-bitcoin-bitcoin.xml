    <summary>In this email exchange, Ricardo Filipe asked Kevin for the correct URL of his project after the previous link given by him did not work. Laszlo Hanyecz speculated that the website might be serving up exploits selectively and whoever is the target would get something special. Jeff Garzik criticized Kevin's choice of URL calling it a phishing attempt which nobody should visit. However, Kevin defended himself, stating that it was a serious project and he wanted it connected with the Bitcoin core. He later acknowledged that he needed to register a domain for it and get a page going to avoid confusion as he had forked it correctly. Finally, he clarified that he would never set up fishing because it's not his style.</summary>
