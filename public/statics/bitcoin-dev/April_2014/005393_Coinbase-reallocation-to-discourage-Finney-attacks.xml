    <summary>Based on the context provided, it is suggested that individuals who regularly use Bitcoin often purchase things they need but would also appreciate receiving items for free, such as coffee at Starbucks. However, attempting to double spend may result in consequences, as 95% of the time, individuals end up paying for the item they intended to receive for free. While attempting a double spend and failing may not have immediate negative repercussions, it does not benefit the individual as they are no worse off than if they had simply paid for the item initially.</summary>
