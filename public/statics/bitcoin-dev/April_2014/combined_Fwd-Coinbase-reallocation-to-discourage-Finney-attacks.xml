    <summary>In an email, a proposal was made to create a centralized version of Bitcoin for ultra-fast payments. The idea is to hold $5 of money at companies like Apple, Google, VISA, Mastercard or BitPay and establish a standardized API for other companies to compete in price. With all addresses kept on SSDs and 6x replication, it should be possible to charge 1 cent/address per month and 1 cent/transaction. However, Gregory Maxwell responded that large scale consensus cannot provide instantly irreversible transactions directly, and increasing block speed cannot help past the point where the time starts getting close to the network diameter.Maxwell further explained that there is no silver bullet that can offer something identical to what a centralized service can provide without invoking centralization. He suggested that other chains with different parameters could achieve a different tradeoff which may better suit low value retail transactions. A choice of tradeoffs could be useful, but there would still be some level of centralization involved. Therefore, the proposal for a centralized version of Bitcoin for ultra-fast payments may not be feasible in its current form.</summary>
