    <summary>The use of bitcoin units will decrease as the network value increases, causing a decimal problem for most transactions. To solve this issue, millibitcoin and microbitcoin units have been introduced. However, these units may still cause confusion among users. To simplify the process, a proposal has been made to introduce a new unit called "bit". One BTC would equal one million bits, and one bit would equal 100 satoshis. The labeling of this unit should be easy enough for everyone to understand. To learn more about this proposal, see the user discussion threads on Reddit.</summary>
