    <summary>In an email exchange on April 9, 2014, Wladimir van der Laan, a Bitcoin Core developer, responded to a suggestion by slush regarding how to improve the current situation without reworking the architecture. Wladimir stated that none of his proposals would require significant changes to the planned architecture. After SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) lands, the wallet will be split off, and an interface will be required for bitcoind to allow running with full node. If this can be generalized to be useful for other clients, it would be helpful. He also acknowledged that they could explore other solutions as well.</summary>
