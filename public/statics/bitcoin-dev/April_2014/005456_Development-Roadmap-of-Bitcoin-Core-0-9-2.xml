    <summary>In an email correspondence, Kristov Atlas raised concerns about the compatibility of the latest nightly build with Tails/Debian Squeeze and asked if there were plans to address the issue. Warren, in response, clarified that while bitcoin-qt may not work due to qt-4.6, bitcoind does work on most distributions. He emphasized that the priority is for bitcoind to work on as many distributions as possible since older stable distributions are generally headless. For users who need Bitcoin-Qt on an incompatible system, building it from source would be the only option. The official Bitcoin 0.8.6 binaries also did not work on Squeeze, so this was not a regression.</summary>
