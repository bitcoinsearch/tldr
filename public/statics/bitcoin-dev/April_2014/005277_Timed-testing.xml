    <summary>In a communication dated April 17, 2014, Gavin Andresen asked about the difference between running in -regtest mode and running in -timedtest mode, which generates a new block automatically every second instead of having to manually request one. The response was that there is no difference, and that perhaps the value in creating a new mode is not enough to justify it. However, the proposed -private mode could provide a way to simulate proof of work attacks. The author asks questions about simulating a pow race situation without actually doing any pow and how to measure validation performance to get the number of peak tps that can be processed without taking block size or network latency into account. The author wonders if anyone has tried these things before.</summary>
