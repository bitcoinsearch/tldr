    <summary>In an email exchange between Jan Møller and Matt Whitlock on April 22, 2014, they discussed changes to the secret sharing scheme. Møller suggested allowing the user to select one share if they choose to, even though it may seem technically unnecessary. This would simplify the software and hardware by not requiring different formats, import/export paths, and multiple UIs. Whitlock agreed with Møller's suggestion and proposed encoding N-of-M in one byte as he doesn't see good use cases with more than 17 shares. The encoding bias of M was changed to -1, and test vectors were updated. The changes can be found on the Github page for btctool.</summary>
