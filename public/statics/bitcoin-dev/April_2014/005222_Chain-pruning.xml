    <summary>In an email exchange between Pieter and Paul Rabahy, concerns about 51% attacks were discussed. Pieter explained that with full node security, everything is validated, making it impossible to be tricked into believing something invalid. The only potential attacks are centered around which version of valid history ultimately gets chosen. However, if one relies on hashrate to determine the validity of UTXO sets, a 51% attack becomes even more dangerous as it can lead to the acceptance of an invalid version of history.</summary>
