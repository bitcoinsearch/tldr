    <summary>In an email conversation on 4/7/14, Flavien Charlon proposed that the 54 BTC (5.4 BTC if the dust is now 540 satoshis) should become part of the capital of the company and can always be recovered by uncoloring the shares. He argued that it was an investment and not an expense. However, the recipient of the email was unconvinced by this line of thinking and used the analogy of printing shares on gold plates to explain why they disagreed.</summary>
