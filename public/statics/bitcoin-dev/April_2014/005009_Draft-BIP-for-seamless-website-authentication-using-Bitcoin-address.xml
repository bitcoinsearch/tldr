    <summary>In an email conversation, Eric Larchevêque discusses the benefits of a standard protocol for Bitcoin authentication. He believes such a protocol will benefit the entire ecosystem and argues that without it, certain scenarios wouldn't be possible, like pure Bitcoin physical locker rentals or booking hotel rooms with Bitcoin. However, there are potential problems when mixing payment and identification. For instance, if coins are in a multi-sig relationship with a risk analysis service, who gets to open a locker? Larchevêque suggests using client certificates instead, which have the advantage of being supported by web servers and browsers, but suffer from backup and cross-device sync issues, just like wallets.</summary>
