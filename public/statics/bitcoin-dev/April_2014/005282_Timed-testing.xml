    <summary>The author expresses gratitude for the explanations provided on using regtest to reproduce example scenarios. The author decides that a private mode would not be useful for testing and will work on private chains separately from bitcoind without creating a pull request. The author brings up Sipa's complaints about regtest being too specific and argues that some behaviors should be specified as independent parameters instead of chainparams attributes. The author suggests one example of an independent parameter and proposes implementing the blocktime param as an independent parameter without the need for a new mode. The author is unsure if the timedtest parameter would be useful for bitcoind testing and asks Sipa for suggestions on how to solve the issue as part of PR 3824. The author welcomes any suggestions on how to improve PR 3824, especially from Sipa, as it is simple enough for the author to start contributing to bitcoind.</summary>
