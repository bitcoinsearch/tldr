    <summary>The conversation is between Wladimir and Miron / devrandom. They are discussing the process of building a basic virtual machine using Gitian for gitian builds. Devrandom wonders how much of the process could be scripted, to which Wladimir replies that everything can probably be scripted using vmbuilder or vagrant as suggested by Nick Simpson. The point of providing exact steps is to allow people to follow them and build a basic virtual machine for gitian builds. Wladimir did not want to end up with a gitian-builder-that-builds-a-gitian-builder. It may be possible to script some parts without automating the entire process, but over time, Gitian itself should become easier to use/setup so that fewer steps are needed in the first place. Wladimir hopes that Gitian will continue to improve to make it easier for newcomers to get started.</summary>
