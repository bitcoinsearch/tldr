    <summary>Mr. Torrent suggested to refuse serving blocks older than three months to avoid wasting time and bandwidth, forcing downloads by other means, presumably torrent. However, there remain issues of older nodes and "getting the word out" that prevent this switch from being flipped on tomorrow. Gregory Maxwell was concerned about using a binary archive bit as it could cause extreme load hot-spotting and the kind of binary "Use lots of resources YES or NO." He suggested extending the addr messages so that nodes can indicate a range or two of blocks that they're serving, allowing all nodes to contribute fractionally according to their means.
