    <summary>In April 2014, Tier Nolan raised a concern about the lack of use cases defined in a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). While the proposal mentioned that certain features were necessary for atomic cross-chain transfers, it did not explain how those features would be useful. Another BIP may have been needed to address this issue. However, the response to Nolan's comment clarified that the specification was simply unclear and that one use case would suffice. The proposed feature allowed spending to be controlled by the publication of information in another transaction, ensuring that transactions could only be completed atomically. A citation to a revision of the contracts page was suggested for further clarification. Overall, the discussion focused on improving the clarity and usefulness of the proposal.</summary>
