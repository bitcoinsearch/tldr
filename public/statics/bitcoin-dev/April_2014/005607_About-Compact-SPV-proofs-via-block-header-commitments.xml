    <summary>In an email exchange, Mark Friedenbach defined an SPV proof as a succinct sequence of bits that can be transmitted to establish the ancestor of a block as well as the cost of creating a fake proof. However, Sergio argued that an SPV proof is a sequence of bits that establishes a block as part of the best-chain. While Sergio understood that SPV nodes require Friedenbach's definition of SPV proofs, he couldn't see how they require it under his own definition. Sergio did not consider Friedenbach's definition of SPV proof to be a need and asked if it was a well-established definition in the community.</summary>
