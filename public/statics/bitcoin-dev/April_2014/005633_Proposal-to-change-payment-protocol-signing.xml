    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a core Bitcoin developer, initiated a discussion regarding the clarification of how BIP70 signs payment requests. The issue was about the signature field before signing, and Andresen suggested that instead of setting the signature to an empty string, it should be cleared so that it is not serialized at all. He said that this type of mistake is why BIPs take a while before being declared 'Final.' BIP70 is already in use with over a hundred paid requests, but Andresen believes that changes need to be made now, while it is still a 'Draft.' The email also includes a link to a free automated cross-browser testing platform.</summary>
