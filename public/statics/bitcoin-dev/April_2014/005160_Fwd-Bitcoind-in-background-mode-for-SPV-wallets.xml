    <summary>In an email conversation on April 9th, 2014, Brian Hoffman raised concerns regarding how running a full node would affect the user in terms of disk storage. He questioned if users would be more likely to enable this feature if it was not required, considering the space constraints that come with it. In response, Wladimir clarified that if users choose to run a full node, they must have the bandwidth and disk space to support it. However, if they opt for Bitcoin Core as a wallet, they can select their preferred wallet while still having the option to run a full node.</summary>
