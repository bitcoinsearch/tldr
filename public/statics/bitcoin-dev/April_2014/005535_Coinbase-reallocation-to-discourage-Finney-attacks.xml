    <summary>The interpretation of what a bitcoin means is a human decision that has been taken to achieve some socially useful goal. The notion that the block chain encodes some kind of natural, immovable law that's above human judgement is a strange one. Bitcoin doesn't use encryption anywhere, just digital signatures. Lack of information is the only thing approaching natural law that stops majority consensus controlling everything. Hence all the discussion around privacy and anonymity that goes on all the time.</summary>
