    <summary>Flavien Charlon was discussing a company's balance sheet, and mentioned the "Asset" section. However, it was clarified that gold plates are not assets for the company when someone else holds them, but rather an asset for the owner of the share. The concern was raised that by spending money on gold costs, the company is getting less capital. It was questioned whether the company was raising capital or selling gold, and why they would spend money on gold before asking for other people's money to build the company. Investors may appreciate being able to buy shares of the company and gold separately. It was suggested that for other use cases besides stocks, it may be even more clear. Lastly, the question was posed whether an IOU written in a gold plate makes sense.</summary>
