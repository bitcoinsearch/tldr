    <summary>In a discussion thread from 2014, Tier Nolan suggested that having a defined way to import an unknown wallet could be a solution. However, another participant in the thread disagreed and stated that there is no way to import a wallet if its structure is not known. The participant went on to explain that it may be possible to find all the addresses for a root seed given a blockchain, but this would not work if the keyspace is almost infinite due to the potential variability of the wallet hierarchy.</summary>
