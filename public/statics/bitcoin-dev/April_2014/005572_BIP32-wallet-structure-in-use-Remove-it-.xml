    <summary>The conversation between Bitcoin developers Gregory Maxwell and Thomas Voegtlin revolves around the idea of wallet interoperability. Maxwell argues that it is not possible to achieve full wallet interoperability without constraining functionality, which would hinder progress and innovation in developing new features. However, he suggests that a compatibility mode where a wallet has a subset of features could be supported. Meanwhile, Voegtlin agrees with Maxwell's stance, stating that the cost of interoperability is too high and partial compatibility could result in users being unable to recover all their funds when using another wallet. Ultimately, the developers discuss the challenges involved in making a wallet portable between systems, including key management and metadata handling.</summary>
