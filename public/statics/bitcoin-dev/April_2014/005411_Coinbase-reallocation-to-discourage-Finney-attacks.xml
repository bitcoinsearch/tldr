    <summary>In an email dated 23 April, 2014, Gavin Andresen questioned why someone would use a blog instead of an open, publicly archived mailing list. The response was that non-developers are more comfortable using social media tools, which allow for sharing, commenting and tweeting with nothing more than a web browser. In contrast, the barrier for participation on a mailing list is higher, and visibility is lower. At the end of the email, there is a message to support online privacy through email encryption as well as a link to a YouTube tutorial on how to do so. The email also includes a PGP signature for security purposes, as well as an attachment containing a public key.</summary>
