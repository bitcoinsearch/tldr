    <summary>In an email exchange on April 30, 2014, Luke Dashjr asked for meaningful identifiers to be used instead of TX0, TX1 etc. and the names were updated accordingly. The bail-in transactions are only signed by one party and kept secret until the refund/payout transactions are properly signed, with a third party needed to mitigate malleability risks. Refund principles similar to payment channels are employed, and TX0 is not broadcast until the refund transactions are complete. A full implementation was planned as the next step, although there was already an implementation of this system available. The purpose of OP_EQUAL_VERIFY in TX4 was explained as a typo. Dashjr suggested separate BIPs for the exchange itself and the protocol to negotiate it, and also recommended compressed keys to discourage use of uncompressed ones. MIME was proposed as a different way of doing things instead of JSON-RPC for the protocol.</summary>
