    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn discusses the importance of adding instrumentation to existing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets to report back to home base how long they are running for, how much disk space and RAM they have, and what kind of hardware. He strongly suspects that the vast majority of SPV wallets are not left running permanently and run on laptops where battery life is at a premium. He believes that people will never want to run full nodes, which may result in Bitcoin's failure if no one volunteers to support the network anymore. Wladimir argues that it does not make sense to run full nodes on consumer hardware, and instead, time is better spent optimizing so that it is cheaper for full node operators to run them on cheap virtualized servers. However, most consumer hardware is more powerful than cheap virtualized servers, and any optimization that helps running on cheap servers will also help running it on consumer hardware.</summary>
