    <summary>In an email exchange on April 25th, 2014, Peter Todd warns that P2SH redeemScripts are limited to just 520 bytes and complex transactions may not be able to be encoded in P2SH at all. However, he notes that this is just a change to isStandard() rather than a protocol change and these transactions can already be mined into blocks. The email exchange was part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Additionally, the email contained an advertisement for eXo Platform, a Java-based open-source intranet software that could potentially be used for collaboration within a Bitcoin development team.</summary>
