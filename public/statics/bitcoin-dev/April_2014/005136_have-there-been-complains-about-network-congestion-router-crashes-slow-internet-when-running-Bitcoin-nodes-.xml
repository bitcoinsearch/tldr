    <summary>The author is questioning whether the traffic on a Bitcoin node will become so high that it causes problems for home routers and modems. They list issues such as crashing or slowing down due to overflow of NAT pin-hole tables, UDP traffic, and send buffers being filled up with outgoing data causing delays on interactive traffic. The author suggests that these issues were solved by the bittorrent community with uTP, which uses a congestion window algorithm to use as much TCP bandwidth as possible while throttling down in case of cross traffic and considering other features like optimum MTUs and clock drift phenomena. They propose that implementing uTP could greatly improve the performance of the Bitcoin network. A link is provided for further information about uTP.</summary>
