    <summary>There is an ongoing discussion within the Bitcoin community about the use of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as a replacement for Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining. While some have proposed protocols involving PoS mechanisms to eliminate checkpoints, others believe that without an existing mechanism for enforced scarcity (such as PoW), PoS cannot work in a consensus algorithm. One issue with PoS is that there are no stakes involved and miners can sign as many different forks as they wish, which could result in double-spends at will.Stephen Reed proposed creating a Bitcoin branch that provides a sandboxed testbed for researching the best PoS implementations. He conducted a poll on bitcointalk.org, which suggests some minority support for Bitcoin Proof-of-Stake. His goal is to develop, test, and document PoS while exploring its vulnerabilities and fixing them in a transparent fashion. Mark Friedenbach and Vitalik Buterin have also proposed protocols involving PoS mechanisms. However, the main issue with PoS mining is that it does not offer any stake, which can lead to double-spends. Fraud proofs can mitigate this issue, but Friedenbach argues that this still reduces to proof-of-work mining.In 2014, Stephen Reed proposed creating a Bitcoin branch for testing the best Proof-of-Stake (PoS) implementations. The discussion also touches on the use of fraud proofs to mitigate double-spends in PoS, but some argue this still reduces to PoW mining. Vitalik Buterin discusses the idea of a "punitive proof-of-stake algorithm" in an article on the Ethereum blog. However, this is not a new concept, and the author and Iddo have conducted research on pure PoS and found it to be feasible, but the unpublished work cannot be referred to at this time.Meanwhile, the compatibility of proof-of-stake blockchains with the sidechain/two-way peg system invented by Greg Maxwell is being discussed. The author plans to explore the concept of sidechains and merge-mining support and suggests that coin age is a good starting point for implementing PoS. He also plans to establish a Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin project thread in the Project Development sub-forum of Bitcointalk for technical discussion and encourages the creation of a list of principles.Finally, Jeffrey Paul raises the question of whether alternate decentralized consensus algorithms like proof of execution, proof of stake, and others are compatible with the sidechain universe as envisioned. However, alternate decentralized consensus algorithms (proof of execution, proof of stake, etc.) may not retain compatibility with Bitcoin in a two-way peg model, which would make "alternate universe" altcoin experiments with different proof models take on a different cost/benefit ratio if they cannot interoperate as sidechains. Additionally, due to DMARC enforcement, Gmail is spamfoldering emails from Yahoo, making it incompatible with Sourceforge mailing lists. The two solutions are to not use Yahoo or stop using Sourceforge mailing list software.</summary>
