    <summary>In an email exchange on April 23, 2014, Pieter Wuille suggested defining a new purpose ID without accounts. He believed that many simple wallets would find multiple subwallets too complicated for users or not worth the technical complexity. Alternatively, they could implement multiple wallets with different security policies where each wallet wouldn't share a common piece of private key material. Sharing a private key and not sharing a private key could be confusing for multiple wallets.</summary>
