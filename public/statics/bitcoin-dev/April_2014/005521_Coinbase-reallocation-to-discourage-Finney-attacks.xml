    <summary>In a thread on 4/24/14, Mike Hearn and another individual were discussing the relationship between "proof of work" and blockchain tampering. The individual argued that replace-by-fee policies could be disentangled from rewriting history attacks, while Hearn maintained that proof of work is what makes the blockchain difficult to tamper with. The two also disagreed on whether miners who engage in replace-by-fee are "honest" or not. Hearn argued that replace-by-fee policies are an improvement over first-saw-first-included policies, while the other individual disagreed. Additionally, they debated the use of argument from authority fallacies and definitions of honesty within the context of Bitcoin. Overall, the conversation revolved around the complexities and nuances of mining behavior and its impact on the blockchain.</summary>
