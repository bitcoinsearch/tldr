    <summary>In an email conversation from April 25, 2014, Peter Todd discusses his research on implementing oracles in blockchain transactions. He suggests that using ECC secret keys revealed by the oracle is a better method than hash-locked transactions, as the oracle can prove their possession of the key by signing a challenge message. Additionally, the transaction can include keys derived from the oracle keys, which conceals the purpose of the oracle from itself. The use of EC public points for the oracle case is agreed upon by both Peter and the original sender of the email thread. They reference Reality Keys as an example of this method in practice.</summary>
