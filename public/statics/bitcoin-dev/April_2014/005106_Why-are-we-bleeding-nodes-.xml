    <summary>In a conversation between Tier Nolan and an unknown individual on April 7th, 2014, the topic of loading blocks in random order was discussed. Nolan stated that once the order of the blocks is given by the headers, they can be loaded randomly. However, computing the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) requires storing the blocks temporarily unless there is enough RAM available. The conversation clarified that only the UTXO set needs to be stored, not the entire blockchain. It was also emphasized that verification must still be done in order, and if blocks are fetched out of order, they must be preserved long enough to be reordered before verification can take place.</summary>
