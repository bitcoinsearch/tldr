    <summary>In an email exchange on April 21, 2014, Rodney Morris asked about the proper procedure for dealing with someone quoting an entire digest for the sake of a few lines of content. He also questioned whether this behavior could be considered abuse and if others were bothered by it. Wladimir responded that he wouldn't classify it as abuse unless it was done intentionally, and suggested politely asking the person instead of complaining to the list.</summary>
