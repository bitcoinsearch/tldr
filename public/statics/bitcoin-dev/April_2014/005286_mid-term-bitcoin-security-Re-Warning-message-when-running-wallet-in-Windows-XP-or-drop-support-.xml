    <summary>In a discussion about bitcoin addresses, Adam Back suggests rebranding them as "invoice numbers" to prevent double payments. However, another participant argues that this is still too coarse-grained and proposes using a BIP32 extended public key instead. This would allow payers to create unique addresses and avoid merging inputs, thus preserving user privacy. Additionally, it is noted that assuming a 1:1 relationship between payment transactions and invoices is broken from a business accounting perspective. The discussion emphasizes the importance of online privacy and encourages the use of email encryption whenever possible.</summary>
