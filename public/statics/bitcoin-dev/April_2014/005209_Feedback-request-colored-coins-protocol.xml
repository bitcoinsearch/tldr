    <summary>Decentralized networks may make it more appropriate to emit fewer shares, as 2 billion shares backed by coloured coins makes less sense than a more conservative number. However, if a company has already created a significant number of shares, then a coloured coin can represent a bundle of shares, with another coloured coin instrument emitted for smaller investors unwilling to deal in terms of bundled shares. Coloured coins have benefits but also constraints that are not difficult to live with. Flavien Charlon suggests that the asset quantity of every output is explicitly encoded in the OP_RETURN output, so whether you are issuing 1 share or 100 trillion, you never need to pay more than 540 satoshis.</summary>
