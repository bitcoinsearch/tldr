    <summary>The conversation is a discussion about the development of payment channels and the hub/spoke concept. The credit for the design of payment channels goes to Satoshi, and the implementation work was done by Matt during a Google internship. Jeremy Spilman deserves credit for getting rid of the dependency on nSequence and making the protocol trust-free. There was an Android UI for it and a couple of apps developed, but real-world usage wasn't achieved. The hub/spoke concept dates back to 16th century Italy when goldsmiths started passing pieces of paper across their benches, or bancos in Italian. It took five hundred years for math to make it trust-free. There were issues with malleability, semi-fixed with the P2SH trick, which Pieter's proposed malleability patch will clarify for good.</summary>
