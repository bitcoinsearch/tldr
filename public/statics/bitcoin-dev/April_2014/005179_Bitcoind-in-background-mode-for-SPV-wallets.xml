    <summary>In this email conversation, slush suggests integrating the torrent download of bootstrap.dat into bitcoind. Slush believes that many users, especially beginners, give up on synchronization once they realize it takes too much time and that downloading the bootstrap significantly improves catching the blockchain. Wladimir responds by suggesting that parallel block download would be better than involving bittorrent. He also asks to keep the discussion focused on the current topic and not other solutions for faster block download.</summary>
