    <summary>In an email exchange on April 16, 2014, Kevin questioned the security of Windows XP and asked about a warning. The response was that Windows XP is no longer maintained and should not be used to protect money. The warning was issued by Microsoft, as seen on their website regarding end of support for the operating system. The suggestion was made to have Bitcoin Core detect when it's running on Windows XP and warn the user of the risks they may be unaware of.</summary>
