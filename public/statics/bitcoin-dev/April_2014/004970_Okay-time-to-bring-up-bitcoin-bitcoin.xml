    <summary>Kevin, a developer, has been working on a secure tax "mode" for Bitcoin by forking it from Bitcoin core. The code is written in Autoit, a scripting language. He has shared the link to his project on Github and is inviting people to review it and engage in an open dialog about it. Kevin wants to receive feedback regarding the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of his project.</summary>
