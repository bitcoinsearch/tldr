    <summary>In an email conversation dated March 29th, 2014, Matt Whitlock expresses his doubts on whether his Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) would be worth improving with suggestions provided. However, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, clarifies that the decision to use Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) is separate from the decision to write a BIP. He explains that if people are using SSS in the field, it is better to write a BIP than not. Even Informational BIPs that describe existing practices can be useful.</summary>
