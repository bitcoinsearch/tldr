    <summary>The user is attempting to redeem a 2-of-3 multisig P2SH output using a raw transaction. The address that the P2SH output was sent to is shown and the transaction containing the output is identified as ec7d985ae265a3a79c68d852e0e52cf4177c3362d7a25fb718be82f980f39285. A raw transaction is created to spend the output, which is then decoded for completeness. The transaction is signed using 2 of 3 keys. The hex and decode of the signed transaction are shown.However, the transaction appears to be invalid, as it was rejected by the network when attempting to transmit it. There is no clear indication as to why the transaction was rejected or what specific error occurred. This context pertains to a Bitcoin transaction, and it includes essential information about the raw data of the transaction, the inputs, and outputs. Inputs provide information on the source of funds, while outputs give details on where the funds are being sent and in what amount.</summary>
