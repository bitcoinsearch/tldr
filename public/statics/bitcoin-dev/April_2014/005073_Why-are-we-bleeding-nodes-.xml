    <summary>In an email exchange between Mark Friedenbach and Gregory Maxwell on April 7, 2014, they discussed the issue of why people are not running full nodes. Maxwell argued that it was an implementation issue rather than a requirements issue, specifically related to the lack of headers first and parallel fetch. Friedenbach agreed but emphasized the importance of distinguishing between fixable implementation issues and the need to change goals and incentives. Friedenbach pointed out that when he read about the "resource requirements of a full node moving beyond," he did not immediately gather that this was due to implementation issues that could be improved for low resource users. This exchange highlights the complexity of addressing the challenges of running full nodes in the Bitcoin network and the importance of carefully considering the root causes of these challenges before proposing solutions.</summary>
