    <summary>The discussion between Tamas Blummer and Gregory Maxwell on the Bitcointalk forum revolved around the loading of headers and blocks in the Bitcoin network. Once headers are loaded, there is no need for sequential loading. Validation, however, needs to be sequential, but this step can be deferred until the blocks before a point are loaded and continuous. The conversation then moved towards the idea of returning a bitmap of pruned/full blocks instead of ranges. However, Maxwell pointed out that using a bitmap could result in high overhead and poor locality if non-contiguous blocks were advertised, since blocks are fetched sequentially.</summary>
