    <summary>In a discussion about the serialization of keys when using test chains, Tamas Blummer expressed that he saw no use in distinguishing serialization of keys while using any of them. Mark Friedenbach noted that the issue of testnet vs mainnet is separate from bitcoin vs altcoin, but unfortunately few of the alts ever figured this out. The email exchange took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list on April 22, 2014. The context also mentions that treating testnet differently is common practice in various Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and private keys, but none of them define values for alt coins.</summary>
