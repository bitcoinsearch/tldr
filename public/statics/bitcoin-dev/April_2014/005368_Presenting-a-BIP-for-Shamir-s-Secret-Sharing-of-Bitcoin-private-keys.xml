    <summary>In an email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Mark Friedenbach, Blummer expressed his opinion that separate prefixes for test chains may or may not make sense, but having per-alt prefixes is nonsensical. He mentioned that he uses several test chains to test his software, including the official test net, a standalone net in-house, and even chains created on the fly for unit testing. However, he found no use in distinguishing serialization of keys while using any of them. On the other hand, Friedenbach noted that the issue of testnet vs mainnet is different from bitcoin vs altcoin, but unfortunately, few altcoins have realized this.</summary>
