    <summary>In an email conversation between Kristov Atlas and Warren Togami Jr. on April 23, 2014, Kristov shared that he had modified the gitian build to use Qt 4.6 instead of 4.8, with the intention of making it compatible with Tails/Debian Squeeze. He provided a link to a test build of master with the updated gitian descriptor which should work on Debian Squeeze / Tails Linux. The links to download the bitcoin-qt executables were also included in the email.</summary>
