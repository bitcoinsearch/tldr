    <summary>In an email conversation between Luke-Jr and an unknown person on April 23, 2014, Luke-Jr stated that any wallet should be able to import all coins without issue, but would not use any account other than account 0. He also reminded the person that addresses are only used to receive bitcoins and once the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are in the wallet, they are no longer associated with the address or how they were received. The conversation then shifted to the fact that wallets do not see UTXOs until they scan all branches/accounts on a hierarchical deterministic (HD) node import.</summary>
