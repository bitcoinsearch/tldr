    <summary>Warren Togami Jr. posted on the Bitcoin-Translators mailing list for developers to communicate to translators at particular times when new translations are needed. The subscription to this list would additionally be valuable to the project as it allows for a convenient way to ask for translations of other related projects like bitcoin.org that are hosted on the Transifex platform. Development Roadmap of Bitcoin Core 0.9.2 was also discussed in which the Bitcoin Core developers have a desire to do a mostly bug-fix and translation update release in v0.9.2. A feature and string freeze will start about 3 weeks from now. The purpose of this development roadmap is to communicate the project intent and to better organize volunteers. Schedule was also given subject to change such as 13 May 2014: Feature freeze. Source string freeze. Release candidate. and 20 May 2014: Testing of a release candidate is roughly a week. Nightly Gitian Builds were also made available to make it easier for non-developers and translators to get involved in testing unofficial deterministic nightly builds.</summary>
