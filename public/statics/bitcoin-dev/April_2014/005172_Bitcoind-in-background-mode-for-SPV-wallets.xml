    <summary>In an email thread from 2014, Gregory Maxwell is challenged about his claim that Bitcoin has a resource usage problem. He denies that there is a broken incentive model and accuses the challenger of making nonsensical claims about resource requirements. However, he does not defend his own position when it is questioned. Maxwell refers to archives of the mailing list where there are triple the number of people confirming the resource usage problem than denying it. The email includes a signature encouraging the use of email encryption for online privacy.</summary>
