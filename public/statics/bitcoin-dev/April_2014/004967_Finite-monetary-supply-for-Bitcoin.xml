    <summary>In an email exchange on April 1, 2014, Luke-Jr, a developer of Bitcoin, proposed a controversial idea to turn Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency. Pieter Wuille responded skeptically to the proposal, but Luke-Jr remained enthusiastic, linking to a cleaned-up version of the proposal and suggesting that tonal numbers would be used in Bitcoin by the year 2214. Benjamin Cordes also joined the conversation, recommending a book about mathematical music theory called Topos of Music, which he believed could have applications to Bitcoin.</summary>
