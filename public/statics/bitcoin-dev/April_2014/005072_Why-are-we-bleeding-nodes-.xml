    <summary>In an email dated April 7, 2014, Mike Hearn reported that the number of bitcoin nodes had decreased from 10,000 at the start of February to 8,500 and was still falling. He wondered if there was a way to gain more insight into why people were ceasing to run nodes. Although he acknowledged that some of the reasons could be due to disk space usage or lost interest, he suggested that it would be helpful if the subVer contained the operating system so that it could be determined if the bleed was mostly from desktops/laptops (Windows/Mac) or from virtual servers (Linux), which would be more concerning. Hearn also proposed implementing an exit survey similar to what is done with Tor nodes. If a node disappeared for long enough, the operator could be emailed and asked why they stopped. In a historical context, the number of nodes rose dramatically during the China bull run, reaching 45,000 in China alone. However, the number dropped as dramatically as the price after the first PBOC announcement aimed at cooling down bitcoin trading in China.</summary>
