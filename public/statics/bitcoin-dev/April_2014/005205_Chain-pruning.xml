    <summary>The discussion between Mike Hearn and Wladimir about chain pruning suggests that it is a separate thread. While discussing the reason for changing blocks, Mike doubts anyone would specify blocks to keep in terms of time as it would be in terms of megabytes, which is the actual resource constraint on nodes. However, Wladimir argues that with Bitcoin, time, number of blocks, and maximum size are all related, so estimates can be given for all three. He suggests that it makes sense to work with block ranges and proposes a new addr field that specifies how many blocks from the chain head are stored. This assumes that nodes will always store the latest blocks, which makes sense for dynamic nodes that take part in the consensus. Finally, Wladimir asks whether there would be a use for a static node that serves only the first 100000 blocks or a static range like block 100000 - 200000.</summary>
