    <summary>Tamas Blummer, founder of Bitsofproof, suggests that the most effective metadata to optimize chain scan is the key birth date and allowed gap size. In response to this suggestion, Tier Nolan raises concerns about the default value of 20 being too low for gap limit requirements. Nolan points out that merchants could easily send 20 addresses in a row to customers without them making any purchases. As a result, setting the gap limit too high would only incur a small extra cost. However, Bip-32 serialization does not offer a way to add metadata.</summary>
