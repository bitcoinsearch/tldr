    <summary>In an email exchange on April 23, 2014, Pavol Rusnak and Luke-Jr discussed the need for a more detailed wallet file format to restore accounts. Luke-Jr suggested scanning all branches for UTXOs to determine the balance for the wallet, stating that account balances are metadata and cannot be known from the seed alone. Pavol Rusnak then listed several possibilities for why Luke-Jr was not understanding the document, to which Luke-Jr responded that he may have missed the redefinition of "account" to mean "subwallet" in BIP 32. As a result, single-subwallet wallet software would need to have the user provide a subwallet number in addition to the seed.</summary>
