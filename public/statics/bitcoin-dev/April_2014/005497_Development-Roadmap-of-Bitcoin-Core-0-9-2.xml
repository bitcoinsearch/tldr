    <summary>In an email exchange from April 24, 2014, Warren Togami Jr. expressed concern over replacing functions in glibc and libstdc++ beyond the trivial while working with Bitcoin 0.8.6 that used qt-4.6.2. Wladimir responded by stating that Qt is not part of the compiler/build environment, so there is no need for such tricks. Instead, they could easily build against Qt 4.6 by unpacking and exporting the headers. However, Wladimir mentioned that Qt 4.6 was ancient as it was released in February 2010 and suggested using a cut-off point of 4.7 or 4.8. He noted that besides Tails, nobody was using those old stable distributions on the desktop.</summary>
