    <summary>In this conversation, Gregory raises a question about the possibility of having multiple network transports for Bitcoin. There is no formal abstraction for a Transport layer but it can be created when required. Angel asks if Bitcoin nodes could cause routers to crash or slow down due to high traffic, but Wladimir explains that the default maximum amount of connections is 125 and there should be no problem even for cheap routers. Bitcoin doesn't use UDP so there are no issues with it. Filling up the send buffer is possible, but throttling will be postponed until parallel block download implementation. Finally, Wladimir suggests starting with benchmarking and analysis to find out where the performance issues lie.</summary>
