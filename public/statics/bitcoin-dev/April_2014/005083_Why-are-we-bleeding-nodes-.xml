    <summary>Last month, the writer sent 456.5 gb of data from their geographic service location in Singapore costing about $90 for bandwidth alone. The stalled PayFile project was initiated in anticipation of this problem, and if someone wants to download and validate the full blockchain from scratch, they will have to start paying for it. To reduce redundant downloading and network-wide transmit traffic, the implementation of headers-first is suggested. Additionally, chain pruning implementation allows people to control upload bandwidth consumption by reducing the amount of disk storage they allow. Links to the PayFile project and a YouTube video on the same are provided.</summary>
