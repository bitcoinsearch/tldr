    <summary>Bloom filters can compromise the privacy of Bitcoin users, as they provide statistical information about the coins owned by a user, even if they don't reuse addresses. This information can be used to deanonymize the user and Tor doesn't offer much protection against this type of attack. However, there is an option to download everything with only basic surface validation without keeping track of UTXOs, which doesn't require a full node.</summary>
