    <summary>In an email exchange between Pavol Rusnak and Gregory Maxwell on April 23, 2014, the two discussed the issue of splitting funds across multiple wallets in Bitcoin. Maxwell suggested that it would be better if this was only a "MUST NOT" rather than a complete prohibition. Rusnak disagreed, stating that it makes perfect sense for funds to never mix across different accounts. Instead, he suggested that users could still send funds from one account to another and then perform another spend. Pieter also weighed in, suggesting that many simple wallets may find multiple subwallets too complex for users to manage.</summary>
