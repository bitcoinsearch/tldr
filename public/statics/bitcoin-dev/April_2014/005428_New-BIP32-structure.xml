    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Marek explains that while using a higher gap limit in the software is not prohibited, it breaks the standard "as is". This means that importing such wallet to another BIP64 wallet won't recover the funds properly without proper settings of the gap limit. He suggests that gap limit 20 is the most sane default for the majority of users, and that the majority of users won't need to change it at any time. Tier Nolan responds by saying that setting the gap limit too high can be a small extra cost, especially if someone has 100 accounts on 10 different devices. However, Marek clarifies that he meant for a merchant with a server that is handing out hundreds of addresses, and that the point is to have a single system that is compatible over a large number of systems. The email ends with a promotion for eXo Platform, an open-source intranet software that is social, extensible, and cloud-ready, as well as a reminder to start collaborating on turning intranets into collaboration platforms.</summary>
