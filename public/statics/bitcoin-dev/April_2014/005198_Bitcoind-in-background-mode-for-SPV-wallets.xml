    <summary>The email thread discusses the implementation of payment channels in Bitcoin. Payment channels are a form of off-chain payment that can be implemented in "hub and spoke" payment networks. The idea is to have one or more centralized hubs that have payment channels set up with payors and payees. If the person you want to pay is connected to the same hub as you are, payment can be made essentially instantly. However, this form of off-chain payment is less decentralized compared to standard Bitcoin transactions. Nevertheless, it can be combined with Chaum tokens for anonymity. There are regulatory issues to consider, particularly if central payment hubs learn all the details about every transaction made. However, if widely implemented, this reduces pressure to raise the block size enormously while keeping the underlying system decentralized. Dark Wallet is suggested to implement these protocols in an open and decentralized fashion before vendor lock-in. Credit goes to Mike Hearn for the payment channels, and possibly for the hub concept as well.</summary>
