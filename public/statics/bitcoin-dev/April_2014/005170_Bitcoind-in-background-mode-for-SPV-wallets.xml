    <summary>In an email exchange on April 9th, 2014, Wladimir expressed concern over the lack of resources being volunteered to support the Bitcoin network. Justus Ranvier responded by suggesting a solution that would allow for more nodes to be added to the network quickly. This solution would also make it easier to separate the wallet from Bitcoin Core and give users a choice in which wallet they use with their full node. However, Justus acknowledged that this is not a long-term solution and changing the incentive structure would be much more difficult and risky. Wladimir welcomed any pull requests for solutions.</summary>
