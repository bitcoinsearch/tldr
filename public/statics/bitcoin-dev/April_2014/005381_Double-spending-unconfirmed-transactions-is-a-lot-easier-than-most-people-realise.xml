    <summary>In an email exchange on April 22, 2014, Jan Møller and another individual discussed the difficulty in executing a double-spend after an original transaction. The individual noted that sending a non-standard transaction to Eligius would normally suffice, but in this specific case with LuckyBit, it would not work because they are directly connected to Eligius and Eligius relays non-standard transactions. However, Jan Møller pointed out that double-spending every bet would defeat the purpose of the action.</summary>
