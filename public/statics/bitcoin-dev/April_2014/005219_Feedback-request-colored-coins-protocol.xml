    <summary>The conversation revolves around whether or not a certain project is still using colored coins. The difference between colored coin model and Mastercoin model is explained as colored coins being linked to transaction outputs while Mastercoin has a notion of address balances. Colored coin model's explicit dependencies allow for reliance on SPV, whereas this is not the case with Mastercoin. The approach being described is similar to the original colored coins model in most aspects, but OP_RETURN size limitations can pose problems for some applications. The suggestion is made to look into Counterparty or Mastercoin instead.</summary>
