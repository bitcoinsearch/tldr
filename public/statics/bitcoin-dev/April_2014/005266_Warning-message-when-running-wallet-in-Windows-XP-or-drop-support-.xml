    <summary>In a discussion on 04/16/2014 at 02:29 PM, Kevin suggested the idea of an autoupdate function for Bitcoin Core which pulls a work around off the server. However, this suggestion was quickly rejected with a strong statement that Bitcoin Core will never have an auto-update functionality. The reason behind this decision is that such a functionality would create a single point of failure which when compromised could result in the theft of every last bitcoin held in a Bitcoin Core wallet. This statement highlights the importance of security and reliability in the development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies. It also emphasizes the need for caution when implementing features that could potentially compromise the safety of users' funds. Therefore, Bitcoin Core developers have chosen to prioritize security over convenience in their approach to updates and upgrades. Overall, this discussion reveals the importance of careful consideration and evaluation of potential risks and benefits in the development of cryptocurrency technologies. While innovation and progress are important, they should always be balanced against the need for security and protection of users' assets.</summary>
