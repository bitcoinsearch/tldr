    <summary>Tamas Blummer, a developer and founder of Bits of Proof, suggests the use of "xbit" (spoken as "ex-bit") as a new slang word that would rationalize XBT, which comes from supranational use and is unique. Blummer associates "x" with "six" and supports the 1e-6 divisor of Bitcoin. Pieter Wuille, another developer, comments on the colloquial names of units, saying that it is not something developers should determine and will vary depending on language and culture. Wuille argues that using "bits" as an official name in software could be confusing and we need a more distinctive name for Bitcoin fractions. It is yet to be determined how Bloomberg will use XBT, but Blummer believes that it is not too late to shape its use in finance.</summary>
