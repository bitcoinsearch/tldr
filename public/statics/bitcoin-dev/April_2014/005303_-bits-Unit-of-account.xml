    <summary>The proposal to denominate Bitcoin currency in a unit called 'bit' is being discussed among the people. It is suggested that one bitcoin (BTC) equals one million bits (bits) and one bit equals 100 satoshis. However, some individuals are proposing arbitrary subunits instead of bits. One concern raised by people is that it would be difficult for kindergarten kids to understand the new label, but it's not a major concern. The term 'bit' is already in use in English, so many people find it weird to use it as a unit. Some individuals suggest avoiding ambiguities while picking a label. Overall there have been mixed reactions on using 'bit' as a unit.</summary>
