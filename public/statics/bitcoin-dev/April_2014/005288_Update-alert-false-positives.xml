    <summary>The alert system for the bitcoin-qt produces unnecessary alerts on many systems, which can be frightening for normal users. The alert is related to the OpenSSL vulnerability called Heartbleed and is generated based on the client's version number. The ubuntu bitcoin ppa is dynamically linked to openssl, unlike the binaries available from bitcoin.org. Currently, there is no way to notify users of 0.9.0 w/ static linking without also notifying 0.9.0 w/ dynamic linking. A developer named Oliver Egginger suggests turning off this message as it produces too many false positives and motivates people to use harmful workarounds. The email thread includes a free guide to graph databases called "Graph Databases" by O'Reilly Books and a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list on SourceForge.</summary>
