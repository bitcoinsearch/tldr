    <summary>In an email conversation between Wladimir, Pieter Wuille and Kevin on April 16th, 2014, the topic of Windows XP's security was discussed. Pieter asked if they should assume that XP is not secure enough, to which Wladimir replied with a simple "Yes." He went on to explain that as newer versions of Windows were released, people would begin analyzing patches to those versions in order to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited on XP. Therefore, XP would quickly become extremely insecure. Kevin then proposed adding an alert message to wallet installers to inform users that certain features may not run on XP.</summary>
