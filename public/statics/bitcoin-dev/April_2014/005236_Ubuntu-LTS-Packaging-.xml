    <summary>On April 12, 2014 Oliver Egginger sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list enquiring about timely updates for critical vulnerabilities. He mentioned developing a LiveCD for hot/cold wallet management on Ubuntu LTS basis and his decision to maintain his own repository for this project. He also asked for better alternatives if any. In response to this email, Matt confirmed that there was nothing new yet and informed that version 0.9.1 did not change anything for dynamically-linked-to-openssl builds. The email thread also contained a link to Jenkins Continuous Integration for developers to try out.</summary>
