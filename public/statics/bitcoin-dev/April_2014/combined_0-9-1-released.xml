    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.1 is available as a security update and should be upgraded immediately for those with previous versions installed. The update contains OpenSSL 1.0.1g that fixes the vulnerabilities affecting the Bitcoin Core software, including CVE-2014-0160 ("heartbleed") and CVE-2014-0076. It's important to upgrade if using the graphical interface or bitcoind from any pre-0.9.1 version and have enabled SSL for RPC and configured allowip to allow rpc connections from potentially hostile hosts. No code changes were made between 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 except for changes in dependencies.Users should shut down their older version before installing the new one and wait until it has completely shut down, which might take a few minutes for older versions, then run the installer on Windows or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). Those upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier will need to re-index their blockchain files, which could take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of the machine.The issue tracker at Github can be used to report bugs. The OpenSSL team is credited for fixing the vulnerabilities quickly.</summary>
