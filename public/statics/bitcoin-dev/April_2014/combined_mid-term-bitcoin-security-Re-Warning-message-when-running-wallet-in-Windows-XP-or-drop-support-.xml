    <summary>In an email exchange on April 16th, 2014, Adam Back suggested rebranding Bitcoin addresses as "invoice numbers" to prevent double payment of invoices. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, supported this suggestion noting that BitPay already uses similar language. The email thread discussed the need for air-gaps and zero-trust ecosystems to enhance security. The author suggests using real-time auditability, type 2/type 3 exchanges based on atomic-swap, trustless escrow, and mass production of trezors. Another issue being addressed is address substitution via an untrusted network/user and a weak site with 1 million lines of Swiss-cheese security app-store. The author recommends address authentication TOFU and proposes a simple native TOFU format like Alan Reiner's multiplier * base approach or something like the IBE address proposal. In a discussion about bitcoin addresses, Adam Back suggests rebranding them as "invoice numbers" to prevent double payments. However, another participant argues that this is still too coarse-grained and proposes using a BIP32 extended public key instead. This would allow payers to create unique addresses and avoid merging inputs, thus preserving user privacy. Additionally, it is noted that assuming a 1:1 relationship between payment transactions and invoices is broken from a business accounting perspective. The discussion emphasized the importance of online privacy and encourages the use of email encryption whenever possible. Finally, the discussion concludes with an exchange about whether XP with a Trezor would work fine and dropping XP support completely in the next major release.</summary>
