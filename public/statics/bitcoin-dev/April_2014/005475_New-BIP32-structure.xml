    <summary>During a conversation between Pieter Wuille and Pavol Rusnak on April 23, 2014, the topic of creating multiple sub-wallets was discussed. Pieter suggested defining another purpose id without accounts as many simple wallets would find multiple subwallets too burdensome for the user experience or not worth the technical complexity. Pavol agreed and referred to a previous email where he had described the hypothetical creation of BIP65 and BIP66, which addressed the same issue.</summary>
