    <summary>In an email exchange on April 4, 2014, Nikita Schmidt suggested that the field order (p) should be used for arithmetic in Bitcoin due to its consistency with current practices. However, given different bit lengths, consistency must be chosen over other factors. Operation mod the group order is necessary for secret key combination in type-2 private derivation for BIP-32 and for a secret sharing scheme that is compatible with threshold ECDSA. The concern was raised that any private key secret sharing scheme should be compatible with threshold ECDSA to avoid redundancy in specification.</summary>
