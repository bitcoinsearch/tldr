    <summary>In an email conversation, Arne Brutschy discussed the issue of overloading and why it is not necessary to choose a term that is already overloaded. Additionally, he suggested using a term that is phonetically different and short, as most currencies do. He proposed using terms such as Pluk, cred, finney, or even "unsp" for unspent. The original email did not provide context for the discussion, but it can be inferred that the conversation was related to choosing a name for something. Mike also responded to the email, but his response was not included in the provided text.</summary>
