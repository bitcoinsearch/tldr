    <summary>A recent announcement on SourceForge encourages non-English speakers to join Transifex and help clean up translations in all languages, as Litecoin will use the same translations. The feature freeze for Bitcoin Core 0.9.2 is May 13th, 2014, which means now is the time to start volunteering. Volunteers should try the nightly builds of Bitcoin Core as it heads toward 0.9.2, but not recommended for their production wallet. They can also join the Translator mailing list to receive announcements when translations are needed for Bitcoin and be notified if other Bitcoin Project things in Transifex need translations such as bitcoin.org. Even those who are not developers can help improve Bitcoin by dedicating some time and doing a little language work.</summary>
