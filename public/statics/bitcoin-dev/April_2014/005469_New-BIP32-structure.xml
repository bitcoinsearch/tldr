    <summary>In an email exchange on April 23, 2014, Luke-Jr asked how to achieve the expected behavior of mixing funds between accounts. He stated that only a niche user base requires isolated funds. In response, it was suggested that any restrictions on mixing funds should be made clear to users to avoid confusion and a negative experience. The example was given of a user with funds split across two wallets who is unable to spend them - a situation that could lead to frustration and dissatisfaction.</summary>
