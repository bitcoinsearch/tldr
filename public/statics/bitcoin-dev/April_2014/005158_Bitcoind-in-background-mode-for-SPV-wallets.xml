    <summary>On April 9, 2014, Natanael suggested bundling Stratum to allow SPV wallets to connect to Bitcoind. The advantage of using Stratum is that it's currently being used by Electrum and could be an easier way to support SPV clients than creating a new API in Bitcoind. However, Wladimir questioned the need for a new API since P2P should be sufficient for SPV clients to access filtered blocks and transactions, and RPC can be used to manage and query the Bitcoind instance. It's unclear what Stratum would add in this scenario.</summary>
