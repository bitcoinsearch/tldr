    <summary>In an email exchange, Alex Mizrahi and Wladimir discussed the privacy implications of Bloom filters. According to Mizrahi, Bloom filters reveal statistical information about what coins a user owns to anyone they are connected to, making it easy for attackers to deanonymize users even if they do not reuse addresses. Mizrahi suggested that Tor does not offer much protection against this attack. On the other hand, Wladimir pointed out that while downloading everything is an option, it does not require a full node. However, he argued that running a full node would support the network.</summary>
