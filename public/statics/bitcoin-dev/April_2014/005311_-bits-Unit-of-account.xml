    <summary>In the Bitcoin community, there is a resistance to using the term "credit" as a unit of Bitcoin because it is not a credit-based system. However, the average person may not understand what "credit" means and may not care about the distinction even if they do know. Therefore, some believe that using the futuristic and easily understandable term "credit" as a human-friendly unit may be wise. The question remains whether others in the community agree that "credits" have a desirable connotation as a unit of account.</summary>
