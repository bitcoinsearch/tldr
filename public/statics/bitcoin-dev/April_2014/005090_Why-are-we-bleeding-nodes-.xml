    <summary>In an email conversation on July 4th, 2014, Tamas Blummer stated that once a single transaction is pruned in a block, the block can no longer be served to other nodes. The decision of which transactions to prune is custom and can even depend on the wallet(s) of the node. Because of this, instead of returning ranges, it would be more useful to return a bitmap of pruned/full blocks. The context suggests that the node has decided not to prune any transactions from the block, allowing it to return full blocks within that range.</summary>
