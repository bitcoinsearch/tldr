    <summary>It appears that the provided context consists of three separate statements that do not have a direct connection with each other. The first statement suggests that casting a vote does no harm, but there is no indication of what or who this vote is for. The second statement talks about pools joining a blacklist and how there is no harm in doing so. Again, it is not clear what kind of pools or blacklists are being referred to. Finally, the third statement mentions reaching a majority without any context or explanation.Without further information, it is difficult to make sense of these statements or create a cohesive summary. However, it is important to note that providing additional context and clarity is essential for effective communication.</summary>
