    <summary>In an email exchange on April 22, 2014, Jan Møller expressed enthusiasm for implementing BIP 0039 in Mycelium for bip32 wallets. He commented that the protection of secrets such as a HD master seed or private key could enable recovery even in cases of partial theft or loss. Møller suggested using different prefixes for testnet keys/seeds to avoid mixing them up with mainnet keys. He also requested allowing M = 1 and observed that GF(2^8) represented a simpler alternative to Shamir's Secret Sharing. In response, the author of BIP 0039 invited forks of his draft but stated no intention to research GF(2^8) secret sharing schemes at present.</summary>
