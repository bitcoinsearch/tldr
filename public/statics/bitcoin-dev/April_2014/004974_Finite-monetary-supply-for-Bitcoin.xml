    <summary>On April 1, 2014, Pieter Wuille requested a BIP number for a proposal. The request was made on a mailing list where ten people commented on the proposal. However, consensus seemed unlikely due to differing opinions. Despite this, a BIP number was assigned to the proposal - BIP 42. It is unclear whether the bribe mentioned in the email had any influence on the assignment of the BIP number.</summary>
