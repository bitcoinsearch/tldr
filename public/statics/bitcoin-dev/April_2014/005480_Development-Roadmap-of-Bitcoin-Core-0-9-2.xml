    <summary>In an email thread from April 23, 2014, Warren Togami Jr. suggests that for users who need Bitcoin-Qt on an incompatible system, they can at least build it from source. However, Tails users cannot usually build it from source as Tails is a live boot mostly stateless linux distribution for privacy applications. One member of the thread agrees that statically linking QT on Linux generally should be avoided due to theming issues. However, they suggest that perhaps the build process could dump out a separate extra static QT binary just for these other cases. They feel that this would require less work in maintaining it than answering questions and complaints about it.</summary>
