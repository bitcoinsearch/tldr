    <summary>This is an email thread discussing the need for a standard for sharing wallets. While there is agreement on the usefulness of such a standard, there is no agreement on every aspect of it. The plan is to write a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to describe the structure and any wallet that wants to be compatible with it can be so. However, if a wallet wants to use a different format, it cannot call itself BIP XX compatible and nobody will expect it to recover all keys generated by a BIP XX wallet. Each client will implement things differently but this doesn't mean they cannot share the bare minimum of the BIP. If developers agree on a specific BIP, then it should be cross-compatible. It is proposed that they keep their chains separate and only try standardizing after they have a feel for the specific requirements.</summary>
