    <summary>The email exchange shared discusses the use of date formats in BIPs. The author initially believed it to be an April Fool's joke but then realized that all BIPs do indeed use this format. The format being referred to is the date format used in RFC 822, which predates ISO 8601 by half a decade. The author expresses frustration with this choice of format and suggests that any style can be used as long as there is a pledge to 'slay' those who complain about the new style.</summary>
