    <summary>Jonathan is requesting recent data on specific aspects of blockchain transactions. He is interested in the relationship between the 95th percentile transaction propagation time and fees/kilobyte, as well as the total fees. Additionally, Jonathan would like to know the number of blocks bypassing well-propagated transactions based on fees/kilobyte and total fees. Lastly, he is interested in the signed-double-spend confirmation probability compared to broadcast time offset from the first spend. Coinometrics is working on a modified client to capture information on network propagation. Jonathan invited suggestions for any other useful statistics that could assist in the development of software.</summary>
