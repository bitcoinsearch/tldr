    <summary>In an email exchange dated April 24, 2014, between Wladimir, Gregory Maxwell, and Warren Togami Jr., they discussed options for building against the 4.6 Qt headers to avoid a library swap. Compatibility was mentioned as a priority, which led to the suggestion of losing some GUI features. Wladimir questioned if the version was truly Qt 4.6 and not 4.7 or 4.8 since he expected more symbols in the latter versions. He asked for clarification on this matter.</summary>
