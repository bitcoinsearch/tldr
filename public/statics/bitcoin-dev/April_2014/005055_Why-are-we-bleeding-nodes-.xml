    <summary>It seems that Bitcoin Wallet is not phasing out into SPV wallets, despite rumors to the contrary. However, as of February 24th, there has been a sharp change in the "current installs" graph of Bitcoin Wallet, which used to grow at about 20,000 per month, but has since barely moved horizontally. It is speculated that this is due to a large number of users losing interest after losing their money in the MtGox scandal. On another note, it has been observed that the number of Bitcoin nodes has been decreasing since the beginning of February, from 10,000 to 8,500 and still falling. While there are various reasons for this decline, one potential solution suggested is to implement an exit survey for node operators to provide insight into why they stopped running their node.</summary>
