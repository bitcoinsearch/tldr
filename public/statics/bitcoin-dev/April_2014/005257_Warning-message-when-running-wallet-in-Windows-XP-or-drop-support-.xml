    <summary>During a email conversation on 04/16/2014 at 09:27 AM, Kevin suggested adding an alert message to wallet installers regarding the non-compatibility with Windows XP. However, it was pointed out that it's not their responsibility to police that and Bitcoin Core can still be safely used as a full node on XP. The issue lies with the wallet functionality, which users should be cautious about. Additionally, only a small percentage of people fall under the intersection of running XP, having systems capable of running Bitcoin Core, and using the wallet feature.</summary>
