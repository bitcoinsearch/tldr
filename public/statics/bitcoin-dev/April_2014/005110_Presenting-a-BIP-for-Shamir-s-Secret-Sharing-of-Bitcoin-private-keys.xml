    <summary>In a discussion about changing the key fingerprint algorithm, the participants consider using CRC16. They also discuss the choice of fields for an implementation of this BIP, noting that any implementation will need big integer arithmetic to do base-58 anyway. The operations required for SSS are nearly the same as for base-58 and can probably be done by the same subset of the chosen bignum library. While using GF(2^8) would add complexity to both the BIP and its implementations, the maths in GF(2^8) is so simple that this additional complexity can be considered negligible. As a co-author of a bitcoin application running on a real microcontroller, the speaker notes they were also going to implement their SSS over a 256-bit prime field. However, uniform processing of secrets of any size (instead of using different primes for different cases) is a valid argument in favor of GF(2^8). Ultimately, the speaker has no preference one way or another.</summary>
