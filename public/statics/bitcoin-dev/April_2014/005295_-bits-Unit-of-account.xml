    <summary>This email thread between members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list discusses the proposal to introduce a new unit of account for Bitcoin called "bits." The proposal suggests that one bitcoin (BTC) would equal one million bits (bits), and one bit would equal 100 satoshis. Some members express concern about introducing a new prefix, which they argue is unnecessary given the existing divisions in u/mBTC. Others note that people already use wallets other than Bitcoin Core and suggest that the importance of this decision will fade over time. Several links are provided to earlier discussions about bits and related proposals.</summary>
