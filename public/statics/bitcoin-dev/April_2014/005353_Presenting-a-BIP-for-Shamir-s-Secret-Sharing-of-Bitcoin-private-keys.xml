    <summary>In an email exchange on April 22, 2014, Jan Møller discusses the encoding of N-of-M shares. Møller suggests encoding N-of-M in 1 byte and expresses that he doesn't see good use cases with more than 17 shares. However, he agrees that machines may be able to make use of it. Additionally, Møller notes that the byte that encodes M-1 is optional, allowing for space concerns to be addressed by omitting it along with the checksum.</summary>
