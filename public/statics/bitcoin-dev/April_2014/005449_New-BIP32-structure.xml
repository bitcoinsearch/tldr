    <summary>The conversation between Luke-Jr and Pavol Rusnak on April 23, 2014, involved the suggestion to scan all possible branches under the BIP-defined structure for UTXOs to obtain the balance for a wallet. While account balances are metadata that cannot be known from the seed alone, a more detailed wallet file format could be defined to restore accounts. Tamas Blummer argued that the wallet needs to know how it got the UTXO in order to spend it, but Luke-Jr disagreed, stating that the assigned scriptPubKey and secret(s) required to satisfy it are sufficient. In the context of BIP32, individual secrets per UTXO are irrelevant and inaccessible, and key coordinates are re-created on-the-fly if needed.</summary>
