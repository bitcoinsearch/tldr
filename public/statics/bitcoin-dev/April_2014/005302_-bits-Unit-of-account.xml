    <summary>The writer of the message has given thought to how to explain Bitcoin to those who are not technically inclined, suggesting that 1 bit = 1e-6 BTC is an easy and straightforward way to do so. They also propose using "XBT" as one "bit". The idea of there being a million bits in a Bitcoin is seen as highly intelligible for the average person, with any potential issues regarding the term "bit" considered a non-issue for the general population. Another individual named Alan Reiner responds to the message, indicating support for the proposal as long as it adheres to the 1e-6 standard.</summary>
