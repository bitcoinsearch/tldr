    <summary>The integrity of Bitcoin is more important than personal preferences and nobody has the right to decide which valid scripts in the blockchain will be disregarded. It is important for Bitcoin to maintain its neutrality and if it loses this property, it is not Bitcoin anymore. Discussions regarding such issues can be held on the bitcoin-development email list. BitUndo, a double spending service, was being used to create fake confirmations for transactions. It is owned by Eric Springer, who joined Github on February 11, 2010. However, the wizards can create a site like BitUndo in a few hours.</summary>
