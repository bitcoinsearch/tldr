    <summary>Chain pruning is a complex project that spans across codebases. Attempting to implement it solely by changing Bitcoin Core would break all SPV clients based on bitcoinj, requiring upgrading both codebases at the same time. Gavin's shift from Core maintainer to chief scientist may have been influenced by future changes that will require significant planning and involve multiple projects. From a technical perspective, extending addr broadcasts is necessary so nodes can broadcast how much of the chain they have, and teaching both Core and bitcoinj how to search for nodes with enough of the chain for them to use. Currently, bitcoinj does not use addr broadcasts at all, which requires fixing an incomplete patch, improving Bitcoin Core to make the results of getaddr more usable, and ideally as high quality as what DNS seeds provide to avoid slowing down initial connect time, an important performance metric.</summary>
