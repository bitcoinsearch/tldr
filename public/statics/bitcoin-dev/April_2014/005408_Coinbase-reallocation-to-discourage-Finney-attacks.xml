    <summary>In this context, Mike Hearn and Justus Ranvier are discussing the possibility of miners rejecting a block that has been mined. Hearn states that it would require a majority consensus among miners to orphan a block, and suggests that an out-of-band mechanism for measuring consensus is unnecessary when the protocol itself can be used. Ranvier argues that changing the network could result in it no longer being able to process scripts as intended. Hearn responds by pointing out that Bitcoin already imposes many arbitrary rules beyond script execution, such as the inflation schedule.The conversation takes place over email but is posted publicly on a blog. The author of the post emphasizes the importance of privacy and encourages the use of email encryption. A PGP signature is included at the end of the email for added security. An attachment containing PGP keys is also included.</summary>
