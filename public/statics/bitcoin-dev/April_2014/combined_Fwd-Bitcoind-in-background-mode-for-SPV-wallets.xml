    <summary>On April 9th, 2014, Brian Hoffman expressed concerns about the impact of running a full node on users' disk storage. He questioned if users would be more likely to enable this feature if it was not required due to space constraints. Wladimir, in response, clarified that users who choose to run a full node must have sufficient bandwidth and disk space to support it.However, for those who opt for Bitcoin Core as a wallet, they can still have the option to run a full node while selecting their preferred wallet. This means that users can use Bitcoin Core wallets without having to run a full node if they don't have enough disk space or bandwidth to support it.Overall, the conversation between Brian Hoffman and Wladimir highlights the importance of considering the resources required to run a full node when choosing a Bitcoin wallet. While running a full node can provide numerous benefits, including increased security and privacy, users must have the necessary resources to support it.</summary>
