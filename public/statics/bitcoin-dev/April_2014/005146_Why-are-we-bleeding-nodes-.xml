    <summary>In an email conversation between Wendell and Wladimir on April 9, 2014, Wendell expressed his belief that it was possible to make desktop and mobile wallets very simple and user-friendly. He asked whether this was a priority for the Bitcoin community and requested additional contributors to Hive. In response, Wladimir questioned how this relates to the issue of nodes and suggested the possibility of packaging an optional bitcoind with the wallet, which would be automatically managed in the background, allowing users to run a full node if they desire.</summary>
