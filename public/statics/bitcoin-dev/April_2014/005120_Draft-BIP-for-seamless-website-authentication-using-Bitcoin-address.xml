    <summary>It is important to avoid making sweeping assumptions when it comes to the value of a product. The ease of installing a plugin, for example, may be worth it when compared to the effort and cost involved in other aspects of using the product. Similarly, in 2005 people claimed that nobody wanted to download apps anymore, but Google Earth's success with over 400 million installs proved otherwise. It is important to consider the unique qualities and value of a product before making assumptions about its reception.</summary>
