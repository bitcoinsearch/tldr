    <summary>In an email conversation from April 2014, Brian Hoffman questioned how the activation of pruning in Bitcoin core would affect user disk storage. He speculated that users would face space constraints with this feature. However, if pruning is activated, a full node could be supported within approximately 4 gigabytes of storage space. This would provide enough room to store the unspent transaction output at about 350 megabytes and a few gigabytes for blocks to serve out. To determine how much disk usage agility SPV wallet developers thought was necessary, Wladimir sought input from them.</summary>
