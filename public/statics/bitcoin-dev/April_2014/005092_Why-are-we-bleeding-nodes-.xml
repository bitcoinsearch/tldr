    <summary>Tamas Blummer, the founder of Bitsofproof, has commented on the pruning process of blockchain. He considers a fully pruned blockchain equivalent to UTXO, where blocks that no longer hold any unspent transactions are reduced to headers. However, he believes there is no harm in retaining more blocks. In response to Tamas Blummer's comments, Gregory Maxwell stated that pruning does not work in the way suggested by Tamas Blummer, and that it can work happily on a whole block at a time basis regardless of whether all the transactions in it are spent or not.</summary>
