    <summary>Flavien Charlon has asked for Mark Friedenbach's opinion on an approach that he has taken. Mark Friedenbach thinks that the approach has significant flaws. He pointed out two main flaws in the approach which were including asset tagging information without validation and using fixed increments for share sizes, which is not future-proof as the minimum output size changes based on the minimum fee. Additionally, he mentioned that a capital of 54 btc for a million shares is unacceptable. Mark Friedenbach suggested Flavien Charlon to look at Bitcoin-X mailing list where these issues have been mostly worked out. He also provided a link to padded order-based coloring scheme worked out here.</summary>
