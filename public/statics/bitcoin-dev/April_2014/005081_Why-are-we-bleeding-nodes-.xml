    <summary>Running a full node for Bitcoin is not as cheap as it might seem. The bandwidth usage alone can be costly, with someone in Singapore spending around $90 per month just on that. In one 30-day period, one user's node received 36.8 GB of data and sent 456.5 GB of data. However, one person argued that running a full node only costs about $1 in disk space and a couple cents in power per month, so it's not necessarily beyond the capabilities of casual users. Nonetheless, running a full node consumes a significant amount of data traffic, which can add up to a large expense over time.</summary>
