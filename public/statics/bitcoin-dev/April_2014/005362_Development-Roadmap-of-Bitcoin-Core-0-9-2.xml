    <summary>The Bitcoin Core developers have announced the development roadmap for v0.9.2, which will mostly focus on bug-fixes and translation updates. The feature and string freeze will start in three weeks from May 2014. This roadmap is aimed to communicate project intent and better organize volunteers. The developers may delay particular goals if there are good reasons on a case-by-case basis. Non-developers and translators can get involved in testing unofficial deterministic nightly builds which are available at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=571414.0. Transifex allows open source projects to coordinate the work of many translators. English language source strings from Bitcoin Core are synchronized to the Transifex project periodically. Those strings are then translated by contributors who create free accounts and senior contributors can be promoted to a Reviewer or Maintainer role for each language. Developers pull from Transifex to merge translated strings back into Bitcoin Core. The Bitcoin-Translators mailing list is an announce-only mailing list for developers to communicate to translators at specific times when new translations are needed.Prior to an intended release, a String Freeze is declared on a specific date to ensure that translators have a reasonable amount of time to translate new or modified source strings so their work can be included in a release. v0.9.2 is planned to be released directly from the master branch so translations for this upcoming release can be developed directly. Laanwj came up with a great idea for dealing with future releases where translations for both diverged stable and master branches can be kept simultaneously in Transifex, with scripts automating the process of merging strings and separating them back to the diverged branches.</summary>
