    <summary>Tamas Blummer, the founder of Bitsofproof, prefers to start with an SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) and later upgrade to a full node if needed. This statement was made in response to a message from Mike Hearn on April 7th, 2014. Hearn suggested shipping pre-baked databases that are auditable and calculated up to the last checkpoint for people to download, so they can immediately boot up their node without recalculating everything from scratch every time. Hearn believed it wasn't sustainable in the long run to continue recalculating everything.</summary>
