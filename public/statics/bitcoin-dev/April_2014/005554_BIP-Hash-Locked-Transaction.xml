    <summary>An oracle can associate a hash with each possible outcome, making it useful for betting. When the outcome is known, the corresponding preimage will unlock the transaction. This approach has several advantages over multi-sig script, including not needing involvement in each specific transaction, having the same resolution for everyone who makes a bet on a specific event outcome, no need for two-way communication and no need for a special protocol. The oracle could publish the unlocking preimage on a web page, and participants would manually enter it into their clients.</summary>
