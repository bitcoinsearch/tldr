    <summary>In this context, the difficulty lies in sending a double-spend after the original transaction. It is suggested that sending a non-standard transaction to Eligius would normally suffice, but in this particular case, it is not possible. This method defeats Andresen's proposed double-spend-relay patch as the double-spend is a non-standard transaction. The reason why sending a non-standard tx to Eligius first does not work in this scenario is not explicitly stated. However, it is questioned whether LuckyBit is connected directly to Eligius and if Eligius relays non-standard transactions.</summary>
