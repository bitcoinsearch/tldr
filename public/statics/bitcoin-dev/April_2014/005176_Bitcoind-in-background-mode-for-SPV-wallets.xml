    <summary>The email thread discusses various ideas to improve the existing Bitcoin network. Marek suggests that there might be many Bitcoind instances running, but they do not have properly configured port forwarding. He proposes finding a way to expose these already existing instances to the internet without reworking the architecture. He also suggests bundling ipv6 tunnelling into Bitcoind so that any instance becomes ipv6-reachable automatically. Gregory Maxwell responds by stating that existing implementations are inefficient in many known ways and that the list is for developing protocol and implementations including improving their efficiency. He argues that Bitcoin has low resource requirements and that some large number of users do not like the efficiency of existing implementations. He hopes his response clarifies the discussion.</summary>
