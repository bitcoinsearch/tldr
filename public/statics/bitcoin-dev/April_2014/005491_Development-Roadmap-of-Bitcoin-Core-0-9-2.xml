    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Warren Togami Jr., the topic of Bitcoin-Qt on an incompatible system was discussed. Tails users, who use a mostly stateless Linux distribution for privacy applications, cannot build Bitcoin-Qt from source. The idea of running a full node on a stateless system was also questioned. The suggestion was made to remove one symbol or put it behind #ifdef COMPATIBILITY_BUILD. Another option was to build against the 4.6 Qt headers instead of statically building, which would lose some GUI features but may be more compatible. Wladimir signed off on the email thread.</summary>
