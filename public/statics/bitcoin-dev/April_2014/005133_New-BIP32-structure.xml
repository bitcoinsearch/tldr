    <summary>In an email exchange between developers discussing the sharing of a single BIP32 tree across different currency types, alternative suggestions were made. One option was to use one seed across different chains but have separate master nodes that are derived by replacing the key string "Bitcoin seed" with something chain-specific. Another suggestion was to have every encoded node, including master nodes, with a chain-specific serialization magic, which is almost the same as the first suggestion except that the m/cointype' in m/cointype'/account'/change/n is replaced by different masters. There was some disagreement about using "cointype" in the bip32 path, but it was seen as the most elegant solution for fulfilling all requirements for a single backup, separating pubkeys, and handling all coins by one master.</summary>
