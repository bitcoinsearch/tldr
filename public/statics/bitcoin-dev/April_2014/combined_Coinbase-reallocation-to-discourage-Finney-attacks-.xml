    <summary>Sergio D. Lerner, an active member of the bitcoin-research list, has recently joined the bitcoin-development mailing list to participate in research discussions. He shared a year-old post about Bitcoin Eternal Choice for the Dark Side Attack or ECDSA which deals with eroding confidence in Bitcoin by providing double-spends as a service. This issue is related to Peter Todd's recent post on BitUndo's problems. Mike Hearn discussed the implications of BitUndo's launch of Finney attacks as a service for Bitcoin's security on the bitcoin-development list. Finney attacks are when miners secretly work on a block containing a double spend and run to the merchant and pay when they eventually find a block. A proposed solution to discourage blocks that perform Finney attacks is to have honest miners refuse to build on them; however, this idea has some problems. Dishonest blocks can be identified out of band by having honest miners anonymously submit double spends against themselves to the service using a separate tool. Miners can vote to reallocate the coinbase value of bad blocks before they mature. This mechanism would only apply to coinbases, not arbitrary transactions, thus it cannot be used to steal arbitrary users' bitcoins.</summary>
