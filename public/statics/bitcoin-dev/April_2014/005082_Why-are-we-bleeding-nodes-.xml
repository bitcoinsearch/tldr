    <summary>The email conversation between Mike Hearn, Brent Shambaugh and Gregory Maxwell discussed the process of setting up a Litecoin node. The primary resources needed for this are disk space and bandwidth, as it uses no electricity unlike mining. One suggestion made was to create pre-baked databases calculated up to the last checkpoint, allowing people to download them and set up their node quickly without needing to recalculate the entire thing from scratch. However, the resource requirements of a full node are moving beyond what low resource users can handle. This is an implementation issue that needs to be improved to make it work better for low resource users. The discussion also touched on the importance of distinguishing between issues that can be fixed and those that require changing goals/incentives.</summary>
