    <summary>In this email conversation, Sergio Lerner shared a link to his post on 5-second block intervals and mentioned that NimbleCoin is a new altcoin that allows 100 transactions per second and is based on BitcoinJ. The recipient of the email found it fascinating but raised concerns about the sync time for SPV wallets with so many headers. They also discussed Pieter's experiment with relaying blocks as hash lists and a new protocol called MinCen that aims to achieve instant payments.</summary>
