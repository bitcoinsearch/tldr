    <summary>Wladimir is creating a guide to help people install and set up a Debian VM for gitian building. The guide can be used on any operating system that has VirtualBox, with the aim of making it easier for people to get started with gitian builds. The link to the rendered version of the guide on Github is provided and users are encouraged to give feedback or report any issues encountered while following the guide. In an email exchange with devrandom, Wladimir provides instructions on how to create a basic virtual machine for gitian builds. Although automation using vmbuilder and/or vagrant is suggested, the purpose of the provided steps is to provide an exact guide that can be followed by anyone without requiring scripting languages. The hope is that over time, Gitian itself will become easier to use, thereby reducing the number of steps required in the first place. The conversation between Wladimir and devrandom centers around the process of building a basic virtual machine using Gitian for gitian builds. Devrandom wonders if the process could be scripted, to which Wladimir replies that everything can probably be scripted using vmbuilder or vagrant as suggested by Nick Simpson. However, the point of providing exact steps is to allow people to follow them and build a basic virtual machine for gitian builds without requiring scripting. Wladimir hopes that Gitian will continue to improve to make it easier for newcomers to get started. On April 2, 2014, Wladimir announced his work on the guide to install and set up a Debian VM for gitian building. The intention behind this was to simplify the process of starting with gitian builds. The link to the rendered version of the guide on Github was shared, and users were asked to share their comments and patches. Additionally, users were encouraged to let Wladimir know if they faced any problems while following the guide. Miron responded to Wladimir's email with an expression of admiration.</summary>
