    <summary>The email thread from April 9, 2014, between slush and Laszlo discusses the slow deployment of IPv6 to server environments and ways to bundle IPv6 tunneling into bitcoind to make instances IPv6-reachable automatically. Teredo is a potential solution for this, as it is available by default on Microsoft systems and works for bitcoin as well. However, there may be security settings around it that need to be considered. In the US, AT&amp;T/CenturyLink provide IPv6 by way of 6RD for DSL customers and Comcast has native IPv6 on residential cable modems, but most people just plug their CPE into a NAT router without IPv6, which keeps many nodes from being reachable. Hurricane Electric is a tunnel broker that allows users to use their own IPv6 addresses. To educate operators about IPv6 and improve reachability, Laszlo suggests adding an IPv6 checkbox in the settings with a link to an explanation or a built-in checker that shows red/green for different aspects of reachability (v4/teredo/v6). Leveraging IPv6 through an application running its own tunnels is not recommended.</summary>
