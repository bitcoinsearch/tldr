    <summary>On April 23, 2014, a discussion occurred between Slush and Luke-Jr about the functionality of wallets. Luke-Jr stated that any wallet should be able to import all coins but would only use account 0. He also mentioned that once the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) were in the wallet, they were no longer associated with the address or any other details of how they were received. Slush disagreed with this statement and said that wallets do not see UTXOs until they scan all possible branches/accounts on an HD node import, regardless of which features it supports.</summary>
