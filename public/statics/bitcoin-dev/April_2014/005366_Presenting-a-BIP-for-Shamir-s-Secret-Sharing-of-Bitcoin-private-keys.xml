    <summary>The difference between testnet and mainnet is a distinct issue from bitcoin vs altcoin. However, few of the altcoins were able to understand this differentiation. Tamas Blummer, in an email dated 04/22/2014, expressed his opinion that extra encoding for testnet is not necessary complexity when compared to many alt chains. He also suggested that BIPS should remain chain agnostic. Blummer is associated with bitsofproof.com.</summary>
