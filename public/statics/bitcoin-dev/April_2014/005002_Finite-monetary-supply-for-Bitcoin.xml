    <summary>Matt Whitlock pointed out that the creation date in the BIP header has the wrong format and should be 01-04-2014, as per BIP 1. Although he initially thought it was a joke, it turned out that all BIPs use this format because RFC 822 predates ISO 8601 by half a decade. While it would be difficult to patch all mail servers, adopting a more sensible date format would only require a few people to update their scripts. One possible solution suggested by Matt is to have one person run sed s/parseabomination/parsedate/g.</summary>
