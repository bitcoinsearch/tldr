    <summary>The context of the conversation is about a forked project from Bitcoin core. Kevin has developed a secure tax "mode" for bitcoin in Autoit and wants people to review it on GitHub. Jeff Garzik warns against visiting a URL that looks like a phishing attempt and considers it a poor choice of URL. There is some speculation that the site may be serving up exploits selectively, targeting specific individuals while showing others a 'domain for sale' message. Kevin defends his choice of URL and insists that the project is serious. The conversation takes place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
