    <summary>The conversation revolves around the use of TREZOR for web authentication purposes. While TREZOR requires a web plugin, it is not mandatory as browsers have the capability to create private keys and upload public parts seamless for the user. Upgrades can be made in key management, which is a small subcomponent that the Bitcoin world is trying hard to solve. A modified version of Chrome or Firefox that takes the key from a BIP32 hierarchy or 12-words scheme can be used but still reuse all the rest of it. TREZOR could also support a simple request/response protocol via USB plugin allowing a server to display some arbitrary text and get confirmation, increasing demand and pushing down prices for Bitcoin users. Slush's main comments on BIP were not to use bitcoin addresses directly and not to encourage services to use "login" for financial purposes. Mixing authentication and financial services is wrong, and a function should be used to generate other private/public keys from the bitcoin seed/private key to prevent leaking bitcoin-related data to the website. Eric LarchevÃªque was unsure of the risks associated with using your Bitcoin address as an authentication key.</summary>
