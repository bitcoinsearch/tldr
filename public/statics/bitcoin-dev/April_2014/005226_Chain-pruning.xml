    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin security, Pieter Wuille notes that relying on the longest chain (with the most proof of work) to commit to a valid UTXO set is a strict reduction in security. However, it is guaranteed that the longer chain starting before a checkpoint will not be accepted suddenly since current bitcoin code already sets blockchain checkpoints from time to time. It would be interesting to store only unspent wallets before the last checkpoint and verify "unspent wallet accounting" using only checkpoint data. The merkle tree can detect data corruption or manipulation in a local hard disk.</summary>
