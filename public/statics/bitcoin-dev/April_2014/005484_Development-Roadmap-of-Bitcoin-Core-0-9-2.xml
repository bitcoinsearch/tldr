    <summary>In an email conversation on April 23, 2014, Gregory Maxwell stated that Tails users usually can't build it from source and that it's a live boot mostly stateless Linux distribution for privacy applications. He also added that Tails is really good in general. While agreeing that QT shouldn't be statically linked on Linux generally, he suggested having the build process dump out a separate, extra static QT binary just for these other cases. This idea was well received.</summary>
