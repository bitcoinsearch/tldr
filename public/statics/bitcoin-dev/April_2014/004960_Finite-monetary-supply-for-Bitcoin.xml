    <summary>In a controversial proposal, Pieter has suggested that Bitcoin should be turned into a limited-supply currency. Pieter believes that the current subsidy schedule is unacceptable and has written a small draft BIP to support his proposal. He points out that Dogecoin has already demonstrated how easy such changes can be made and considers this to be a worthwhile idea to explore. The full text of the proposal can be found on https://gist.github.com/sipa/9920696. Pieter encourages comments on his proposal.</summary>
