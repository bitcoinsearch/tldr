    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.1 is now available as a security update and recommended for immediate upgrade from the previous versions. It's particularly crucial to upgrade if you currently have version 0.9.0 installed and are using the graphical interface or bitcoind from any pre-0.9.1 version, and have enabled SSL for RPC and configured allowip to allow rpc connections from potentially hostile hosts. The new release includes OpenSSL 1.0.1g that fixes the vulnerabilities which can affect the Bitcoin Core software, including CVE-2014-0160 ("heartbleed") and CVE-2014-0076. No code changes were made between 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 except for changes in dependencies. Users should shut down their older version before installing the new one and wait until it has completely shut down, which might take a few minutes for older versions, then run the installer on Windows or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.1, your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.The issue tracker at Github should be used to report any bugs. Credits go to the OpenSSL team for fixing the vulnerabilities quickly.</summary>
