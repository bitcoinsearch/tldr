    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Jeff Garzik, the issue of standardization of public keys in the redeem script was discussed. Voegtlin suggested that the public keys should be sorted in a standardized order to prevent the p2sh address from depending on their order. Garzik agreed with this solution, mentioning that it had already been implemented in some wallets. Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, works for BitPay, Inc., a company that provides Bitcoin payment processing services.</summary>
