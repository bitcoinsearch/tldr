    <summary>In an email conversation between Sergio Lerner and Mike Hearn, the issue of handling 17K block headers a day in NimbleCoin currency's SPV mode was discussed. Lerner proposed a variation of the standard headers-only SPV mode called SmartSPV, which he believes could also be implemented by BitcoinJ for Bitcoin. Additionally, Lerner mentioned that if one has the freedom to specify things and control the headers, then SPV evaluations of work can have log(n) scaling. This concept was further explained in a link provided by Lerner to a mail archive discussion. As a suggestion to address the issue of headers in reverse, Lerner referred to a wiki page on reverse header-fetching sync authored by Gmaxwell. The page provides ideas and insights on how to handle header syncing more efficiently.</summary>
