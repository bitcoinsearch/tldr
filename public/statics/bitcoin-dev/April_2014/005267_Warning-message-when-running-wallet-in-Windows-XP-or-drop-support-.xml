    <summary>In an email exchange between Mark Friedenbach and Kevin on April 16th, 2014, Kevin suggested implementing an auto-update function for Bitcoin Core to address its vulnerabilities. However, Friedenbach rejected this idea, stating that it would create a single point of failure that could lead to the theft of every bitcoin held in a Bitcoin Core wallet if compromised. Furthermore, even accidental implementation could cause a hard-forking bug to be rolled out or worsened.</summary>
