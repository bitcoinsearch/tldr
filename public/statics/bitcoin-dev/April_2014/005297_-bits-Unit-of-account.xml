    <summary>The discussion is about using "bits" as a new unit of measurement for Bitcoin instead of the current "BTC". There are concerns about the term "bit" being too overloaded, but some supporters of the idea suggest that it could be a good fit. The integration of alternative units into Armory is being worked on, and there is a desire to get commitments from other wallet developers before making it the default. Previous discussions about "bits" as a unit of measurement have taken place among engineers, but there is concern that the average person may not understand what it means and could make mistakes when sending transactions. There are also suggestions that people who do not understand Bitcoin can simply use satoshis instead. Overall, the discussion revolves around finding a more user-friendly and easily understandable way to measure Bitcoin.</summary>
