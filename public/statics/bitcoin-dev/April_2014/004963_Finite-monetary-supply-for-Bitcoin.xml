    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed a controversial idea on the Bitcoin-development mailing list on April 1, 2014. He believed that the current subsidy schedule could not be accepted anymore and suggested turning Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency. He provided a draft BIP for this proposal which can be found on GitHub. Wuille acknowledged that his proposal was controversial but argued that it was worth exploring. He also pointed out that Dogecoin had already shown how easy such changes could be made. Additionally, he suggested allowing coin bases to be merged from orphan blocks so that miners could be fairly rewarded even if unlucky. The proposal prompted comments and discussions on the mailing list.</summary>
