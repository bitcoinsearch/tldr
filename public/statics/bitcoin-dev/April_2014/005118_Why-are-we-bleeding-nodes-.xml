    <summary>Multi-sig is a security measure that requires infrastructure and is not a solution that can be easily implemented. The necessary protocols and techniques do not yet exist, and there is little incentive to create them. However, there are some web wallets such as BitGo and greenaddress.it that offer multi-sig capabilities. An integration plan for bitcoinj has also been developed, but it is complex like most features.</summary>
