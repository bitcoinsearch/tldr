    <summary>The discussion was started by Laszlo Hanyecz regarding a warning that Bitcoin Core should issue to users using Windows XP. He argued that high-level applications like wallets need not concern themselves with the rest of the system, and that there are many reasons why users may still use outdated operating systems. He noted that such warnings sound like behavior modification tactics aimed at forcing users to shell out money for a newer version of the operating system. Roy Badami asked whether there should be a similar warning for OS X 10.6, which is less known than XP, and Pieter Wuille suggested that Bitcoin Core should detect when it's running on Windows XP and warn the user about the risks. Kevin suggested an autoupdate function that pulls a workaround off the server to face the vulnerabilities. The email chain also included links to free resources on graph databases.</summary>
