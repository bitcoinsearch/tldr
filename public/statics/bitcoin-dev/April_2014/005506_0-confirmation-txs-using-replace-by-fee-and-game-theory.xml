    <summary>The discussion revolves around a scheme that discourages Finney attacks in Bitcoin. While the idea may work, it is deemed an "ugly hack" since it requires users to have extra funds to pay for transactions. This poses a problem for those who do not have enough balance to make a purchase. On the other hand, some prefer the hassle of a green address notary instead of always having to ensure double the amount needed for a transaction. A participant questions if the scheme addresses the current issue with Finney attacks, but this is left unanswered. The email concludes with an advertisement for eXo Platform, followed by a reminder about the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
