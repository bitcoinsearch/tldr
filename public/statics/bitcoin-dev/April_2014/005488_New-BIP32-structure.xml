    <summary>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Thomas Voegtlin, they discussed the use of BIP64 in clients such as Electrum and Multibit. Specifically, they talked about the differences between BIP32 and BIP64 when it comes to defining accounts. According to Wuille, BIP64 has a stricter definition for accounts than BIP32. In BIP32, accounts can be used for various purposes such as subwallets, receive accounts, multisig addresses, etc. However, in BIP64, accounts are strictly used for subwallets. This led to some confusion on whether recurring payments, receive accounts, and multisig addresses could still be used with BIP64. The proposal requires a different purpose code and another BIP, making it incompatible with the draft. This could limit functionality for wallets that want to implement recurring payment chains without having to generate entirely different wallets that cannot share funds across them.</summary>
