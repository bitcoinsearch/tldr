    <summary>In an email exchange on 4th July 2014, Tamas Blummer discussed the sequential validation process for blocks. He suggested that the validation step could be deferred until all the previous blocks are loaded and continuous. The question arose as to how to find these blocks. In response, a suggestion was made to have nodes advertise the range of full blocks they possess, enabling synchronization from the advertised ranges.This exchange relates to the importance of block validation in blockchain technology. When a new block is added to the chain, it must be validated by each node on the network to ensure that it is legitimate. This process typically involves checking that the block meets certain criteria, such as having a valid proof-of-work or being signed by a trusted party. Validation can be a time-consuming process, particularly if there are many blocks to be validated.Blummer's suggestion of deferring validation until all previous blocks are loaded and continuous would streamline the process by reducing the number of validations required. However, this approach relies on being able to identify the relevant blocks, which is where the suggestion of having nodes advertise their block ranges comes in.By advertising the range of blocks they possess, nodes can facilitate synchronization between themselves and other nodes on the network. This can help to ensure that all nodes have access to the same set of blocks, making it easier to validate new additions to the chain. Overall, this exchange highlights some of the challenges involved in maintaining a secure and efficient blockchain network.</summary>
