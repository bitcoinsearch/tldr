    <summary>A suggestion has been made to distribute partial proofs of work and prime memory pools with transactions. This suggestion is similar to what p2pool does, which results in a 1% better return than zero-fee mining pools due to lower stale rates. In regards to block propagation times, there is a suggestion to allow peers to request the list of transaction hashes that make up a block and then make a follow-up request to only download any unknown transactions. The potential benefit of this idea is not known as no math has been done on it yet.</summary>
