    <summary>The security implications of embedding files into payment request are cautioned by Ross. Even the presumed safe file formats like images have had security issues in the past (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms11-006). In the longer term, Ross suggests embedding PaymentRequest directly into web pages through the &lt;iframe&gt; tag, which could potentially eliminate the need for BIP0072 and improve user interface integration. However, this approach would require browser plugins.In response to Ross' suggestion, Mike Hearn points out that PaymentRequests are limited to 50,000 bytes, which he believes is more than enough for payment messages. Although it might be nice to have images and other elements in payment requests to enhance UI, the current version should suffice with 50kb limit.</summary>
