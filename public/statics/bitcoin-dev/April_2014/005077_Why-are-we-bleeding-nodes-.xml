    <summary>In an email exchange from April 7, 2014, Mike Hearn discusses issues related to the validation process of Bitcoin. According to him, the problem with slow validation is not the actual validation itself, but rather the lack of parallel fetching and the existence of slow peers. He suggests that making the signature gate adaptive and deploying the 6x faster ECDSA code could improve the situation in the future.He recommends checking out sipa's headers first branch, which has no problem saturating a 20mbit/sec pipe when syncing up. It seems that the main issue at hand is not the validity of Bitcoin transactions, but rather the speed at which they can be processed and validated. By implementing these improvements, it could lead to a faster and more efficient system overall.</summary>
