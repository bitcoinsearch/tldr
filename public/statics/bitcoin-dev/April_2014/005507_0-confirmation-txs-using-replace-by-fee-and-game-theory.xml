    <summary>The context discusses a proposed scheme to discourage Finney attacks by making every block a Finney attack that charges the maximum double spending fee possible. However, this solution does not solve the problem as it still allows for double spending in certain scenarios such as when purchasing goods on contract. The author suggests that a better solution would be to simply ask local businesses if they would be willing to accept a form of payment that allows anyone to steal from them by paying double the purchase price to some other random person. This proposal is met with skepticism as no business would willingly participate in such a scheme.</summary>
