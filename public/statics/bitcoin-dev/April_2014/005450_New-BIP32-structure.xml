    <summary>In an email thread dated April 23, 2014, Luke-Jr suggested a method for scanning all branches for UTXOs to determine the balance for a wallet. He noted that account balances are metadata and cannot be known from the seed alone. If one wants to have a way to restore accounts, they must define a more detailed wallet file format which could be built on top of this. Pavol Rusnak responded with a list of possible reasons for misunderstanding the issue at hand, including not having read the document, not understanding what accounts are, not understanding how restoring accounts work, and not understanding that account funds are not meant to be mixed together. He also encouraged reading the document in question.</summary>
