    <summary>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and Tier Nolan, the topic of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) came up. Todd suggested that instead of creating yet another format specific type like Nolan's BIP, they should consider writing a BIP to examine how the isStandard() rules could be removed. Todd believed that removing isStandard() would provide more flexibility and suggested a whitelist of low risk opcodes as a reasonable compromise. He proposed that these two BIPs would be smaller changes that add functionality for specific use-cases. However, he acknowledged that changing the entire philosophy behind isStandard() would be a much bigger change than adding one new type.</summary>
