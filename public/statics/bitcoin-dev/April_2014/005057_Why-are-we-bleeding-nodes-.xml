    <summary>In an email conversation on April 7, 2014, Gregory Maxwell mentioned that the node count for Bitcoin had fallen below 8500 a few months prior. This decline had been consistent since the change in bitcoin.org. Unfortunately, there was no access to old data from Bitnodes.io to verify this information. It is worth noting that the Bitnodes counts were always higher than Maxwell's or sipa's node counts.</summary>
