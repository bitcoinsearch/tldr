    <summary>The author discusses a shift away from a trustless system towards a more democratic one, acknowledging the imperfections that come with humans running and using the system. The question of what changes are acceptable and which violate the social contract will continue to be debated in the future. The author asserts that arguments against change for its own sake are not sufficient and any argument must carefully analyze the costs and benefits. Ultimately, the answer to this question will differ on a case by case basis, but it is important to consider the expectations and desires of Bitcoin users as the system evolves.</summary>
