    <summary>In an email conversation between Pavol Rusnak and Luke-Jr on April 23, 2014, the topic of BIP64 compatibility was discussed. Luke-Jr argued that as long as a user has a way to specify which subwallet they are accessing in single-subwallet clients, there should be no problem with BIP64 compatibility. However, Pavol Rusnak maintained that if a client cannot distinguish between subwallets and keep coins apart, it should not be considered BIP64 compatible.Pieter weighed in on the discussion, asking if software that scanned all accounts specified by BIP64 but had no user interface option to distinguish them in any way or view them independently would still be considered compatible with BIP64. He suggested that although it may not support the accounts feature, it could still be interoperable with other BIP64 software and therefore considered compatible according to the "all or nothing" argument.</summary>
