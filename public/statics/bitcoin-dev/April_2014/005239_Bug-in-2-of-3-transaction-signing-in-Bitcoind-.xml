    <summary>In order to find out why something was rejected, it is recommended to check the debug.log. This log file contains detailed information about any errors or issues that occurred during the process. Additionally, there appears to be an HTML attachment that was scrubbed from the original context, but it is unclear how this may be relevant to the issue at hand. It is important to thoroughly review all available information and resources in order to properly diagnose and address any problems.</summary>
