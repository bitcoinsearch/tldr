    <summary>The context discusses the idea of miners identifying themselves and the potential consequences if they do not. The speaker argues that assuming all miners should identify themselves is a huge leap, as it does not necessarily follow from the majority of miners supporting tougher enforcement against double spending. They criticize the lack of support for this "obvious next step" argument, stating that it can be applied to any proposal in any walk of life. The speaker provides examples of other unsupported arguments, such as floating fees, to illustrate their point. Ultimately, the speaker believes that the argument for miners identifying themselves lacks logical reasoning.</summary>
