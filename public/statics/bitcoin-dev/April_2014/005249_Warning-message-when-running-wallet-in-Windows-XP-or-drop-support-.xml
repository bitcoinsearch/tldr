    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list on April 16, 2014, Wladimir expressed concern over the security of using Windows XP for online banking and Bitcoin wallet storage. He suggested that if it is not secure enough for online banking, it is certainly not secure enough to run a wallet. He asked for opinions on what to do, including whether to warn users and allow them to continue or redirect them to a message on bitcoin.org warning about the dangers of using Windows XP. Wladimir acknowledged that dropping support for XP could cause the network to lose nodes, particularly in China and Russia where many computers still use XP. One person asked if XP with a Trezor would work fine, but there was no response to this question. Wladimir's personal preference was to issue a warning and direct users to a free software operating system that they could upgrade to. He also asked other wallet software maintainers how they were handling the situation and if they planned to drop XP support completely.</summary>
