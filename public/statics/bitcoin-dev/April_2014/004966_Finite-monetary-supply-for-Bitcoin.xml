    <summary>In an email exchange, Pieter Wuille recommended a book called "Topos of Music" to Luke Jr. The book is about mathematical music theory by a student of Grothendieck who advanced Euler's theories of harmony based on advanced category theory. Wuille also suggested that there might be many applications to Bitcoin. In response, Luke Jr. shared his thoughts on a controversial proposal he had made to turn Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency. He wrote a draft BIP and shared it with the group for comments. Luke Jr. also added a humorous comment about using tonal numbers in the year 2214. The email exchange was part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
