    <summary>In a message signed by Wladimir, it is stated that if no one wants to volunteer resources to support the network anymore, they will have failed. The broken incentive model of the network's security needs to be fixed so that economics works for them instead of against them. The message also includes a plea to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and provides a link to a tutorial video on how to do so.</summary>
