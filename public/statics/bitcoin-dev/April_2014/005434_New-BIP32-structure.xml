    <summary>The email thread discusses the compatibility of BIP64 with BIP32 and suggests appending key birth to key serialization in xprv. The author states that BIP64 is only a set of recommendations for wallet developers on how to browse bip32 tree, and modifying serialization format could break compatibility. However, the author mentions having a solution for storing wallet birth time, which will be communicated soon in a more specific format. Tamas Blummer suggests picking up the idea of appending key birth to key serialization in xprv from Pieter's suggestion in IRC, which would help the importing client.</summary>
