    <summary>Pieter Wuille asked if software that scans all accounts as specified by BIP64, but lacks user interface options to distinguish them in any way, view them independently and has no ability to keep the coins apart, is compatible with BIP64. Marek responded that it is not compatible because one requirement of BIP64 is to not mix addresses between accounts. He added that the key space is split into independent user identities at this level (accounts), so the wallet never mixes coins across different accounts.</summary>
