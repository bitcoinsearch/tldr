    <summary>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and slush on April 8, 2014 at 5:58 PM, the topic of sharing BIP XX was discussed. Slush suggested that bitcoinj or Electrum could share the bare minimum of BIP XX, but Schildbach argued that it's either implementing the "BIP" fully or not. However, Marek clarified that he meant "spec describing bare minimum", which is different from the "bare minimum of some spec".</summary>
