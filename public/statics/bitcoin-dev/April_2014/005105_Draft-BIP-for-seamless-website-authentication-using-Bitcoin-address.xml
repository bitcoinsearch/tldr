    <summary>In a discussion thread from April 2014, Troy Benjegerdes proposed the use of Bitcoin addresses as a persistent identity key, suggesting that it could become the "killer app" for Bitcoin adoption. Another user agreed with this sentiment and raised the question of whether a multisig seed could be used for this purpose. The idea was to have a "root" key serve as a login for users, and then have the system request the creation and association of a new key for each purchase, signed by the root key. While there was some debate over the practicality of this approach, the concept of using Bitcoin addresses as an identity key remains an interesting possibility for wider adoption of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
