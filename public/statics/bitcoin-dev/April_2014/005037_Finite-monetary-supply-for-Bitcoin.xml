    <summary>In an email conversation between Matt Whitlock and Jorge Timón on April 5, 2014, the topic of date formats was discussed. Timón expressed his preference for both DD-MM-YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD but disliked MM-DD-YYYY and YYYY-DD-MM. Whitlock then pointed out that these preferences reflect a cultural bias and stated that the only entirely numeric date format that is unambiguous across all cultures is YYYY-MM-DD. He also noted that no culture uses YYYY-DD-MM, or at least the ISO seems to think so. The discussion was then ended abruptly with a link to a comic strip about the complexity of date formats by Wladimir.</summary>
