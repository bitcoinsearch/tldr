    <title>New BIP32 structure</title>

    <summary>In an email thread from 2014, Marek, a Bitcoin developer, cautioned against assuming that seed other than "xprv" does not contain bitcoins or that "xprv" only contains bitcoins as both situations are technically possible. He stated that it is still safer to do the lookup as the serialization magic of bip32 seed is ambiguous and most software doesn't care about it anyway. Another developer named slush had suggested in the same email thread that using the same seed (xprv) and then separating the chains inside the BIP32 path would be more useful instead of having serialization magic for the BIP32 seed. However, Marek's response highlights that it is important to do a lookup as it can be dangerous to assume that a certain seed only contains bitcoins.</summary>
