    <summary>A member of a mailing list has asked if it is considered abuse to reply to and quote the entire digest for the sake of a few lines of content. Another member responded by suggesting that it might not be intentional and that it would be best to privately ask the person instead of complaining on the mailing list. The original poster thanked the respondent for their feedback and explained that they noticed this issue more frequently due to primarily reading the list on a mobile device.</summary>
