    <summary>A discussion took place in 2014 regarding the need for clients to use features in BIP 64. The question was raised as to whether Electrum, a cryptocurrency wallet, could simply use account 0 for all transactions instead of implementing the BIP fully. However, Andreas argued that there is no "bare minimum" and that BIP 64 should be implemented fully or not at all. Using only a subset of the specification could lead to confusion for users who import their BIP64 compatible wallet into Electrum and only see a fraction of their coins. Therefore, it is important to follow the principle of least surprise.</summary>
