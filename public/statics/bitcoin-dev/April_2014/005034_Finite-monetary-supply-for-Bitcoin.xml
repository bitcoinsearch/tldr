    <summary>The writer expresses their preference for date formats, stating that they like both DD-MM-YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD but dislike MM-DD-YYYY and YYYY-DD-MM. In an email conversation dated April 4, 2014, Jeff Garzik agrees with standardizing on ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) dates, stating that it is easily computer parse-able without a lookup table and naturally sorts correctly in a lexicographic sort. He also believes that language should not be included in a date format on a computer. The email exchange was part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Jorge Timón's website is linked at the end of the email.</summary>
