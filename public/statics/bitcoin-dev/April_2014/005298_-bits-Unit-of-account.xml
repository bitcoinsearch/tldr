    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin denominations has been going on since 2013, with suggestions for alternative units such as XBT and bits. Alan Reiner is in support of "microbitcoin" as an appropriate unit of measurement, while expressing concern that the term "bits" may be too overloaded to be effective. Armory has started integrating alternative units, although this will require more work, and Alan would prefer a unified push from other wallet developers before changing the default. Tamas Blummer supports the use of "bits" but suggests that any discussion about Bitcoin denominations should be taken to wallet developers rather than engineers. Rob Golding proposes offering a preference to denominate Bitcoin currency in a unit called a bit, where one bitcoin equals one million bits and one bit equals 100 satoshis.</summary>
