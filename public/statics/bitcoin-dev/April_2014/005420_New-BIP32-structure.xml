    <summary>In an email exchange on 23rd April 2014, Tier Nolan and Pavol Rusnak discussed the issue of merchants sending multiple addresses to customers without any purchase. Nolan pointed out that such a merchant would most likely use a merchant system instead of generic wallet software. Rusnak suggested that setting the gap limit to high in this case would be a small extra cost. However, Nolan argued that with 100 accounts on 10 different devices, this would not necessarily be the case.</summary>
