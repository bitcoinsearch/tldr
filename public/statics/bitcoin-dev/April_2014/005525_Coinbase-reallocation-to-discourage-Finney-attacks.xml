    <summary>In a message signed by Jorge Tim√≥n, the 21 million Bitcoin limit is said to be important not because of its exact value or because it was chosen by Satoshi, but because users hold Bitcoin based on the promise that the block reward will never be adjusted ex post facto. The behavior users rely on is that "the bitcoins you hold are forever a calculable fraction of all the bitcoins that will ever be issued." This agreement cannot be changed, despite the fact that the number is arbitrary.</summary>
