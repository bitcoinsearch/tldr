    <summary>In a discussion on 7th April, 2014, Gregory Maxwell and Nikita Schmidt discussed the implementation of BIP. Nikita mentioned that any implementation of this BIP will need big integer arithmetic to do base-58. However, Gregory disagreed with this point and provided an example from https://gitorious.org/bitcoin/libblkmaker/source/eb33f9c8e441ffef457a79d76ceed1ea20ab3059:base58.c which he claimed does not require biginteger division for encoding Base58Check. It was pointed out that this specific code only decodes Base58Check and does not have an encode function that would require biginteger division.</summary>
