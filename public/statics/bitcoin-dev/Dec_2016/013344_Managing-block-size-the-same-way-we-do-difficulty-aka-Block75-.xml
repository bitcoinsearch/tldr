    <title>Managing block size the same way we do difficulty (aka Block75)</title>

    <summary>The proposal called "Block75" suggests adjusting the maximum block size every two weeks based on transaction volume, similar to how difficulty is calculated. The target capacity over 2016 blocks would be 75%. If the last 2016 blocks are more than 75% full, the difference will be added to the max block size. The system allows the max block size to grow (or shrink) in response to transaction volume and attempts to keep blocks at 75% total capacity over each two week period. However, some concerns were raised about block propagation time and the potential for miners to game the system by filling the network with transactions. Bitcoin's fundamental design allows it to scale by using off-chain solutions, but the need for on-chain scaling may still arise regardless of which off-chain solution gains popularity.</summary>
