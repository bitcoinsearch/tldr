    <summary>The size of the Bitcoin network in terms of full nodes is decreasing rapidly, which makes it difficult to consider it a decentralized p2p network. Despite proposals to reward those running full nodes, few have been implemented or even considered. The lack of incentive for people to run full nodes and upgrade their clients is a major issue that has not been discussed enough in the Bitcoin community. Satoshi predicted centralized full nodes, but this contradicts the idea of a decentralized immutable system. It would be interesting to know why the consensus is not to solve these issues, so people do not waste time trying to find solutions.</summary>
