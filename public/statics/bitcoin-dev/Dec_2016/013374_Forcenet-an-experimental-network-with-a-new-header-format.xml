    <summary>In a discussion between Luke Dashjr and Johnson Lau via bitcoin-dev mailing list on December 14, 2016, Lau stated that there is no need to use a timestamp beyond four bytes. However, Dashjr disagreed and mentioned the lock times. He also added that his overflow solution does not have a solution for this issue. Dashjr suggested stealing a few bits from tx nVersion through a softfork as a possible solution.</summary>
