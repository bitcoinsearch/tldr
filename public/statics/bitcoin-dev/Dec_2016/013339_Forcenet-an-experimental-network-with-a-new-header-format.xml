    <title>Forcenet: an experimental network with a new header format</title>
    <updated>2023-06-11T20:45:45.155160+00:00</updated>

    <summary>The header of Forcenet is described in Luke's BIP with some amendments made as it was implemented. The format is given, and it includes fields such as Height, BIP9 signalling field, hardfork signalling field, merge-mining hard fork signalling field, prev hash, timestamp, nonce1, nonce2, nonce3, Hash TMR, Hash WMR, total tx size, total tx weight, total sigops, number of tx, merkle branches leading to header C. There are comments on the header, such as not wanting variable length fields in it, questioning the need for both TMR and WMR, a redundant bit, total size/weight/number of txs feeling redundant, proposing an extension of timestamp from 4 bytes to 8 bytes, and mentioning that it might be too nit-picky.</summary>
