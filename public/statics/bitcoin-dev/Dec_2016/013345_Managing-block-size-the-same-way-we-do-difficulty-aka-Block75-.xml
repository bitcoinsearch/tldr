    <title>Managing block size the same way we do difficulty (aka Block75)</title>

    <summary>A proposal called Block75 has been made to manage Bitcoin's block size by adjusting it every two weeks using a system similar to how difficulty is calculated. The target capacity over 2016 blocks would be 75% and if the last 2016 blocks are more than 75% full, the difference would be added to the max block size. The system aims to keep blocks at 75% total capacity over each two week period and also keeps blocks as small as possible. However, the main problem with this proposal is not how to grow the maximum block size automatically without human action, but what number can the network handle considering both miners and users. While disk space requirements might not be a big problem, block propagation time is. If blocks take too much time to propagate in the network, the orphan rate will increase in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the system can also be gamed by filling the network with transactions which can break things. It has been suggested that Bitcoin can scale by using offchain solutions.</summary>
