    <summary>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tadge expressed some concerns about the header of forcenet. Specifically, Tadge suggested avoiding variable-length fields in the header and questioned the need for both TMR and WMR. Tadge also pointed out that including total size/weight/number of txs in the header seems redundant. Furthermore, Tadge recommended making timestamp 8 bytes instead of 4 bytes since 2106 is coming up soon. Overall, Tadge acknowledged that these suggestions may be nit-picky and that it may be better to include more features initially and then remove any unnecessary ones as development progresses. The discussion referenced a commit which had fixed issues related to timestamp size.</summary>
