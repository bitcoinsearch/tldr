    <summary>The Block75 system cannot be gamed by miners due to the lack of financial incentives, and even attempting to do so would cost more in transaction fees than they could make up. However, it is possible for a miner to create thousands of transactions paying to themselves and hold them instead of broadcasting them to the network, which would allow them to collect the fees included in the blocks they mine. Eventually, blocks may get too big, but only if bandwidth stops increasing and the cost of disk space stops decreasing. The hard limit maximum block size cannot grow to an unlimited value, and there is a validation cost in time for each block. While a permanent solution is preferred, dynamically growing the maximum block size is also kicking the can down the road without actually touching it.</summary>
