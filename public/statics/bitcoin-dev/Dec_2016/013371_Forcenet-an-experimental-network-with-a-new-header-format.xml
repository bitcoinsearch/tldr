    <summary>A discussion regarding the use of a timestamp beyond 4 bytes took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Hampus Sjöberg suggested increasing the timestamp to 8 bytes, citing the upcoming year 2106 as a reason for doing so. Tom Zander responded by stating that there is no need to use a timestamp beyond 4 bytes and that if a blockchain is stopped for more than 2^31 seconds, it is dead. He also pointed out that while the commit referenced by Sjöberg does address the issue, a new block header would provide a better solution. Zander provided links to his blog and vlog in his signature.</summary>
