    <summary>The discussion revolves around the possibility of a miner creating transactions to themselves and not broadcasting them to the network, but instead holding them and including them in the blocks they mine. This would allow the miner to collect the fees for those transactions included in their block. However, this tactic is easily detectable by other miners who may intentionally orphan blocks that contain a large number of unknown transactions. The likelihood of a single miner or pool being able to carry out this attack is low, as it would require a colluding group with 51% of the hash rate. Overall, this type of attack is unlikely to be successful and would result in significant loss for the attacker.</summary>
