    <summary>A user named Andrew inquired about a scriptPubKey for doing multisig with just hashes of the participants. In response, it was noted that there were several issues with the proposed script. Firstly, performing two OP_SWAP's in a row would simply return to the original state. Additionally, all of the hashes end up hashing the same key, which could be easily spent by anyone on the network. It was suggested that P2SH scripts would provide better security and prevent public keys from being exposed until spending. The email also included a resource link to learn more about opcodes and simulators.</summary>
