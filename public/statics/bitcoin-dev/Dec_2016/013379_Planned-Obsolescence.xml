    <title>Planned Obsolescence</title>

    <summary>According to the statistics at https://bitnodes.21.co/nodes/, the top 10 Bitcoin running node versions are listed, with Version Satoshi:0.13.1 leading with 38.97% of nodes followed by Version Satoshi:0.12.1 with 19.23%. Over 30% of nodes running Bitcoin Core are using versions older than 0.13.0, indicating that many node operators do not upgrade their clients. It is noted that newer versions require the same or fewer hardware resources to run compared to older versions and that obsolete and incompatible issues may arise on older versions. To avoid such wide fragmentation and help simplify the developer's jobs, introducing planned obsolescence in each new version is worth analyzing. If a node does not upgrade, it will stop working instead of participating in the network with an outdated protocol version. These changes may also help create a more predictable protocol improvement process.</summary>
