    <summary>The conversation is centered around the possibility of miners creating a conglomerate that would control the network by stuffing blocks with thousands of transactions and keeping the fees. However, this would only work if they mine their own blocks, as they cannot do the same for others' blocks. Even if a single mining pool mines most of the blocks, the max block size would only reach 7.25MB after a year. The likelihood of this happening is very close to zero. The topology and bandwidth speed/hash rate of the network also cannot be controlled and increasing the max block size dynamically would be a permanent solution. Block75 is self-correcting and allows for gradual changes in the max block size, which would allow for any consequences to be seen well in advance.</summary>
