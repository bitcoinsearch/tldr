    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list post, Alice Wonder expressed her frustration with testing errors in Bitcoin Core updates. She almost didn't update to version 0.13.0 because of Python errors in the test suite, which were fixed by following instructions on bitcointalk. However, version 0.13.1 came with new Python errors and she decided not to update at all until the test suite works properly in her CentOS environment. Douglas Roark requested more information about the issues and offered help, suggesting that posting an issue on Github would be useful.</summary>
