    <summary>On December 10, 2016, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the implementation of a new merkle algorithm. Tier Nolan suggested that it should use a sum tree for partial validation and fraud proofs. Luke Dashjr replied with "PR welcome", indicating that he was open to the suggestion and that it was a basic idea. Dashjr also shared a link to his GitHub repository where he had already implemented a merkle algorithm that summed up sigops, block size, block cost (or "weight"), and fees.</summary>
