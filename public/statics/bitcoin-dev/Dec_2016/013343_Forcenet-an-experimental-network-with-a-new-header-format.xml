    <summary>On December 4th, 2016, a discussion regarding the timestamp for Bitcoin occurred on the bitcoin-dev forum. Hampus Sj√∂berg suggested making the timestamp 8 bytes due to the year 2106 approaching soon. Tom Zander clarified that the issue had already been addressed in a commit by jl2012, but noted that the commit was not a proper fix and that a new block header would be necessary. Zander links to his personal blog and vlog at the end of his response.</summary>
