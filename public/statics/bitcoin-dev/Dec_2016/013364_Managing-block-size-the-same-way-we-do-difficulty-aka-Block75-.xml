    <summary>The email thread on December 11, 2016, from t. khan via bitcoin-dev discussed the proposed Block75 solution for scaling Bitcoin. The author argued that Block75 is not exponential scaling and would only increase by a maximum of 7x in the first year, followed by a maximum increase of 2x in the second year, and 50% in the next. With these limits, the author suggested that there is little reason to not have a fixed schedule. Furthermore, the author dismissed the idea that miners would be held back on block sizes due to propagation delay, stating that it was a myth. The author also warned that this could favor collective pooling, which would have negative consequences.</summary>
