    <summary>On December 4, 2016, Johnson Lau via bitcoin-dev discussed several potential updates to the Bitcoin protocol. One suggestion was to implement a new merkle root algorithm using a sum tree for partial validation and fraud proofs. The discussion also touched on the idea of allowing blocks to indicate new trees, which would make the protocol extendable and potentially enable easier soft forks like segregated witness. Another topic was communication with legacy nodes, which could be accomplished through a bridge node transferring only coinbase-only legacy blocks. Finally, there was mention of many other hardfork and softfork ideas that could work better with a header redesign.</summary>
