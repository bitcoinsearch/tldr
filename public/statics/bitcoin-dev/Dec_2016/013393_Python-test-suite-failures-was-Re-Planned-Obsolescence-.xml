    <summary>The error message displayed is from version 0.13.1 of Bitcoin. Specifically, running the "bitcoin-util-test.py" file caused the error. The traceback shows that the issue is with the "bctest.py" file. In particular, the line of code that reads the output data from a file is causing a FileNotFoundError due to the specified file not being found in the directory. This issue was previously known on the master branch. If users encounter similar issues on the current 0.13.2 release candidate, they are advised to report it on the Bitcoin GitHub issues page and include the version of CentOS they are running.</summary>
