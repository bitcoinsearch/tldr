    <summary>In a Bitcoin development forum, Daniele Pinna queries about objective measures to estimate the probability of orphaned blocks given average network bandwidth and block size. Pieter Wuille responds that models can predict orphan rate based on block size and network/hashrate topology. However, the topology cannot be controlled, and certain factors like FIBRE conceal the impact of block size on it. As a result, optimizing for minimal orphan rate can lead to a situation where a single pool or conglomerate produces all the blocks, with no propagation delay, resulting in 0 orphans.</summary>
