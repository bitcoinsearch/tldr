    <summary>The Bitcoin community has been discussing the difficulty of finding the right line to draw when it comes to software upgrades. Matt Corallo raised the issue of developer centralisation and how it is important for users to find it easy to refuse an upgrade. Ethan Heilman brought up the concerns of exploitable and eclipsable nodes, suggesting that a grace period be introduced before disconnecting obsolete nodes. Jorge Tim√≥n suggested planned obsolescence in new versions of Bitcoin Core node to avoid wide fragmentation, but others felt that this was not the best solution as anti-features can easily be removed. Instead, users should be left to determine when to upgrade, although security updates should be encouraged. It is recognised that developers have limited resources and are unlikely to give support for older versions.</summary>
