    <title>Managing block size the same way we do difficulty (aka Block75)</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, t. khan proposed the concept of 'Block75', which suggests that instead of focusing on the maximum block size, the focus should be on how full we want the average block to be. The aim is to keep the blocks 75% full, as over the last year, the averages have been at or above this level. However, some members of the community argue that this proposal effectively makes the blocksize limit completely uncapped and does not differentiate between genuine transactions and low-value spam attacks. This could lead to miners imposing their own cap on the block size, resulting in a fork. They further posit that difficulty adjustment works because there is a clear goal of having a certain rate of making new blocks and without a target, automatic adjustment makes no sense.</summary>
