    <title>Forcenet: an experimental network with a new header format</title>

    <summary>The header of Forcenet is described in Luke's BIP, but some amendments were made as it was implemented. The format consists of height, BIP9 signalling field, hardfork signalling field, merge-mining hard fork signalling field, prev hash, timestamp, nonce1, nonce2, nonce3, Hash TMR, Hash WMR, total tx size, total tx weight, total sigops, number of tx, merkle branches leading to header C. The author suggests having a fixed-size header instead of variable length fields. Also, the need for both TMR and WMR is questioned as segwit would be required with this header type. Two types of headers will be present in this system: the 80 bytes short header and the variable length full header. Short headers are enough to link everything up. The height is committed in the coinbase tx via bip 34, so nHeight can be omitted as it is implied, saving four bytes. Total size/weight/number of txs feel redundant, and it is hard to come up with a use for them. Timestamp doesn't need to be 8 bytes because the year 2106 is coming up soon. The author suggests that it might be better to put lots of stuff in for testing the forcenet and then take out all the stuff that wasn't used or had issues as it progresses.</summary>
