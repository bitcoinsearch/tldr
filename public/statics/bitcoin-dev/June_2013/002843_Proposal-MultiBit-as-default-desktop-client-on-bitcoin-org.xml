    <summary>The Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind default is being argued to be retained due to the extensive field experience, code review, and testing on desktop than other wallets. The promotion of alternative wallets is hoped to increase their developer communities. While most bitcoinj code is peer-reviewed, it is not done to the same extent as Bitcoin-Qt. Bitcoin-Qt will still be promoted, but a distinction will be made between using MultiBit for quick start-up or running Bitcoin-Qt to help out the Bitcoin network by donating some computer resources. Although the MultiBit interface is functional, all desktop wallets could benefit from an improved user interface design.</summary>
