    <summary>In a discussion about the use of blockchain for non-currency purposes, Jeff Garzik notes that while it may incentivize timestamping and data storage, these uses cannot be prevented and are already automated. He believes that the majority of users are invested in Bitcoin as a currency or commodity and that disincentives should be explored for using the blockchain for data storage and messaging. However, these disincentives must be implemented in a way that makes doing the less-harmful thing advantageous. For instance, people keep arguing for OP_RETURN to only be allowed as one txout in a tx, which puts it at a disadvantage relative to just using unspendable outputs. Similarly because people can play OP_CHECKMULTISIG games, allow as much data as can be included in that form, 195 bytes. Meanwhile, in an email forwarded by Peter Todd, a user expresses concern about the unlimited bloat in inefficient timestamping and threatens that Gavin may back them all into a scalability corner with no good solutions.</summary>
