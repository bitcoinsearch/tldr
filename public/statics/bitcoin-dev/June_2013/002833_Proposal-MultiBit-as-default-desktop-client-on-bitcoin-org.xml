    <summary>In an email exchange on June 27, 2013, Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik discussed the possibility of an overall net reduction of full nodes on a P2P network. Luke-Jr expressed concern about the lack of listening bitcoinj or MultiBit nodes, stating that he had never seen one. He then asked Jim if MultiBit would be adding P2P listening support. However, without validation, listening is not very useful. Luke-Jr suggested that it could potentially be more useful with some protocol additions.</summary>
