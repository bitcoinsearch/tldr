    <summary>The purpose of CTxIn::nSequence in Bitcoin is explained in detail on a stack exchange question. The post provides a clear explanation of the function and its significance. CTxIn::nSequence is a 32-bit integer that can be used to indicate how transactions should be sorted for processing. This value can be set by the sender of a transaction, and it allows transactions to be prioritized based on their age or other factors. The original question on the purpose of CTxIn::nSequence was posed by Marko Otbalkana on June 20th, 2013. The response on the stack exchange page explains that the nSequence field is used to determine the order in which transactions are processed by miners. Specifically, it can be used to ensure that certain transactions are included in the next block even if they arrive after other transactions that were broadcast earlier. The post also provides additional information on the mechanics of nSequence. For example, it notes that setting nSequence to a specific value can allow a sender to delay spending of a particular output until a certain time has passed. The post concludes by noting that nSequence is an important tool for ensuring that transactions are processed in the correct order, and that it is widely used in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
