    <summary>There was a debate on IRC regarding whether bitcoin addresses can be considered opaque or not. The argument was made that if an address is opaque, examining its characters would reveal nothing about the address. However, there was confusion as to whether this was the case for bitcoin addresses. The wiki page on bitcoin addresses provides information that suggests they are not opaque, and if this has changed it would invalidate several statements on the page. These include the length and composition of addresses, the process for creating them, the probability of mistyping, and the use of checksums. Furthermore, there may be a likely change from the base58 encoding for bitcoin addresses. It is important to clarify what exactly an address is believed to be and update the wiki accordingly to reflect any changes.</summary>
