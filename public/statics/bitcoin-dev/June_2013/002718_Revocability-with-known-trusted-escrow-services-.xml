    <summary>The context discusses P2SH with 2 of 3, which involves the payer, recipient, and a trusted third party. It is explained in detail on the bitcoin wiki contracts page, along with an example of escrow and dispute mediation. The conversation also touches upon the issue of tainted coins and how nothing can be done at the protocol level if the transaction needs to remain p2p. Leszek Rychlewski mentions that transactions with cash are even less revocable, and authorities are exploiting differences between crypto currencies and the banking system as an excuse to prosecute members of the new industry. He suggests collecting arguments against such accusations. The conversation ends with Jorge Timón's website link.</summary>
