    <summary>In an email exchange from June 27, 2013, several topics related to multibit were discussed. One member suggested that multibit should not be the default wallet due to less testing and field experience on desktops. Another member reported that potential deadlocking problems with reentrant locks had been resolved, and that there was a lot of work left to do in terms of HD wallet support. Multibit connections were also discussed, including connections to bitcoind nodes on port 8333, multibit.org, and currency tickers for exchanges such as MtGox and CampBX. The group noted that intermediate "Exchange Data Provider" servers would likely be added to patch servers when changes occurred. Additionally, members speculated about the number of full nodes versus SPV nodes, and some expressed doubt that multibit would ever participate in the Bitcoin network other than as an SPV client. Finally, one member raised a question about whether MultiBit would add P2P listening support.</summary>
