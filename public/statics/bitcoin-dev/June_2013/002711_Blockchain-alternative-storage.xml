    <summary>Marko Otbalkana inquired on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about projects related to storing the blockchain in a database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. He also requested information on tools that could read the blockchain from the Satoshi client and convert it into different formats. In response, BitcoinJ was mentioned as a project that stores parsed blocks in H2, an embedded SQL database for Java. Additionally, ServiceNow was advertised as a cloud service that can automate IT design, transition, and operations, offer high-level views of enterprise services through dashboards, and provide a single system of record for all IT processes.</summary>
