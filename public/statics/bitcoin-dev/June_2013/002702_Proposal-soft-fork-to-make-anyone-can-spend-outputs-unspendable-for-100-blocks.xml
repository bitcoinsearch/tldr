    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Roy Badami, the difficulty of obtaining payments through bitcoin mining is discussed. Roy argues that obtaining payments through mining transactions is itself difficult due to the high network difficulty. However, Jeff counters this argument by stating that pool operators and those buying hashing power from services like GPUMAX can still obtain payments easily. Jeff also notes that achieving a valid bitcoin block is a very high bar, emphasizing the difficulty of the process. Jeff Garzik is a Senior Software Engineer and open-source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
