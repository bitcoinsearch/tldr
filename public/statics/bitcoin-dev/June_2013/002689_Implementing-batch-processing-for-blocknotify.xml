    <summary>In this email thread, the participants discuss different methods for high-speed notifications. Wladimir suggests using zmq and shares a pull request to integrate it directly into bitcoind. Chris Double, who has already integrated zmq for block notifications in bitcoin and alt coins, thanks Wladimir for sharing the pull request and expresses his interest in trying it out. The original poster Rune thanks everyone for their input and decides to go with the Unix socket method, while also expressing his desire to learn more about Unix sockets. Finally, there is a link to an AppDynamics Lite troubleshooting tool for Java/.NET code.</summary>
