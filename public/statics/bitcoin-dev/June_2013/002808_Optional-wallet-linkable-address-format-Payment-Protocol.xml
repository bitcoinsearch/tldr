    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of proving a payment to a third party who has not seen the communication between payer and payee. The solution proposed involves using PubKeyParent and HMAC (Multiplier, PubKeyParent) to calculate the destination address, which can then be provided to the third party as proof of payment. The use of Timo's suggestion is also discussed, but it would require deviation from BIP 32 standardization. The importance of supporting both solutions is emphasized, rather than introducing extra wallets/chains.</summary>
