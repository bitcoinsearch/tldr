    <summary>The conversation at hand is regarding the use of Testnet as an alt-coin. Dennison Bertram suggests that using Testnet as an alt-coin has its advantages such as testing non-standard transactions in a pseudo live environment where coins have a nominal value and people are incentivized to try and steal and come up with clever ways of gaming the system. It also allows developers a chance to develop in advance new technologies and services that currently won't run on bitcoin main net but might be enabled in the future at which point they can switch over to main net. Melvin Carvalho wonders if Ripple could be used to set up a transfer system between the 'main' and 'staging' systems. Adam Back suggests the idea of a Main net, a testnet and a "beta-net" where the coins on the beta-net would be allowed to have value. A possible way to implement this would be something like a "testnet=1, testnetversion=3" in the bitcoin.conf file. He further discusses the idea of a real-live system, with live value, but intentionally wanting to avoid forking bitcoins parameters, nor value, nor mindshare dilution. In this way something interesting could move forward faster and be less risky to the main bitcoin network.</summary>
