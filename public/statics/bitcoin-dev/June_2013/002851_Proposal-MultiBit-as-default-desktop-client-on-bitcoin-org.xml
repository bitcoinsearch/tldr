    <title>Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop client on bitcoin.org</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin.org provides descriptions and links to various wallet solutions, including the reference client, Bitcoin-QT. Hovering over any of the wallet icons on the website provides a description and link to that particular wallet. However, the first wallet link on the page is what most new users click. A user named Bill Hees suggests outlining arguments for promoting both the reference client and a lighter-weight alternative, and providing links to each on bitcoin.org. He further proposes links to various alternative wallet solutions alongside their respective benefits and drawbacks. Gavin Andresen votes for MultiBit to replace Bitcoin-QT as the recommended desktop wallet app, claiming it would make most users happier. The email signature promotes MultiBit as "money, reinvented".</summary>
