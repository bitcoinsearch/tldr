    <summary>In a discussion about the relay field of a network packet, Addy Yeow emphasized its importance and explained that it is not an optional field. To read the packet correctly, one should first retrieve the header information, get the actual payload length, and then parse the payload accordingly. Yeow also mentioned that including 0x00 for the relay field in the outgoing packet and reflecting it in the length field in the header is possible. Jeff Garzik, a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, responded to Yeow's message by stating that although the logic of parsing fields may be ugly, there is no need to change it now. He argued that updating the version message to a different design solely for cleanliness reasons is not sufficient cause to migrate the entire bitcoin universe to a new and different version/feature negotiation setup.</summary>
