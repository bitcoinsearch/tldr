    <summary>In a conversation between Peter Todd and Luke-Jr on June 14, 2013, the two discussed the practice of pools using about one share per second which Todd found excessive. Luke-Jr suggested using higher difficulty shares instead. Todd agreed but also pointed out that share rate affects the variance of reward/payout. They also discussed the possibility of P2Pool-like solutions where only a small subset of shares are sent to the pool while maintaining good user optics. In addition, they talked about the importance of auditing and troubleshooting in mining operations and how reporting shares that were not sent to the pool can make it more difficult. The conversation also touched on eliopool's ability to accept arbitrary shares and do the correct accounting for them, as well as possible protocol extensions.</summary>
