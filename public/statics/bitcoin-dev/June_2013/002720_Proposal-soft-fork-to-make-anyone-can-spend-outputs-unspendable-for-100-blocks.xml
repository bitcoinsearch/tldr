    <summary>On June 01, 2013, Peter Todd proposed a change to make anyone-can-spend outputs IsStandard(), so they can be relayed. However, Luke argued that storing data on the blockchain is a violation of the social contract between nodes and users who store blocks for financial purposes. He suggested that proof-of-stake could be done without spamming people against their consent. Instead of sacrifices to unspendable outputs, Luke proposed making other standard outputs unable to store data as well.</summary>
