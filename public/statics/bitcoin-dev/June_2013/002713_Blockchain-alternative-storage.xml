    <summary>In response to a question posed on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2013, Jouke Hofman of Bitonic.nl recommended using a project called bitcoin-abe to store the blockchain in a database. The project is available on GitHub and there is also a discussion thread about it on the bitcointalk.org forum. Hofman's message was in reply to Marko Otbalkana's inquiry about projects related to storing the blockchain in a database, as well as tools that can read the blockchain from the Satoshi client and convert it into different formats. The email also included a sponsored message about ServiceNow, a cloud service that automates IT design, transition, and operations.</summary>
