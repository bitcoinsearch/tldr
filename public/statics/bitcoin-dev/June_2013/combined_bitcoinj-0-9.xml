    <summary>Bitcoinj 0.9, a Java library for working with the Bitcoin protocol, has been released. The library supports simplified and full verification and has been used to create everything from end-user wallet apps to network crawlers to SatoshiDice. Users can check out the source from git and run *git fetch --all; git checkout **67b187c4c4c4* to get bitcoinj 0.9. The release is signed by Andreas Schildbach and can be verified with *git tag -v 0.9* once users have his key. New features in this release include a basic fee solver that attaches the minimum fee per kilobyte to a created transaction using the 0.8.2+ fee rules, improved coin selection in the wallet, and a new ScriptBuilder class that simplifies the process of constructing various kinds of scripts. Additionally, a new block importer tool can parse bitcoind block files and process them, which is faster than streaming them over a network connection. Support for the regtest mode added by the C++ side pull req 2632 makes app development and testing easier by eliminating the need to wait for a block.The release also includes many bug fixes and testing improvements. Known issues can be found on the limitations and missing features page on the website. Overall, Bitcoinj 0.9 offers significant upgrades to the functionality and efficiency of the library for those working with the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
