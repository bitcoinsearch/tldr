    <summary>There is a discussion about the use of blockchain technology for timestamping documents and creating notary services. A website called Proof of Existence is already providing such a service on the blockchain. The idea is that people should have an opportunity to play with these types of services and better test them. One person suggests that timestamping does not need a coin at all, but rather just the collection of hashes into a PoE merkle tree and adding it to the merged mining MT. However, another person argues that while it's a good idea, it could be considered blockchain spam if used to notarize high volumes of things like tweets or combined with something like colored coins. Overall, the conversation revolves around the potential uses and limitations of blockchain technology for notary and verification services.</summary>
