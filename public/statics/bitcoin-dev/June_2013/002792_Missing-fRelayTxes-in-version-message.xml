    <summary>In this conversation, the participants discuss the issue of variable-length messages in Bitcoin protocol and their effect on parsing messages. They agree that optional lengths shouldn't be used and for every field change, the protocol version should be upgraded. The fRelayTxes field is specifically discussed and it is mentioned that it has been made a part of the protocol, but old clients don't send it so it has to be optional. The participants also discuss BIP 60, which proposes a protocol upgrade and details everything that needs to be done. Ultimately, they agree that having a fixed number of fields per protocol version would be beneficial for parsing messages and considered good practice.</summary>
