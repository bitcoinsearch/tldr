    <summary>MultiBit has been adding features such as encrypted wallets, sign and verify message, stability improvements and bug fixes over the last few months. The founder, Jim, believes that MultiBit is now suitable for entry-level Bitcoin users and proposes to put MultiBit as the default desktop client on the bitcoin.org "Choose your wallet" page. Jim's goal is to attract new users who come to bitcoin.org through a Google search or a Bitcoin news article and provide them with an easy-to-use wallet. If they can get MultiBit up and running in a tea break, they may be interested in exploring other Bitcoin wallets and solutions. Despite its limitations, MultiBit can serve as a gateway to the Bitcoin economy.</summary>
