    <summary>Peter Todd suggested sacrificing to provably unspendable for now and doing a soft-fork later if there is real demand. People are bloating the UTXO set with unspendable outputs which can't be 100% proven unspendable. Provably unspendable seems like an improvement on long term UTXO health. Some believe this incentivizes towards timestamping and other non-currency uses, which cannot be prevented and have already been automated anyway. However, the majority of users are invested in bitcoin-the-currency or commodity. Timestamping/data storage/messaging is essentially getting a free ride given their relative volumes of traffic. It is worth continuing to disincentivize the use of blockchain for data storage and messaging for the rare times where a clear currency-or-data-storage incentive is available.</summary>
