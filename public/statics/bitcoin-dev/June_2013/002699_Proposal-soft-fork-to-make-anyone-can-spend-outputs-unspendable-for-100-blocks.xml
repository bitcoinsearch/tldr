    <summary>In an email conversation between Adam Back and Jeff Garzik dated June 2, 2013, they discussed the possibility of introducing new standardized spend-to-fees for miners. They also considered proposing a standard recognized address that is unknown to anyone's EC discrete log as an alternative solution.Garzik mentioned his experimentation with zero-output transactions where 100% miner fee would be allowed as proof of sacrifice, but noted that this would require a hard fork which may not be feasible for most people. He added that a change transaction would likely be generated by most people, which would produce an already-standard transaction where inputs are greater than outputs.Garzik, a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., shared his thoughts on the matter via email.</summary>
