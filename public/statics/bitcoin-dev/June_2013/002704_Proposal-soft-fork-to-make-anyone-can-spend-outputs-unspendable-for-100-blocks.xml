    <summary>On Tue, Jun 04, 2013, Jeff Garzik and Roy Badami discussed the difficulty in obtaining payments as a miner. While Badami suggested it was not difficult for pool operators or those buying hashing power from services like GPUMAX, Garzik disagreed, stating that achieving the high difficulty needed to create a valid bitcoin block was a significant challenge. The conversation then shifted towards the potential vulnerability of mining fee sacrifices due to the possibility of being created cheaply by large pools working together. Peter Todd jumped in with a humorous comment about the going rate to get Eligius to mine a fake mining fee sacrifice. Overall, the discussion highlights the complex nature of mining and the challenges involved in ensuring its security.</summary>
