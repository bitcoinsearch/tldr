    <summary>In an article, Melvin Carvalho discusses the potential social benefits of combining cryptocurrency with a "pay it forward approach". Although cryptocurrencies have yet to make a significant impact on any economy or achieve much in terms of social good, there is excitement about how they can modernize our lives. Carvalho proposes distributing new money to those who need it most through various strategies, such as beaming coins to every mobile phone and allocating coins on a lottery basis to reduce systemic gaming risks. According to Carvalho, mobile phones can function as banks that can send money via SMS, making them ideal for distributing new currency to those who need it most. Additionally, he suggests allocating coins on a lottery basis to minimize the risk of systemic gaming. In this way, coin recipients are encouraged to "pay it forward" by doing good for the sake of good, creating a virtuous circle that can transform the planet. Overall, Carvalho believes that cryptocurrency has the potential to create positive social change if used in a proactive and thoughtful manner. By taking a "pay it forward approach", individuals can use cryptocurrency to help those who need it most and create a more equitable society.</summary>
