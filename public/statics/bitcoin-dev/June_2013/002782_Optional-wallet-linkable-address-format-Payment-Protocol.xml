    <summary>The context discusses the idea of using ECDSA signatures for type2 public keys, which are multiples of a parent public key. The proposal is to send an ECDSA signature of the multiplier, which can be used to compute or "recover" the parent public key. A concern raised is the unknown discrete log artefact and how it could be addressed. One solution proposed is to require a proof of knowledge of the discrete log, such as including an ECDSA sig or Schnorr proof of knowledge in the address. This would demonstrate knowledge of the discrete log of Q to base G.</summary>
