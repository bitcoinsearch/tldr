    <summary>The author of the message is working on a project that requires users to exchange public keys for multisig transactions. While hex encoding is typically used in displaying public keys, it results in longer strings and lacks 4-byte verification. The author suggests using a standard way to encode public keys as base58-check addresses to make it easier and safer to display and exchange public keys. All that's needed is deciding on a prefix byte. The author suggests using 0x37/0x38, which would result in the letter P for "Public" and currently isn't used for anything.</summary>
