    <summary>The email thread dated June 1, 2013, shows a suggestion by Gavin to create a new opcode instead of redefining OP_NOP1. He suggested the use of 'verify depth' as the redefinition for the new opcode. Mark replied to Gavin's suggestion, proposing a more general 'push depth onto stack.' This new opcode would allow the use of math/relational operators that are not commonly used. However, he questioned if it's a good idea to go down that route at all. The email thread ends with a PGP signature.</summary>
