    <summary>In this email conversation, Luke-Jr argues that data should not be stored on the blockchain because it violates the social contract that people running nodes have agreed to. Peter Todd suggests a way to implement his zookeyv key-value consensus system using transactions with txout pairs that prove funds have been sacrificed, which is compatible with Gregory Maxwell's address pre-image fix to data-in-chain storage and unblockable by making such transactions more expensive. The email ends with Todd stating that increasing the blocksize is madness.</summary>
