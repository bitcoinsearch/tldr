    <summary>The authorities seem to be using the differences between crypto currencies and the banking system as an excuse to prosecute members of the new industry. Transactions with cash are even less revocable than with Bitcoin, as there is no negative cash balance while a BTC wallet can have a negative balance. However, collecting arguments against such accusations should suffice. Additionally, the concept of maturation for dedicated accounts/transactions could be helpful in combating these accusations.</summary>
