    <summary>In this email thread, Jeff Garzik discusses proposals for improving the prioritization of transactions by telling peers what the fee/kb is when INV advertisements are sent. One proposal involves accepting tx's into a node's mempool indiscriminately but delaying broadcasting INV messages until child tx's that make low-profit ones worth mining are found. When a child with a sufficiently high fee is found, an INVGROUP message is sent to notify peers of the new opportunity. Garzik also mentions the suboptimal way in which new blocks are communicated to peers via a block INV message, and suggests that nodes prioritize fast peers first when sending INV messages and attending to incoming messages. Another suggestion is to investigate the network-wide costs of simply broadcasting block header + coinbase TX + TX list to opt-in miners. However, the question of whether this is an improvement is complex, as it depends on factors such as the number of peers and memory available. Additionally, relying on TX hashes to keep bandwidth down means any disruption to that system can have a big impact on the network.</summary>
