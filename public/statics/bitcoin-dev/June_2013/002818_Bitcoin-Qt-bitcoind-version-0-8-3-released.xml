    <summary>Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.3 has been released to address a denial-of-service attack that can cause nodes to crash. The new release includes measures to prevent a memory exhaustion attack by truncating over-size messages. Additionally, a regression that caused excessive re-writing of the 'peers.dat' file has been fixed. Users are encouraged to report any bugs using the issue tracker available at GitHub. Peter Todd was credited with responsibly disclosing the vulnerability (CVE-2013-4627) and creating the fix. The software is available for download from SourceForge.</summary>
