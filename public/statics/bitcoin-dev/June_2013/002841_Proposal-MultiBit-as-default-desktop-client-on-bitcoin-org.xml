    <summary>In this email thread, Gregory Maxwell expresses his support for promoting a fast SPV desktop wallet. However, he goes on to mention that he encountered several issues during his testing of multibit, including frequent deadlocks and lack of proxy support. Additionally, Maxwell notes that the wallet reuses addresses, does not clearly distinguish confirmation levels, and makes repeated https connections to an unknown IP address. He asks if there is a timeframe for resolving these issues. Another member of the thread, Caleb, comments on the potential risks of discussing anonymity or TOR in relation to Bitcoin development.</summary>
