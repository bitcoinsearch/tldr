    <summary>In this email thread, a discussion regarding the adoption of Bitcoin is taking place. One person suggests that most users are migrating to blockchain.info or coinbase.com, but they would like to keep Bitcoin as P2P as possible. Another member of the conversation notes that regular people outside of the Bitcoin community do not want to learn all the new terminology and simply want a client that just works and allows them to retain control of their private keys. They argue that channelling these regular people to a decent client would be huge for mass adoption. The argument about Bitcoin needing nodes is deemed manipulative and unnecessary, as there are plenty of nodes available and NAT'ed home nodes which don't mine are mostly useless anyways. The conversation then shifts to discussing the number of full nodes versus SPV nodes and how multibit will likely never participate in the Bitcoin network other than as an SPV client. The optimisation of multibit is to reduce data traffic, effectively making it a mobile wallet that happens to live on a desktop. It is not intended to be more than "a wallet for regular people to store and spend their bitcoin". The conversation ends with a mention of Windows sponsorship and links to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
