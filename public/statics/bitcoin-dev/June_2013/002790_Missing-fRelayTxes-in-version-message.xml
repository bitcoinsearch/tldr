    <summary>In an email thread between Mike Hearn and Paul Lyon, they discuss the issue of the fRelayTxes field missing from some Bitcoin version messages. Turkey Breast also chimes in, suggesting that it would be better if messages always had a fixed number of fields per protocol version, rather than having variable length messages. Some argue that this is not a bug, but rather just how the protocol has always worked, with variable length messages being allowed for tx messages, for example. Ultimately, it is suggested that the protocol version should be upgraded to reflect the inclusion of fRelayTxes.</summary>
