    <summary>In a conversation between Adam Back and Peter Todd, the topic of merged mining was discussed. Back suggested a "fair" merged mining solution which involved the miner choosing between mining altcoin or Bitcoin at mine time. In this scenario, the altcoin chain would consider Bitcoin mine unspendable and vice versa. The purpose of this would be to prove the sacrifice of potential BTC earnings, accomplished by mining shares with an unspendable coinbase. This would require a coinbase for parity-priced alt-coins that would be intentionally considered an invalid Bitcoin address and vice versa. The difference being that it would be a valid alt-coin coinbase and unspendable Bitcoin coinbase.</summary>
