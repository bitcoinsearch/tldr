    <summary>In this email thread, the members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list are discussing the possibility of replacing Bitcoin-Qt with MultiBit as the recommended desktop wallet app. Gavin Andresen votes in favor of making the switch and believes that most users will be happier with MultiBit. Theymos is asked to relax newbie restrictions for the alt client forums, as getting support at the moment is difficult and emailing Jim doesn't scale. The email also includes a sponsored message from Windows, urging developers to build for the Windows Store.</summary>
