    <summary>A group of researchers has discovered a vulnerability in Bitcoin which could lead to a double-spending attack in fast payment scenarios. Compatibility issues with signature encoding between versions 0.8.2 and earlier versions of Bitcoin have introduced the vulnerability. The researchers have provided a detailed description of this vulnerability at ftp://ftp.inf.ethz.ch/pub/publications/tech-reports/7xx/789.pdf. Gavin, one of the Bitcoin developers, has already been informed about the problem. The vulnerability is expected to be addressed soon.</summary>
