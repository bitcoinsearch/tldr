    <summary>The author is working on a project that requires users to exchange public keys for multisig transactions. They have noted that hex encoding is commonly used to display public keys, but this results in longer strings and lacks the 4-byte verification. The author proposes using a standard way to encode public keys as base58-check addresses which would make it easier and safer to display and exchange public keys. They suggest using 0x37/0x38 as a prefix byte which would result in the letter P for "Public" since these bytes are not currently being used for anything else.</summary>
