    <summary>Bitcoinj 0.9, a Java library for working with the Bitcoin protocol, has been released. The library supports simplified and full verification and has been used to create everything from end-user wallet apps to network crawlers to SatoshiDice. To get bitcoinj 0.9, users can check out the source from git and run *git fetch --all; git checkout **67b187c4c4c4*. The 0.9 release is signed by Andreas Schildbach and can be verified with *git tag -v 0.9* once users have his key.New features in this release include a basic fee solver that attaches the minimum fee per kilobyte to a created transaction using the 0.8.2+ fee rules, improved coin selection in the wallet, and a new ScriptBuilder class that simplifies the process of constructing various kinds of scripts. A new block importer tool can parse bitcoind block files and process them, which is faster than streaming them over a network connection. Support for the regtest mode added by the C++ side pull req 2632 makes app development and testing easier by eliminating the need to wait for a block.The release also includes many bug fixes and testing improvements. Known issues can be found on the limitations and missing features page on the website.</summary>
