    <summary>The email conversation between Bill Hees and Gavin Andresen discusses the promotion of both Bitcoin-QT and a lighter-weight alternative on bitcoin.org. They suggest outlining arguments for both options and providing links to alternative wallet solutions with their respective benefits and drawbacks. The question is raised whether having a singular "recommended" client would be advantageous. Gavin Andresen votes in favor of MultiBit replacing Bitcoin-QT as the recommended desktop wallet app, arguing that most users would prefer it. However, he acknowledges that it is easy to change back if necessary.</summary>
