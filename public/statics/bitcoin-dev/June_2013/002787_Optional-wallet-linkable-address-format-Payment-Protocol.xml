    <summary>In this conversation, Jeremy is discussing with Alan the limitations of BIP32 in using multiple chains. He mentions that BIP32 does not prescribe a way to use multiple chains like the one he described. He also questions the need for a 128kB hardware wallet as it is only a signing device and doesn't listen on the P2P network. Jeremy emphasizes the benefits of gaining critical mass support for a technique that can be used in all cases, increasing security and privacy for everyone involved. He believes there are huge benefits in leaving the age of single address generation behind us.</summary>
