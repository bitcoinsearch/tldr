    <summary>The email thread from Bitcoin-development mailing list discusses the BIP 60 proposal. The proposal suggests that messages should always have a fixed number of fields per protocol version. However, it's not clear whether it's a bug or not, as version messages have always been variable length. There is nothing inherent in the Bitcoin protocol that states that all messages should be fixed length. Additionally, tx messages are allowed to have arbitrary data appended after them that gets relayed.The email includes a link to the BIP 60 wiki page, which details everything that needs to be done and proposes a protocol upgrade. It's worth noting that there was recently a change to make bitcoind/qt always send a particular field, although this isn't related to the discussion on BIP 60. The email also includes a sponsored message about building for Windows Store.</summary>
