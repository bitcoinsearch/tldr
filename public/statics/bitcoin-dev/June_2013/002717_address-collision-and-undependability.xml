    <summary>The checksum at the end of a cryptocurrency address does not effectively prevent single character errors or transpositions. For example, valid addresses such as 1ByteCoinAddressesMatch1kpCWNXmHKW and 1ByteCoinAddressesMatch1kpCxNXmHKW only differ by one character. Similarly, addresses such as 1ByteCoinAddressesMatchcNN781jjwLY and 1ByteCoinAddressesMatchcNN718jjwLY only differ by one transposition. A discussion on Bitcoin-dev revealed that it would be impractical to generate two Bitcoin addresses that differed in exactly one character modulo different checksums. Additionally, changing one character of an address with a verifiable signature would render it undependable due to the lack of a known private key.</summary>
