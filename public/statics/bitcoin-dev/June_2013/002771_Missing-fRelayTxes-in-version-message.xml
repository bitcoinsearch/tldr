    <summary>The email conversation thread dated June 19, 2013, between Turkey Breast and Mike Hearn discusses the issue of variable length messages in protocol versions. Turkey Breast suggests making a fixed number of fields per protocol to make parsing messages easier and as good practice. However, Mike Hearn argues that there is no problem with variable length messages in any codebase he knows of and that it is not a bug but rather an inherent feature of the Bitcoin protocol. He also mentions that Amir's proposal for BIP 60 is unclear and proposes a protocol upgrade. The emails include links to BIP 60 and a Windows sponsorship offer.</summary>
