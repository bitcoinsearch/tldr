    <summary>The context is a PGP signed message from Mike Hearn, where he discusses the possibility of mining nodes restarting and clearing their mempools out rather than an explicit policy of replace by fee. The discussion pertains to Peter's replace-by-fee node, which would have to be connected directly to the mining node for this to happen. The sender also mentions that they took care to ensure transactions were only ever broadcast once, disabling the wallet rebroadcast mechanism.</summary>
