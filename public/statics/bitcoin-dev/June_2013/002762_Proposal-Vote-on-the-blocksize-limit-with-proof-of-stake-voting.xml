    <summary>Peter Todd and Alan Reiner discuss the problem of long-term storage of large amounts of money, which requires a secure voting system to sign votes. However, revealing one's public key is a concern, as it increases exposure and risk of quantum computers breaking encryption earlier than expected. Todd suggests adding an opcode called "OP_VOTE" and executing a code-path in the script for that specific key. Reiner argues that instead of "OP_VOTE," a "spending tx matches a template" functionality would suffice. The discussion ends with no clear solution proposed.</summary>
