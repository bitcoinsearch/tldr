    <summary>In a discussion on a Bitcoin forum on June 27, 2013, Jeff Garzik expressed concern about the possibility of an overall reduction in full nodes on the P2P network. He noted that he had never seen a listening bitcoinj or MultiBit node and asked if MultiBit would be adding p2p listening support. There was also some discussion about whether MultiBit promoted Bitcoin misunderstandings with misinformation like "from" addresses.</summary>
