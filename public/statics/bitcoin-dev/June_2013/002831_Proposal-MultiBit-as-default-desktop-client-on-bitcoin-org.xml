    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list proposed the idea of promoting a fast SPV desktop wallet. However, another member reported issues with the wallet after testing it on multibit. The issues included frequent deadlocks, lack of proxy support, address reuse, and unclear confirmation levels. The wallet also made repeated HTTPS connections to an unknown IP address (141.101.113.245). The member questioned if there was any timeframe for addressing these concerns. The email was sponsored by Windows and included a link for building apps for the Windows Store.</summary>
