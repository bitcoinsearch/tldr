    <summary>The discussion between Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd focuses on ways of optimizing the use of bandwidth when mining bitcoins. One proposal is to have a mempool with child-pays-for-parent support where conflicts are allowed, which would enable miners to prioritize transactions based on fees/kb. Another suggestion is that when INV advertisements are sent to peers, they should include information about fee/kb, which would allow peers to prioritize properly. Garzik suggests that instead of broadcasting block header + coinbase TX + TX list, miners could opt-in to this network-wide cost. Garzik also recommends that pools target at least 5-10 seconds per share, no matter the strength of the miner.</summary>
