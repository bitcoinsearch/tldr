    <summary>In an email exchange in June 2013, Bitcoin developer Adam Back proposed a new type of merged mining. This "fair" merged mining would require miners to choose between mining an altcoin or Bitcoin at the time of mining. The altcoin chain would consider Bitcoin as unspendable and vice versa. This would prove the miner's sacrifice of potential earnings and go back to the proof-of-work hashcash system mentioned earlier. The idea was discussed in an email exchange with Peter Todd, another prominent Bitcoin developer.</summary>
