    <summary>On November 19, 2013, Wladimir posted a message on GitHub asking about the future of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Jeff Garzik replied that BIP drafts can be found in git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git/drafts/ and are not automatically assigned BIPS numbers. Wladimir volunteered to create the repository and import current BIPs from wiki to there and convert them from wiki markup to markdown if necessary. Peter Todd had already done so and shared a link to his repository https://github.com/petertodd/bips. In response to this, Jeff suggested that leaving BIPs as MediaWiki is the best way to go because MediaWiki has advantages over markdown when it comes to formatting capabilities, particularly for displaying mathematical equations. They agreed that new BIPs may use either markdown or MediaWiki format. The discussion revolved around the best way to move forward with BIPs and how they should be formatted. While Wladimir had initially offered to create the repository for BIPs, Peter Todd had already done so and shared the link to his repository. It was decided that BIPs could use either markdown or MediaWiki format, but leaving them as MediaWiki was considered the better option due to its superior formatting capabilities. Overall, the discussion centered around how to improve BIPs and ensure that they were easily accessible and properly formatted.</summary>
