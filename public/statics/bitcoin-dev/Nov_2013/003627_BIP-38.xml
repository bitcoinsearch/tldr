    <summary>In an email to Mike Caldwell, Wladimir mentions some issues he faced while implementing BIP 0038 in Python. He brings up the fact that the BIP does not describe how flag 0x04 (lotsequence_present) should be used in decoding and suggests that it be clarified. Additionally, Wladimir points out an error in the encryption process mentioned in the BIP where it says "Split the result into two 16-byte halves and call them derivedhalf1 and derivedhalf2." It should actually be two 32-byte halves as the result is 64 bytes. In response to Mike's email about a recent change to BIP 0038, Gregory informs him that there have been no prior messages about his proposal on the list and no mention of the assignment had been made in the wiki. Gregory had assumed that something similar to what happened with BIP 22 had occurred. Gregory suggests that having a wallet with only a single address is poor form and mentions Jean-Paul Kogelman's draft proposal which is based on Caldwell's BIP38 work but with a different encoding scheme that was revised in response to public discussion. He proposes combining efforts to move forward.</summary>
