    <summary>In November 2013, there was a discussion about Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) on the Bitcoin Development mailing list. Jeff Garzik mentioned that BIP drafts are stored in git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git/drafts/ and are not automatically assigned a BIPS number. Wladimir suggested creating a repository to import the current BIPs from the wiki there and convert them from wiki markup to markdown where necessary. Peter Todd volunteered to create the repository, which he did and named it https://github.com/petertodd/bips. Todd recommended leaving the BIPs as MediaWiki since GitHub can render MediaWiki just fine. He also suggested that new BIPs may want to use either markdown or MediaWiki but that the latter has advantages in terms of formatting capabilities over the former, particularly when math needs to be displayed.</summary>
