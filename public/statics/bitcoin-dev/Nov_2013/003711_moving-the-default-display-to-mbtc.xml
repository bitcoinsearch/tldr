    <summary>In a message exchange on Nov 15, 2013, Jeff Garzik suggested to go straight to using uBTC (micro bitcoin) instead of BTC (bitcoin). He stated that humans and existing computer systems handle numbers to the left of the decimals just fine, whereas QuickBooks really does not like 3+ decimal places. Wendell replied that they are also with uBTC and have been waiting for the signal to do so, and that they should make the switch right after the fee system is improved. Wendell also provided links to grabhive.com, hivewallet's Twitter page, and his GPG key.</summary>
