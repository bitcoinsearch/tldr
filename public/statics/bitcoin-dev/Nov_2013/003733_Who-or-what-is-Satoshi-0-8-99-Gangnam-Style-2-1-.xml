    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Addy Yeow, Hearn praises the Bitnodes site created by Yeow and asks if it would be possible to gather and chart data on block and transaction propagation times. Yeow responds that there are several TODOs for the project in the next couple of months, including propagation data. Hearn also asks whether the recent increase in running nodes is real or due to custom experimental additions and Yeow notes that a more in-depth analysis is needed. In another email, Hearn discusses additional logging he added to his node and noticed that despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, virtually all transactions seen by his node were being announced by modified software running on several different machines. He wonders if the owners of these nodes are relaying transactions without checking their validity and if that's why they always win the race to be the first to announce to his node. Hearn has opened a pull request for his extra logging, which he notes is quite trivial.</summary>
