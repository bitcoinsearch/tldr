    <summary>In an email exchange on November 22, 2013, Gregory Maxwell asked Jeff Garzik if there was a reason why Bitcoin Core did not have a parallel get RPC to obtain the current list. Garzik replied that it would be easy to add. He also mentioned that there had been requests for an IP blacklist, which would require associated RPC/config gadgetry. Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist who works for BitPay, Inc.</summary>
