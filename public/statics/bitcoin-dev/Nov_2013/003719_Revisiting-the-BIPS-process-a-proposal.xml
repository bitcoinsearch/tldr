    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Drak on November 19, 2013, they discussed the practice of allocating numbers to proposals during draft status. Maxwell explained that the IETF distinguishes between individual proposals and documents that have been accepted by a working group and given a number only upon completion. He emphasized the importance of distinguishing complete work from incomplete work and single party work to avoid confusion and misinformation. Drak suggested using GitHub for collaboration and proposed a system where proposals could be worked on in a forked repository and submitted as pull requests to the draft folder once ready for acceptance by the working group. This way, random BIPs could not be added to the official repo without first being accepted as a working draft proposal by Gavin or another designated person. The proposal would then undergo further collaboration and tweaking until reaching a final state, at which point it would be moved to the accepted/ folder.</summary>
