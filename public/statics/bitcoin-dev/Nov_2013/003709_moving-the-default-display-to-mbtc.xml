    <summary>Psychology research shows that defaults have a strong influence on people's behavior. This can be observed in the difference between opt-in and opt-out national organ donation policies, where the default option can affect donation rates drastically. For instance, countries with opt-in policies tend to have organ donation rates below 10%, while those with opt-out policies have rates over 90%. A discussion on changing the default display in Bitcoin software was held on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in November 2013. The suggestion was to consider making mbtc the default option instead of bitcoin, which already had a dropdown display option.</summary>
