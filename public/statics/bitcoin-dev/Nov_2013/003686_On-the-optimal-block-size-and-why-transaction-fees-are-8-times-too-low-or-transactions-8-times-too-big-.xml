    <summary>In this email thread, Bitcoin experts are discussing the cost of including transactions in blocks and how it rewards larger mining pools. Michael Gronager suggests that reducing the number of hops in the network would bring down the cost of including transactions per kilobyte (kB). However, Peter Todd argues that such a reduction in k is unlikely to happen and that large pools could easily connect with each other. He also notes that smaller miners should not include transactions in their blocks if they want to remain competitive. The thread concludes with a discussion on the reward system for miners and the importance of decentralization and resistance to 51% attack.</summary>
