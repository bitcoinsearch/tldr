    <summary>The discussion about BIP39 and its usefulness in transcribing binary data has resulted in the removal of similar words from the word list. However, this only serves to validate input, not assist the user if it is incorrect. If a similar word is used instead of the correct one, it would result in a checksum error. The proposal is to include words that are similar to each other and have them refer to the same number. This could be done by allowing multiple words on a single line in the wordlist, with the first word being the "primary" or "real" word, and the other similar words included for translation purposes. This would allow translation programs to fix users' input errors and provide helpful feedback, such as "'cat' isn't a valid word choice; assuming you meant 'eat', which is valid". However, caution must be exercised to avoid confusion and ensure that only the "main" word is used for translation. An updated wordlist has been pushed, filtered to similar characters, and reviewed by slush.</summary>
