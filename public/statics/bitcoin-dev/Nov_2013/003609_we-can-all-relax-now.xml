    <summary>Kyle Jerviss mentioned the concept of Gambler's ruin, which is not related to the topic being discussed. The topic is evaluating the chance of the other side getting ahead and cashing in by publishing blocks. It's important to keep track of the value of unpublished blocks and consider publishing some or all of them if they stand to lose more than they gain. This is mostly a theoretical attack because inflation subsidy is large and fees don't matter, but it gets more complex once fees start to matter. An example is announce/commit sacrifices to mining fees.Peter Todd suggested that pools contact him to get them to switch to a smaller pool as it would help if everyone mined solo or on p2pool. Currently, this attack is theoretical and doesn't pose a significant threat. However, if the fees become substantial, then the situation could change.</summary>
