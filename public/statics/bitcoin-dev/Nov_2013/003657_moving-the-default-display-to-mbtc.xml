    <summary>In this context, Jeff Garzik and Mark Friedenbach are discussing the use of decimal places in Bitcoin. Garzik suggests using uBTC because existing computer systems can handle numbers to the left of the decimals just fine, while QuickBooks does not like 3+ decimal places, so it's better to have two decimal places which is becoming a standard for new national currencies. Friedenbach agrees that having eight or even five decimal places is not intuitive to the average user, and by using uBTC, they wouldn't be too far from human scale everyday numbers. They suggest switching currency symbols to alleviate the confusion, to XBT or NBC (New Bitcoin). The email also includes a PGP signature for security purposes.</summary>
