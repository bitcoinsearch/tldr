    <summary>In an email conversation on 17/11/13, Timo Hanke asked how Trezor proves that external entropy is used in their wallet. Pavol Rusnak responded by explaining the process they would use. The most straightforward way involves printing entropy A on a display (in hex format), triggered by sending a special flag in the initialize message. Trezor then receives entropy B from an external source and creates sha256(A + B) to use as a seed. The used seed is printed on a display (in BIP39 format), which can be checked by the user on a trusted computer. It is important to note that steps b-d are the same regardless of whether the special flag was set.</summary>
