    <summary>In a discussion thread, Pavol Rusnak and Timo Hanke talked about Trezor's process of generating a random number and sending it to the computer while keeping the number secret. Hanke raised the question of how one can be sure that the mnemonic corresponds to the secret in Trezor. He shared his experience of losing coins because the secrets he had didn't match the public keys he thought they would match. Hanke suggested recovering the wallet first from backed-up secrets before sending any coins to pubkeys in the wallet. He questioned if having one device generate and display the secret is the right way to go since it requires a second device to verify the backup is sane. The question of auditing entropy would only apply to the generator and not the wallet. Hanke recommended proving that external entropy was used while generating the master seed.</summary>
