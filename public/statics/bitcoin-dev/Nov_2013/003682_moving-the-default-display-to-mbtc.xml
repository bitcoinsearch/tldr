    <summary>In this email chain, Alex Kravets suggests the idea of Bitcoin currency code standardization and re-denomination project. He claims that a lot of non-geeks are confused by the notation used to represent very small quantities of Bitcoin. He proposes using XBT as the currency code and defining one bit as 100 satoshis. However, another individual, Eugen Leitl, opposes this idea and instead suggests using SI prefixes. Alan Reiner supports the XBT idea but disagrees with the term "micro bitcoins." He suggests naming them "bits," "micros" or "microbits" to ensure consistency in terminology. On the other hand, Leitl believes that SI prefixes were invented to prevent the need for such a transition. The discussion revolves around the best way to standardize Bitcoin units and terminology to avoid confusion among users.</summary>
