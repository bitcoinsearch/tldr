    <summary>The author of the text is proposing an alternative protocol change to address the miner backbone issue discussed in a paper. Instead of assuming the network is full of sybil nodes and changing the rules for selecting the chain, the author suggests automatically building a miner backbone by having IP addresses of nodes embedded into coinbases. By doing so, all major pools would be linked together with no administration overhead. To further enhance privacy, IPv6 could be used to allow nodes to be reached via Tor, which would be useful for anti-DoS reasons. The author believes that achieving this can be done with a few days of coding and new command line flags, and the impact is much easier to reason about than the proposed fundamental rule change.</summary>
