    <summary>In a forum discussion dated October 31st, 2013, a user named "slush" brought up a practical issue with the mining of mnemonics in a proposal made by Thomas. Slush noted that embedded devices would not be able to use mnemonics due to the high difficulty of generating them on microcontrollers. While solutions may exist, Slush considered this to be a current showstopper for the proposal. Another user then asked if metadata being only 8 bits, or around 256 hashes, could potentially solve this problem.</summary>
