    <summary>In 2013, a patch was sent by Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik to the Bitcoin-development mailing list for discussion. As Github access was temporarily disabled, he chose this avenue for submitting the patch. However, another member of the mailing list pointed out that the code in the patch looked like node.js code for something called txtool. It is unclear what the patch was intended to do or if it was ultimately accepted and implemented into the Bitcoin codebase. Jeff Garzik also worked for BitPay, Inc., an open-source payment processor for Bitcoin and the email included a promotional message for Intel's Software Adrenaline, which offered a free subscription for software experts and developers to stay up-to-date on tech innovation.The patch submitted by Jeff Garzik adds functions to the BitcoinRPC.js file which includes getRawTransaction, signRawTransaction and sendRawTransaction. A new transaction tool has been added which allows users to load files in hex format, serialize transactions from bitcoind RPC, and execute JSON-RPC commands using the txtool command. The tool can be run by executing `./txtool -h` and following the instructions. Despite Github access being temporarily disabled, the pull request avenue was used as the best option for submission and the patch is unlikely to be controversial.</summary>
