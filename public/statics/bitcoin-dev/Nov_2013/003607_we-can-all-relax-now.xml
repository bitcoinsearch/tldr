    <summary>The email thread discusses the strategy of miners sending blocks to only 51% of the hash power, with Peter Todd calculating that the actual threshold is 29.3%. He explains that if a miner has &gt;29.3% of the hashing power, they have no incentive to publish the blocks they mine. Furthermore, if a miner knows that they are two blocks ahead, they need less hashing power for their incentives to be to not publish the block they just found. This means that miners should try to make their blocks propagate to less of the hashing power by whatever means necessary. If any large pools want to try this stuff out, they can contact Peter Todd.</summary>
