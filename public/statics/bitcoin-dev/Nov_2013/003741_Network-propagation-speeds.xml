    <summary>Christian Decker, the author of the Information Propagation paper, has created an automated measurement code for network propagation, which takes a daily snapshot of the situation and calculates the time until blocks and transactions reach a certain percentile of nodes in the network. The result is available on the Network Propagation page on bitcoinstats.com. This page includes a detailed page showing the density function describing at what times nodes learn about the existence of a block/transaction. Christian Decker intends to add more information and plots over time, but wanted to push this out quickly as there were some people asking for it. He hopes that this will help in reducing the blockchain fork rate.</summary>
