    <summary>In an email thread dated November 6, 2013, Kyle Jerviss explained that each block solved in Bitcoin mining has a reward, but the expected reward is slightly less than the nominal reward due to orphaned blocks. The longer a miner delays publishing a block, the more the expected reward drops. A response to this email criticized the lack of stated assumptions in a paper and noted that attacking a paper can involve showing it's wrong or showing its assumptions make it irrelevant. However, the response did not do either of these things.</summary>
