    <summary>The email from Drak suggests that without recommendation or action from bitcoin core developers, there may not be much change at the user or consumer level. However, Jeff Garzik argues that decisions should not be centralized in this decentralized currency and instead proposes generating discussion on all possible forums to consider a proposal to switch to uBTC, labeled as ISO prefers (XBT?). He believes that input and discussion at every level of the community is necessary before any decisions are made. Garzik emphasizes the need for less "core dev fiat" and more collaborative decision-making. Garzik is a senior software engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
