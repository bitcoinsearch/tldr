    <summary>Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, Jeff Garzik has submitted a patch for discussion that is unlikely to be controversial. Github access was temporarily disabled hence this is the best pull request avenue for the moment. The patch sent adds functions to the BitcoinRPC.js file which includes getRawTransaction, signRawTransaction and sendRawTransaction. A new transaction tool has been added which allows users to load files in hex format, serialize transactions from bitcoind RPC, and execute JSON-RPC commands using the txtool command. The tool can be run by executing `./txtool -h` and following the instructions.</summary>
