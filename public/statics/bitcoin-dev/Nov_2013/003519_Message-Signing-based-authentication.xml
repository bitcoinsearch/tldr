    <summary>In an email exchange from 2013, Jeff Garzik and Melvin Carvalho discuss the issue of identity online. Carvalho suggests that identity need not be a hard problem and that it is already solved. Garzik agrees and provides a link to the Bitcoin Identity Protocol v1 on the Bitcoin Wiki. However, it is noted that this protocol does not solve the problem for the average internet browser. The discussion ends with the acknowledgment that this is not the right forum to delve into the topic further. The email includes a PGP signature from Garzik.</summary>
