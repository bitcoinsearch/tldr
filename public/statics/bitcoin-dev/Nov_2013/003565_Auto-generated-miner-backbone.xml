    <summary>In a conversation about the future of Bitcoin, Mike Hearn suggested the creation of an automated miner backbone or cloud. This suggestion was met with criticism from others who believed that it showed a conflict of interest on Hearn's part as an employee and could lead to centralization of infrastructure. Additionally, Hearn's trust in IP addresses as a foundation for security was called into question, citing his apparent shock when the NSA hacked his previous backbone.</summary>
