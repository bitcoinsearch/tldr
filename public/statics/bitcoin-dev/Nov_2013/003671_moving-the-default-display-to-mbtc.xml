    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Daniel F suggested that the community should avoid centralizing decisions, and switch to uBTC instead of BTC. He recommended posting on all possible forums with a proposal to switch to uBTC and see what sort of discussion is generated. Another participant in the thread disagreed, stating that the market should be left to decide and that changing the default value in the dropdown from BTC to mBTC could be a viable solution. The thread also touched upon the question of the ISO code (XBT vs BTC) and the fact that the price of bitcoin has gone up roughly 1000x since Satoshi made his suggestion that the decimal point could move 3 places.</summary>
