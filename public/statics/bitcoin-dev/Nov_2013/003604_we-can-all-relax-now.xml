    <summary>In an email dated November 6, 2013, a user named kjj expressed their frustration with the Selfish Mining paper and its unsuitability as a simulation of the Bitcoin system. They criticized the authors for assuming a total sybil attack and not realizing that the condition necessary for the attack is far worse than the attack itself. In response to this lack of a suitable network simulator, kjj offered a bounty of 1 BTC for building a general Bitcoin network simulator framework that can account for latency between nodes, simulate an attacker that owns varying fractions of the network, and be easily modified for other schemes. Another user expressed interest in working on the simulator and posted details about it. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
