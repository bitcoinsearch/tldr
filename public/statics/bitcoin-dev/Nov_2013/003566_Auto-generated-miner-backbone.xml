    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin development, Mike Hearn suggested the idea of building a miner backbone. Gustaw Wieczorek accused Hearn of advocating centralization of infrastructure, citing his conflict-of-interest as an employee. However, Hearn clarified that using Tor addresses would authenticate the mechanism and it is as decentralized as Bitcoin mining itself. Peter Todd chimed in, stating that he himself suggested the mechanism for different reasons and he is usually against centralization. The discussion did not involve Google.</summary>
