    <summary>On November 2, 2013, Mike Hearn questioned why SSL client certificates were not widely used. He proposed that if they were utilized, it would force website pages to be encrypted and make it difficult for the NSA to log web traffic. In response to this, a forum member on Bitcointalk.org shared a white paper on passwordless secure login based on bitcoin/bitmessage technology. The purpose of this technology is to create a secure login without requiring a password. The post was signed using PGP encryption.</summary>
