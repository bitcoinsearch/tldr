    <summary>In an email exchange on November 19, 2013, between Wladimir and others, the lack of associated documents for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) 40 and 41 was discussed. The BIPs are already widely deployed, but there is a question about how to distinguish between BIPs that document defacto standards versus those that propose new actions. The group agreed that BIPs should not be used as levers to force ideas onto others, but rather the process should help build consensus and review on how to do something and then document that consensus. They also noted that the IETF issues informational RFCs liberally for already widely deployed things. A link to the BIP repository on Github was provided for reference.</summary>
