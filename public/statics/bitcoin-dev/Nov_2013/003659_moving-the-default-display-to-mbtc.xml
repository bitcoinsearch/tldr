    <summary>In a conversation between Drak and Alan Reiner on 14 November 2013, they discussed the minimum unit that can be transferred and the standard fees for Bitcoin transactions. Alan mentioned that the smallest unit that can be easily transferred is 54.3 uBTC and the standard fees are 500 uBTC, but he noted that it's not a deal-breaker. Drak corrected Alan by saying that the fees were reduced to 0.0001/kb a while back. He also clarified that the fees are currently around $0.042, contrary to what others were saying about the fees being $0.20.</summary>
