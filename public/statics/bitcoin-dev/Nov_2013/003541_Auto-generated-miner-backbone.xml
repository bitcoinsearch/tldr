    <summary>The suggested change to address the problem in Bitcoin is not agreed upon by all. The proposed solution would allow anyone to broadcast a newly discovered block at any time and have a 50% chance of winning, which fundamentally changes the dynamics of how Bitcoin works. This would require careful study before implementation. Additionally, the proposed change does not address the sybil attack issue that is at the core of the problem. A solution to sybil attacks should be implemented instead.</summary>
