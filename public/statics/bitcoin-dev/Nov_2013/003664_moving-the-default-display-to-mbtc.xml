    <summary>In a message posted on 14th November 2013, Bitcoin core developer Mark Friedenbach suggested that the term “address” should be changed to “key id”. He argues that the use of the term “address” leads people to associate it with a physical location or account, whereas in reality the address is temporary and changes frequently. The notion of an “invoice id” was also suggested as a way to refer to addresses, however this may become obsolete with the payment protocol. Another developer, Luke-Jr, suggests using “invoice id” instead of “address” as it is more intuitive. A third developer, Sipa, suggests using “key id”, stating that it accurately describes the hashed-pubkeys. Friedenbach agrees with the suggestion of using “key id”, arguing that it is a neutral term which does not lead to any specific associations.</summary>
