    <summary>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and another individual, both expressed their reluctance towards centralization and trusted entities. They discussed the idea of an authenticated miner announced set of nodes, but acknowledged that this alone is not a complete solution as attacks can still be carried out by adding requirements to target the public miner announced nodes. However, they emphasized the importance of improving Bitcoin's security by creating tighter networks and making it more difficult to partition.</summary>
