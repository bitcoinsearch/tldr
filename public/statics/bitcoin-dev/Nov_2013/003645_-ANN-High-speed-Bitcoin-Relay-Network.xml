    <summary>The code for transaction relay is different from that of block relay and the bandwidth for transaction relay on the nodes is lower than for blocks by design. However, tx-less block relays for transactions that peers already have may be considered to limit block relay times even for large blocks. In such cases, tx relay is necessary. John Dillon suggested splitting the block-only and block+tx not only by port number but also by DNS address. This would minimize the risk of a DoS attack by flooding transactions. By doing so, the more important block relaying functionality is less likely to be damaged in an event of an attack. Until it becomes an issue, both DNS addresses should point to the same IP.</summary>
