    <summary>In this email conversation, Michael Gronager and Peter Todd discuss the alpha value for block propagation. They calculate that it takes 24kB/s to propagate a block, which they consider "atrocious". Michael then calculates alpha using different values, leading to confusion as to where one of the numbers came from. They go on to discuss the amount of money wasted due to inefficient block propagation, and conclude that pool operator earnings are only slightly affected. The conversation then turns to P2Pool and its advantages, including more efficient block propagation. However, they also acknowledge the difficulty in growing P2Pool due to the requirement of running a full node.</summary>
