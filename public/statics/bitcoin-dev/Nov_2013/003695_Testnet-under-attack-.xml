    <summary>The use of testnet is sometimes limited as it can break due to public resource abuse. Instead, creating a local network with -regtest allows instant block minting and simplifies the testing and app development process. In a 2013 email thread started by Mike Belshe on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, he raised concerns about someone minting new blocks every couple of seconds on the testnet chain. This issue was observed on both blockexplorer and btclook. The email also included a promotion for DreamFactory, an open-source REST and JSON services provider for HTML5 and Native Apps.</summary>
