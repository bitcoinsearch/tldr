    <summary>In an email conversation on November 14, 2013, Allen Piscitello suggested that Bitcoin-Qt should display all fees and trading rates in BTC or MBTC. He also expressed concern over the potential confusion that could arise from any transition and suggested that any changes be bundled with other terminology fix-ups. One such issue he raised was the use of "confirmations" to refer to both the number of blocks deep a transaction is buried and the point where a transaction is accepted as paid. He suggested that using "5 blocks deep" would help prevent confusion. Another issue he raised was the use of the term "address," which people naturally compare to postal addresses and email addresses. He suggested using "invoice id" instead. Luke asked for thoughts on these suggestions and whether the advent of the payment protocol would make address/invoice id use obsolete.</summary>
