    <title>[PATCH] bitcoind: whitelist nodes, to prevent them from being banned</title>

    <summary>In 2013, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik sent a patch to the Bitcoin-development mailing list for discussion. As Github access was temporarily disabled, he chose this avenue for submitting the patch. However, another member of the mailing list, Michael, pointed out that the code in the patch looked like node.js code for something called txtool. It is unclear what the patch was intended to do or if it was ultimately accepted and implemented into the Bitcoin codebase. Along with his role as a Bitcoin core developer, Jeff Garzik also worked for BitPay, Inc., an open-source payment processor for Bitcoin. The email also included a promotional message for Intel's Software Adrenaline, which offered a free subscription for software experts and developers to stay up-to-date on tech innovation.</summary>
