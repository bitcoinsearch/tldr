    <summary>In March, there was a vote on bitcointalk.org regarding the proposal to use uBTC as the main unit for Bitcoin. The majority of votes were in favor of it. The advantages of using uBTC are that having satoshi as 1/100 of the main unit is familiar to people like USD and cent, all existing financial software can deal/store big numbers but typically only two decimals, and the split could be linked with the introduction of the ISO code in one step. Jeff Garzik suggested posting the proposal on all possible forums and seeing what sort of discussion is generated. If the support is broad, it will be plain from the responses if there is a consensus. Tamas Blummer, the founder and CEO of bitsofproof.com, sent the email.</summary>
