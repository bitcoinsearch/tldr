    <summary>In an email exchange, Wendell expressed confusion about the use of a vCard in passing around data. He clarified that Taylor was talking about a standard way to pass around data and that the end user wouldn't be exposed to a vCard. Additionally, he stated that the vCard's existence would be temporary. Mike Hearn responded, stating that he wasn't convinced that vCard support was necessary for payment protocol extensions, but it shouldn't hold anyone back from experimenting or prototyping. He mentioned that all an extension requires are some tag numbers and they aren't in danger of running out any time soon. Wendell's signature included links to grabhive.com, hivewallet on Twitter, and his GPG key (6C0C9411).</summary>
