    <summary>The author of a post on bitcointalk.org has criticized the paper "Selfish Mining" for not being a suitable simulation of the bitcoin network due to its lack of latency and states. The author suggests that a general bitcoin network simulator framework is needed that can account for latency between nodes, simulate an attacker that owns varying fractions of the network, and be easily modified for other schemes. The author even offers a 1 BTC bounty for building such a simulator. The lack of a decent network simulator was what allowed the Selfish Mining paper to gain attention, according to the author.</summary>
