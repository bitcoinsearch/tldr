    <summary>In November 2013, a discussion was held among Bitcoin developers regarding the terminology used for Bitcoin addresses. Luke-Jr suggested that using "invoice id" instead of "address" would be more intuitive for people who naturally compare it to postal or email addresses. Another developer, Mark Friedenbach, replied to the suggestion and proposed using "key id" instead. However, he clarified that he was not suggesting renaming scriptPubKey, but only the destination-for-transaction presented to end-users. The discussion also touched upon the possibility of address/invoice id becoming obsolete with the advent of the payment protocol.</summary>
