    <summary>On November 2, 2013, a celebration was held for the 5th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper. To commemorate the event, a new authentication method called Message Signing was introduced. The method involves the server providing a token for the client to sign, which is then passed back to the server along with the client's bitcoin address. The server validates the message and uses the alias and bitcoin address as identification. A proof of concept forum that utilizes this authentication method is available at forums.bitcoingrant.org.However, it was pointed out that this method has already been used for years by Eligius and Bitcoin-OTC. The user does not need to provide their bitcoin address every time they use the method.</summary>
