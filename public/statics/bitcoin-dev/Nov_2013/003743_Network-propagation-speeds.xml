    <summary>In a discussion with Gregory Maxwell, Christian Decker mentioned that he is trying to find a good way to publish some measurements. However, as the measurements are rather large in size, he doesn't want to serve them along with the website as it hasn't got the capacity. He is currently looking for suggestions on how to publish them effectively. In response, Maxwell asked if Decker could publish the block ids and timestamp sets for each block which would be useful in correlating propagation information against block characteristics. Decker plans to automate his measurement code from the Information Propagation paper and make it available on a per-user basis if the demand is not huge.</summary>
