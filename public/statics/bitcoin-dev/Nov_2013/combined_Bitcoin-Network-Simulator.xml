    <summary>A developer has created a Bitcoin network simulator that models miners exchanging messages and building block chains. The simulator includes two examples, one for a 51% attack and the other is an implementation of selfish mining. It simulates latency, bandwidth and verification speed but currently does not simulate propagation or inclusion of transactions, instead using random block sizes. The project can be found on the developer's Github page. Another developer has also created a Bitcoin network simulator with similar basic principles, which follows the protocol message structure as much as possible. The aim is to have a network/chain visualization running in the browser with the actual simulation running on a WebWorker to keep things responsive. The second simulator runs a network of 1000 full nodes (with 100 miners) for a week of simulated time (with a normal hashrate) and empty blocks (except for the coinbase transaction) takes about 30-60 seconds, using nodejs. Theoretical support for transaction propagation is included in this simulator, with the aim of testing zero-conf stuff and whether it works.The creator of the first simulator, Rafael Brune, invites others to take a look at the project and help improve it. With the random parameters chosen, it seems to pay off to mine selfish with &gt;=30% of the hashing power. However, this is based on a very small network and randomly chosen parameters, so it is not a perfect replica of the real-world network.</summary>
