    <summary>In a discussion about the use of measurements for propagation delays in Bitcoin, Pieter Wuille corrected himself regarding the data used in C. Decker's paper. Wuille had previously stated that the paper used data from blocks 180000-190000, which occurred between May and July 2012. However, he later clarified that the actual data used was from blocks 20000-210000, which took place from September to November 2012. It is worth noting that this data was still collected prior to the release of version 0.8 of bitcoind/bitcoin-qt.</summary>
