    <summary>MacOS X users have been experiencing periodic leveldb data corruption issues since 0.8.x version of Bitcoin. Three commits have been made to fix the issue, but there remains at least one mysterious corruption issue on Mac where leveldb is corrupted after a clean shutdown of Bitcoin-Qt. Gavin and Litecoin Dev have pledged 5 BTC and 200 LTC respectively to start a bounty for the fix. The thread has public addresses for Mac users to donate to increase the incentive to fix this issue sooner. For testing purposes, users are requested to use either Bitcoin git master or Bitcoin 0.8.5 OMG3, both of which contain all of the relevant leveldb fixes. Users are also encouraged to contribute detailed bug reports or links to more relevant background information pertaining to this corruption issue.</summary>
