    <summary>On November 14, 2013, Alan Reiner wrote about his liking of the XBT idea, which suggested matching ISO currency symbol. He also agreed with the idea of going straight to uBTC and skipping mBTC. However, he did not prefer calling them micro bitcoins and suggested the name "microbes" instead. Although it was not a suitable name for money transfer, he suggested using "bits", "micros" or "microbits". Alan believed that promoting a consistent term could avoid confusion when people use different names for the new unit. Meanwhile, Luke proposed sticking to SI units by using the abbreviation "micro-bitcoins" or "mibicoins" informally/spoken. The team aimed to pick a good name and build it into the interface on the first release to ensure an easier transition.</summary>
