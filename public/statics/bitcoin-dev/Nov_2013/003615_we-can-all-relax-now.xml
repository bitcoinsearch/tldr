    <summary>In this email conversation, Gavin Andresen expresses concern over the possibility of large pools attempting a selfish mining attack on the main network. He warns that if he finds out about such an experiment, he will encourage people to switch to a more responsible pool. ASICMiner and GHash.IO are cited as examples of pools that may have the capability to carry out such an attack. Andresen suggests that lowering the barrier with reactive block publishing could make it easier for a pool to reach 51% hashing power. He also advises miners to avoid pools with more than 1% hashing power and opt for smaller pools or p2pool instead. Finally, the email ends with Peter Todd jokingly calling for a witchhunt against large pools.</summary>
