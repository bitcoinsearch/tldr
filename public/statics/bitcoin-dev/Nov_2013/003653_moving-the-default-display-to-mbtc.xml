    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mark Friedenbach expressed support for skipping mBTC and moving straight to uBTC. He argued that having eight or even five decimal places is not intuitive to the average user, while two decimal places are becoming standard for new national currencies. Moving to uBTC would bring bitcoin closer to human scale everyday numbers, with 25.00uBTC currently equaling about $0.01. Friedenbach believes that very few people on the list would consider bitcoin overvalued in the long term perspective, and it is better to go through a confusing renumbering only once. Alan Reiner, however, expressed concerns about changing the base unit of such an established system, stating that there is no easy way to do so without causing more heartache than it's worth.</summary>
