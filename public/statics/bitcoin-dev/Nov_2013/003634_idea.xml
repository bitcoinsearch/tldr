    <summary>In an email thread from November 2013, Chris Evans suggested adding an optional note field to transactions so that receivers could identify who sent them Bitcoin. However, Wladimir, one of the developers of Bitcoin Core, explained that this issue arises only when users re-use addresses, which is discouraged for security reasons. He recommended that users request a new receiving address along with a message over whatever channel was used for negotiation when someone wanted to send them Bitcoin. For those posting static Bitcoin addresses for donations, Wladimir advised considering it an anonymous or pseudonymous gift jar.</summary>
