    <summary>Rafael Brune has created a Bitcoin network simulator that is a stochastic event-based continuous-time simulation of miners exchanging messages and building block chains. The simulator simulates latency, bandwidth, and verification speed but currently does not simulate propagation/inclusion of transactions and instead uses random block sizes. Two examples are included in the simulator, one for a 51% attack and the other is an implementation of selfish mining. With the random parameters chosen, it seems to pay off to mine selfish with &gt;=30% of the hashing power. However, this is based on a very small network and randomly chosen parameters, so it is not a perfect replica of the real-world network. Rafael Brune invites others to take a look at the project and help improve it. The project can be found on his Github page.</summary>
