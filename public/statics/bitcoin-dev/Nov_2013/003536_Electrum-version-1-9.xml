    <summary>Electrum has recently released version 1.9 which includes various features and updates. This version allows users to connect to multiple servers in order to retrieve block headers and find the longest chain. Additionally, SSL certificate validation has been added to prevent MITM attacks. The release also includes deterministic signatures and a menu to create/restore/open wallets. Users can now create transactions with multiple outputs from CSV (comma separated values). Moreover, Electrum has introduced a new user interface for text mode, named "stdio" which does not use curses. Plugins are no longer tied to the qt GUI and can reach all GUIs. Proxy bugs have been fixed as well. However, it is important to note that the BIP32 features are postponed to version 2.0 due to the discussions about mnemonic seed format.</summary>
