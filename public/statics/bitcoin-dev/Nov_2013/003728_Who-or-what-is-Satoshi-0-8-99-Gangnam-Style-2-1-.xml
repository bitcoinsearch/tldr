    <summary>Mike Hearn, a software developer, added some additional logging to his node and ran it for a few days. Despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, virtually all transactions seen by his node are being announced by modified software, which appears to run on several different machines. There is a pull request open for his extra logging, which is quite trivial. He posted a log showing the transactions accepted by his node, and he suspects that the modified software is relaying transactions without checking their validity as they always win the race to be the first to announce to his node. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, responded to this email.</summary>
