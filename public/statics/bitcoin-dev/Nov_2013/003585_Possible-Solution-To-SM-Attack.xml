    <summary>On November 5, 2013, a proposed solution was forwarded in an email thread regarding a possible attack on Bitcoin's blockchain. The solution suggested that if multiple blocks were received within a certain time frame, the block with the lowest hash would be chosen as the winner. This ensures that the winning block is chosen randomly and is considered a fair patch for the issue. It also requires the attacker to not only propagate their blocks first but also ensure that their blocks have the smallest hash, making it more difficult for them to carry out the attack.</summary>
