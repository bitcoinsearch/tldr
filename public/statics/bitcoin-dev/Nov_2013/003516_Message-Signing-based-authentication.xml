    <summary>In a conversation, someone mistakenly stated that it is not possible to log in a user using SSL and redirect them to an encrypted page. They later corrected themselves by saying that they meant an unencrypted page. This statement implies that it is indeed possible to log a user in using SSL and then redirect the user to either an encrypted or unencrypted page.</summary>
