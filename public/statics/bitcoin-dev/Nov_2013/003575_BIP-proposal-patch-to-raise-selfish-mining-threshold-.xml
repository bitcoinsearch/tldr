    <summary>Ittay has expressed concerns that any bugs found in sensitive software like Bitcoin should be fixed immediately, as every flaw that is exploitable in abstract will eventually be exploited in real life. He also warns against a false sense of security. In response to Ittay's comments, Mike Hearn suggests that it would be helpful if the attack was actually implemented and pulled off, so we could see how quickly it can be done.
