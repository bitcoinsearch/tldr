    <summary>In a conversation between Luke-Jr and Drak on November 16, 2013, the topic of using the term "blocks" for Bitcoin transactions was discussed. Drak suggested using "confirmations" instead, but Luke-Jr argued that this may not be the best term to use because it could be misleading for the average person. Instead, he suggested using "witnessed N times" or "clearing" for transactions with six confirmations. He also proposed using the round ticker as an indication of transaction progress. The discussion highlights the importance of clear and understandable language when explaining Bitcoin transactions to users.</summary>
