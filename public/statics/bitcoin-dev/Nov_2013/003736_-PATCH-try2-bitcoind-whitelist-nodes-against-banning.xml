    <summary>In an email thread from November 2013, Jeff Garzik proposed the idea of whitelisting nodes to prevent them from being banned. This suggestion was made in response to concerns about a high number of bans occurring on the Bitcoin network. However, another participant in the thread asked if there was a reason why a parallel get rpc couldn't be used instead to obtain the current list of nodes. It is unclear from the context whether or not this suggestion was implemented or further discussed.</summary>
