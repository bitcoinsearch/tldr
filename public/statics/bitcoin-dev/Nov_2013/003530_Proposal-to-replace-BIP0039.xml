    <summary>On November 3, 2013, Timo Hanke sent a message inquiring about a device's functionality. The message was a response to a previous inquiry regarding whether the computer would use B for a check. Hanke clarified that Trezor could rig (k,K) by computing b as k-a. The sender of the initial inquiry had simply asked a question to understand how the device works and its requirements. If Hanke believes he can assist with an explanation, he is willing to do so.</summary>
