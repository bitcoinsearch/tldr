    <summary>The discussion is about resolving the problem of sharing alt-chain merkle tree. The idea of using UUID-as-path is appreciated for this purpose. To prove extra data validity, a whole merkle path is required. Therefore, it is suggested to make it a full 256 bits. However, the Merkle branch does not get stored indefinitely whereas the coinbase hash does. It is suggested that the data stored in the coinbase output can always be the 256-bit root hash truncated to less. Although the additional bytes may not make much difference, the idea of adding complexity to achieve better results is not entirely dismissed.</summary>
