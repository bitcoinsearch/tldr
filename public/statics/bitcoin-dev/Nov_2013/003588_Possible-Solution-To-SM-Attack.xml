    <summary>In an email thread from November 5th, 2013, a proposal was made to randomly choose the winning block in the case of two blocks being broadcast within a certain period. This solution was deemed fair and simple. However, a concern was raised regarding the incentive for miners to release their blocks quickly if they were unusually low. It was pointed out that non-first-block-heard strategies could lead to significant increases in large reorganizations and perverse incentives. The author also mentioned having simulated these strategies in the past with negative results.</summary>
