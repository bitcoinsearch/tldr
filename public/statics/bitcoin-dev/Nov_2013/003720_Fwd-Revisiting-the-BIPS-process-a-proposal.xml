    <summary>On November 19, 2013, Wladimir posted a message on GitHub asking if they were going to move forward with BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). Jeff Garzik replied that BIP drafts can be found in git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git/drafts/ and are not automatically assigned BIPS numbers. Wladimir volunteered to create the repository and import current BIPs from wiki to there and convert them from wiki markup to markdown if necessary. However, Peter Todd had already done so and shared a link to his repository https://github.com/petertodd/bips. In response to this, Jeff suggested that leaving BIPs as MediaWiki is the best way to go because MediaWiki has advantages over markdown when it comes to formatting capabilities, particularly for displaying mathematical equations. They agreed that new BIPs may use either markdown or MediaWiki format.</summary>
