    <summary>A conversation between Michael Gronager and Christian Decker from 2013 about sorting snapshots by date gave rise to a discussion on real-time stats. Christian suggested extending calculations to include a size-normalized version, as well as attempting to correlate propagation speed and number of inputs/outputs to see if processing at the nodes has an influence. Michael suggested normalizing the results with block size and plotting the delay graph as e.g. normalized to the averaged blocksize or defining a standard block size to compare the plot between days. He also asked if the correlation of propagation times holds for transaction sizes as well. Gregory Maxwell requested that Christian publish the block ids and timestamp sets for each block, which would be useful in correlating propagation information against block characteristics. The conversation took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
