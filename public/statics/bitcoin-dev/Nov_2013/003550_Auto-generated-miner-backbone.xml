    <summary>In an email conversation between Ittay and Peter in 2013, the former asked how Peter could guarantee that the majority mines on the non-selfish block. Peter responded by explaining that feedback is the key. He gave an example of hashing power being split equally between two blocks with a near-target threshold of 1/64th, meaning a block header with difficulty 1/64th of the actual difficulty will be broadcast around the network by nodes. At a 10 minute block interval, near-target block headers are found on average every 9.4 seconds. Once one of the halves finds a near-target PoW solution, the corresponding block-header will be broadcast on the network. If a miner receives such a PoW solution, they know that the block has more hashing power than other competing blocks and would switch to mine it to extend that block. This forms a feedback effect that quickly brings everyone to consensus as everyone starts mining to extend the same block. There's nothing the selfish miner can do as there's no disagreement to exploit.</summary>
