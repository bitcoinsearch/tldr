    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2013, Patrick explains that the proposed solution by Ittay to raise the selfish mining threshold would actually reduce the ratio of honest miners to 0.5 and make the attack easier rather than harder. Ittay had suggested a minimal pool size of 25%, while Todd had pointed out that the proposed random choice solution would introduce a vulnerability where pools over a certain size would withhold blocks to split the network when they eventually reveal the block they mined. This can be to their benefit, and even profitable for pools over a certain size without investing in a low-latency network. Someone was requested to do an analysis on a deterministic switching scheme. The discussion also included information on November webinars for C, C++, and Fortran developers to accelerate application performance with scalable programming models.</summary>
