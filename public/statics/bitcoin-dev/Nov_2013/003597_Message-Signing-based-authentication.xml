    <summary>The discussion is about the storage of private keys in cryptocurrency. The person mentions that crypto can be stored in the browser with the help of NSS, but they don't think bitcoin's curve will be supported because it's not NIST approved. However, if there is a use case presented, it may be added. The conversation ends with a mention of Trezor, which is a hardware wallet for storing cryptocurrencies. It is not clear what Slush refers to in this context.</summary>
