    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, several users debated whether it would be beneficial to switch from mBTC (millibitcoin) to uBTC (microbitcoin) as the standard unit of measurement for Bitcoin transactions. Some argued that uBTC would be more intuitive for the average user, as two decimal places is becoming standard for new national currencies. However, others expressed concern that such a transition could cause confusion and result in lost coins. Additionally, some worried that using uBTC would make Bitcoin seem less valuable, while others believed it would increase the perception that Bitcoin is divisible and therefore has room for growth. The consensus seemed to be that while the transition to uBTC should be carefully thought out, it would be better to go through a potentially confusing renumbering only once rather than twice. Overall, the discussion centered on how to best optimize user experience with Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
