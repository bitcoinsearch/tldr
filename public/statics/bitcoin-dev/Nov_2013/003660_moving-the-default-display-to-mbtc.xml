    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposal to introduce a new unit of measurement for Bitcoin, with suggestions to use uBTC instead of mBTC due to its intuitive value and compatibility with existing computer systems. Participants also discussed potential names for this new unit, including "microbes," "bits," or "microbits." The email highlights the importance of promoting a consistent name to avoid confusion among users and suggests incorporating the chosen name into the interface on the first release of the new unit. Additionally, the email proposes switching currency symbols to XBT or NBC (New Bitcoin) to align with ISO currency symbols. The discussion concludes with an advertisement for DreamFactory, an open-source REST and JSON services platform.</summary>
