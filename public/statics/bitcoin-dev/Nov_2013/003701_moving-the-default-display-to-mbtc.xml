    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin usage, Luke-Jr and Drak debated the use of the term "confirmations" in relation to payments. While Luke-Jr argued that using "witnessed N times" would be more appropriate than "confirmations," Drak suggested that the terminology used should make sense to the average user. They also discussed the use of the term "bitcoin address" or "bitcoin id" instead of simply "address" when referring to payment destinations. Luke-Jr argued that Bitcoin addresses were not like email addresses or PayPal ids as they represent specific invoices rather than just being a destination. However, Drak believed that the technical details were not important to the user and that the UI should fit with their understanding of the world.</summary>
