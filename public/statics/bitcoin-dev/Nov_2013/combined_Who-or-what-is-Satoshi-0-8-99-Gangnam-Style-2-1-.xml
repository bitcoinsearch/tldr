    <summary>In November 2013, Mike Hearn, a Bitcoin developer, noticed that virtually all transactions seen by his node were being announced by modified software running on several different machines. Despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, Hearn suspected that the modified software was relaying transactions without checking their validity, which allowed them to always win the race to be the first to announce to his node. Hearn added extra logging to his node and ran it for a few days. He wondered if anyone knew/owned these nodes and if they were relaying transactions without checking their validity, which seemed the most likely reason for why they always won the race to be the first to announce to his node. There is a pull request open for Hearn's extra logging, which he noted was quite trivial.Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, responded to Hearn's email and questioned whether the relay in question had reduced validity checking. Additionally, there was a subscription offer for Intel(R) Software Adrenaline that delivers strategic insight and game-changing conversations shaping the rapidly evolving mobile landscape.Hearn also exchanged emails with Addy Yeow, creator of Bitnodes site, praising the site and asking if it would be possible to gather and chart data on block and transaction propagation times. Yeow responded by saying that there are several TODOs for the project in the next couple of months, including propagation data.Overall, Hearn was concerned about the modified software running on multiple machines and potentially relaying transactions without checking their validity. He sought help in identifying the owners of these nodes and ensuring the integrity of Bitcoin transactions. The email exchanges revolved around concerns about modified software relaying transactions without proper validity checking and the possibility of gathering data on block and transaction propagation times.</summary>
