    <summary>The conversation is about incorporating a software that verifies data in multiple units. The suggestion is to have three input fields for "BTC", "mBTC", and "uBTC" where the converted value updates automatically in all fields as the user enters a value in one. This makes it difficult to make mistakes while entering values. The software should display all units on all verification windows to allow sanity checks between conversions. One person argues that showing multiple boxes everywhere would be cluttered since they already support unit conversion by changing the dropdown box in the amount widget. However, they agree to make the verification dialog show the totals in all three units to help users learn about other units without consciously choosing them.</summary>
