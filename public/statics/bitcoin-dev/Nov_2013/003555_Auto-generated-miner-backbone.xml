    <summary>In this email conversation between Mike Hearn and Peter Todd, they discuss the issue of miners trying to extend the block that the majority of hashing power is trying to extend. Mike argues that there is no stable way to know which side has the majority, and that Peter's proposal for using "near-miss headers" is circular and unreliable. Peter responds by explaining that his proposal is meant to quickly establish a clear majority consensus, rather than determine the exact hashing power on each side. He claims that it only requires a small amount of bandwidth and can be done in a short amount of time. The conversation ends with Peter's email signature.</summary>
