    <summary>The context highlights the relevance of emotive for bitcoin user comprehension and sentiment. The author mentions an amusing trivia reference about a currency that had to deflate rather than inflate in history. The reference is a hyperinflated fifty trillion Zimbabwe dollar note which the author carries in their wallet for bitcoin contrast/amusement purposes. The author agrees with Alan's suggestion to show both currencies to avoid denomination confusion, but warns about the high risk given irrevocability. The eBay link to the Zimbabwean currency note is provided for reference.</summary>
