    <summary>The discussion revolves around the development of a new digital scarcity on an alpha-qa level network, which is similar to a more stable version of the test-net. The aim is to create bitcoin 1.x parallel with bitcoin 0.x to test new features and disabled scripts before deploying them onto 1.x. However, this introduces some risks, hence the idea of 1 way peg. There are concerns about whether there are enough people with the skills and motivation to support two parallel efforts.Melvin proposes creating a new genesis block for a staging network that keeps the properties of bitcoin as far as possible. Staging coins can be traded, but people should be aware that changes can be rolled into the network without warning. To address concerns, a straw poll voting system could be set up for those who own staging coins to sign messages indicating which patches they would like to test out next. When patches are stable in the staging area, they could be promoted to the main net.</summary>
