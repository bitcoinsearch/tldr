    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list requested graphs and raw data showing how propagation data changes over time, as well as instrumentation of bitcoind to discover where time is spent when relaying a block. This request was prompted by a discussion of the Cornell paper on Information Propagation. Gregory Maxwell asked for block ids and timestamp sets for each block to aid in correlating propagation information against block characteristics. The email also included an advertisement for Intel's Software Adrenaline subscription service.</summary>
