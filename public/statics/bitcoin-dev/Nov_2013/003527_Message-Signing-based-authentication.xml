    <summary>The discussion revolves around the distinction between what is required and what is strongly recommended. It is noted that Satoshi Dice reuses EC Keys for every transaction, while exchanges use the same deposit address repeatedly. However, this practice is argued to be a best practice rather than a protocol requirement. A specific use case is mentioned where generating a new key was necessary to set up a 2 of 2 Multisig Refund Tx. The alternative was to ensure there were no unspent outputs. The use case for reusing keys was attributed to laziness rather than actual necessity. Luke-Jr points out that Bitcoin as a system has always required a unique EC key and address for each transaction.</summary>
