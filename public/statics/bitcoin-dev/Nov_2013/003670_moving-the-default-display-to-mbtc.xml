    <summary>The issue at hand is whether or not to switch to using uBTC (microbitcoin) and labeling it as ISO prefers (XBT). The suggestion is to post on all possible forums to generate discussion and see if there is a consensus. However, there is concern over centralizing decisions and creating more "core dev fiat." Some argue that the market should be left to decide and that individuals, merchants, and exchanges are already free to choose different units. This debate may lead to vast volumes of discussion but offer only a dubious gain.</summary>
