    <summary>The current interface and price of Bitcoin are causing usability issues for people, even though the high price reflects Bitcoin's expansion. The learning curve of Bitcoin is already difficult, and feeling "insecure" when paying with small amounts can be a problem. To avoid fragmentation and confusion in the market, it would be better to reach a consensus on a path forward. A proposal to switch to uBTC and label it as ISO prefers (XBT?) is suggested to generate discussion and see if there is a consensus. However, some argue that this is a trivial problem and we should let the market decide. There is already a dropdown allowing individuals to choose units, merchants are free to price in different units, and exchanges are free to denominate trade in different units.</summary>
