    <summary>The email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list from November 2, 2013, discusses the off-topic nature of identity systems for the web. While some argue that identity is a hard problem, others believe it is a solved problem that can be addressed by translating real-world entities into a digital format. The use of a URI naming system is suggested as a solution to scalability issues. The conversation also briefly touches on SSL client certificates and their potential impact on encryption and NSA logging, with one member stating that it would not make a significant difference. Finally, the email includes a link to a white paper discussing secure code signing practices for Android apps.</summary>
