    <summary>In this context, Drak argues that from a user's perspective, Bitcoin transactions are similar to PayPal transactions. However, Mark argues that it is not about being technically correct, but protecting the user's privacy. He believes that users should not reuse Bitcoin addresses and should understand why they shouldn't. The term "Bitcoin address" and the inclusion of an "address book" in the reference client have led people to think that these objects are like email or PayPal addresses, but they are not and should not be treated as such. Mark emphasizes that the UI must be about the user and fit their experience of the world.</summary>
