    <summary>In November 2013, Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo sent a message to the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding relay nodes. He stated that while relay nodes do some data verification to prevent denial-of-service attacks, they don't fully verify the data they are relaying, meaning that miners should never mine a block building on top of a relayed block without fully checking it with their own Bitcoin validator. However, this raised concerns about disconnects due to misbehavior. A standard node connecting to a relay node would receive blocks/transactions that are not valid in some way and then disconnect. It was suggested that another bit could be assigned in the services field as "relay", which would mean that the node doesn't do any checking. Connects to relay nodes could be command line/config file only, and peers wouldn't connect to them.</summary>
