    <summary>In a mailing list discussion on Bitcoin development, Chris Evans suggested the addition of an optional note field to transactions so that receivers would know who sent the bitcoin. However, it was noted that the mailing list was for development discussion only and not for bug reports or feature requests. Currently, Bitcoin does not have a built-in mechanism for conveying the sender of a transaction or notes. Therefore, it is recommended to collect any necessary information before giving someone a payment address.</summary>
