    <summary>The conversation is about the ratio of q/Q for miners in a pool, and whether mining solo or in a pool is more beneficial. The author suggests that q represents individual miners participating in pool Q, who would pay the pool owner a fraction, e, but also become part of an economy of scale. They question at what point it becomes more profitable for larger miners to break away from pools and mine solo. The equations presented show that there is an incentive to centralize all the way up to one miner with 100% hashing power, although it is noted that p2pool might be an exception to this. However, the math for p2pool is said to involve many more stales.</summary>
