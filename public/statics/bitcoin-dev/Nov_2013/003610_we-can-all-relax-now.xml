    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has warned large mining pools to not run experiments on the main network that could increase everyone's orphan rate. He also encourages miners to do the math on variance and switch to smaller pools or p2pool if they are mining on a pool with over 1% hashing power. He offers confidentiality for any large pools that want to try this out, but warns of consequences if they cause harm to the network.</summary>
