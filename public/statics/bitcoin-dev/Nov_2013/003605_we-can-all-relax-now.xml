    <summary>In an email sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list on November 6th, 2013, a member named 'kjj' criticized the Selfish Mining paper for pretending to learn something about the real world through testing a model against itself. They argued that the model is not suitable for simulating the bitcoin system since it has no latency and assumes attackers have total visibility across the network. The author of the email expressed their willingness to pitch in 1 BTC as a bounty for building a general bitcoin network simulator framework which would account for latency between nodes and within a node. The simulator should be able to simulate an attacker who owns varying fractions of the network and make decisions based only on what the attacker knows. The email also mentioned that the lack of a decent network simulator allowed the Selfish Mining paper to get press and that if the author had been able to see the importance of the stuff he was ignoring, people wouldn't be wasting so much time correcting him. The email's author also shared a link to a forum post on Bitcointalk.org discussing the topic. The email ended with an announcement for November webinars for C, C++, and Fortran developers, offering techniques for threading, error checking, porting, and tuning to accelerate application performance with scalable programming models.</summary>
