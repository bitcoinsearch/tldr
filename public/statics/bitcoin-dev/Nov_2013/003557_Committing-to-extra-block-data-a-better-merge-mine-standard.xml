    <summary>In a message from November 4th, 2013, Peter Todd discusses setting a reasonable limit on actual path lengths and suggests choosing something like 32 levels. He also advises that allowed paths be made block specific by defining them as H(uuid | nonce), with nonce as an option. This could be H(uuid | nLockTime) where Coinbase transactions still have a nLockTime, which is generally left at zero but can be any value valid for a transaction in the block. The message includes contact information for Peter Todd and a digital signature.</summary>
