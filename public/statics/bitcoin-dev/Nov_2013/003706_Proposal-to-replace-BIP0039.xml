    <summary>In an email conversation on 03/11/13, Timo Hanke described a neat trick employed by Trezor where the device picks random s and sends S=s*G to the computer while keeping s secret.

Additionally, he suggested allowing users to use their own firmware if they do not trust the provided one.</summary>
