    <summary>In this message, Alan Reiner discusses the awkwardness of having 54.3 uBTC as the smallest unit that can be transferred easily and the standard fees being 500 uBTC. He mentions that this needs to be taken into consideration when it comes to user perception. This is one of the reasons why such a change would be made in the first place. The fees are then questioned by another person who mentions that they are huge. They mention a suggested fee of 20 cents for an irrevocable transaction.</summary>
