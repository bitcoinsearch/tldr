    <summary>In a post on the BitcoinTalk forums, Taylor Gerring has suggested how the Payment Protocol can be extended with optional vCard support to enhance the usability of Payment Protocol for user-to-user transactions and improve the user experience in wallets supporting PP. The concept is outlined in detail by drawing on BIP 0070 and Mike Hearn’s Payment Protocol FAQ. Gerring is hoping that this will create a discussion on how to make wallets more friendly in a standard way, as there is interest in “contact exchange” functionality from the Hive team. Gerring asks readers to provide feedback after reading the post.</summary>
