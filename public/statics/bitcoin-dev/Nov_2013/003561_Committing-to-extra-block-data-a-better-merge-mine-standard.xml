    <summary>The discussion revolves around the issue of transiently relayed data, specifically IP addresses. The conversation is between Mark Friedenbach and Mike Hearn with reference to Merkle branch and coinbase hash. Hearn believes that additional complexity in storing the 256-bit root hash truncated to less in the coinbase output may not be worth it, but Friedenbach argues that it makes a difference when merged mining. This is because two data trees whose hash matches the (truncated) value can be constructed using the birthday attack, each containing separate aux block headers. This allows for double-counting the bitcoin PoW for more than one aux block on the same chain, potentially facilitating aux chain attacks. For 128 bits of security for merged mined aux chains, 256 bits of hash in the coinbase are required. A PGP signature follows this message, and the email thread ends with a link to a white paper on secure code signing practices for Android apps.</summary>
