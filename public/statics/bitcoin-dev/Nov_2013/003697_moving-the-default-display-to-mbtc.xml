    <summary>In a Bitcoin-Qt discussion on terminology fixups, Luke-Jr proposed that "confirmation" and "n confirmations" are problematic as they lead to confusion, particularly with scamcoins claiming to have faster confirmations. Instead, he suggests using "cleared payments" and "n confirmations". He also proposes switching from using the term "address" to "invoice id" as it is more understandable for users. However, Drak suggests that "payment address" or "bitcoin address" make more sense since people are already familiar with terms like "paypal address" or "paypal id".</summary>
