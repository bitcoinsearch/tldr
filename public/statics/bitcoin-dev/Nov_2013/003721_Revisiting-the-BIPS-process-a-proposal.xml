    <summary>In an email thread from November 2013, Gregory Maxwell and Drak were discussing the allocation of numbers for draft proposals. Drak mentioned that it is common for standards bodies to allocate numbers during the draft stage, but they are clearly labeled as drafts and may not pass. He also suggested using a Github repository for collaboration, which was agreed upon by both parties. However, Maxwell pointed out that the IETF makes a clear distinction between individual proposals and documents that have been accepted by a working group. Work is not assigned a number until it is complete. Wladimir joined the conversation and noted that BIP 40 and 41 did not have an associated document on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals Github repository, indicating over-eager number assigning.</summary>
