    <summary>Electrum has recently launched version 1.9 which comes with a host of new features and updates. One of the most significant changes is the ability for users to connect to multiple servers to retrieve block headers and find the longest chain. SSL certificate validation has been added to prevent MITM attacks, while deterministic signatures have also been introduced, along with a menu for creating, restoring, and opening wallets. Users can now create transactions with multiple outputs from CSV, and Electrum has also introduced a new user interface for text mode called "stdio" that does not use curses.Plugins are no longer tied to the Qt GUI, and they can reach all GUIs. Proxy bugs have been fixed as well. However, it is important to note that the BIP32 features are postponed to version 2.0 due to discussions about mnemonic seed format. Overall, version 1.9 brings a range of improvements and fixes that are sure to be welcomed by the Electrum community.</summary>
