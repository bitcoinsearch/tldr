    <summary>The email thread includes discussions on the recent explosion in running nodes and the possibility of gathering and charting data on block and transaction propagation times. Mike Hearn added additional logging to his node and noticed that despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, virtually all transactions seen by his node are being announced by a modified software which appears to run on several different machines. He questions whether anyone knows/owns these nodes and if they are relaying transactions without checking their validity as this seems to be the most likely reason for how they are always able to win the race to be the first to announce to his node. The email also includes a link to bitcointalk.org for further discussion on the topic.</summary>
