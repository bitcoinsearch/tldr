    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Arthur, Arthur shares a link to blockchain.info/hub-nodes that shows the three nodes from nogleg that relay the most to blockchain.info. Mike had added additional logging to his node and discovered that despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, virtually all transactions seen by his node were being announced by modified software running on several different machines.Mike wonders if anyone knows or owns these nodes and if they are relaying transactions without checking their validity, which could be the reason for how they always win the race to be the first to announce to his node. Additionally, there is a subscription offer for Intel(R) Software Adrenaline that delivers strategic insight and game-changing conversations shaping the rapidly evolving mobile landscape. The email conversation was part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
