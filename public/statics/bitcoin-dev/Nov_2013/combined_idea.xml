    <summary>Chris Evans has suggested adding an optional note field to transactions involving Bitcoin, to allow the receiver of Bitcoin to know who sent the currency. Currently, there is no built-in mechanism for conveying the sender of a transaction or notes in Bitcoin. The recipient can only know the identity of the sender if they explicitly state it in the message accompanying the transaction. In a mailing list discussion on Bitcoin development, Evans suggested the addition of an optional note field to streamline the inclusion of information about the sender in a more organized manner. However, it was noted that this mailing list was for development discussions only and not for bug reports or feature requests. One of the developers of Bitcoin Core, Wladimir, explained in an email thread from November 2013 that this issue arises only when users re-use addresses, which is discouraged for security reasons. He recommended that users request a new receiving address along with a message over whatever channel was used for negotiation when someone wanted to send them Bitcoin. For those posting static Bitcoin addresses for donations, Wladimir advised considering it as an anonymous or pseudonymous gift jar. In summary, Chris Evans's suggestion of adding an optional note field to Bitcoin transactions would allow the receiver to identify the sender of the currency in a more streamlined manner. However, it has been noted that this mailing list is for development discussions only, and Bitcoin does not have a built-in mechanism for conveying the sender of a transaction or notes. Therefore, users are recommended to collect any necessary information before giving someone a payment address.</summary>
