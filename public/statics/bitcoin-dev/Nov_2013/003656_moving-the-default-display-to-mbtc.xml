    <summary>There has been anecdotal evidence that the high value of Bitcoin is putting off a lot of normal buyers. There was a straw poll conducted 6 months ago which showed that roughly 2/3 of respondents favored switching to Satoshi (uBTC). Satoshi has said that there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally. If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point. It has been suggested that changing the default display in the software and having uBTC as the default might be a possible solution. However, unless something is recommended/done by the bitcoin core developers, not much will change at bitcoin user/consumer level.</summary>
