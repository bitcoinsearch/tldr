    <summary>Mike Hearn, a Bitcoin developer, sent an email on November 22, 2013, to the Bitcoin development mailing list. He added additional logging to his node and ran it for a few days. He noticed that despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, virtually all transactions seen by his node were being announced by modified software, which appeared to run on several different machines. Hearn was wondering if anyone out there knew/owned these nodes and if they were relaying transactions without checking their validity. That seemed the most likely reason for how they were always able to win the race to be the first to announce to his node. Hearn also shared a link to the pull request open for his extra logging, which was quite trivial.</summary>
