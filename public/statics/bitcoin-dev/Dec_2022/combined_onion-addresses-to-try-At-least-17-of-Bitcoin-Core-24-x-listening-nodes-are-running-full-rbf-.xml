    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev thread, Peter Todd discussed the lack of convenient sources for onion addresses. Vasil Dimov responded with a potential solution but also pointed out the risks associated with trying onion addresses without checking their long-term track record. Dimov suggested using DNS seed records instead as they are tested over long time frames and have a better chance of representing real nodes. However, his DNS seed is not currently set up to track nodes using Tor.On December 22, 2022, Peter Todd posted on the bitcoin-dev forum about the issue of finding convenient sources for onion addresses. In response, Vasil Dimov provided a command that can be run in the terminal to obtain onion addresses. However, he cautioned against blindly trying them without verifying their long-term track record. Dimov recommended using DNS seed records instead as they are more reliable. He signed off his email with a quote about living life to the fullest.</summary>
