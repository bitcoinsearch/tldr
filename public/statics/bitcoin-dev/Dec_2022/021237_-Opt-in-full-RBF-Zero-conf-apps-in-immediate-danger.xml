    <summary>The conversation is between Daniel Lipshitz and Peter Todd, discussing the services provided by GAP600. Shapeshift used to be a client of GAP600, but they no longer use their services. GAP600 processes Bitcoin transactions and has been in production since 2016. In 2022 (Jan-Nov), GAP600 processed around 15 million transactions with a value of 2.3 billion USD. The company offers non-custodial liquidity providers that offer service to non-custodial wallets. To test out their service, one can find a merchant using Coinpayments or Coinspaid. Daniel Lipshitz can help set up a trial account via API for interested parties and send an activation link that remains active for 24 hours.</summary>
