    <summary>In a Bitcoin protocol development community, Antoine Riard forwarded an email to Daniel proposing that the current option of full-RBF should be removed from Bitcoin Core. To do so, enough economic flows at risk and the presence of sizable loss in miners' income need to be addressed. The mempoolfullrbf feature was rushed through while controversy was growing, specifically to attempt to achieve this imaginary protection of "sorry, that ship has sailed" which indicates an agenda that is counter to greater social consensus and status quo. Removing the mempoolfullrbf feature is the opposite of restraining user choice. Any incentivized user can still create and distribute patches for any given mempool policy, regardless of whether we remove the feature from Core, but it is important to note that extremely few have felt the need to do so in the past. With a first-seen policy in place, users have *more* options, and Bitcoin is thus more useful, and thus more valuable to everyone. This is evident in that the feature of full-rbf is that it overrides any ability for users to signal intent of how they wish their transaction to be handled by nodes and miners. User-signaling is a useful feature for the mempool, full-RBF removes that feature. When Bitcoin Core adds special support for specific policies, it positions itself as a political authority and influencer. The original technical motivation of this option, and the wider smoother deployment, was to address a DoS vector affecting another class of use-case: multi-party transactions like coinjoin and contracting protocols like Lightning. All of them expect to generate economic flows and corresponding mining income. Since then, alternative paths to solve this DoS vector have been devised, all with their own trade-offs and conceptual issues. John Carvalho, CEO of Synonym.to, believes that zero-conf support reduces friction for LN adoption by allowing us to make instant, seamless UX within wallets when onboarding, rebalancing, and splicing.</summary>
