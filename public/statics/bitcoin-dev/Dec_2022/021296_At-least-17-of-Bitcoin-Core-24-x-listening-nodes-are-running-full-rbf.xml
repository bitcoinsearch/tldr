    <summary>A recent experiment conducted by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd has shown that around 17% of all Bitcoin Core v24 nodes listening on IPv4 are running with full-replace-by-fee (full-rbf) enabled and successfully propagating full-rbf replacements. To measure this, Todd connected to every Bitcoin Core v24 node possible and manually added 692 IPv4 addresses not advertising the full-rbf service bit in his DNS seed's 'dnsseed.dump' file. He then waited for connection counts to stabilize and used grep to count the number of invs after a full-rbf replacement transaction was propagated. This data shows substantial adoption of the mempoolfullrbf=1 option among IPv4 listening nodes. However, this measurement only accounts for successful propagation, meaning nodes which have full-rbf enabled but do not have any full-rbf peers are not counted. Therefore, the true number of full-rbf nodes will be even higher than these stats indicate. Since v24 nodes are currently only approximately 5% of all listening nodes, the probability of a non-listening node having a full-rbf peer in their outgoing eight connections is still low (~8%). However, if this 17% was maintained as all nodes eventually upgrade to v24, the probability of a full-rbf peer in the outgoing eight would be quite high (~80%).Todd suggests future work to investigate how full-rbf nodes are distributed among the IPv4 address space, other connection types such as Tor, and non-listening nodes. According to Todd, anecdotal evidence suggests that some people are running mempoolfullrbf=1 on non-listening nodes.</summary>
