    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Daniel Lipshitz, Peter Todd explains the issues with his first-seen-safe proposal and why it was only proposed as a political compromise. Todd also notes that full-RBF behavior is necessary for multi-party transactions such as coinjoins and multi-party lightning channels, which make accidental double-spends less likely and intentional DoS attacks more expensive. Todd suggests that Antoine Riard's spent-nVersion signaling proposal is the only possible compromise, but it has negative privacy implications. Todd advises service providers to either change their business model to use scalable instant payment tech like Lightning or give up on Bitcoin and expand their business with other chains like BSV. Todd anticipates that hashing power running with full-RBF will increase over time.</summary>
