    <summary>On December 1, 2022, Daniel Lipshitz via bitcoin-dev shared statistics related to zero confirmation transactions. These statistics included the fact that GAP600 had processed around 15 million transactions with a cumulative value of 2.3 billion USD as of the end of November 2022. Additionally, there were approximately 1.5 million transactions queried per month. However, Peter Todd responded to this post requesting more information about the time frame involved in these figures.</summary>
