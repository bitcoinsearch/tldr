    <summary>Bitcoin Inquisition 23.0 now supports BIP 118 (ANYPREVOUT) and BIP 119 (CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY) on regtest and signet. This update is intended to encourage experimentation and a better understanding of the risks, benefits, and tradeoffs associated with these proposals. To ensure availability, 100% of blocks on the default global signet have been switched to mining using this patchset for a trial period. If any issues arise, signet miners will automatically fall back to using bitcoin core nodes. Users who want to experiment with signet can join the #bitcoin-signet IRC channel on Libera and request a larger budget than the various faucets provide.Users who wish to enable these soft forks on a custom signet should mine a block with version 0x60007600 (BIP 118) and/or version 0x60007700 (BIP 119), then monitor activation using `bitcoin-cli getdeploymentinfo`. The inquisition node software should also correctly validate/relay CTV transactions on the existing ctv signet (ctvsignet.com). As an example of experimentation, block rewards are currently being sent to the address tb1pwzv7fv35yl7ypwj8w7al2t8apd6yf4568cs772qjwper74xqc99sk8x7tk. This is a taproot address with an ANYPREVOUT script path ("OP_1 OP_CHECKSIG"), which splits 1000 sBTC into 900 sBTC for Kalle's mining wallet and 100 sBTC into mine. The transaction was signed with an ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT|ALL signature, enabling it to be replayed with other utxos of that pubkey. Users can generate the same transaction by setting up a watchonly wallet to monitor that address and manually assembling sufficient inputs to fund the required signed outputs (with the excess going to fees).Bitcoin Inquisition 23.0 is based on Bitcoin Core version 23.0, while 24.0.1 has just been released. The plan is to keep inquisition focused on released versions of core to minimize rebasing. Going forward, the current patches will be ported to the latest release, and additional BIPs may be supported. Discussion of these ideas is welcome. Links to the original proposal, Wiki, PRs, and discussion about testing segwit on testnet are provided. To more reliably relay transactions using the new soft forks, users may manually connect to a node that supports these features by specifying addnode=inquisition.bitcoin-signet.net and addnode=phfrpeh47vpjvoi2dgpngfk6ynl7vbnxwekwtcpg3zancixnnjvq.b32.i2p.</summary>
