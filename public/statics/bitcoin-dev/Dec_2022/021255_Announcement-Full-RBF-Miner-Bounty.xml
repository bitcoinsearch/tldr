    <title>Announcement: Full-RBF Miner Bounty</title>

    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the importance of proof of work for building blocks that are accepted by consensus rules. The validation nodes that propagate those blocks enforce these rules, and if there are multiple valid blocks generated at the same time, validation nodes add economic incentives against certain practices. The conversation also touches upon a potential attack on opt-in RBF and 0Conf bitcoin usage. The proposed solution is to work on a bitcoin core implementation that stops propagation of full-rbf replaced blocks, which would add a risk to miners that enable full-rbf, working as an incentive against it. Some contributors argue that enforcing mempool consistency through a consensus rule is a recipe for unintended chainsplits, while others put forth evidence that there is currently no significant hashrate mining with fullrbf policies. The conversation also briefly touches upon an ad hominem attack made towards Daniel Lipshitz.</summary>
