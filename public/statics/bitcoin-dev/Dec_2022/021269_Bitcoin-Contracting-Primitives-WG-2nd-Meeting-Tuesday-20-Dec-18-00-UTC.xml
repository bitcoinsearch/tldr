    <summary>The Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group has scheduled their second meeting on Tuesday, December 20th at 18:00 UTC. The proposed agenda for the meeting includes discussing contracting protocol use-cases and corresponding primitives to ensure completeness of past community ideas. If anyone has been working on a primitive or use-case that is missing from the current listing, they are encouraged to open a PR or reach out to the group leader. The second part of the meeting will involve listening to everyone's blockers regarding their contracting primitives/covenant research and providing support where needed. The communication venue for the group is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat, and logs from the previous session are available on GitHub. One participant plans to work on a taproot annex implementation as a fee-bumping primitive and constrained amount malleability extension for multi-party channels.</summary>
