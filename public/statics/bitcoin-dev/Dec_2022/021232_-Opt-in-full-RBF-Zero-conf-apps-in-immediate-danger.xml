    <summary>The email conversation between Daniel Lipshitz and Peter Todd discusses the statistics of GAP600's zero confirmation use case for Bitcoin. According to Daniel, from January 1, 2022, until the end of November 2022, GAP600 has processed approximately 15 million transactions worth 2.3 billion USD. In 2021, they processed around 12.5 million transactions, and in 2020, the number was about 6.5 million. The company has been working on this project since 2014/2015 and has been in production since 2016. Peter Todd asks for more information on the time frame involved in these figures. Daniel provides his contact details at the end of the email.</summary>
