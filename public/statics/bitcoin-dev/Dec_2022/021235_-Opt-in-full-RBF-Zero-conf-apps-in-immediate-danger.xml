    <summary>The email conversation between Daniel Lipshitz of GAP600 and Peter Todd discusses the former's services and clients. Though Shapeshift used to be a client of GAP600, they no longer use their service. However, they still occasionally ask for fee recommendations. Therefore, the logo of Shapeshift as a current client should be removed. If one wishes to test it out, they can try finding a merchant using Coinpayments or Coinspaid. Additionally, some of the non-custodial liquidity providers offer services for non-custodial wallets, though it is uncertain which ones. Peter Todd asks about the service GAP600 provides for Shapeshift, as the latter waits for confirmation before allowing a trade when funded with a high-fee, non-opt-in-rbf transaction. In response, Daniel Lipshitz clarifies that they have been processing BTC transactions since 2016 and have been working on the project since 2014/2015. He also shares the transaction details processed by GAP600 from January 1, 2022, until the end of November 2022, which amounted to circa 15M transactions with a value of 2.3B USD. The number of transactions processed in 2021 was circa 12.5M, and in 2020, it was circa 6.5M.</summary>
