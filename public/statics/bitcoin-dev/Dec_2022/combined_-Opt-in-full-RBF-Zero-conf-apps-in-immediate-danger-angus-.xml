    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is currently discussing the concept of Full RBF and its impact on mempool policy. Full RBF supporters argue that relying on predictable mempool policy is a bad idea as miners will always want to optimize fees in the short term, while those who oppose it argue that Zero Conf acceptance is already widely used and useful.However, there is a debate over Full RBF and its potential impact on zero-conf users. Some argue that full RBF aligns with miner and user incentives, while others believe it can result in more real-world double-spends and ultimately lead to less valuable transactions.A legitimate business offers insurance/risk management for accepting zero-conf, but Lightning provides a risk-free instant settlement solution. The mempoolfullrbf feature should be removed from Bitcoin Core distributions as it disrupts mempool harmony.There is also a discussion on the economics of fees, price discovery, and demand for blockspace. Fees are a price on confirmation, and in economics, there is a "price theory" where total earnings vs price has an optimum price, and it may very well be lower than the prevailing market price of a good. Therefore, RBF is an optimization to speed up the discovery of the optimum price, and it is desirable.Many proponents of zero-conf work on supporting Lightning, which is not risk-free and should not be assumed as a primary dependency for commercial payments. For low-value payments, lightning is the only workable version because the current low-fee environment is not scalable, but for high-valued payments, zero-conf was never valuable or useful and never will be.Low fee/high fee double spends of a zero-conf with no RBF flag has been demonstrated repeatedly, making it clear that there is no long-term scenario where zero-conf is valuable. However, the author discusses the possibility of miners continuing to support zeroconf transactions, even if they themselves do not use or care about them. Prioritizing long-term income over immediate revenue may prevent 51% attacks from becoming a dominant strategy.The author advocates for Full RBF nodes, seeing it as ultimately making Bitcoin stronger by eliminating a use-case that takes risk. However, the author disagrees with preventing other people from voluntarily taking on small risks that are already easily managed or avoided.In a discussion about full RBF, it was pointed out that it aligns with miner and user economic incentives. However, this argument can be refuted as RBF is actually a fee-minimization feature that allows users to spend the least amount in fees that correlates to their time-preference, which results in miners earning less. Additionally, nodes providing replacement service and propagation incur an expense.The author argues that consistent and predictable relay policy across nodes remains important and possible whether or not the policy is first seen is final, highest fee rate wins, or something else. The author explains that "money for enemies" does not mean treating other Bitcoiners as enemies but rather putting power in the hands of an eclectic majority rather than an elite minority.Finally, the author shares their experience of selling and buying online, stating that they have no objection to a user being able to cancel their order and that this has never posed a problem. They argue that the 20-minute wait before shipping items is meaningless, and the only risk involved is that a user replaces a transaction with a different destination. Even with the flag on (which the author does not care about), this has never been observed.</summary>
