    <summary>Upon being made aware of a suggestion by Peter Todd detailed in a 2015 email to Bitcoin-dev mailing list, the speaker expressed their approval of the idea. The suggestion involves using the "first-seen-safe replace-by-fee" method which would balance FullRBF while retaining use cases for zero-conf transactions. The speaker believes this could be a good way forward.</summary>
