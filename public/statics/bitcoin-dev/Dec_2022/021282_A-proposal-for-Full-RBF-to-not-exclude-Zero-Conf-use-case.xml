    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Daniel Lipshitz suggested implementing First-seen-safe replace-by-fee (FSS-RBF) as a solution to a problem with wallets like Electrum that use RBF to batch transactions. While John Carvalho expressed concern over potential negative side-effects of FSS-RBF, Lipshitz argued that it would balance FullRBF while retaining the significant 0-conf use case. He also referenced an FAQ on the Bitcoin Core website that addressed why opt-in RBF wasn't adopted, but stated that the reasons listed were not pertinent in this case given that opt-in RBF already exists as an option and FSS-RBF would provide additional benefits.</summary>
