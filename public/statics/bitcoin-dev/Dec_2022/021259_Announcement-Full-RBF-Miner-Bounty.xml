    <summary>On Dec 09, 2022, 0xB10C via bitcoin-dev has set up a mempoolfullrbf=1 node to monitor full-RBF replacements and is logging replacement events. The replaced and replacement transactions are filtered and listed by the node. The node is getting all the replacements expected due to good peering. It hasn't taken any special steps to peer that node with other full-rbf nodes. The node is accepting incoming connections. Over the last few days, the node has mostly seen OP_RETURN transactions (presumably mostly by OpenTimestamps) and a few other non-OP_RETURN transactions. None of the replacement transactions have been mined yet.The OpenTimestamps transactions are mostly making full-rbf replacements on two calendars: https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ and https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/. The status pages currently link to https://mempool.nixbitcoin.org which is running mempoolfullrbf=1. The full-rbf bounty is started again on Alice.Https://blockstream.info also enabled full-rbf a few days ago. But currently propagation to their nodes is spotty, so replacements don't always show up.
