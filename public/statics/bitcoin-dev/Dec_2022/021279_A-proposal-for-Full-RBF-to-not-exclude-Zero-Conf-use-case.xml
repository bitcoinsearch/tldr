    <summary>In an email exchange between Daniel Lipshitz and Yuval Kogman, the topic of Full-RBF is brought up. John Carvalho, CEO of Synonym.to, chimes in with his thoughts on the matter, noting that while he believes there are negative side-effects to Full-RBF, he thinks that the FSS-RBF feature is worth considering. In response, Lipshitz thanks Carvalho for bringing it to his attention and suggests first-seen-safe replace-by-fee as a more suitable option that balances FullRBF while retaining the significant 0-conf use case. The email includes a link to a post by Peter Todd discussing this option.</summary>
