    <summary>GAP600 is a B2B provider that services payment processors and liquidity providers, relying on transactions that clients query via their API and pay subscriptions for. The statistics provided are based on these transactions and reflect the 0conf market on BTC. However, it is unclear how and to whom end clients implement GAP600's service. The company primarily services payment processors and liquidity providers and not end merchants. While AML/KYC measures are in place, some end users are not KYCed for the transactions. Coinify is one of GAP600's major clients. The company used to have Shapeshift as a client but they no longer use GAP600's service. As for Coindirect and CoinsPaid, both exchanges appear to require confirmations before accepting transactions. It is suggested that external confirmation be sought from major clients such as Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Coinify.</summary>
