    <summary>In an email conversation, Daniel Lipshitz shared that his company, GAP600, has processed around 15 million transactions with a value of $2.3 billion USD in Bitcoin from Jan1 2022 up until the end of November 2022. The company has been in production since 2016 and working on the project since 2014/2015. In comparison, they did around 12.5 million transactions in 2021 and roughly 6.5 million in 2020. ShapeShift is one of their clients, and the recipient of Peter Todd's inquiry about their services. However, Peter pointed out that ShapeShift appears to wait for a confirmation before allowing a trade when funded with a high-fee, non-opt-in-rbf transaction. It is unclear how GAP600 is assisting ShapeShift or what services they are providing.</summary>
