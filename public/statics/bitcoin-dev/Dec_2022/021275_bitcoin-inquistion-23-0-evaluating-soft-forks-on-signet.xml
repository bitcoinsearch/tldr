    <summary>Bitcoin Inquisition 23.0 has been tagged with support for BIP 118 (ANYPREVOUT) and BIP 119 (CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY) on regtest and signet. The hope is that this will allow more experimentation and building greater understanding of the risks, benefits, and tradeoffs of proposals like BIP 118 and BIP 119. For an initial trial period, 100% of blocks on the default global signet have been switched to mining using this patchset. If any problem occurs, the signet miners are configured to automatically fall back to using bitcoin core nodes to ensure that signet continues to be available.To more reliably relay transactions using the new soft forks, users may wish to manually connect to a node that supports these features by specifying: addnode=inquisition.bitcoin-signet.net and addnode=phfrpeh47vpjvoi2dgpngfk6ynl7vbnxwekwtcpg3zancixnnjvq.b32.i2p. If users are trying to do experiments with signet and would like a larger budget than the various faucets will give, they can join the #bitcoin-signet IRC channel on Libera and let them know. This applies whether or not they're making use of inquisition-y features.Users who wish to enable these soft forks on a custom signet should mine a block with version 0x60007600 (BIP 118) and/or version 0x60007700 (BIP 119), then monitor activation using `bitcoin-cli getdeploymentinfo`. The inquisition node software should also correctly validate/relay CTV transactions on the existing ctv signet (ctvsignet.com).As one simple bit of experimentation, block rewards are currently being sent to the address tb1pwzv7fv35yl7ypwj8w7al2t8apd6yf4568cs772qjwper74xqc99sk8x7tk. This is a taproot address with an ANYPREVOUT script path ("OP_1 OP_CHECKSIG"), which has an example spend splitting 1000 sBTC into 900 sBTC for Kalle's mining wallet and 100 sBTC into mine.The transaction was signed with an ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT|ALL signature, allowing it to be replayed with other utxos of that pubkey. To generate the same transaction, users can set up a watchonly wallet to monitor that address and manually put together sufficient inputs to fund the required signed outputs (with the excess going to fees). Finally, Bitcoin Inquisition 23.0 is based on Bitcoin Core version 23.0 when 24.0.1 has just been released. The plan in general is to keep inquisition focused on released versions of core to minimize rebasing, and more concretely, to start forward porting the current patches to that now that it has been released, and possibly consider including support for additional BIPs. Discussion of those ideas is welcome. Links to the original proposal, Wiki, PRs, and discussion about testing segwit on testnet are provided.</summary>
