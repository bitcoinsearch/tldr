    <title>Announcement: Full-RBF Miner Bounty</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential risks of a proposed rule to enforce mempool consistency on the Bitcoin network. One participant expresses concern that such a rule could lead to unintended chain splits and is not necessary since users are free to choose their own transaction policies. Another suggests creating a Bitcoin Core implementation that stops propagation of full-RBF replaced blocks, but this may be difficult politically as Peter Todd, who is currently attacking the network using these methods, has commit access to the main repository. The idea of running multiple nodes with such functionality is also suggested, but it is unlikely that long-term contributors would support a contentious soft fork to enforce this. The email includes links to various sources discussing previous attempts to double spend on the Bitcoin network using low-fee/high-fee methods and the possibility of miners using full-RBF policies.</summary>
