    <summary>The writer expresses a negative view towards NFTs as they are currently centralized, insecure, duplicable, virtual, stealable, not signed and expensive. However, the writer suggests that if we consider anything that can be bought or stored as an NFT, whether it be real, electronic, or in the metaverse, then it becomes more interesting. The majority of NFTs are used on Ethereum and there is a "mess" to describe this stuff. The writer proposes a decentralized, secure, and inexpensive Bitcoin NFT system. It envisions local Bitcoin chains and while it may already exist, the writer is not aware of it. This proposal appears to contradict previous publications by the writer, but they explain why this is not the case. The writer invites review and comments regarding their proposal either on the list or their personal address. The writer's location is Sophia-Antipolis, France, and they provide links to their LinkedIn, GitHub account, and various cryptocurrency-related projects such as a wallet for moving coins, simplifying Bitcoin transactions and creating anti-spies and private torrents. They also provide links to simple Zcash and Bitcoin wallets, as well as dynamic blocklists and information about Peersm.</summary>
