    <summary>The email exchange between Aymeric Vitte and Vincenzo discussed a decentralized, secure, and cost-effective Bitcoin NFT system that is simple and based on the assumption that the main purpose of an NFT is to be sold or bought. Aymeric suggested using SHA-256 to make a simple reference to the NFT hash and described how one can mint a NFT on Bitcoin. The proposed system involves using a double hash for the reference in transactions to prove that the buyer and seller are the only ones who know the original hash of the NFT. The system is not centralized and does not rely on any third-party platforms or oracles, making it less costly than Ethereum NFT tokens. The proposed system is not anonymous as buyers and sellers must know each other, but they can use anonymous means such as Signal, Protonmail, Telegram, or Tor. Additionally, the proposal suggests creating a new email address for this purpose and using PGP keys. The article argues against creating a super sidechain and instead proposes a local Bitcoin system that is limited to a specific area and could be seen as a barter money with a stable value. The local Bitcoin system could be used on cruise boats, planes, and other local areas. The writer expresses a negative view towards NFTs as they are currently centralized, insecure, duplicable, virtual, stealable, not signed and expensive. However, the writer suggests that if we consider anything that can be bought or stored as an NFT, whether it be real, electronic, or in the metaverse, then it becomes more interesting. The majority of NFTs are used on Ethereum and there is a "mess" to describe this stuff. On December 29, 2022, Aymeric Vitte expressed his disapproval of the current design and use of NFTs. He shared a link to his proposal for a decentralized and secure Bitcoin NFT system that is not expensive. Unfortunately, the link provided by Vitte is either gone or private. Vincent signed off on the email with a cheerful note. It is worth noting that the proposed system is not open-source but is available for use upon contacting the author. The funding source for this proposal is unknown. The writer invites review and comments regarding their proposal either on the list or their personal address. The writer's location is Sophia-Antipolis, France, and they provide links to their LinkedIn, GitHub account, and various cryptocurrency-related projects such as a wallet for moving coins, simplifying Bitcoin transactions, and creating anti-spies and private torrents. They also provide links to simple Zcash and Bitcoin wallets, as well as dynamic blocklists and information about Peersm.</summary>
