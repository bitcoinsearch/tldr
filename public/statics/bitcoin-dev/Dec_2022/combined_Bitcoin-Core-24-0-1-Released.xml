    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 24.0.1 has been released, featuring new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are advised to shut down older versions before upgrading. The compatibility of Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.One significant addition in this version is the `mempoolfullrbf` configuration, which allows users to replace unconfirmed transactions with newer ones. However, contributors strongly recommend that merchants and services not accept unconfirmed transactions as final. The update also includes reworked logic to download headers from peers, resulting in longer initial sync times for new nodes. Several RPC configuration options have been removed, and new RPCs have been added. GUI changes include a new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file and saving configuration changes to a `/settings.json` file rather than the Qt settings backend. Lastly, credits were given to all those who contributed directly to the release, as well as those who helped with translations on Transifex.In addition, version 23.1 of Bitcoin Core includes various updates and new features, including improvements to P2P networking code to support more efficient headers-first syncing, removal of certain deprecated configuration options, and updated endpoints to use a query parameter instead of path parameter. The latest release also includes low-level changes, such as an update to RPC commands and Miniscript descriptor options for certain commands. Contributions to this release were made by numerous contributors who directly impacted Bitcoin Core version 24.0.1.On December 13, 2022, Michael Ford via bitcoin-dev announced that Bitcoin Core version 24.0.1 was available for download from the official website. The announcement also mentioned that version 24.0 had been tagged but not fully released due to some last-minute issues. However, the PGP signature on the email was found to be bad. It was later discovered that the announcement on the bitcoin-core-dev mailing list also had an invalid signature, likely due to a formatting error caused by sending the message as both text and HTML. Peter Todd commented on the issue, reminding users not to send HTML emails to the mailing list.Overall, the new version of Bitcoin Core includes various updates and features, with contributions from numerous contributors who directly impacted this release.</summary>
