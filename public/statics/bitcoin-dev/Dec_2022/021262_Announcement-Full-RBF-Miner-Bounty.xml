    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Bitcoin developer Peter Todd and 0xB10C discussed the monitoring of full-RBF (Replace-by-Fee) transactions. According to 0xB10C's logs, Luxor may have mempoolfullrbf=1 enabled as five full-RBF replacements were mined in two blocks by the mining pool. Additionally, he is not sure if AntPool has full-RBF enabled based on one transaction that they mined. Todd mentioned that block explorer Blockstream.info recently enabled full-RBF but propagation to their nodes can be spotty at times. Todd has also ported Antoine's preferential peering patch to v24.0 and suggested that running it would be reasonable as what's more interesting is the replacements, not whether or not propagation happens to work out of the box. Todd also noted that Foundry USA mined a doublespend which may have just been an accident of propagation.</summary>
