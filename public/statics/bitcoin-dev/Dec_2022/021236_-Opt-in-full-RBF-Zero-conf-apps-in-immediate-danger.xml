    <summary>In an email conversation, Daniel Lipshitz revealed that Shapeshift was one of his company's first clients in 2016 but they no longer use their services and only reach out to them for fee recommendations. He suggested removing their logo as a current client. The discussion moved on to Gap600's unconfirmed transaction tools and their relevance in transactions that rely on AML/KYC policies. Lipshitz claimed that as of November 2022, GAP600 has processed about 15 million transactions with a cumulative value of $2.3 billion USD. However, it is unclear how many of these transactions relied on their unconfirmed transaction tools as the majority of the exchanges mentioned in their advertisements require confirmations before using deposited funds.</summary>
