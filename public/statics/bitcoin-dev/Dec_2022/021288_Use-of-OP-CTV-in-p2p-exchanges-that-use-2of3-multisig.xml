    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has identified a potential issue with p2p exchanges that use 2of3 multisig, whereby the buyer and seller could settle the trade without involving the exchange. In order to prevent this, the developer suggests using OP_CTV and a template that specifies the release transaction must have two outputs: one output that sends a small amount to the exchange for fees, and another output that sends bitcoin to the buyer. The developer is not proficient in writing bitcoin script with opcodes and asks for confirmation from others regarding the viability of this solution and if there are other advantages of using OP_CTV for a p2p exchange. The developer also suggests modifying the simple vault which uses 2of2 multisig for proof of concept or conducting a normal poc if there are RPC commands available to test OP_CTV in bitcoin-inquisition.</summary>
