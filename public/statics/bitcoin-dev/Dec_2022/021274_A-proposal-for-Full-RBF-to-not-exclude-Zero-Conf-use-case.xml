    <summary>In a post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in May 2015, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd proposed a new approach to Bitcoin's block size limit. He suggested that rather than setting a hard cap on the size of blocks, miners should instead adopt a "floating" block size limit that would adjust dynamically based on network conditions. Todd argued that this would allow for more efficient use of the blockchain's storage capacity, while also preventing the emergence of centralized mining cartels.Todd's proposal was met with mixed reactions from the Bitcoin community. Some praised the idea as a practical solution to the block size debate, while others criticized it as overly complex and potentially vulnerable to manipulation. Ultimately, the idea did not gain enough traction to be implemented, and the community continued to grapple with the issue of how best to scale the network.</summary>
