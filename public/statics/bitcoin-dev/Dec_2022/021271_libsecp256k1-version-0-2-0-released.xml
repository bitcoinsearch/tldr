    <summary>The libsecp256k1 development team has announced the first tagged release of version 0.2.0, after 10 years of development. The development only had a master branch which created confusion about API compatibility and stability, but this new tagging system will provide clarity in future releases. The team promises clear documentation for any API breaks that may occur and is skipping version 0.1.0 as it does not uniquely identify a set of source files. Binary releases will not be created, but ABI compatibility issues will be taken into account for release notes and versioning. The release tag is signed with the PGP key of the lead developer, and suggestions are welcome for improving the release process in the future.</summary>
