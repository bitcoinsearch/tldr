    <summary>The author has set up a mempoolfullrbf=1 node to monitor full-RBF replacements and list the replaced and replacement transactions on their website. They have not yet seen any full-RBF replacement transactions being mined, and most of the transactions they have observed are OP_RETURN transactions. The website also links yellow badges to the block on miningpool.observer to show the mining pool and see if the transaction conflicts with the mined transaction. This should be the case if a full-RBF replacement transaction is mined.</summary>
