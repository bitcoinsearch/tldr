    <summary>A discussion on a spec related to hardware wallets (hwws) has taken place, with one participant expressing approval of the concept. The conversation also touched on the feasibility of incorporating Musig2 descriptors into hwws, with some stating that it is possible as long as there is either enough state or a reliable RNG present. While this may not be feasible for all hwws, it was suggested that the support for Musig2 in protocols should still be considered. Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, participated in the discussion.</summary>
