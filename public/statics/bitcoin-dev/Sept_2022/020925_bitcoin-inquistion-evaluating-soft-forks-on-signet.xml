    <summary>The email thread between Matt Corallo and Anthony Towns on the mailing list Bitcoin-dev discusses the process of getting soft fork ideas from concept to deployment. While Towns believes that there is no good answer to this question, Corallo disagrees. Corallo lays out a four-step process that involves coming up with an idea, socializing it in the technical community, proposing a concrete idea, and finding rough consensus within the community.Towns argues that the lack of progress on the great consensus cleanup over the past 3.5 years indicates that there is a problem with the process. He also suggests that steps 2 and 3 of Corallo's process are too difficult, preventing alternatives from making progress and causing the evaluation process to be inconclusive. Corallo believes that the difficulty of the process is causing potential champions to decide not to follow it through to completion. He cites Taproot as an example of an idea that many were excited about, which helped it overcome the difficulties of steps 2 and 3. The email thread includes several links to relevant discussions and alternative approaches to soft forks, including CTV, consensus cleanup, APO, simplicity, TXHASH, TX, Elements-style opcodes, ANYPREVOUT, Simplicity, and Lisp.</summary>
