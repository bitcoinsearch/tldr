    <summary>The email exchange between two developers discusses a new scheme suggested by Ruben Somsen that allows multiple silent addresses per wallet with minimal overhead. The scheme enables the resulting address to be recognizably marked, which distinguishes different payment purposes. The main downside of this is that the public identifier f becomes crucial for recovering from backup and needs to be communicated to the sender as part of the address format. The email also mentions a new RPC to retrieve silent addresses, which allows users to assign different labels to different addresses. This way, the user knows which silent address the UTXO came from. The address in the new scheme has a new field called identifier, which tells the receiver and sender how to set the address correctly. If the receiver doesn't know which identifiers have been used, the wallet can scan all identifiers from 0 to 99. Currently, only 100 different identifiers per wallet are allowed, but the limit can be increased at any time in the future. Unlike address formats so far, sp addresses are not script-related and may eventually include any additional information needed, such as an expiration timestamp (or block height). The email provides a step-by-step tutorial on the new scheme.</summary>
