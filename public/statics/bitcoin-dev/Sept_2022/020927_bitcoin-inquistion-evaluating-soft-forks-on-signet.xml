    <summary>The email exchange between Anthony Towns and Matt Corallo via bitcoin-dev discusses the process of progressing a soft fork in Bitcoin. The discussion centers around the steps that need to be taken, including coming up with an idea, socializing it, proposing it, and finding a champion to move it forward. While some argue that the lack of progress is due to a lack of test frameworks, others disagree and feel that the issue is a lack of champions following all the steps. Matt believes that people are too busy to be a champion for a soft-fork and that being a champion is a full-time job that requires months of work. He encourages anyone who wants to contribute to Core to reach out to those who would mentor them. Overall, the email exchange highlights the challenges of progressing a soft-fork and the need for more champions to take on this role.</summary>
