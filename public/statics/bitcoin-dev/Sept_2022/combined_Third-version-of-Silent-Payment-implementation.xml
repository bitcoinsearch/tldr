    <summary>A new version of Bitcoin has been released that implements a new scheme suggested by Ruben Somsen, which allows for multiple silent addresses per wallet with minimal overhead. The scheme includes a new field called the identifier, which tells the receiver and sender how to set the address correctly. A new RPC has also been implemented to retrieve silent addresses, allowing users to assign different labels to different addresses so they know which silent address the UTXO came from. Currently, only 100 different identifiers per wallet are allowed, but this limit can be increased at any time in the future. Ruben Somsen shared a clarification on the function of the identifier in Bitcoin addresses, which is to distinguish why someone paid you. The payments that appear on-chain are still unlinkable by third-party observers and they're unable to tell which identifier was used. In cases where you don't want people to know that you're the same entity, the identifier is insufficient and you'll need a completely separate Silent Payment address. The email exchange between two developers discusses a new scheme suggested by Ruben Somsen that allows multiple silent addresses per wallet with minimal overhead. The scheme enables the resulting address to be recognizably marked, which distinguishes different payment purposes. The main downside of this is that the public identifier f becomes crucial for recovering from backup and needs to be communicated to the sender as part of the address format. The email also mentions a new RPC to retrieve silent addresses, which allows users to assign different labels to different addresses. This way, the user knows which silent address the UTXO came from. The address in the new scheme has a new field called identifier, which tells the receiver and sender how to set the address correctly. Currently, only 100 different identifiers per wallet are allowed, but the limit can be increased at any time in the future. Unlike address formats so far, sp addresses are not script-related and may eventually include any additional information needed, such as an expiration timestamp (or block height). A step-by-step tutorial has been written for reference.</summary>
