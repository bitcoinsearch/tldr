    <summary>The new version of Bitcoin addresses requests made in PR and implements a new scheme suggested by Ruben Somsen that allows multiple silent addresses per wallet with minimal overhead. This scheme has a new field called identifier which tells the receiver and sender how to set the address correctly. Additionally, a new RPC is implemented to retrieve silent addresses, allowing users to assign different labels to different addresses, so they know which silent address the UTXO came from. The address format is not script-related and may eventually include any additional information needed, such as an expiration timestamp or block height. Currently, only 100 different identifiers per wallet are allowed, but this limit can be increased at any time in the future. A step-by-step tutorial is available on Github.</summary>
