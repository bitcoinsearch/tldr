    <summary>Ali reached out to Michael in regards to the Socratic transcript, stating that it is detailed and touches on various problems including theft/offline issues. Ali questioned if there was any research done that didn't involve a trade-off of theft or online connectivity. While ROAST and Liquid are two solutions that address this issue, they still utilize centralized nodes. Ali suggested decentralizing federated nodes into "lite nodes" managed by each service wanting payment, which would make a threshold signature out of many subscribers paying at the same time.</summary>
