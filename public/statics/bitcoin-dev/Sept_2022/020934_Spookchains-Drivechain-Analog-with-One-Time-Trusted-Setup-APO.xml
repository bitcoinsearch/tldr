    <title>Spookchains: Drivechain Analog with One-Time Trusted Setup &amp; APO</title>

    <summary>The article discusses the concept of Terminal States/Thresholds in blockchain technology. These states represent accumulated work over a period and should have viable state transitions. The author suggests having the money sent to an OP_TRUE output, which would prevent the miner from swerving the car to a different output. This approach is not exactly like Drivechains but similar. The "ultimate threat" in Drivechains is everyone upgrading sidechain rules to mainchain rules. Still, there are concerns about using this approach in Spookchains. Alternatively, the administrator key/federation with a block timeout could be used for convenience, similar to Blockstream's separation of block-signing functionaries from money-keeping functionaries.</summary>
