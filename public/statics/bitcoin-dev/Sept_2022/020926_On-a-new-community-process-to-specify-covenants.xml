    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard proposed that Slack not be used as a communication channel due to concerns about exclusivity. He suggested IRC as the best option, citing its strong text-based format, lack of avatars or emojis, and ease of participation pseudonymously. However, he acknowledged that some may find it to be a technical high-bar and suggested Discord as an alternative. Another participant in the discussion ruled out Discord due to its requirement for phone numbers, which could be triggered by VPN or Tor usage. Overall, the discussion focused on finding a communication channel that is inclusive and accessible for all members of the community.</summary>
