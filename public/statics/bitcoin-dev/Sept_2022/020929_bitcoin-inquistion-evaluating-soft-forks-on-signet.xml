    <summary>In an email thread on Bitcoin-dev, several developers discussed the difficulty of getting soft fork proposals from concept to deployment. While some believe that the current process is sufficient, others argue that there needs to be more testing and evaluation before a proposal is implemented.The idea of experimenting with soft forks on signet was suggested as a way to better evaluate proposed changes with less drama and politics. Testing on signet with pre-existing infrastructure would allow for multiple consensus changes to be deployed, making it easier to compare alternative approaches. Additionally, signet has more activity than Liquid, making it a better testing ground for proposed changes.The developers also touched on other potential upgrades to Bitcoin, including APO/eltoo and Simplicity, both of which are progressing in parallel. Furthermore, Antoine's covenant R&amp;D effort seems promising, and developers hope to foster a community that is open to new ideas and research while avoiding chain split fights.Overall, the group discussed the importance of finding champions who are willing to push an idea forward towards rough agreement within the technical Bitcoin community.The Bitcoin community has been discussing the proposed CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) soft fork, which is designed to improve the flexibility of Bitcoin scripting and help with future upgrades. However, there have been criticisms regarding the lack of a champion to push for the fork's implementation.Matt Corallo argues that it is not up to the community to find a champion, but rather the responsibility of the original proposer to take charge. While some argue that CTV has already completed the necessary steps, such as socialization, documentation, and implementation, Corallo believes that having only one author on the list does not constitute a completed step three.He suggests that there are a few possibilities to consider, including the lack of definition in step four, the inconclusive evaluation process, and the difficulty in completing steps two and three, which may prevent alternatives from making progress.Corallo acknowledges that being a champion for a soft fork is a full-time job for months on end, and many developers are busy maintaining other implementations. He encourages those who want to contribute to Core and become a champion for a soft fork to reach out for mentorship.Overall, the community needs to find the right balance of humility, confidence, interest, and time to move forward with the CTV soft fork or other potential upgrades.</summary>
