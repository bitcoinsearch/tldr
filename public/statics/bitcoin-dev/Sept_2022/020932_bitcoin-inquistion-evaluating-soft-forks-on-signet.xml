    <summary>The email conversation between Antoine Riard and AJ discusses the evaluation of creative ideas in Bitcoin development. They agree that evaluation occurs throughout an idea's lifetime, done by both the author and wider audience. AJ expresses concern about downgrading to pure empiricism in consensus upgrades and suggests using a working prototype on bitcoin-inquisition as a determining factor of proposal soundness. However, they note that prototypes also help think about all the details in a fork. They discuss experiments with changes in block reward issuance schedule and the upcoming Contracting Primitives WG to document relevant experiments run on bitcoin-inquisition.</summary>
