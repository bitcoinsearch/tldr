    <summary>In a conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Tomas, it was discussed that Bitcoin Core software does not use mempool pre-validation as it can lead to hard-to-detect consensus faults and make all mempool code consensus-critical when it otherwise is not. There have been bugs in the past which would have split the network if this optimization had been used. Bitcrust does not need reorgs at all, making it less susceptible to these risks. The discussion also touched on whether splitting script validation and order validation introduces risks inherent to the protocol.</summary>
