    <summary>The discussion revolves around the possible policy changes in Bitcoin to make it vulnerable to a 51% attack. The argument is that using ASICBoosted hash rate would be more secure against newer optimizations than non-ASICBoosted hash rates. However, policy changes should not be made to enable patented PoW algorithms but rather to prevent their use. While open-sourcing the patent for ASICBoost would be beneficial, legalities of specific jurisdictions should not affect Bitcoin policy as it introduces risk to the network. To handle any specific cases where a patent or legal maneuver gives an actor an unfair advantage, Bitcoin will take necessary action. The proposed changes could increase the odds of Segwit being activated as per BIP-141.</summary>
