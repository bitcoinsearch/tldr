    <summary>In an email exchange on April 14, 2017, James Hilliard claimed that "everyone can spend" transactions were not being prohibited from mining due to policy rules. However, Tom Zander, in his response, clarified that the statement was false and explained that a policy rule was not a protocol rule. He further elaborated that a mining node was not guaranteed to have the policy rule and that those that did typically made it configurable. In conclusion, Zander cautioned against depending on one implementation and user configuration for the avoidance of chain forks and appreciated Hilliard's thoughtful reply.</summary>
