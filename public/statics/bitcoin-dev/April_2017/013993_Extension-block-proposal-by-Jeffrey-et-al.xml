    <summary>The proposal suggests that each channel opening transaction must reserve 700 bytes within each block in the chain until the transaction is closed. However, the writer questions if this implementation is necessary for a softfork and suggests that a hardfork or extension block could be used to grant extra space when the tagged UTXO is spent. It is also noted that there may be potential abuses of the system by miners or users trying to claim all unused space and sell those tagged UTXOs later. To address this concern, the writer proposes limiting the reservable space in each block and deducting more space than what is reserved. Additionally, the writer suggests utilizing a few bits in nSequence with BIP68 to allow users to fine tune the space they want to reserve. The writer expresses interest in exploring this idea further and incorporating it into their hardfork proposal.</summary>
