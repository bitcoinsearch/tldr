    <summary>Unfortunately, there is concern over the use of specialized hardware in POW, and a suggestion has been made to make it dynamic so that only GPU/FPGA is possible. One potential solution suggested is a variant of Keccak where the size of the sponge is increased along with additional zero bits required. However, there are concerns that this may compromise sha3 such that the size of the sponge does not increase the number of possible output bits as expected.</summary>
