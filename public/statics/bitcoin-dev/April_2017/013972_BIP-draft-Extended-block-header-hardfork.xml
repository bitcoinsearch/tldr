    <summary>Russell O'Connor, a member of the Bitcoin development community, suggested moving nHeight from the coinbase script to the coinbase locktime in an email sent on April 2, 2017. He mentioned that someone had previously suggested this change as it would be more natural. Tom Zander responded to this email, stating that such a change would not require consensus and could be made any day. Zander is a blogger and vlogger who frequently provides insights on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.</summary>
