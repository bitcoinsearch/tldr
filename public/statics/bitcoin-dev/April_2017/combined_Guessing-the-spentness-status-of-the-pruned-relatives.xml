    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion, the use of MMR data structure for transaction output (TXO) commitments was brought up. One suggestion put forward is for Bitcoin nodes to keep a spentness status list, where each bit corresponds to whether a transaction output in the Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MMR) is spent. This could make it so that disconnected wallets did not have to guess the pruned relative spentness status when reconnected to the network and help prevent DoS attacks. The limitation of 8 to 12 layers corresponds to an MMR proof length of 512 to 768 bytes if a 32 byte hash and spentness bits are used.When using spentness bits in the merkle tree hashes instead of setting leaf nodes to empty, increasing the DLH_REQUIRED beyond 8 quickly has diminishing returns. Given that the spentness bit fields are 1 bit per txo, and markle hash size is 32 bytes, if you are using a 32 byte hash and spentness bits, you are pretty much limited to only being able to prune 8 to 12 layers. Bitcoin nodes have the ability to maintain a spentness status list that would correspond to whether a transaction output in the MMR is spent. If such a list were kept, disconnected wallets would not need to guess the pruned relative spentness status when reconnecting to the network, which could help prevent DoS attacks. In an email thread related to using the MMR data structure for txo commitments, a user named bfd at cock.lu suggested the topic of committed bloom filters as a solution to similar issues without needing an ever-growing list of hundreds of millions of spent outputs. Praxeology_guy responded saying that wallets could maintain the changing MMR proof for their old coins but they also need to know the spentness status of close relatives in the MMR tree to construct a valid MMR proof that their own coin is not spent.In a Bitcoin development discussion on the scalability of transactions, participants exchanged opinions on using spentness bits in the merkle tree hashes instead of setting leaf nodes to empty. Praxeology_guy highlighted that using spentness bits scales linearly in comparison to swapping digest leafs with empties which can scale logarithmically increasing storage requirements. However, making the memory commitments smaller would increase CPU requirements and proof size. Bram Cohen, a computer programmer and creator of the BitTorrent protocol, shared his approach to research and development, suggesting that exploring all interesting ideas and helping each other improve them is appropriate before deciding on an option when there is a deadline to be met. The topic of exploring interesting ideas in R&amp;D was discussed between Bram Cohen and Praxeology Guy. Bram suggested that Praxeology Guy should read his txo bitfield proposal instead of responding to something unrelated. In response to Bram's suggestion, Praxeology Guy expressed that he is not a fan of the Patricia Tree for bitcoin txos and believes it to be too much work when other options are available.Praxeology Guy presented an idea called "The TXO bitfield" which suggests changing how the MMR data is modified on spend. The proposal moves from changing leaf nodes to changing a node closer to the root. The spentness bit array becomes part of the nodes at height DLH_REQUIRED's hash, resulting in the same benefit of MMR proofs not changing. The spentness bits take up 30% of the data structure's space with DLH_REQUIRED = 8 while it takes up 87% with DLH_REQUIRED = 12.Using stats from blockchain.info, 12E6 delayed utxo only txos are added to an MMR per year w/ the current block size while 200E6 txo/year added to the MMR per year if spent txos are added too. If the block size is increased, we may soon decide we'd rather switch from using spentness bits to changing digest nodes to empty nodes, as this would give more breathing room.</summary>
