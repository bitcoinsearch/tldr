    <summary>A suggestion was made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list on April 17, 2017 about adding a signal to OP_RETURN that would allow users to tag validated input addresses. With this information, nodes could activate new features after a certain percentage of tagged input addresses is reached within a specific time period. This tagging may provide a better indication of economic support for certain upgrades than simply counting reachable nodes. However, the idea of tagging transactions with information about the capabilities of the node that created them may not be advisable for various reasons.</summary>
