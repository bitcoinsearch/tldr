    <summary>A new development, called bip-genvbvoting, has been released on GitHub. The implementation is based on the Bitcoin Unlimited 'dev' branch and submitted as PR458 to BU. The development's naming of the new 'bipgenvb_forks' output section in the 'getblockchain' RPC interface is temporary while the BIP has no formal number. Feedback is welcome as a corresponding pull request for a reference implementation on Bitcoin Core is being implemented. However, it may come at a later stage due to other commitments, so anyone else eager to port it over can feel free to do so.It is important to note that the revised "unknown version check" code is considered an implementation-specific and not part of core functionality. As a result, it is not fully covered by regression tests. This means that there may be issues with this code that have not yet been discovered or addressed. It remains to be seen whether this development will be widely adopted by the cryptocurrency community, but it is clear that there is interest in exploring new approaches to voting mechanisms.</summary>
