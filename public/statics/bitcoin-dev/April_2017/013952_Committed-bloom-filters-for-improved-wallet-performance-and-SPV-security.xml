    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev forum, Chris Belcher expressed his support for the committed bloom filter idea over BIP37 for better privacy. However, he noted that downloading blocks from multiple peers with new tor circuits is still necessary for good privacy when using Bitcoin frequently. Belcher also discussed the challenges of finding transaction subgraphs from blocks and how a Bayesian approach could potentially address this issue. He suggested analyzing what information a spy can obtain if they are missing some blocks that the wallet downloaded. Looking to the future, Belcher believes off-chain transactions will likely be the best option for private and high-volume use of Bitcoin. Additionally, another participant in the discussion shared their belief that BIP37 is effectively unused by most wallets and services.</summary>
