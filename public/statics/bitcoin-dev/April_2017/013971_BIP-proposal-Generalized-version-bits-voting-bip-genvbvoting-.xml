    <summary>In an email exchange on April 3, 2017, Tom Zander asks Sancho Panza to elaborate on a specification, which was missing the meat of the proposal.  Zander agrees that cosmetic changes are needed to generalize from only soft forks to "soft or hard forks" and to add the additional per-bit parameters "threshold" and "windowsize." However, he believes that the per-bit parameter threshold and windowsize are a different matter altogether. The design of the state machine is envisioned to remain unchanged, but without these variables specified in the BIP, old nodes would miss the data to transition to certain states. Zander suggests creating three default sets of properties and when a proposal starts to use bit 11 it behaves differently than if it uses 22.</summary>
