    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Zander proposed changing the proposal to allocate only 8 bits to grinding and leave 20 bits for signaling. However, he is unsure of what steps to take next and wonders if he should create a new BIP or try to convince the authors of BIP141 to modify their proposal. In response, Sancho Panza suggested that the top 3 bits, which are currently reserved for other purposes, could be used to signal for an extended version field elsewhere, leaving the bottom 29 as entropy. While not his preferred direction, it is a technical possibility. The discussion ends with a request for information on the next part of the process.</summary>
