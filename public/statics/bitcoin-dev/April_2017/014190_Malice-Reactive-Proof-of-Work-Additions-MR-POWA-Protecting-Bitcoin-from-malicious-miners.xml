    <summary>On April 16, 2017, Erik Aronesty suggested a solution to protect hardware infrastructure investments from ASICs. He proposed using eight or more secure hashes that can be implemented on GPU/CPU and rotate through them per block round robin. The write time for configuring FPGA with a fresh bitstream is measured in tens of milliseconds, which makes it more affordable than GPUs or FPGAs. Unused circuits don't consume power, making it the main cost for running a miner. However, centralized manufacturing is a problem leading to a monopoly. A rotating POW seems to make ASIC manufacture impractical compared to generalized, commercially available hardware. It's unfortunate that the POW can't be made dynamic so that any specialized hardware is impossible, and only GPU/FPGA is possible.</summary>
