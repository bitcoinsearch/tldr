    <summary>The email conversation between Erik Aronesty and Sergio Demian Lerner discusses the potential release of Segwit2mb, which is a last resort option that doesn't need to be released quickly. The proposal's name isn't important, as it refers to joining segwit with a 2Mb hard-fork. However, Segwit2mb doubles the maximum size of a block, resulting in an average block size of 4.0Mb for blocks filed with average transactions. While a high consensus hard fork is preferable to a low consensus soft fork, there is no indication that segwit isn't already very high consensus except for a handful of pool operators protecting fee income. If the proposal is rejected by any side, then it'll reveal that neither side is looking for any consensual resolution of the conflict. Miners who currently object to segwit while pretending to like larger blocks will find excuses to object to this proposal too, although Sergio has received positive feedback from them until now. The hard-fork is conditional to 95% of the hashing power approving the segwit2mb soft-fork and the segwit soft-fork being activated. However, miners signalling they have upgraded by flipping a bit in the nVersion field has little relevance in a hard fork, and Sergio plans to explain why creating 8Mb blocks on purpose is generally an irrational choice.</summary>
