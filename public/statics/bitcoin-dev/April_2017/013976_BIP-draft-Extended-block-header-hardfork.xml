    <summary>In this conversation, Greg Sanders corrected Tom Zander on his reference to BIP30 when he actually linked to BIP34. James Hilliard then confirmed that the rule in question is a consensus rule in BIP34. Tom Zander was trying to find where the rule was enforced, but only found code that checked for unknown or fully spent txids. Russell O'Connor suggested moving nHeight from the coinbase script to the coinbase locktime, but Tom Zander pointed out that this change would not be a consensus change and could be made at any time. Tom Zander also provided links to his blog and vlog.</summary>
