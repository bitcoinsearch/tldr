    <summary>In an email thread on bitcoin-dev, Christopher Jeffrey clarified that his proposal was not meant to be a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). This caused confusion among readers, as it was written like a BIP. One reader suggested that if it wasn't for Bitcoin, Jeffrey should clarify which altcoin the proposal was for. However, since the forum is not intended for discussions about altcoins, the conversation came to an end. The original poster apologized for any confusion.</summary>
