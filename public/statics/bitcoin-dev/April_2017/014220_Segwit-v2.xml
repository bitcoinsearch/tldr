    <summary>The BIP 141's version bit assignment will expire soon and requires renewal. Luke Dashjr suggests making minor tweaks to the spec for the next deployment, which would be an improvement but not critical. The first suggested change is to replace the dummy marker with 0xFF instead of 0 due to the ambiguity created by using 0. The second recommended change involves relaxing the consensus rules on when witness data is allowed for an input. Currently, it is only allowed when the scriptSig is null, and the scriptPubKey being spent matches a specific pattern. Instead, Luke suggests allowing it in combination with scriptSig and with any scriptPubKey, and consider these cases to be "upgrade-safe" policy ignoring. The purpose of this change is to be more flexible to any future softforks.</summary>
