    <summary>David Vorick urges caution in proposing a plan to invalidate hardware, stating that it will only succeed if everyone is on board with it. Bitmain's ASICBOOST has been kept from their own customers and hasn't been shared with anyone else; therefore, disabling it would only affect Bitmain and not other miners. Peter Todd emphasizes that mining is a zero-sum game, so if no one can use ASICBOOST, all miners are in the same position as before. ASICBOOST is only relevant to miners like Bitmain who have access to it while other miners don't.</summary>
