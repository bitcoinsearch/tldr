    <title>Small Nodes: A Better Alternative to Pruned Nodes</title>

    <summary>David Vorick, a developer via bitcoin-dev, has suggested that the best alternative to storing the full blockchain is a pruned node. However, Tom Zander believes this idea is too complex and has suggested an alternative approach which he believes is much simpler. His proposal includes a "random pruning mode" that would store a day's worth of blocks and an additional 20-50GB for historical data to be shared on the network. The node would store a random set of blocks and drop random blocks as it runs out of disk space. This setup would allow many different nodes to have the total amount of blocks, even though each node only has a fraction of the total amount. This would result in less replication among nodes and greater efficiency.</summary>
