    <summary>In a recent post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, concerns were raised regarding the potential default setting of pruned nodes in bitcoin-core. The post claimed that if this were to happen, it would become problematic quickly. In response to this, one user criticized the proposed solution of inventing a workaround and stated that the priority should be to increase full nodes with an incentive for people to run them. They argued that the proposal was absurd and did not address this priority. Another user responded to the criticism by referencing a previous discussion from 2015 which suggested compactly indicating which blocks a node has so that each node would store a sub-set of all the blocks, making it unnecessary to download every block from multiple peers. It was recommended that each node store the last few days worth of blocks regardless. The original poster also included links to their Github pages, which include simple Zcash and Bitcoin wallets, a torrent dynamic blocklist, a list of 10 million passwords, and information about anti-spies and private torrents.</summary>
