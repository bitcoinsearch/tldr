    <summary>In an email to Tomas van der Wansem, Marcos expressed interest in integrating his bitcoin implementation as a kernel module in bitcoin-core. The implementation takes a different approach to indexing for transaction verification, using a spend-tree instead of an index of unspent outputs. This allows for better concurrency and the ability to verify individual inputs fully in parallel. The code is available on GitHub, and Tomas is sharing it to call for a clear separation of protocol and implementations. He suggests that the solution's excellent performance characteristics might make updates to the protocol addressing UTXO growth unnecessary and that such concerns should be addressed as implementation details.</summary>
