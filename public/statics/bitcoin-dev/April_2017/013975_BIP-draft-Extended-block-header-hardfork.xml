    <summary>Tom Zander, a developer, asked for clarification on where a particular rule was enforced in the code of Bitcoin. James Hilliard responded that it is a consensus rule and provided a link to BIP-0034, which specifies the enforcement of this rule. Russell O'Connor suggested moving nHeight from the coinbase script to the coinbase locktime, but Tom pointed out that such a change would not require a consensus change. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Links to relevant code were also shared throughout the conversation.</summary>
