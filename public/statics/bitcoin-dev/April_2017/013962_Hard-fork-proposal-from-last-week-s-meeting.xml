    <summary>A discussion on the bitcoin-dev forum regarding the proportion of users who believe in microtransactions for all took place on March 29, 2017. Jared Lee Richardson made the initial statement and Staf responded, stating that a clear definition of microtransaction would be necessary to evaluate the claim. No consensus was reached on the matter. The conversation was held via email and included a digital signature attachment.</summary>
