    <summary>In this context, the author discusses a mathematical equivalence between using two limits and calculating the ratio versus using one limit and a ratio. The author notes that there is no difference in the output, only in the order of operations. The statement that there is no blocksize limit with this method is seen as meaningless because it simply means that an abstraction is being used where the limit is not visible.</summary>
