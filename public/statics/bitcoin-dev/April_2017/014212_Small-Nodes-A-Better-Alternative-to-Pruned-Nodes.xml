    <summary>The context of the discussion is about increasing the number of full nodes on the blockchain network. There is a proposal to incentivize people who already have the resources to run full nodes, in order to protect their business. However, some participants feel that encouraging home users to run full nodes is not a good idea because it could lead to centralization. They suggest using already proven efficient concepts like torrents instead of reinventing them. The proposer of the incentive believes that his proposal does meet all of the requirements listed by Maxwell and that having a set of 8 random peers gives a high probability of being able to recover every single block. However, there are concerns about how the full nodes will first be bootstrapped and whether the pruning nodes will desync.</summary>
