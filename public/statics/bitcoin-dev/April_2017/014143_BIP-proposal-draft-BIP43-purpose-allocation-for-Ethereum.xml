    <summary>This BIP proposes a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets on the Ethereum blockchain based on an algorithm described in BIP-0032 and purpose scheme described in BIP-0043. Ethereum's unique requirements make the hierarchy defined by BIP44 poorly suited, resulting in inter-client incompatibility. The proposed hierarchy defines two levels in BIP32 path: m / purpose' / subpurpose' / *. Apostrophe indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used at each level. Purpose is a constant set to the hardened value of the BIP number assigned to this BIP, indicating that the subtree of this node is used according to this specification. Subpurpose is set to the EIP number specifying the remainder of the BIP32 derivation path, permitting new Ethereum-focused applications of deterministic wallets without needing to interface with the BIP process. References to BIP32 and BIP43 are provided.</summary>
