    <summary>Tom Zander argues that the version field is still necessary in order to allow for future block version upgrades. He believes that cutting off this road forward would be a mistake. However, if all 32 bits were given up to grinding, he tends to agree with this point. It is important to note that BIP9 is solely informational and the top 3 bits are reserved for other purposes. One of them could potentially be used to signal an extended version field elsewhere, leaving the bottom 29 bits as entropy. While this is not Tom's preferred direction, it remains a technical possibility.</summary>
