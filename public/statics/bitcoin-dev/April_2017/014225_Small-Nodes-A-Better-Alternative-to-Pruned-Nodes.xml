    <summary>In an email exchange, Danny Thorpe states that 1TB HDD is available for under $40 USD, but most people are upgrading to SSD's due to faster boot and response times. However, a 200 - 500gb SSD is the most storage upgrade people can afford in the $400 to $700 range of laptops. David's premise of only requiring 30GB instead of 100GB to run a full node would remove a major obstacle for more people to run full Bitcoin nodes. Danny questions whether it will be able to scale as the blockchain volume grows exponentially and whether different small sizes can interoperate. He suggests allowing users to choose how small they want their nodes to be from 10GB to 100GB instead of a standard default install of 30GB. As more people use Bitcoin, there will be an exponentially growing number of smaller nodes taking up the slack, making the blockchain look like a BitTorrent, but one that does not require full downloads.</summary>
