    <summary>Joseph Poon, a Bitcoin developer, discussed a proposal to mitigate Goldfinger attacks in the Lightning Network (LN). The proposal involves adding an extra transaction bit that would reserve 700 bytes of space for two transactions to occur. Firstly, a penalty transaction penalising the parent transaction for fraud by spending the funds immediately and secondly, a free-rider transaction that penalises fraud within around a two week window. Vigilant watchers of channels can immediately punish fraud using the former transaction while the latter allows users to find space within two weeks. This method reduces the cost of setting up LN channels with funds in reserve with minimal code changes. However, certain conditions related to miner-attacker coordination with high hashpower remain.</summary>
