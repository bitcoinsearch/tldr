    <summary>The writer of the context is looking for a hardfork design that involves a stricter UTXO growth limit. They believe that challenging the established model is always a good thing, but they do not want any conspiracy theories involved. The writer has concerns about UTXO growth and how it could affect their design. They are responding to someone who suggested that a protocol addressing UTXO growth might not be worth considering for protocol improvements. The writer disagrees and believes that a UTXO growth limit would be helpful for their design. The writer acknowledges that their previous statement regarding output and input costs was unclear and potentially misleading. They clarify that in their design, outputs are less costly than inputs in total resource costs, but this does not ignore base load script verification. Overall, the writer wants to create a hardfork design with a stricter UTXO growth limit that addresses their concerns.</summary>
