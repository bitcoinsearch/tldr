    <title>Quadratic Hashing in BIP 134</title>

    <summary>The latest BIP 134 now includes support for SIGHASH_SINGLE and its counterparts. However, this reintroduces some quadratic hashing behavior because SerializePartialTransactionv4 is called per non-SIGHASH_ALL input. This means that if each input in a transaction has one SIGHASH_SINGLE CHECKSIG operation, the total amount of hashing done for the transaction will be quadratic in the number of inputs. Though the amount of hashing is not as severe as with the SIGHASH_ALL case, it is still non-linear.</summary>
