    <summary>In an email thread on April 3rd, 2017, Russell O'Connor proposed a new approach to the coinbase transaction input. He suggested that instead of using a hash of all zeroes in the coinbase script, the hash of the previous block should be used. This would enable people to pay to a child of a particular block with a new SIGHASH design. O'Connor has already implemented this in his spoonnet2 branch and plans to describe it with a BIP soon. However, this proposal is separate from his goal of allowing people to know the height of a block through the extended header. The current proposal states that the witness of the first input of the coinbase transaction must have exactly one stack item containing bytes 0 to 3, which represent the nHeight of the block in signed little endian format. A suggestion was made to move the nHeight to the coinbase locktime instead, but O'Connor is exploring a different approach.</summary>
