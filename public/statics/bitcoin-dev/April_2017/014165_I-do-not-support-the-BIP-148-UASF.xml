    <summary>In a conversation between James Hilliard and Tom Zander on April 14, 2017, they discussed the need for consensus rule enforcement even with SegWit. Hilliard agreed with Zander's point that non-upgraded nodes on a SegWit network are at risk of mining an invalid block. This contradicts Gregory Maxwell's statement that there is no risk to such nodes. These miners could potentially be "left behind" and operating on different consensus rules than the majority.</summary>
