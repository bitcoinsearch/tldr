    <summary>In a discussion between Bram Cohen and Praxeology Guy, the latter presented an idea called "The TXO bitfield" which suggests changing how the MMR data is modified on spend. The proposal moves from changing leaf nodes to changing a node closer to the root. The spentness bit array becomes part of the nodes at height DLH_REQUIRED's hash, resulting in the same benefit of MMR proofs not changing. The proposed idea looks great for making commitments on the entire TXO set instead of some policy of N blocks delayed UTxOs. However, Praxeology Guy still likes the MMR structure better if only UTxOs are added after a long delay. The delay and adding only UTxOs allow much fewer additions to the spentness bitfield and its merkle tree. One downside of only adding delayed UTxOs to the MMR is that the index changes/created when the delayed addition happens. Praxeology Guy thanked Bram Cohen for his idea, which was the inspiration to switch from changing to empties to changing the spentness bits, and expressed excitement about these designs.</summary>
