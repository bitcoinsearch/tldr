    <summary>On April 5, 2017, Gregory Maxwell sent an email in which he stated that each block must contain either a BIP-141 segwit commitment or a correct WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef. However, it was later pointed out to him that the proposed ID collides with one chosen in another non-BIP proposal. Maxwell clarified that this collision was unintentional and he would change the value when updating the document.</summary>
