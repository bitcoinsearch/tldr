    <summary>Miners are irrelevant when it comes to hardforks as they cannot make the process any smoother. While BIP9 can indicate censorship in a soft fork, a hard fork always requires nodes to upgrade to the version increasing the degrees of freedom of the system. Signaling is less useful here since the change is not opt-in and will require coordination, and the continuation of the chain thereafter depends on people actually running the hard-fork code, not just being aware there is something happening. Miners became a convenient way to activate soft-forks but they can't ameliorate a HF transition in the way they can censor transactions without permission.</summary>
