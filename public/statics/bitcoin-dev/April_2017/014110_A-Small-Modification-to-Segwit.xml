    <summary>In a conversation between two individuals named Pavel and an unnamed party, they discuss the potential impact of ASICBoost in mining. While Pavel believes that there would be significant parties involved with nonequivalent starting positions, the other individual disagrees, stating that nonequivalent starting positions are the norm in mining and therefore not a problem. The topic then shifts to preventing ASICBoost completely, which the unnamed party believes can and should be done. However, they clarify that their proposal aims to bring ASICBoost out into the open while it is still possible, and that a BIP to prevent it completely is compatible with their proposal.</summary>
