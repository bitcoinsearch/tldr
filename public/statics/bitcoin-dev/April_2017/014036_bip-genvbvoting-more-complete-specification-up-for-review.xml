    <summary>A draft of the Bip-genvbvoting (generalized version bits voting) specification has been put up for review. Comments are welcomed on the Github page provided by the author. The proposal aims to achieve full backward compatibility with the existing BIP9 state machine, which is necessary to maintain full compatibility with any ongoing deployments. The author plans to work on a reference implementation and provide a link to it once it is mature enough for review. Previous reviewers who took a look at the initial rough draft have been thanked by the author. A link to their comments has also been provided.</summary>
