    <summary>Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, raised concerns about Asicboost, a method used by some Bitcoin miners to increase their efficiency. He stated that Asicboost creates an incentive to make blocks smaller, which is undesirable and should be eliminated. The hashing method used in Asicboost does not treat the process as a black box, meaning it has impacts on what gets mined. It is unclear how exactly Asicboost modifies the mining algorithm, but it likely involves reordering and excluding certain branches of the merkle tree. However, there is no precise description available for this process.</summary>
