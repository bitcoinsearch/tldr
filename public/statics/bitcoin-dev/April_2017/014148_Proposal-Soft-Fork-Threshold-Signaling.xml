    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas and Sancho, they discuss the threshold as part of signaling in a soft-fork proposal. They agree that coinbase space could be a limitation. Thomas suggests encoding the threshold in the version bits. He proposes setting the top 3 bits to 010, allowing for the use of the remaining 29 bits for soft-fork signaling. With 7 bits per soft-fork proposal, there would be enough space to encode four simultaneous proposals with sub-percent granularity for the threshold. Sancho responds by referencing his own proposal on how to make BIP9 more configurable. He suggests extending it with a coinbase signaling feature to include parameter information for forks which a miner is signaling for coordination. However, he notes that there is limited space in coinbase for embedding data on the large number of possible independent deployments.</summary>
