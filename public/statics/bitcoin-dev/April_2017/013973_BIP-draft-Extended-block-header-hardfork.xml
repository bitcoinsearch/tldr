    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around moving nHeight from the coinbase script to the coinbase locktime. Russell O'Connor suggests that this change would be more natural. However, Tom Zander states that it would not require consensus and could be made at any time. It is important to note that the current protocol operates under a consensus rule, as stated in BIP-0034. The rule determines that block headers must contain a merkle root of all transactions in the block, including the coinbase transaction. Any changes to this rule would require consensus among the network participants.</summary>
