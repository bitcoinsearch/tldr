    <summary>Segwit was designed to allow older miners to continue operating without interruption after activation. However, if a miner does not upgrade to segwit and someone else mines an invalid block, the non-participating miner could extend it. This would result in a chain-fork as segwit miners reject it and non-segwit miners continue mining on it. A segwit transaction to a non-upgraded miner is an "everyone can spend" transaction, which means that a miner that does not validate the segregated area in a post-segwit world will be able to create blocks that will not validate for segwit miners by including a transaction that spends a SW tx.</summary>
