    <summary>The proposed BIP is an extension to BIP9 that introduces an additional activation parameter to guarantee activation of backward-compatible changes, also known as soft forks. The aim is to simplify the original uaversionbits proposal by introducing a simple boolean flag to guarantee lock-in of a BIP9 deployment by the timeout. This combines optional flag day activation with BIP9, allowing user-activated soft forks that can be activated early by the hash power. The specification adds a new per-chain deployment parameter to the existing BIP9 specification. During the STARTED state, if the lockinontimeout is set to true, the state will transition to LOCKED_IN when the timeout is reached. A reference implementation is available on GitHub.
