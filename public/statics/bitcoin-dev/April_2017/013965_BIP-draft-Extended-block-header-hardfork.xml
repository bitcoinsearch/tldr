    <summary>On April 2, 2017, Johnson Lau sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing a proposed change to the Bitcoin protocol. The proposal suggests that the witness of the first input of the coinbase transaction must have exactly one stack item, which is the "extended header". This extended header must contain data consisting of bytes 0 to 3, and nHeight must be equal to the height of this block (signed little endian). In response to this proposal, someone suggested that it would be more natural to move nHeight from the coinbase script to the coinbase locktime. It is unclear who made this suggestion or what their reasoning was. Johnson Lau did not directly address this suggestion in his email.</summary>
