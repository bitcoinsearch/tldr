    <summary>Setting up a full node for Bitcoin has a high barrier of entry due to bandwidth requirements, which makes it difficult for people living in third world countries without adequate data packages from ISPs. There is no financial incentive for running a node, making it a sunk cost and only an ideological one. However, it is important to allow participation in the network for those who cannot afford to run a node, such as by supporting proposals or writing applications on top of Bitcoin. A small node could be a solution, but financially incentivizing nodes could lead to malicious actors automating deployment of nodes to prevent community adoption of proposals.</summary>
