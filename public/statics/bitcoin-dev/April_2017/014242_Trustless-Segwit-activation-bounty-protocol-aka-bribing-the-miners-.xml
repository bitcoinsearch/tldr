    <summary>Based on the given context, it is noted that if SegWit has not been activated at height H, Input 1 of the Bounty Payout will be considered invalid as it spends a P2WPKH output. This is because P2WPKH becomes an "anyone can spend" output in such a case. It is important to note that SegWit is a soft fork and all SegWit transactions must be interpreted as valid by old nodes. Therefore, if SegWit has not been activated, it will have consequences for the validity of certain transactions.</summary>
