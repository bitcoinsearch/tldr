    <summary>In an email exchange between Johnson Lau and Luke Dashjr, they discussed the commitment structure for dummy markers, upgrades to pools software and wallets, and the use of scriptSig and witness. Lau preferred to keep the dummy marker and not change the commitment structure as suggested by another post. Dashjr thought that the dummy marker could be non-consensus critical so long as the hashing replaces it with a 0. They also talked about the use of scriptSig and witness, and Dashjr suggested that scriptSig should not be obsoleted just yet since there are things it can do that witness cannot today. Finally, they talked about restricting witness to IsPushOnly() scriptPubKey, but Dashjr did not see any benefit in doing so since miners could still malleate transactions and add garbage to the blocks.</summary>
