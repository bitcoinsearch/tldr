    <summary>The implementation of a plan to remove millions of dollars of mining revenue for miners is a practical concern, as they are likely to resist this change. The resistance seen during the segwit implementation is an example of this. Additionally, unique optimizations on mining hardware can make a user-activated soft fork (UASF) more difficult. The threshold for success is no longer 51%, especially if miners struggle with the change. Any resistance from the hashrate during the early days of a UASF can cause large reorgs for older nodes and is not much better than a hardfork. It is important to realize how difficult it will be to pull off such a change, as it involves invalidating hardware. The success of such a plan depends on everyone being conclusively on board. Proposals that are not simple and least contentious are unlikely to succeed.</summary>
