    <title>Base Size Increase and Segregated Witness with Discount Governors (SW-DGov) Hardfork</title>

    <summary>Oliver Petruzel has submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to increase block size and introduce hard fork version of Segregated Witness (SegWit). The proposed hard fork will leverage Discount Governors to control the pace of the increase over a period of 145,152 blocks (approximately three years). This proposal is in response to the possible failure of the current soft fork version of SegWit to activate in November 2017. Petruzel hopes that this proposal will provide an alternative that would provide every user in the ecosystem with the fixes and changes they need to move forward with other great projects while also tightly controlling the rate at which the total weight of blocks increases during the next three years.</summary>
