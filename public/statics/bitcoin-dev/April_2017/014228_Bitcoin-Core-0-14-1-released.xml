    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.14.1 has been released with bugfixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. The new minor version release includes two interface changes that break compatibility with 0.14.0. These are the renaming of the first positional argument of `createrawtransaction` from `transactions` to `inputs`, and the renaming of the argument of `disconnectnode` from `node` to `address`. Mining has also seen a change in the getblocktemplate function, which now supports non-segwit clients even after activation by removing all segwit transactions from the returned block template. Additionally, getblocktemplate always recommends signalling segwit for all miners. In the UTXO memory accounting department, memory usage for the UTXO cache has been calculated more accurately, so that the configured limit (`-dbcache`) will be respected when memory usage peaks during cache flushes. Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. However, Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on April 8th, 2014 and there are known instabilities and issues if Bitcoin Core is run on this platform.Users who currently set `-dbcache` to a high value should consider increasing this setting in order to achieve the same cache performance as prior releases. The default `-dbcache` has also been changed to 450MiB. Users on low-memory systems (such as systems with 1GB or less) should consider specifying a lower value for this parameter. A full list of changes and credits for the release can be found at the link provided.</summary>
