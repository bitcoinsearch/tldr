    <summary>Shaolinfry has proposed the bip-uaversionbits proposal, which suggests that BIP9 assignments should reserve a backward compatibility bit for all yet-unknown segwit-compatible proposals to utilize. The motivation behind this proposal is to enable validating nodes that are already capable of supporting segwit to participate to their fullest capacity without further upgrades, even if segwit is activated by alternate means. This proposal would allow any validating node software released after this BIP9 assignment to eventually understand if segwit is activated by alternate means, even when the node is itself a legacy version. The proposal also suggests that future BIP9-compatible deployment attempts might additionally include a date-dependent UASF fallback. If deployment rules require signaling for segwit using the backwards-compatible bit here proposed, then after 95% of recent blocks signal for the alternate segwit deployment, more legacy nodes would understand and validate transactions using segregated witnesses. An expiration time of five years seems conservative.Segwit has proven more contentious to activate than anticipated. However, Shaolinfry believes that the technical consensus is clear, despite noisy objections. No matter which method is used to eventually activate segwit, or on what timeline, it would be beneficial if validating nodes already capable of supporting segwit could participate to their fullest capacity without further upgrades. The realities of system administration on the Bitcoin network are that upgrades occur slowly. Even though segwit in particular is backward compatible with old validating nodes, there are still distinct advantages to validating and generating segregated witness transactions. The proposed deployment logic for segwit is provided in the email.</summary>
