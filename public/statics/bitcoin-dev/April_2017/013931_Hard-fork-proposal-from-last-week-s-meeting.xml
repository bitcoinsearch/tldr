    <summary>The failure to understand the security model of Bitcoin has led to the block size debate. Rodney Morris via bitcoin-dev criticized the obsession with every personal computer being able to run a full node. Eric Voskuil responded by stating that the cause of the block size debate is the failure to understand the Bitcoin security model. He believes that if a typical personal computer cannot run a node, there will be no security. Currently, even a raspberry pi on a poor internet connection can run a full node. It is argued that needing high-end PC and good connectivity to run a full node is not an issue as people that want to, can, and people that don't want to, won't, regardless of how low spec the machine is. The value of Bitcoin is provided by people using it, and people will only use Bitcoin if it provides value to them. Security is one aspect of providing value, but not the only one.</summary>
