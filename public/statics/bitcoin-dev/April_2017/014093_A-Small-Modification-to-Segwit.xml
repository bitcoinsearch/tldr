    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal to modify BIP-141 (Segwit) by allowing overt ASICBoost. The proposal aims to bring ASICBoost out into the open and make it more efficient for miners. The modification involves using the version bits in the header as nonce-space for miners to use in overt ASICBoost, while the witness commitment is moved over to the Coinbase transaction and becomes mandatory. The proposal also addresses concerns about the vulnerability exploited by ASICBoost and the entry barrier for new mining chip manufacturers. However, some participants express reservations about the proposal and suggest addressing the above concerns before implementing it. Additionally, the note on SPV clients clarifies that the proposed change will not impose an extra burden on upgraded light clients.</summary>
