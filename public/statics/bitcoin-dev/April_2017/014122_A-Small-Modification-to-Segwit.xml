    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty questioned whether using an ASIC to find cycles in massive graphs was a good idea. However, another contributor disagreed and argued that using an ASIC tightly coupled with DRAM, such as HBM or HBM2, could actually be the best solution for this task. This would require proof that existing chips using HBM are suitable for Cuckoo Cycle and that no DRAM manufacturer could be lured into making an ASIC. The discussion then shifted to whether a long-term Proof of Work (PoW) change was necessary for the adoption of covert ASICBOOST BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). The contributor stated that such a change was irrelevant given the unresolved problems associated with it.</summary>
