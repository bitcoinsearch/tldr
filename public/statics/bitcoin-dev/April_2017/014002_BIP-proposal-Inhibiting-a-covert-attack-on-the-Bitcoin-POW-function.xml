    <summary>The context of this message appears to be a public response from Joseph Poon, regarding an incident that occurred on April 5th, 2017. It seems that there was a discussion on the "bitcoin" channel at freenode, which led to some sort of issue with Joseph Poon. A user named gmaxwell| made a comment about Poon being complicit in something, to which Poon responded with frustration and disbelief. He questioned whether this was how all problems were resolved, and expressed interest in doing the right thing without any evidence. The tone of the message suggests that this was a heated exchange, and Poon may have been upset or offended by the comment made by gmaxwell|.</summary>
