    <summary>The ongoing conflict between Bitmain and Bitcoin developers over the use of the patented asicboost mining optimization algorithm is being compared to last year's DAO hack, with some suggesting that the algorithm should be nullified. While Bitmain argues that it is simply optimizing its hardware more effectively than others, opponents claim that such optimizations give one company an overwhelming advantage in mining, leading towards monopolisation. Critics argue that asicboost is a direct threat to the health of the Bitcoin ecosystem, damaging to the price, holding back significant improvements and upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol, and directly damaging Bitcoin's ability to upgrade and retain any modicum of decentralization in the hashrate.</summary>
