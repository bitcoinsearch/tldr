    <summary>Eric Voskuil and Tomas are discussing the reverse navigation in Bitcoin to track confirmation and spend information relative to all transactions and outputs for each branch. It is important to have this information persistent and branch-relative. The spend-tree stores this information. They also discuss a scenario where two miners mine a block at the same time and send it to each other. In this case, the miner chooses which tip to work on based on optimizing their income, fees, or excessive validation costs. They emphasize that consistency is reached because people use the same rules. There is also discussion about encoding the height at which a fork historically activated and how it will be history-based rather than height-based. Overall, Eric and Tomas provide insights into the technical workings of Bitcoin.</summary>
