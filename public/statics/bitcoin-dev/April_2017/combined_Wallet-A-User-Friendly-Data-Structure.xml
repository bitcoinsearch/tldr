    <summary>A proposal for a new wallet data structure has been made to improve user-friendliness. It aims to solve "Pruned wallet support #9409" and work with "Complete hybrid full block SPV mode #9483". The proposed structure will allow the wallet to run in a separate process from the Bitcoin node, with a set of trusted nodes belonging to the user. The goals include instant-on capabilities, support for partial scans of the block height range, fast loading of external private keys and other watched identifiers, and transaction deprecation and double spending support. The wallet can merge and connect with different nodes/providers of transaction evidence. The wallet consists of several lists: Spend Term, Wallet Coin, Spend Attempt, Transaction Evidence, Coin Scan, and Evidence Source. A Spend Term identifies a coin that should be tracked by the wallet, while an Evidence Source validates blocks and provides evidence of coin confirmations and spends. Wallet Coins are bitcoin txos with extra data relevant to the wallet, and Spend Attempts identify a spent transaction. Transaction Evidence tracks the creation or spend of a coin, with types including Confirmed UTXO Set Presence, Confirmation, and Discovery (Unconfirmed TX). Confirmed UTXO Set Presence is used for Wallet Coins only, not Spend Attempts. Lastly, the wallet would request a scan from the Source through a Spend Term Scan. It would provide the spend terms, target, and range, with the Source responding with any Transaction Evidence discovered.</summary>
