    <summary>The article delves into the O(N) behavior of two scripting opcodes, OP_IF and OP_ROLL, and how they can lead to a simulated Segwit block that takes up to 5.6 seconds to verify on a single Core i5 processor running Ubuntu VM. However, the findings are not viewed as vulnerabilities since Bitcoin employs multiple worker threads for verifying scripts in parallel. The article suggests rewriting the handling of OP_IF/OP_NOTIF/OP_ELSE with an O(1) algorithm to count true conditions and skipped/false conditions. The second issue lies in the OP_ROLL opcode, which removes a value at a specified index from the value stack and moves it to the top, taking nearly 5.6 seconds to move each stack element around 200 times. One potential solution is using a linked list data structure instead of a std::vector to allow for O(1) removal of items, but it still necessitates O(N) for element lookup. It is possible that optimizing OP_ROLL may never become necessary.</summary>
