    <summary>In an email exchange on April 27, 2017, Luke Dashjr and Johnson Lau debated the use of a dummy marker and scriptSig in Bitcoin. Johnson Lau expressed his preference to keep the dummy marker and not change the commitment structure as suggested by another post. In response, Luke Dashjr argued that the dummy marker could be non-consensus critical so long as hashing replaces it with a 0. Regarding scriptSig, Johnson Lau believed it should be kept empty as it is obsoleted, but Luke Dashjr noted that there are things scriptSig can do that witness cannot today - specifically add additional conditions under the signature. He proposed making a proposal to Litecoin soon, which allows signing and executing extra scripts in witness. This would be useful for things like OP_PUSHBLOCKHASH.Johnson Lau further suggested restricting witness to IsPushOnly() scriptPubKey so miners canâ€™t put garbage into legacy transactions. However, Luke Dashjr did not see the benefit in this since miners can already malleate transactions and add garbage to blocks. He emphasized that witness is cheaper and bigger compared to scriptSig.</summary>
