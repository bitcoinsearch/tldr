    <summary>In a discussion between Tomas and another speaker, the topic of base load and peak load in relation to Compact blocks/XThin with further optimizations is being discussed. The goal is to handle more transactions with the same resources. However, the speaker argues that pre-validation and compactness are unrelated ideas, despite their potential benefits. While compactness can reduce latency of block announcements, pre-validation helps amortize validation and/or storage costs. It is also explained that full transaction validation is necessary upon announcement and outputs alone cannot be validated.Parallel validation is also discussed, and it is concluded that it ultimately slows down both blocks. Soft forks are also mentioned as a compliance issue rather than a performance issue. Tomas suggests adding height-based compliance as metadata of validation as a solution, which is deemed adequate and safe by him. Furthermore, a hash table store that can fully navigate the block tree and transaction DAG has been successfully implemented.In another context, PGP signatures are discussed as a way to secure electronic messages or documents. Developed by Phil Zimmermann in 1991, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is widely used for encrypting emails, files, and other types of data to ensure unauthorized persons cannot access them. Recipients must have the sender's public key to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document signed with PGP. Overall, PGP signatures play an important role in maintaining privacy and security on the internet.</summary>
