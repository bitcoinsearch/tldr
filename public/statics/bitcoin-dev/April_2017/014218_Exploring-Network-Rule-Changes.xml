    <summary>The author has created a guide to explore the problems of changing the rules of consensus systems in general, and posted it to the Bitcoin Development mailing list for review. The guide clarifies the options available to the Bitcoin community and categorizes changes into three categories: Addition of a new rule (Soft-Fork), Removal of an old rule (Hard-Fork), and Subverting an old rule (“Evil”, Non-Traditional Soft-Fork). There are two types of activations: External Activations (User Activated) and Internal Activations (Miner Activated, PoS Activated, Internal Governance Model, etc.). Users within the system with more important roles may wish to signal or veto about a particular topic. This could be part of the activation strategy (internal activations), or just simply to quantify the support of the upcoming change. There are two core types of Signalling: Optional and Forced, with two styles of Signalling: Normal Signalling (Opt-In) and Veto (Opt-Out).</summary>
