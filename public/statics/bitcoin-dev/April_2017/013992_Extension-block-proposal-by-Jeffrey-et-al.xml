    <summary>In this context, Christopher Jeffrey responds to a review of the extension blocks draft spec. Jeffrey acknowledges that many points need to be addressed in the spec and emphasizes the need for feedback. He clarifies that the proposal is not meant to be a BIP and discusses several issues raised in the review, including child-pays-for-parent, merkle commitments, allowed outputs, and block size. Jeffrey also notes the need for more discussion on optimal limits for the extension block size and dos limits. He discusses the implementation of entering outputs, coinbase outputs, transaction versions, and dust thresholds within the extension block. Finally, he explains the deactivation deployment's start time and proposes a solution for handling the migration of funds elsewhere once the extension block is deactivated.</summary>
