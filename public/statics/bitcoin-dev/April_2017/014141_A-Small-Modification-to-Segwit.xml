    <summary>In an email thread on April 11th, 2017, Jimmy Song asked for guidance on how to proceed with his proposal to modify BIP141. He suggested that the specification of asicboost is not being fully utilized and proposed a modification to the protocol to allow more bits for signaling. In response, Sancho Panza agreed that the version field was still necessary for future block upgrades but suggested that one of the top 3 bits reserved in BIP9 could be used to signal an extended version field somewhere else, leaving the bottom 29 as entropy. To submit a proposal to modify BIP141 or propose an alternative, Song was directed to follow the guidelines outlined in bip2 and submit a draft written in BIP style to the BIPs git repository as a pull request. However, it was noted that it may be too late to modify bip141 since there is code out there with the current specification. Furthermore, Song was advised to provide more motivation for maintaining asicboost because it does not make the network more secure, even if all honest miners use it.</summary>
