    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal that aims to add flexibility to the tallying window size of BIP9. The author plans to post a link to a more refined proposal on GitHub once elaboration is complete. The discussion revolves around the idea of retaining full compatibility with BIP9 for a certain version bit if users wish to do so. One participant suggests that it might not be possible to have a state machine without the variables in the actual BIP, but the author argues that the situation would remain unchanged for old nodes. Another participant suggests coming up with three default sets of properties for different bit ranges, while the author prefers the BIP's reference implementation to provide strict BIP9 compatibility and suggests that someone wishing to use a bit for a feature deployment would announce it publicly in a BIP.</summary>
