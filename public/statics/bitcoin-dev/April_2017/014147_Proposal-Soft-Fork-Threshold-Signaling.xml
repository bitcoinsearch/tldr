    <summary>Sancho has proposed a method for making BIP9 more configurable which can be extended with a coinbase signaling feature for coordination. Sancho has shared the proposal on GitHub for Thomas to review. Although Sancho did not include parameter information for forks in the proposal, he suggested it could make a nice addition. However, embedding data in coinbase for independent deployments poses a challenge due to limited space.</summary>
