    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev mailing list thread, Eric Voskuil responded to Rodney Morris' statement that if personal computers cannot run full nodes, then bitcoin will be consigned to the dustbin of history. Voskuil argues that the cause of the block size debate is the failure to understand the Bitcoin security model and that if a typical personal computer cannot run a node, there is no security. He challenges Morris to describe an attack that is made possible when typical personal computers can't run nodes if he wants his logic to have any place in the discussion. This thread highlights the ongoing debate about the role of personal computers in maintaining the security of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
