    <summary>David Vorick, a developer, expressed his concern regarding the activation energy required to implement a proposal that would remove covert ASICBOOST, which he estimates would result in miners losing tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. However, it was clarified that the proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) only removes covert ASICBOOST and should not have any impact on miner revenue as long as the ASICs can still do non-covert ASICBOOST. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on May 4th, 2017.</summary>
