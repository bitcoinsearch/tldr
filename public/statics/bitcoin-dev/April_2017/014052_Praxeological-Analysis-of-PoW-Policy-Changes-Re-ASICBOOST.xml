    <summary>Efficient mining hardware development is desirable for users as it makes the transaction ordering more future proof. Any policy changes to Proof of Work (PoW) should be made carefully in order to minimize the hampering effect on research and development of such hardware. The current BIP proposed by Gregory Maxwell is a good idea, as it blocks the patented covert optimization of asicboost. However, further steps may need to be taken to disable the evident version of asicboost if it becomes an issue in the future.</summary>
