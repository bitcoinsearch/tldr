    <summary>In a discussion about creating bounties for softforks and hardforks, it was pointed out that unless there is a softfork first, it is not possible to create a softfork bounty in a decentralized way. However, creating a hardfork bounty is simple by making sure the transaction violates existing rules. The idea of inverting the logic was suggested, where an economic agent wishing to push for a softfork can select block heights H1 and H2, where H1 is before the activation of the proposed softfork and H2 is after. If a transaction is valid at H1 but invalid at H2, they can offer a bounty for the first person to create such a transaction.</summary>
