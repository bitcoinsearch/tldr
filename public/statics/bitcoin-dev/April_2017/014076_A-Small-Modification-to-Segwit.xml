    <summary>A proposal has been made to modify Gregory Maxwell's recent proposal on Segwit and ASICBoost. The modification would allow for overt ASICBoost, which is more efficient than covert ASICBoost and requires fewer resources. The proposed modification involves changing the version bits in the block header to a nonce-space, allowing miners to use it for overt ASICBoost. The 32-bits are moved to the Coinbase transaction as part of the witness commitment, which becomes required under Maxwell's proposal. This change brings ASICBoost out into the open and can be deployed relatively quickly without imposing an extra burden on upgraded light clients. Feedback is requested on how this modification would affect non-upgraded nodes on the network.</summary>
