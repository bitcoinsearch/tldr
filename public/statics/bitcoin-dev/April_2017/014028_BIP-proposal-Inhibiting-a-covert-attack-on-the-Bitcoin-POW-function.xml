    <summary>A new BIP proposal has been made to address a vulnerability in the Bitcoin proof of work function that can allow a miner to save up to 30% on energy costs. This includes a covert method which can interfere with the implementation of virtuous improvements such as segregated witness. If implemented, this rule would require the coinbase transaction of each block to contain a BIP-141 segwit commitment or a correct WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef. The root value could be required to meet a specific hash prefix requirement, but there is no reason to believe that it is currently necessary.This proposal does not prevent the attack in general, but only inhibits covert forms of it which are incompatible with improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. The proposal notes that another form of attack on Bitcoin exists which is easily detected and could be blocked if it becomes an issue in the future. A proposal has been made to address the non-covert form of this specific attack on Bitcoin.The proposal does not include blocking by requiring that the header version match the coinbase transaction version as it may become generally available without restriction in the future and does not interfere with protocol improvements. The proposal also ensures backward compatibility and implementation details are not provided.The document has been placed in the public domain and can be found on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
