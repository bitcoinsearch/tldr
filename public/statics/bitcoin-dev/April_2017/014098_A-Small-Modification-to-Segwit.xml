    <summary>The use of ASICBOOST is a controversial topic in the Bitcoin community. It has been observed that ASICBOOST causes Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) to become more memory/latency throttled instead of raw computation throttled. The equation for mining profitability is Power Cost + Capital Rent + Labor ~= block reward + fees. Capital Rent is a barrier to entry and in desiring a more distributed system, minimizing the Capital Rent portion of the equation is desirable. However, resolving memory/latency throttle requires a greater Capital Rent than raw computation throttle. This makes ASICBOOST not desirable, even if it wasn't a government enforced monopoly on mining.</summary>
