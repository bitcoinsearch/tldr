    <summary>The writer is in favor of extending signaling capabilities to the end-users. While exploring various signaling ideas, the writer suggests that fields such as OP_RETURN and locktime may not be suitable for this purpose due to issues related to data transfer, storage, and tagging. The output script field is suggested as the best option for signaling as it is specified by the recipient of funds and is already stored in UTXO. The writer also suggests using the last 4 bits of the pubkey/pubkeyhash to opt-in and vote. However, the writer mentions some downsides to this method of voting. Users who do not intend to signal will still be included in the tally, although their signals might be random with a 50% chance of either outcome. The opt-in should ensure that most votes are voluntary. Additionally, requiring too many opt-in bits may exacerbate some problems with HD Wallet lookahead. Despite these challenges, the writer is excited about the potential benefits of this method of signaling, which could provide informed decisions and put an end to speculation about the economic majority.</summary>
