    <summary>In an email discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding suggested that a network with multiple nodes maintaining a transaction index would enable light node applications to ask peers to prove the existence and spentness of TXO's. However, Gregory Maxwell replied that this would only work with additional commitment structures such as those proposed by Peter Todd in his stxo/txo commitment designs. The purpose of this is to improve light nodes by detecting invalid transactions before they are mined. It is unclear why this approach would help in this regard, however, as Bitcrust's txindex merely serves the same role as Core's -txindex mode and can be pruned in the future.</summary>
