    <title>Using a storage engine without UTXO-index</title>

    <summary>The email conversation discusses splitting transactions on storage, and how switching tips can be considered a "reorg". The reverse navigation of UTXO information is essential and branch-relative. The blockchain is only eventually consistent across nodes, and consistency is reached because people use the same rules. It is not optimal to validate concurrently even if selection of a weaker block is advantageous. The validation flags with each transaction are stored in libbitcoin. The discussion also touches on the need for height-based compliance as meta data of validation and how it would be history-based rather than height-based if activation for each branch were tracked.</summary>
