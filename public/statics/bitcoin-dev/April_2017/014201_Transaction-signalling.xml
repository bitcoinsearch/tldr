    <summary>A proposal has been made to tag fee-paying transactions with information about the capabilities of the node that created it. The tagging would occur on the addresses, and the weighting would be by value, so it's a measure of economic significance. This could be useful in gauging economic support for certain upgrades, especially if excluding long transaction chains. A nice bit-field and a tagging standard could be added, and then charted to think about how to use it later. However, this might interfere with "other uses of op_return", such as colored coins. The purpose is to tag economically meaningful nodes to the Bitcoin ecosystem, and colored coins, by definition, only have value to "other ecosystems". There is a counterargument that in some future where this is used as an alternative to BIP9 for a user-coordinated code release, it might be irresponsible to exclude colored coin ICOs that use op-return to float the shares of major corporations from coordinating protocol changes.</summary>
