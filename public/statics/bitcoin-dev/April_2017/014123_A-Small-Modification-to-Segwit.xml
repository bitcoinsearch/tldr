    <summary>The discussion on the use of ASICBoost in Bitcoin mining continues between Jimmy Song and Jorge Timon. Song argues that banning ASICBoost via protocol changes would not be effective, as it could still be used overtly. He proposes bringing its usage out into the open instead. Timon questions the idea of all miners using ASICBoost for security purposes, as an attacker could also use it. Song responds by explaining that allowing ASICBoost makes the network stronger against attacks, as new optimizations can be more expensive to implement. The discussion also touches on the advantages and disadvantages of ASICs in general.</summary>
