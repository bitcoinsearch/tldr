    <title>Small Nodes: A Better Alternative to Pruned Nodes</title>

    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, David Vorick proposed a new type of node called a "small node" which would store only 20% of the blockchain and use Reed-Solomon coding to erasure code blocks into 256 pieces that are 20% of the block's size each. Nodes would pick an index between 5 and 256, with indexes 0-4 reserved for archival nodes, and store the fragment corresponding to their index. When paired with any five unique fragments, the full block can be recovered. A small node would need to connect to peers totaling 5 unique indexes to begin blockchain download. Vorick believes that this new type of node would result in a non-trivial increase in the percentage of users running full nodes and a healthier overall network. However, the proposal requires a non-trivial amount of code to implement.</summary>
