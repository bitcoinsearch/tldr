    <summary>Shaolin Fry recently proposed a user activated soft fork for BIP141, BIP143 and BIP147 using versionbits with guaranteed lock-in to deploy segwit after the current BIP9 segwit times out. The proposed BIP8 could be deployed as early as July 2017, allowing for wide deployment to begin soon with a timeout set to roughly a year from then. However, considering that around 70% of nodes upgraded to witness capability within 5-6 months, the author suggests reducing the time despite the need for caution in Bitcoin. Preliminary dates are set for deployment within a couple of months, starting from November 16, 2017, with a BIP8 timeout on July 4, 2018.This would ensure users have sufficient time to prepare and no longer require a miner supermajority, while still allowing for an earlier miner activated soft fork (MASF). There have been no comments on this draft BIP proposal yet, which is currently in draft status under Standards Track. On April 26, 2017, shaolinfry via bitcoin-dev wrote a draft BIP proposal to redeploy segwit using BIP-8. The reference implementation for this deployment can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...shaolinfry:uasegwit-fla gday. This document specifies a user activated soft fork for BIP141, BIP143 and BIP147 using versionbits with guaranteed lock-in. The motivation for this BIP is that miners have been reluctant to signal the BIP9 segwit deployment despite a large portion of the Bitcoin ecosystem who want the soft fork activated. This BIP specifies a user activated soft fork (UASF) that deploys segwit again using versionbits with guaranteed lock-in on timeout if the BIP is not already locked-in or activated by the timeout. Preliminary dates are deploy within a couple of months, startdate Nov 16th 2017, BIP8 timeout July 4th 2018.For Bitcoin mainnet, the BIP8 start time will be midnight 16 November 2017 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1510790400) and BIP8 timeout will be 4 July 2018 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1530662400). For Bitcoin testnet, segwit is already activated so no deployment is specified.The deployment will set service bit (1) and will be deployed by BIP8 with the name "uasegwit" and using bit 2. This BIP can be deployed well in advance of the BIP8 'starttime' so that the 'timeout' will be sufficiently far in the future to allow Bitcoin users to upgrade in preparation. The 'starttime' of this BIP is after the BIP9 "segwit" timeout to remove compatibility issues with old nodes. Several references are available for this BIP that include https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki, https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki, https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki, https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki and https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0147.mediawiki.</summary>
