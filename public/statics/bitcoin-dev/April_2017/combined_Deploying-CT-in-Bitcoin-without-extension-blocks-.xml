    <summary>Oleg Andreev, on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, proposed a new accounting model and representation of numbers for the deployment of Confidential Transactions on the Bitcoin network. The proposal aims to make the change as compatible as possible while preserving the 1 MB limit. The proposal introduces two new script versions and six new soft-forking rules. The new rules include a sum of commitments on inputs that must balance with the sum of commitments on outputs and cleartext mining fee in the witness. The range proof can be confidential or non-confidential, and Tx witness can have an excess value and cleartext amount for a miner's fee. Confidential transactions use the same UTXO set and can be co-authored with plaintext inputs/outputs using legacy software. The proposal improves scalability by compressing on-chain transactions using mimblewimble cut-through. However, introducing more complex support from miners to respect and merge outputs representing "plaintext value bank" would require further development of non-malleable TxID that excludes miner-adjustable export/import outputs. The proposal also creates an incentive for miners to support the feature and work on improving performance of rangeproof validation by allowing them to sell confidential coins at a premium.Overall, the proposed sketch for implementing Confidential Transactions on the Bitcoin network involves a new accounting model, new representation of numbers, and range proofs per number. The proposal is designed to maintain compatibility, improve scalability, and create an incentive for miners to support the feature and work on improving performance of rangeproof validation.</summary>
