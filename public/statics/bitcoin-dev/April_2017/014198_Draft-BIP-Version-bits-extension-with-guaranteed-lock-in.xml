    <summary>The proposed uaversionbits is being simplified by introducing a boolean flag to ensure lock-in of a BIP9 deployment by the timeout, allowing user activated soft forks that can be activated early by the hash power. However, there is a lack of back-out procedure in this method if a critical flaw is found after activation. The author suggests using a second version bit as an abandonment vote with sufficient hashpower to abandon the protocol change. This changes the dynamic from BIP9's "opt-in" to an "opt-out" system, still governed by hashpower, but far less susceptible to minority miner veto.</summary>
