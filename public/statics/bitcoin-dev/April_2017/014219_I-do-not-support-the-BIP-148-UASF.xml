    <summary>The author of the BIP148 proposal has responded to a review of the concept, stating that while support for BIP148 is surprisingly high, there are important players who do not like the UASF approach. The author claims to have been working on various iterations for a generalized deployment of soft forks and has provided a rough draft of their latest iteration which adds a simple flag to a BIP9 deployment to transition to LOCKED_IN at timeout if the deployment hasn't already activated or locked in by then. The author believes this approach is better than the BIP148 proposal, as it would satisfy the more measured approach expected for Bitcoin without the risks associated with forced activation of existing nodes. They recommend patience, emphasising that Bitcoin is a system that should last for all ages.</summary>
