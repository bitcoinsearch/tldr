    <summary>In an email conversation, Tomas explained to someone about Bitcrust separating script validation from order validation and how it deals with changing validity rules based on block height. For script validation, the software needs an analog of a (U)TXO database, which consumes ~2GB of outputs needed to validate these. However, for order validation, it only needs ~200mb of the spent-index and roughly ~500mb of the spent-tree. Tomas also added that pruning the 5.7GB full spend tree is not worth it anytime soon. When asked about how the spent index rejects a transaction that claims to spend an output that never existed, Tomas did not provide an answer.</summary>
