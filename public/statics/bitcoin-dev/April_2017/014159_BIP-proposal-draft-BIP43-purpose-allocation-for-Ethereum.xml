    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user Tom Zander expressed support for a proposal to create a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) defining a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets on the Ethereum blockchain. The proposed BIP, called bip-nickjohnson-ethereum-purpose, is a particular application of BIP43 and defines two levels in the BIP32 path: purpose and subpurpose. Purpose is a constant set to the hardened value of the BIP number assigned to this BIP, while subpurpose is set to the EIP number specifying the remainder of the BIP32 derivation path. This allows for new Ethereum-focused applications of deterministic wallets without needing to interface with the BIP process. The proposal seeks to provide a path to standardize hierarchical deterministic wallets in a fashion better suited to Ethereum's unique requirements.</summary>
