    <summary>The delay in implementing SegWit may be due to deplorable underlying reasons, according to a post by Praxeology Guy. He suggests pre-mixing the block header bits before they enter the SHA256 hash, either using a hardcoded map or making the map with the tx merkle root as a seed. This could help improve bitcoin's remaining puzzle difficulty. Another option is increasing the number of times SHA256 is performed, but this would require altering the PoW algorithm and may reduce the efficiency of patent-able pre or post calculation skipping/caching. Gmaxwell's solution may be sufficient, however.</summary>
