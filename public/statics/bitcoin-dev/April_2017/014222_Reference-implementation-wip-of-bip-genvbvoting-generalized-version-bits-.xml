    <summary>An initial reference implementation of bip-genvbvoting is now available on Github, based against the Bitcoin Unlimited 'dev' branch and submitted as PR458 to BU. The development's naming of the new 'bipgenvb_forks' output section in the 'getblockchain' RPC interface is temporary while the BIP has no formal number. Feedback is welcome as a corresponding pull request for a reference implementation on Bitcoin Core is being implemented. However, it may come at a later stage due to other commitments, so anyone else eager to port it over can feel free to do so. The revised "unknown version check" code is considered an implementation specific and not part of core functionality and is therefore not fully covered by regression tests.</summary>
