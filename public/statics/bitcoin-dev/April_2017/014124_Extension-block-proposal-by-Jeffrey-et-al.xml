    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of direct exit payments to legacy addresses in the context of block reorganization that may change transaction ID. This can invalidate all child transactions based on the resolution transaction, which is a significant change to the current transaction model. To fix this problem, exit outputs need to be made unspendable for up to 100 blocks, but this creates confusion and fungibility issues for legacy wallet users. Two possible solutions are discussed, with the first solution suggesting adding a maturity requirement for exiting outputs, which would enforce a lower limit than the coinbase's 100 block requirement. The second solution suggests moving all exiting outputs to the coinbase, which enforces a 100 block maturity requirement, but it deteriorates user experience as no one expects payment by coinbase output. The first solution might require more implementation, while the second solution is possibly simpler but sticks to a hard 100 block limit. It is suggested that having a lower lock-up period than 100 blocks would be preferable, maybe somewhere in the range of 5 to 15 blocks, which is seriously unlikely unless something strange is happening. The email thread concludes by saying that if segwit is not activated on the mainchain, it creates a bigger incentive to use the extension block and potentially ensures that users will have less reason to exit.</summary>
