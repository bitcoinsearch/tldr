    <summary>A discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list involved the failure mode of a user's misconfiguration of nTimeout which would result in a stopped chain. However, Praxeology Guy pointed out that this claim is incorrect since BIP9 only works on soft forks and not hard forks. For a stopped chain to occur with a soft fork, a user must adopt more stringent rules while someone maliciously creates an invalid block which is valid to older nodes, and no miner ever mines a different block at the height of the block in question. Furthermore, Praxeology Guy suggested that the user should be notified when a newly activated more stringent soft fork rule caused a block to be rejected, which could be an excellent trigger to enable replay attack prevention.</summary>
