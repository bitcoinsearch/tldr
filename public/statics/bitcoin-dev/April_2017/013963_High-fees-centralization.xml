    <summary>Jared Lee Richardson, a member of the bitcoin development community, expressed interest in the concept of blockchain sharding - dividing the blockchain into smaller parts to increase efficiency. However, he expressed doubts about the possibility of resolving conflicts between these shards and committing transactions between them in a trustless manner. Staf suggested a system where different nodes could agree to process parts of transactions, allowing 20,000 nodes to work like 5,000 full nodes.</summary>
