    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Sergio Demian Lerner wrote that the hard fork is conditional to 95% of the hashing power approving the segwit2mb soft-fork after the segwit soft-fork has been activated. However, miner signalling has little relevance in a hard fork, as even if 100% of the hash power shows they're running this proposal but nodes don't upgrade, it won't matter. The poster expressed confusion about the 95% miner signalling requirement and requested clarification from Lerner.</summary>
