    <summary>The context of the conversation revolves around a consensus rule in Bitcoin. The person asking the question is trying to find where this rule is enforced, but only finds a code that checks whether the transaction ID is unknown or fully spent. This leads them to believe that no full client would reject a proposed change by Russell O'Connor that moves nHeight from the coinbase script to the coinbase locktime. However, James Hilliard responds with a link to BIP-0034 which outlines the consensus rule in question. Tom Zander, who initiated the conversation, expresses that such a change proposed by Russell would not be a consensus change and could be made any day.</summary>
