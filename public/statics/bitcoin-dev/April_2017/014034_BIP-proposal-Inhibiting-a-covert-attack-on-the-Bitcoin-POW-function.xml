    <summary>The situation being discussed has been compared to the DAO fork, but in reality, there are no similarities. The DAO fork violated the principles of cryptocurrencies by changing the ledger in violation of pre-agreed rules, which goes against the whole point of cryptocurrency. On the other hand, Greg's proposal aligns with the principles of cryptocurrencies as it ensures equal access to technology for all miners, which is necessary for a PoW-based cryptocurrency to work through competition. The idea that Bitmain is entitled to future profits is ridiculous because every investment carries risk, and developers must ensure that all miners have equal grounds, which is the point of the protocol. If Bitmain loses profits due to this, it is their problem.</summary>
