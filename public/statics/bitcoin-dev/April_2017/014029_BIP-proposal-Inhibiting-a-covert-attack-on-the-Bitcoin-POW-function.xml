    <summary>In an email thread on April 6, 2017, Luv Khemani argued that blocking the covert form of ASICBOOST would be unethical. In response, a commentator argued that this was a non sequitur. Unlike other optimizations that benefit users, ASICBOOST only benefits certain miners if not all miners use it. Furthermore, allowing it to be used makes the network less secure unless every honest miner uses it. Even if ASICBOOST were good for users, which it is not, this proposal does not disable it, only the covert form that cannot be proven to be used. Therefore, there are no rational arguments against this proposal unless you are a miner currently using or planning to use the covert form of ASICBOOST, or an attacker using or planning to use it. Finally, the commentator notes that ASICBOOST does not reduce the efficacy of large miners or selfish mining in any way.</summary>
