    <summary>After the implementation of segwit, it has been suggested that 8 MB weight is a more clear way to talk about block size than 2 MBs. The proposal suggests that using 2 MBs as a size limit obfuscates the actual new limit with the proposed hard fork. Natanael argues that there is a mathematical equivalence between using two limits and calculating the ratio versus using one limit and a ratio. The output is fully identical, and the only difference is the order of operations. Therefore, saying there's no blocksize limit with this proposal is pretty meaningless because it uses an abstraction that doesn't make the limit visible.</summary>
