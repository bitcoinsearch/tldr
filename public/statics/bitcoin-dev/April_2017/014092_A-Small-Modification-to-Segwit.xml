    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Jimmy Song proposed a modification to Gregory Maxwell's proposal on ASICBoost. Maxwell's proposal precludes the covert version of ASICBoost but leaves the overt version alone. Overt ASICBoost requires grinding on the version bits of the block header instead of the Merkle Root, which is more efficient and requires less resources. Song suggests that if his modification is combined with BIP-141 (Segwit) it would make ASICBoost more useful to miners and appeal to their financial interests. Song's proposal involves changing the version bits in the header to a nonce-space so miners can use it for overt ASICBoost and moving the 32-bits over to the Coinbase transaction as part of the witness commitment. The witness commitment becomes required as per Gregory Maxwellâ€™s proposal.</summary>
