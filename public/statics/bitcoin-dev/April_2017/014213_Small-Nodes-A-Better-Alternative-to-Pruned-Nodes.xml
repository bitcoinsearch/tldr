    <title>Small Nodes: A Better Alternative to Pruned Nodes</title>

    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, David Vorick critiques Tom Zander's proposal to prune the blockchain. Vorick argues that if all peers drop 75% of blocks at random, then users would need to connect with a large number of peers to download the entire blockchain. However, Zander disagrees and believes connecting to many nodes to download faster is not a problem. Vorick also highlights that the new mode of pruning may not be used by 100% of the network, which may impact its ability to handle active adversaries.</summary>
