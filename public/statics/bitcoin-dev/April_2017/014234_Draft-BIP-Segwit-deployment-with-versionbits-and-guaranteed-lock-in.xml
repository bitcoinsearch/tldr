    <title>Draft BIP: Segwit deployment with versionbits and guaranteed lock-in</title>

    <summary>The draft BIP proposal by Shaolin Fry suggests a user activated soft fork for BIP141, BIP143 and BIP147 using versionbits with guaranteed lock-in to deploy segwit after the current BIP9 segwit times out. The proposed BIP8 could be deployed as early as July 2017, allowing for wide deployment to begin soon with a timeout set to roughly a year from then. However, considering that around 70% of nodes upgraded to witness capability within 5-6 months, the author suggests reducing the time despite the need for caution in Bitcoin. Preliminary dates are set for deployment within a couple of months, starting from November 16, 2017, with a BIP8 timeout on July 4, 2018. This would ensure users have sufficient time to prepare and no longer require a miner supermajority, while still allowing for an earlier miner activated soft fork (MASF). There have been no comments on this draft BIP proposal yet, which is currently in draft status under Standards Track. The reference implementation for this deployment can be found at the specified GitHub link.</summary>
