    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Tom Harding, the topic of transaction indexes and light nodes was discussed. Harding suggested that a network with many nodes maintaining a transaction index would enable a class of light node applications that ask peers to prove existence and spentness of TXOs. However, Maxwell pointed out that this could only be achieved with additional commitment structures such as those proposed by Peter Todd in his stxo/txo commitment designs. These commitment structures would improve light nodes by detecting invalid transactions even before they are mined. The email exchange also included a link to Todd's proposal for delayed txo commitments.</summary>
