    <summary>Mark Friedenbach, a Bitcoin developer, discussed the downsides of introducing a new BIP bit as proposed by Greg. The main disadvantage of this alternative is that it would not activate BIP 141, thereby failing to enable new consensus rules on already deployed full nodes. In contrast, BIP148 explicitly chooses to favor users who have upgraded to BIP141 support over miners who have failed to upgrade. However, a new proposal called "Catch-All Segwit Activation" was suggested yesterday which could potentially address this issue. This proposal suggests extended BIP9 activation of SegWit for legacy nodes, though not retroactively. If this release valve exists, discussions can focus on finding the safest incentive-compatible transitions, improving the situation over time instead of making it worse.</summary>
