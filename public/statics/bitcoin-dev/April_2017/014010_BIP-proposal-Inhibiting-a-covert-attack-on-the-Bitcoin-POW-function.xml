    <summary>In an email conversation between Bram Cohen and Peter Todd, they discussed the issue of blocking usage of ASICBOOST in bitcoin mining. Todd stated that non-covert usage of it should also be blocked because of the enormous advantage it gives, which could increase minimum capital requirements to enter the ASIC manufacturing and design business. Additionally, ASICBOOST creates an incentive to make blocks smaller which is an unwanted effect. Cohen agreed with Todd, citing that there is no benefit to Bitcoin for having ASICBOOST. The use of ASICBOOST has led to a year of political issues based on a secret advantage, and they do not want a repeat of this episode.</summary>
