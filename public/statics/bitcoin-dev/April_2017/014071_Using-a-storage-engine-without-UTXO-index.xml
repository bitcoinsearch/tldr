    <summary>On April 6, 2017, Tomas via bitcoin-dev proposed a solution to address the issue of unspent transaction output (UTXO) growth in the Bitcoin protocol. The proposed solution involves reversing the costs of outputs and inputs, which showed excellent performance characteristics in test results. However, some are still unclear on how this solution would affect long-term resource requirements, as UTXO data grows over time at some fraction of the total transaction volume. The question remains whether this proposed protocol improvement is worth considering.</summary>
