    <summary>Currently, overt ASICBoost is not allowed as it would be an attack on the network and cause harm similar to mining only empty blocks. The term "allowed" seems to have different meanings for different people; a valid block on the network or one that doesn't cause harm to the network. However, a miner can still mine only empty blocks or use overt ASICBoost (using as little as 1 bit of the version field) despite it being disallowed. The quantification of harm caused by a block seems subjective and difficult to measure.</summary>
