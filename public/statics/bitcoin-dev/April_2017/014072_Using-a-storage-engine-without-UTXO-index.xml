    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list has turned to whether optimization should be focused on cramming as much data as possible into memory and minimizing disk access. Gregory Maxwell questions whether a proposal for reversing the costs of outputs and inputs, which showed excellent performance characteristics in tests, would be worth considering as it appears to have long-term resource requirements that are directly proportional to the amount of unspent output data. This data grows over time at some fraction of the total transaction volume, plus the rate of spending which is more or less constant. The thread continues with further discussion on the topic.</summary>
