    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner via bitcoin-dev has proposed the Segwit2Mb project, which aims to combine segwit with a 2MB block size hard fork that activates only if segwit activates (95% of miners signaling), but at a fixed future date. The primary goal of the proposal is to reunite the Bitcoin community and avoid a cryptocurrency split.A compromise for the sake of compromise doesn't merit technical discussions. Any change to the code must be technically evaluated. Although the proposal involves a political compromise, any change to the code must be technically evaluated. The patch was made to require the least possible time for auditing. It modifies 120 lines of code, and adds 220 lines of testing code. A core programmer audited it in less than one hour.Even though the proposal involves a political compromise, any change to the code must be technically evaluated. You're risking the unique opportunity to see segwit activated. Maybe we can reach a similar agreement for segwit activation in two years. That will be too late. The remaining cryptocurrency ecosystem does move forward.A recent report from bitnodes.21.co shows that 91% of Bitcoin nodes have upgraded to post 0.12 versions, which can be used to identify active economic nodes. The upgrade has been around for one year and is expected to take a similar or lower time to upgrade for a hard-fork. Delaying a compromise solution could halt innovation for several years, which is not ideal for the Bitcoin community.A BIP will be written detailing the proposal details based on comments collected by the community. If segwit2mb locks-in, all Bitcoin nodes should be updated to prevent forking away in a chain with almost no hashing-power. Contributions to the segwit2mb project are welcomed as long as they stick to the principle that the patch should be easy to audit. The proposal shouldn't prevent other consensus proposals from being merged and community feedback is welcomed.</summary>
