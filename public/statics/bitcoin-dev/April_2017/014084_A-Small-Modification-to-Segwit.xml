    <summary>In this message, Praxeology Guy questions why Bitcoin users would want to change policy in a way that makes their money more vulnerable to 51% attacks. He argues that policy changes should aim to prevent the use of patented Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms rather than enable them. The message is directed towards Jimmy Song and seems to be part of a larger discussion about the direction of Bitcoin policy.</summary>
