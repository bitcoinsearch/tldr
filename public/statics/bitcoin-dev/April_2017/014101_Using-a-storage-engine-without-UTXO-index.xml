    <summary>In a Bitcoin development forum, Tomas stresses the importance of protocol/implementation separation in response to a previous comment. He explains that while UTXO data is always a resource cost for script validation, the ratio of different costs are not necessarily identical across implementations. Tomas notes that in Bitcrust, if the last few blocks contain many inputs, the peak load verification for this block is slower than in Core. In a separate comment, another user suggests limiting the number of 1-in-100-out transactions to prevent UTXO growth and improve efficiency. They suggest experimenting with regtest to compare the performance of Bitcrust with Core. Additionally, they ask about the minimum disk and memory usage in Bitcrust compared to pruning mode in Core.</summary>
