    <summary>A proposal has been put forward to inhibit the covert exploitation of a vulnerability in Bitcoin's Proof of Work function. The attack is said to be capable of allowing an attacking miner to save up to 30% of their energy costs, which could result in a payoff of as much as $100m per year, and could have a centralising effect on mining. This comes after reverse engineering of a mining ASIC from a major manufacturer revealed it contained an undocumented, undisclosed ability to use the attack. A draft BIP has been proposed for discussion, which inhibits the covert use of the attack that potentially blocks protocol improvements.</summary>
