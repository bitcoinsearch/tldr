    <summary>The discussion on a mailing list reveals that if a wallet is unaware of spends of its own coins, there are bigger problems going on. The topic of committed bloom filters is discussed as it solves a similar issue without needing an ever-growing list of hundreds of millions of spent outputs. One suggestion put forward is for Bitcoin nodes to keep a spentness status list, where each bit corresponds to whether a transaction output in the Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MMR) is spent. This could make it so that disconnected wallets did not have to guess the pruned relative spentness status when reconnected to the network and help prevent DoS attacks.</summary>
