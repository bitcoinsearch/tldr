    <summary>A discussion thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the risk of non-upgraded nodes mining invalid blocks on a SegWit network was initiated by Tom Zander. James Hilliard confirmed that consensus rule enforcement is still necessary to mitigate this risk. Gregory's statement that there is no risk to non-upgraded nodes on a SegWit network was challenged by Zander, who claimed the risk is present for any miners who are "left behind" operating on a different set of consensus rules than the majority. However, it was pointed out that the only real risk is that a non-upgraded miner could mine on top of an invalid block intentionally, which is not likely to happen accidentally.</summary>
