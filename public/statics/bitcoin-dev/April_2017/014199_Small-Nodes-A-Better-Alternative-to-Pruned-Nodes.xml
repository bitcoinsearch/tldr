    <summary>In a previous discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, there was a suggestion for a way to compactly indicate which blocks a node has. The idea is that each node would store a sub-set of all the blocks and users could download the blocks they want from the node that has them. While most of the rules for this are already being met, the only issue is that blocks need to be downloaded from multiple peers. Additionally, it was suggested that each node should store at least the last few days worth of blocks. A list of nice-to-have features was also provided by Maxwell in the same thread.</summary>
