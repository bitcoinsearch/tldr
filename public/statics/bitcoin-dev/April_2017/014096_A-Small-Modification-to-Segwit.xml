    <summary>In this conversation, Pavel and Jimmy discuss the impact of changes in mining efficiency due to firmware or hardware updates. They agree that there would need to be changes for stratum and pool software, but note that monetary incentives align with all necessary changes. However, they also acknowledge that these changes would have a significant impact on various parties with non-equivalent starting positions. The conversation then shifts to overt ASICBoost, which can result in significant efficiency boosts. They discuss the challenges of blocking overt ASICBoost without forcing version bits to be a certain value, and propose placing the version number into a coinbase to prevent manipulations with version bits. They note that this would allow for future BIP9 signalling or other purposes. The conversation concludes with a debate over whether or not ASICBoost should be allowed or prevented completely.</summary>
