    <summary>In an email sent on April 5, 2017, Gregory Maxwell proposed that the coinbase transaction of every block between block X and block Y include a BIP-141 segwit commitment or a WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef. When asked why only one of these commitments wasn't enough, Maxwell explained that segwit miners are automatically compatible with this proposal but adding both types of commitment would be trivial to implement. In response to concerns about overt attacks, Maxwell stated that requiring header version matching coinbase transaction version could be done, but it is not being included in his proposal. He also clarified that his proposal does not interfere with BIP 9 because the versionbits could be moved to the generation transaction version, however, this would hide them from light clients. Maxwell's proposal is placed in the public domain, and he provided a link to recommended licenses.</summary>
