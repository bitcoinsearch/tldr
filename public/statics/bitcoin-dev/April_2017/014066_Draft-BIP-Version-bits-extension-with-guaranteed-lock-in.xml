    <summary>In the context provided, it is stated that a user's misconfiguration of nTimeout could result in a stopped chain. This is identified as the primary failure mode. It is suggested that if less-sophisticated users are given these configuration settings, any chaintip progress failures resulting from them should be displayed prominently. This highlights the importance of understanding and properly configuring nTimeout to avoid potential issues with blockchain progress. It also emphasizes the need for clear and visible notifications when such failures occur, particularly for users who may not be as familiar with the technology.</summary>
