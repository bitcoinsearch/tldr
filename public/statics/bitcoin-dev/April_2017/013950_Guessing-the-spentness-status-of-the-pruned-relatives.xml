    <summary>Bitcoin nodes have the ability to maintain a spentness status list that would correspond to whether a transaction output in the MMR is spent. If such a list were kept, disconnected wallets would not need to guess the pruned relative spentness status when reconnecting to the network, which could help prevent DoS attacks. The storage space required for this list would be significantly less if stxos were never added to the MMR. By placing portions of the list in the node at a specific height, R/W operations on the bit list could be made more local to other data that is going to be R/W.</summary>
