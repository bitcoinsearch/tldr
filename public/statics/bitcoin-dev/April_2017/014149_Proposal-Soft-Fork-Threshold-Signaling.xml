    <summary>The writer proposes that the threshold should be made configurable and not fixed in the soft-fork. In addition to this, window size, grace period etc. should also be made configurable. Even though the coinbase space might be a limitation, the writer still likes the coinbase idea more than using up the BIP9 versionbits range for verbose signaling. The writer suggests that it would be very easy to agree on a set of "standard" threshold levels and map those onto e.g. 1 byte. A BIP9 conformant schedule could be A = 95% / 2016 window, while B = 75%/2016, etc. This would be quite a compact yet still readable signaling. The space of values is large enough that there won't be much contention.</summary>
