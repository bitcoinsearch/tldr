    <summary>Tomas van der Wansem, a Bitcoin developer, has created an implementation for the cryptocurrency that indexes and verifies transactions using a "spend-tree" approach rather than the traditional method of using unspent output indices. This method verifies double spends via scanning against spent outputs and allows for better concurrency with individual inputs verified in parallel. Van der Wansem's implementation is available on Github and he is calling for a clear separation of protocol and implementations. He believes his solution could have excellent performance characteristics, as shown by test results, and suggests that updates to the protocol addressing the UTXO growth may be best dealt with as implementation details rather than protocol improvements. Marcos Mayorga, another Bitcoin developer, praised van der Wansem's work and expressed interest in seeing it integrated into Bitcoin Core as a 'kernel module'.</summary>
