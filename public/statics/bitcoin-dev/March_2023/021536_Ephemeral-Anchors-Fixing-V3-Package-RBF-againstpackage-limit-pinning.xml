    <summary>On February 4th, 2023, Greg Sanders announced that he switched to OP_TRUE on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and implementation after receiving negative feedback. In response to his announcement, Peter Todd thanked him and reviewed the updated tests for the OP_TRUE case, which were available on GitHub. Todd suggested that many of the test cases did not need to be changed to OP_2 as they were not related to standardness.</summary>
