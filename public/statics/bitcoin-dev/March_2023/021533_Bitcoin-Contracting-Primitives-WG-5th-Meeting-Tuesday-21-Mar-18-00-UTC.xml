This is one week and a half from now, as per previous meetings which have been scheduled for the third Tuesday of every month. There is an open invitation for anyone who would like to propose an agenda topic in advance. Currently, the only discussion subject is pinned ANYPREVOUT/"Eltoo" but participants are encouraged to add more topics. Those interested in hosting the meeting are welcome to comment on the issue, as it is good to rotate hosts if possible.
