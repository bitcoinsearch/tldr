    <summary>The post discusses the issue of interactivity and partitioning in payment pools and channel factories. It explores non-interactive off-chain pool partitions as a trust-minimized solution that enables non-interactive, off-chain updates of the pool/factory with minimal blockspace consumption. The challenges of pool partitioning are also examined, and potential solutions such as a trusted coordinator or trust-minimized approaches using distributed bulletin boards or on-chain authoritative boards are proposed. The double-spend issue is discussed, and various security models for addressing it are examined.Additionally, the reliability of the publication of partition statements is discussed, and a new consensus data structure is introduced as a potential solution. The high cost and witness size needed to write into the contract register could decrease the economic attractiveness of pool partitioning. The post briefly mentions an email exchange between Billy and ZmnSCPxj where they discussed the challenges of partitioning multi-party constructions and suggested various solutions to address them.In a discussion between Antoine and Billy, the possibility of predicting liquidity needs in sub-pools was raised, and an accumulator committing directly to balances was suggested as a possible solution. The issue of preventing an always-online service from using the receiving key in spending mode if the balance stacked there becomes relevant was also discussed. Furthermore, the possibility of a malicious pool participant committing off-chain balance in two partitions and sending spends to the hosting "receiving-keys" entities without their knowledge was discussed. The email discusses the issue of interactivity and liveliness requirements in Bitcoin's Lightning Network and suggests the need for a trust-minimized solution enabling non-interactive, off-chain updates of the pool/factory with no or minimal consumption of blockspace. It proposes different security models for addressing the double-spend issue of off-chain Bitcoin transactions, highlighting prophylactic and corrective models. Lastly, the email discusses the limitations of correction as a security model in the context of multi-party and suggests leveraging covenants to attach a revocation mechanism to any equivocating branch of transactions.</summary>
