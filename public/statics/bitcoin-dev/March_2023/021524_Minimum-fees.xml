    <summary>A newcomer to the Bitcoin development community has proposed a new protocol rule called min_fees, which would require miners to specify a minimum fee for the following block to be valid. This is intended to address a potential issue where low transaction fees could result in reduced network security, as users have little incentive to pay higher fees if there is enough space for everyone in a block. The proposal suggests that having a minimum fee requirement could bring the equilibrium closer to a socially optimal one and benefit network security in the long term. However, the proposal is still in its early stages and would require further analysis.</summary>
