    <summary>On March 10, 2023 at 4:45:15 am AEST, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, Greg Sanders, pointed out that OP_FORWARD_SELF is a JET (Just Enough Torque) of OP_FLU in the revaulting common case. However, it was noted that this was only true for TLUV and not necessarily true for OP_FLU. In order to preserve the current script without a way to observe it, the script size would have to be infinite, which is not feasible. It was suggested to special case "0 0 OP_FLU" to result in the same script rather than an empty one, which would eliminate the need for a dedicated FWD_SELF opcode. The writer expressed doubt about calling things Jets when they are unrelated to simplicity.</summary>
