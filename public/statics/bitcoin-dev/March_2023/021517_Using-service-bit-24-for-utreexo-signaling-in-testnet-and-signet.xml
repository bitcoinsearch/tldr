    <summary>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Calvin announced his intention to use service bit 24 (1 signet) for utreexo node binaries. The decision was based on a comment in protocol.h in bitcoind, and there are plans to release binaries for the utreexo node in the coming months. However, Calvin has no immediate plans to release binaries for mainnet. He requested coordination with anyone else using the same bit to signal for something else. Luke suggested that this information be written up as a BIP and use a normal service bit assignment.</summary>
