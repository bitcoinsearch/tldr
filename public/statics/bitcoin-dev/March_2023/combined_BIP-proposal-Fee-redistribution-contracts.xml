    <summary>A Bachelor's thesis proposes a new way of distributing transaction fees in Bitcoin mining. The proposed solution involves only taking a fraction of the fees while the rest is sent to one or more contracts, which redistribute the fees back to the miner in a "smarter" way. This would not introduce any new Bitcoins, but would instead collect, average, and reward the fees back to the miner in a cooperative manner. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the paper, including increased security and predictability against fluctuations in fees. However, there are some flaws with the proposal, such as the possibility of undercutting attacks and difficulty in achieving miner consensus. In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rastislav Budinsky proposed a similar solution where the miner would only take a fraction M of the fees and remaining fraction C would be sent to one or more contracts. However, Dave pointed out that miners can profit from confirming a transaction through alternative means, such as "out-of-band fees". He explained that if consensus rules were changed to require each miner pay a percentage of its in-band fees to future miners, then there would be a strong incentive for miners to prefer out-of-band fees that weren't subject to this redistribution scheme. Discussions on the mailing list about paying out-of-band fees have highlighted that larger miners have an advantage over smaller miners in collecting miner-specific fee payments, which undermines the decentralization of Bitcoin's transaction confirmation mechanism.The Bachelor's thesis also acknowledges the difficulty in constructing the smart contract and convincing the ecosystem to change the mining incentive structure from competitive to cooperative. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether long-term mining incentives will be a problem and what solutions should be implemented. Further discussion is needed on achieving miner consensus in implementing and updating the fee-redistribution scheme. Despite these issues, the proposal suggests a potential solution to the long-term miner incentives problem that may arise when block subsidies run out.</summary>
