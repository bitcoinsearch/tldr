    <summary>On March 2, 2023, Luke Dashjr posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about using experimental service bits for experiments. He suggested that if the details of utreexo aren't finalized and may change, an experimental service bit makes sense. Bit 24 is currently unused, so it is fine to use it for signaling something. The full-rbf is currently using bit 26. Meanwhile, kcalvinalvin informed the mailing list that he'll be using service bit 24 to signal for something and requested others to coordinate with him if they are using the same bit to signal for something else.</summary>
