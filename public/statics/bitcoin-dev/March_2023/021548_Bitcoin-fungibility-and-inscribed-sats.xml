    <summary>The author of the message has created a new thread in response to a request by one of the Bitcoin developers. The author believes that fungibility is an essential property of money, and NFTs are not fungible by their very definition, and thus cannot be considered money. However, the inscriptions do not affect the fungibility of Bitcoin as there is no token standard being used. These sats or UTXOs can be sold as normal Bitcoin on exchanges and can be consolidated to use as regular Bitcoin. Bitcoin fungibility is debatable, and the author is working on a coinjoin implementation to avoid censorship of post mix UTXOs on some exchanges. The author explains the parallel universe of Ordinals theory, where some users believe in it and try to learn how bitcoin works. Developers are interested in building things around Bitcoin and have tried to create BIP, DEX, look for libraries, ask questions, and projects implementing PSBT. The author admits to not living in a first-world country and not attending bitdevs but has always wanted Bitcoin to be accessible. They urge people to do what they want with Bitcoin without changing consensus rules as it will help Bitcoin. The message was sent using Proton Mail secure email.</summary>
