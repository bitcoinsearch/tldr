    <summary>In this email, Joost proposes an idea to make annex usage "opt-in" by requiring all inputs to commit to an annex to be relay-standard. Opting in would enable convenants through pre-signed transactions with atomic on-chain signature backup without needing to worry about non-annex multi-party protocols such as coinjoin and dual-funded lightning that may suffer from annex inflation or the last signer presenting an unexpected annex. However, the downside is that there would be an extra empty annex byte per input, which for some could be a reasonable trade-off.Joost then asks whether it would still be necessary to restrict the annex to a maximum size. He suggests that not opting into annex for multi-party protocols may be sufficient, or #24007 may be helpful.</summary>
