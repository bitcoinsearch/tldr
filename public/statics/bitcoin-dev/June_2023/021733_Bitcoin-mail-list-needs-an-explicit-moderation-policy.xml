    <title>Bitcoin mail list needs an explicit moderation policy</title>

    <summary>In a recent post to the bitcoin-dev mail list, Maxim Orlovsky expressed concern over the lack of clear moderation policies and potential censorship on the list. Orlovsky had submitted a post regarding a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol that had received broad community support but was not published on the list. This prompted Orlovsky to propose several suggestions, including the creation of a dedicated mail list for non-censored submissions, the implementation of clear moderation policies, and the replacement of the current moderator, Bryan Bishop. Orlovsky provided evidence of Bishop's abuse of power and personal biases in moderating the list. Orlovsky also noted his contributions to the bitcoin community and the support he received from known community members. The post includes links to Orlovsky's previous work and supporting tweets. Annex A provides a Twitter conversation with Bishop, highlighting the lack of clear policies on the list. Orlovsky proposes that the role of the moderator(s) should be purely executive of the policies without any personal preferences, and the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.</summary>
