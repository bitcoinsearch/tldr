    <summary>In an email conversation, David A. Harding and Joost Jager discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different bitcoin vault protocols. They talked about the on-chain footprint of presigned transactions versus using the annex, and how presigned transactions might be more efficient and private. They also discussed the timeline for witness replacement to become effective and the need for alternative ways to relay transactions to miners besides the p2p network. The possibility of an alternative relay network naively implementing annex relay was brought up, which could lead to miners receiving transactions with a large annex that reduced the transaction's feerate. Various proposals were suggested to address this issue, but it was ultimately concluded that any auxiliary system required for operating a vault adds risk.</summary>
