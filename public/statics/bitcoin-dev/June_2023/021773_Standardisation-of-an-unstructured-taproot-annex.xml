    <summary>In this email conversation, Greg and Joost discuss the potential for improving bitcoin custody using annex-vaults. Joost suggests a policy that would enable annex-vaults but still remain in line with work that has already been done. This includes an opt-in annex, Tlv format as defined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1381, only allowing tlv record 0 - unstructured data, and limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes to protect opt-in users. However, they encounter a problem with the limit of 126 bytes in https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/22 not being sufficient for these types of vaults. They consider whether any practical objections remain to making the annex standard under the conditions listed above.</summary>
