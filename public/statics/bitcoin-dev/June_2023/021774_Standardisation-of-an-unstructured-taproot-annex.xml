    <summary>Antoine Riard raised a question about requiring every input to commit to an annex even if it is empty in the context of Taproot support on the Lightning side. This would be a mandatory upgrade for Lightning nodes, as failure to do so would break propagations of their `option_taproot` channel transactions. Greg Sanders requested a citation for this information and expressed his opinion that protocols should not be built on undeveloped upgrade hooks. Antoine also mentioned another approach where the maximum size/weight of the witness/transaction is introduced as a TLV record itself. This approach is implemented in a branch that also implements the "only allow tlv record 0" with the TLV format from BIP #1381. Greg agreed that this approach seems reasonable and can be further relaxed in the future using max tx size policy "hints" in an annex field. Joost Jager suggested a set of policies that would enable annex-vaults and protect opt-in users, including an opt-in annex, Tlv format, only allowing tlv record 0, and limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes. However, he noted that the current limit of 126 bytes proposed in a pull request isn't sufficient for these types of vaults. He asked if there were any practical objections to making the annex standard under the specified conditions.</summary>
