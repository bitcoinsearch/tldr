    <summary>In this email exchange, Greg is discussing the potential for policy to provide a false sense of security in crafting reliable systems for people to pay miners. Despite potential risks, it is important to enable current users of the p2p network to make reasonable fee rate transactions in coinjoin-like scenarios and allow for as many use cases as possible to pay miners. Joost proposes making annex usage "opt-in" to protect opt-in users and enable covenants through presigned txes without worrying about non-annex multi-party protocols. However, the downside is an extra empty annex byte per input if there are other inputs involved. It is also discussed whether or not it would still be necessary to restrict the annex to a maximum size. #24007 may be helpful in determining a constant, but it is hard to pick one usually.</summary>
