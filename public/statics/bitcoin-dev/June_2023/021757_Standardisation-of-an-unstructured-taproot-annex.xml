    <summary>In an email exchange between Antoine and Joost, they discussed the benefits of using a '0' as free-form for taproot annex design. From a taproot annex perspective, this could be valuable for unstructured data use-cases, allowing annex tags to combine multiple types of unstructured data in a single annex payload. However, smaller bits of unstructured data may not afford the overhead, and it is suggested to move this traffic towards some L2 systems. The default of adding a version byte for the usage of unstructured data comes with the downside of having future consensus enabled use-cases encumbered by the extended witness economic cost.Joost proposes that any annex beginning with '0' should be defined as free-form without additional constraints, as this would offer immediate utilization for developers to make use of the taproot annex for a variety of applications without delay. This approach also keeps options open for future developments and structure improvements, ensuring that the structure is not set in stone prematurely. It is believed that this strategy will yield substantial benefits in both the short and long term, including future flexibility and chainspace efficiency. The conversations around standardization seem to be leaning towards the adoption of a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format, but settling on an exact format may require a significant amount of time.</summary>
