    <summary>The author of a post on a forum is seeking clarification about the statement that "APO can emulate CTV". They note that, according to the specs and inquisition codebase, BIP-118 ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT can constrain outputs of a spending transaction by hardcoding a signature and an unknown public key type in a script, while BIP-119 CTV can directly constrain transaction outputs to a template hash. However, they point out that APO/AS SIGHASH does not commit to the number of inputs or other input outpoints, which could have consequences for Ark's ATLCs. Depending on how contracts are constructed, users or ASP could potentially steal funds. The author asks for insight from developers who are more knowledgeable about covenant research.</summary>
