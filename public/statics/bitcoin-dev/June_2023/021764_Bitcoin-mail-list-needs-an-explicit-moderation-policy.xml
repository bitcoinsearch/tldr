    <title>Bitcoin mail list needs an explicit moderation policy</title>

    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to bitcoin-dev and other projects, wrote an email to the bitcoin-dev mail list about censorship concerns. In the email, he proposed clear peer-review policies and replacing current moderator Bryan Bishop with someone who would be selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria "least votes against." He also suggested creating a dedicated mail list that would publish all submissions without moderation and would be read only by people interested in auditing the bitcoin-dev main mail list's non-censorship. The proposed incentive for moderators was based on reputation, and their role would be purely executive of the policies, without any personal preferences. Dr. Orlovsky provided links to his previous contributions to the community and showed Twitter conversations highlighting the lack of explicit moderation policies and the abuse of power by the current moderator. He referred to the rejection of his post as an example of censorship and implied that it was due to personal likes or dislikes of the moderator rather than content quality.</summary>
