    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky has expressed his concern over the lack of clear moderation policies and potential censorship on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He proposed several suggestions, including the establishment of clear moderation policies, a dedicated mail list for non-censored submissions, and the replacement of the current moderator, Bryan Bishop. Orlovsky provided evidence of Bishop's abuse of power and personal biases in moderating the list. He also suggested that the role of the moderator(s) should be purely executive of the policies without any personal preferences and that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. Orlovsky cited an incident where his post was not published even though it had already received broad reactions across the bitcoin community, leading him to question whether the post ever got to Bishop. The conversation over Twitter highlighted the need for explicit moderation or peer-review policies that must be applied on a non-selective basis. If a non-spam email is censored, people interested in auditing bitcoin-dev main mail list non-censorship will notice it and announce it publicly. In such cases, the failing moderator(s) should be removed and replaced.Bishop responded by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggesting that Orlovsky's complaint may be about moderation queue latency and delay rather than personal bias. He also notes that he recently asked Orlovsky to stop tagging him on quantum woo, which may have caused some tension between them. Overall, the email exchange highlights the need for clear moderation policies and unbiased enforcement to ensure that the mailing list remains an effective platform for discussion among developers.</summary>
