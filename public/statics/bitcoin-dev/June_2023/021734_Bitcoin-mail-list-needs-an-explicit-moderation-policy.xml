    <title>Bitcoin mail list needs an explicit moderation policy</title>

    <summary>In this email exchange, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky alleges that the bitcoin-dev mailing list lacks clear explicit moderation policies and that the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, abused his powers to achieve personal agendas. Orlovsky also includes tweets in Annex A which highlight his frustration with the moderation process and how it is affecting the publication of his posts on the mailing list. Bishop responds by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggests that Orlovsky's complaint may be about moderation queue latency and delay rather than personal bias. He also notes that he recently asked Orlovsky to stop tagging him on quantum woo, which may have caused some tension between them. Overall, the email exchange highlights the need for clear moderation policies and unbiased enforcement to ensure that the mailing list remains an effective platform for discussion among developers.</summary>
