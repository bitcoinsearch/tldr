    <summary>The LNP/BP Standards Association has proposed a new layer 1 upgrade for the Bitcoin protocol called Prime. The upgrade will move most validation work into the client-side validation system, leaving Bitcoin as money and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem intact. It doesn't require any consensus or majority for initial deployment and can be deployed without a softfork and miners upgrade. The proposal makes Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant and ensures that proper assets, NFTs, etc. are done with RGB smart contracts. However, there have been criticisms regarding the design of the timestamping service, which isn't detailed enough to understand what the timestamping service is exactly. Additionally, the section about proofs claims that "Each network user tracks all new PMTs," which does not scale, contradicting the scalability claims. To address this scalability problem, the creators of those merkle trees need to collaborate together in the creation of them to call the solution scalable. There is also a serious data availability problem with the proposal because being unable to access the publication data - even for a single step means you are unable to close the seal. To address these issues, Maxim Orlovsky, the author of the proposal, suggests that interested parties read two papers in detail: https://petertodd.org/2017/scalable-single-use-seal-asset-transfer and https://petertodd.org/2014/tree-chains-preliminary-summary. He also agrees to extend explanations in the paper in the places where the exact mechanism of how the problems mentioned by Peter are addressed.In response to John Tromp's question about Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) anchoring, Maxim Orlovsky referred to their paper and specifically the second paragraph of the "Bitcoin PoW Anchoring" section. The paragraph explains that if a party spends current miner single-use-seal without creating a commitment or committing to a header without sufficient PoW, then any party can create a special bitcoin transaction providing publically-identifiable OP_RETURN information about a new miner single-use-seal (protocol reset). However, only the first OP_RETURN announcement which is closed with a proper procedure is considered valid under the consensus rules. John had also asked what would happen if a miner spends the current miner single-use-seal while creating a commitment but makes the Payment Transaction (PMT) only partially available or entirely unavailable. Additionally, he wanted to know how other miners would reach consensus on whether a protocol reset is required since it seems impossible to agree on something like PMT availability (much like mempool contents).Finally, Maxim Orlovsky announced in a Bitcoin mailing list that LNP/BP Standards Association has released the RGB smart contract system, referencing that the introduction of client-side validation has the potential for upgrading the Bitcoin layer 1 - blockchain, which is limiting the Bitcoin ecosystem by creating both scaling and privacy problems. The organization has presented Prime, a proposal to upgrade Bitcoin protocol with a new scalable (up to billions of tx per minute) and completely anonymous (opaque) layer 1, moving most validation work into the client-side validation system. This proposal would leave BTC (Bitcoin as money) and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem intact and may be deployed without a softfork and miners upgrade. It doesn't affect those users who are not willing to upgrade and doesn't require any consensus or majority for the initial deployment. It also makes Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant.</summary>
