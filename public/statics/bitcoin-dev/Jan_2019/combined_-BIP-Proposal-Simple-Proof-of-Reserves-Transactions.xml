    <summary>The Bitcoin-developer mailing list recently discussed a proposed proof format that provides a standard way of combining multiple proofs and associated metadata. The format is specified in the Protocol Buffers format, designed to make proofs easily verifiable even after some of the UTXOs used in the proof are no longer unspent. However, one participant raised concerns about the content of the format, noting that it may hinder adoption due to previous controversy surrounding its use in BIP70. Another participant suggested the addition of a merkle proof to the format as it lacks sufficient information. It was also noted that although an invalid transaction cannot be proven by nodes, if sent, they will likely cache the "transaction," taking up memory.A draft of a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been created, outlining a proposal for constructing proof-of-reserves transactions. The BIP provides a standard format for the construction of proofs, allowing general proof-verification software to be created and easing integration with existing wallet infrastructure. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a way for companies managing large amounts of Bitcoin to prove ownership over their funds to prevent significant loss without disclosing events to the public. The proof format is designed to be flexible and easy to use with existing systems, formatted as regular Bitcoin transactions but with slight adaptations.The proposal also includes a file format for packaging multiple proofs and relevant metadata using Protocol Buffers. An extension to BIP 174 PSBT format is proposed to help signing devices recognize proof-of-reserve transactions. A proof-of-concept implementation of the PSBT extension can be found in the rust-bitcoin project, and a work-in-progress implementation for producing and verifying proofs in the described format is also available.</summary>
