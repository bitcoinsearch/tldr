    <summary>A developer named Matt Bell has shared his design for Bitcoin sidechains using the Tendermint BFT consensus protocol, which is similar to Blockstream's Liquid sidechain. He is seeking feedback on the design, which can be found in a GitHub repository along with a simplified implementation of the sidechain design. One area of discussion is the source of voting power for the sidechain network, with potential solutions including timelocked Bitcoin and UTXOs on the Bitcoin blockchain. ZmnSCPxj suggests using fixed R values to prevent multiple signatures and also proposes the idea of mainstake, where UTXOs on the Bitcoin blockchain are used as the source of stake for voting power.</summary>
