    <summary>In a recent conversation, it was suggested that the B2EP and similar proposals do not need to worry about UIH2. UIH2 refers to a scenario where one input is larger than any output, meaning there exists an input for all outputs where input is greater than output. To avoid this, the proposal suggests ensuring that for all inputs, there exists an output where input is less than or equal to output. The BIP proposes that the receiver adds one of their own inputs, known as the "contributed input," and increases the output that pays themselves by the contributed input amount. It is essential to ensure that the original transaction avoids UIH2, meaning for all inputs, there exists an output where input is less than or equal to output.</summary>
