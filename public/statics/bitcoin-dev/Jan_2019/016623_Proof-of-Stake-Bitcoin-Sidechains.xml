    <summary>In a message posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on January 24, 2019, ZmnSCPxj discussed the potential for a revealed private key for time locked funds to create a race to spend. The idea is that miners paying attention would have an advantage in such a scenario, but it would still be a race. ZmnSCPxj suggests that if Bitcoin had implemented RBF (Replace-by-Fee) properly, these races could be won by bidding up the fees. It's worth noting that CSV (Check Sequence Verify) transactions are always RBF because CSV disables the opt-out.</summary>
