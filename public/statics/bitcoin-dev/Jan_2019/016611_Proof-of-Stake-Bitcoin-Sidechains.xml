    <summary>Matt Bell has been working on a design for Bitcoin sidechains using the Tendermint BFT consensus protocol, which is commonly used to build proof-of-stake networks. The design ends up being very similar to Blockstream's Liquid sidechain, since Tendermint consensus is not far off from Liquid's "strong federation" consensus. He has requested feedback about improvements or critical flaws. The design document and a simplified implementation of this sidechain design can be found on his GitHub repo.</summary>
