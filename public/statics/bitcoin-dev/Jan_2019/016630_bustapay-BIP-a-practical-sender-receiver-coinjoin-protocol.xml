    <summary>In the given context, someone is questioning the need for the template transaction to be signed in step one and passed back and forth multiple times. However, it is clarified that the transaction is not passed back and forth multiple times. The process works exactly as proposed but with one difference - in step one, the sender uses a signed transaction instead of an unsigned one. This serves as an important anti-DoS/anti-spy tactic to prove that the sender owns the inputs and if the protocol is not followed to completion, the transaction can be dumped on the network.</summary>
