    <summary>ZmnSCPxj suggested a punishment for double signing by requiring that R be a trivial function on the blockheight of the block being signed on the sidechain network. Discrete Log Contracts use a similar idea to prevent Oracles from signing multiple values at a particular time. Matt Bell's design for Bitcoin sidechains uses the Tendermint BFT consensus protocol, which is commonly used to build proof-of-stake networks. The design ends up being very similar to Blockstream's Liquid sidechain as Tendermint consensus is not far off from Liquid's "strong federation" consensus. The source of stake in their current thinking is to pay out stake to Bitcoin merged-miners although they are considering timelocked Bitcoin as stake. ZmnSCPxj proposed an idea called "mainstake" where stakes used to weigh voting power are UTXOs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The same script proposed for the sidechain network can be used for mainstake.</summary>
