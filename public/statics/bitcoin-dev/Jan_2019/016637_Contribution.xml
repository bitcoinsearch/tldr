    <summary>The person who submitted the context is an employee of lbry.io, and they are interested in discussing a potential contribution to Bitcoin's core. Specifically, they're curious about what the Bitcoin development team thinks of implementing base_blob and/or base_uint derived from std::array, which would enable move semantics. They also mention some concerns with acquiring/releasing recursive mutex in a loop, as seen in minig.cpp. The code snippet shows a loop that creates a new block and then processes it.</summary>
