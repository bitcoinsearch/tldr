    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a potential mechanism was proposed to prevent multiple signatures using fixed R values. The idea is to derive R using standard hierarchical derivation and require that the staking pubkey be revealed to the sidechain network as actually being staking_pubkey = P + hash(P || parent_R) * G. To sign for a blockheight h, the public key P and the specific R derived from hierarchical derivation from parent_R and the blockheight as index must be used. Satoshin expressed support for this approach, but asked if there were any downsides and how much it adds to the blockweight. Anonymouse also commented on the proposal. The discussion took place on January 22, 2019.</summary>
