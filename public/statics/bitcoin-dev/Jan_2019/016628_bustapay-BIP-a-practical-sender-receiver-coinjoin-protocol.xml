    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of a payment protocol called Bustapay. The main concern is whether it is suitable for integration into BtcPayServer, given that it lacks its own wallet and requires an additional hot wallet for transactions. There is also discussion on the possibility of adding backwards-compatible versioning in the future and the importance of explicit transaction details like version and locktime. The conversation also touches on the issue of wallets violating certain standards and the need for uniformity in bitcoin transactions. While some concerns are raised, the conversation ends with a willingness to consider alternatives if they offer better solutions.</summary>
