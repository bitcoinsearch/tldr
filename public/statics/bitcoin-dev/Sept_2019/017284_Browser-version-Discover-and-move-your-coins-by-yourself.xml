    <summary>Aymeric Vitte has announced the release of Phase 3 of bitcoin-transactions, financed by NLnet via EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Search and Discovery call. The new release includes several features such as creating transactions, decoding transactions, verifying transactions, converting and mapping addresses including bech32, creating and mapping wallets, and checking wallet recovery. Other features include decoding and creating multisig redeem scripts, pubkey/privkey mapping, conversion and formats, and signing/verifying messages. The browser version is now released and available at https://peersm.com/wallet. The aim of the project is to provide tools for anyone to discover and manage their coins, making transactions independently without having to sync a full node or as an alternative to wallets. The code is open source, provided under a MIT license and available on GitHub. Aymeric Vitte welcomes comments and suggestions on the project.</summary>
