    <summary>In a discussion about the "magic shrinking blockchain" property in implementing relative locktimes, it was noted that this property never applied to kernels. To validate the current UTXO set, all the kernels need to be validated, and each kernel is a Pedersen commitment to zero along with a Schnorr signature using said commitment as public key. It was suggested that the signatures and the Pedersen-commitment-to-0 could all be aggregated into a single signature and Pedersen-commitment-to-0 if we were to use Schnorr-like signatures. It was also mentioned that neither the technique of sinking signatures nor partial aggregation of the signatures that attest to absolute-locktime kernels seems possible with relative locktime kernels. The Grin "Elder channel" design was discussed as being similar in spirit to eltoo, but offering some bandwidth savings compared to the Poon-Dryja design.</summary>
