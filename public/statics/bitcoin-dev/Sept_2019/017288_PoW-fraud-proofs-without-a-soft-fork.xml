    <summary>The lack of commitment in blockchain does not impact security, only bandwidth. In sybil attack, a fullnode will stall and think the blockchain has no more miners while an SPV will follow the false blockchain. Automated payment processing systems using fullnode will refuse to acknowledge incoming payments, leading to noisy complaints from clients but warning the automated payment processor about the possibility of the attack. A timeout can be used to warn higher-layer management systems. Payment processing systems using an SPV with PoW fraud proofs will still see incoming payments but are vulnerable to attack where the automated system is sybilled and false payments are given on the attack chain.</summary>
