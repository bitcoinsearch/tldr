    <summary>The Block Batch Filters draft has been improved and the ability to filter unconfirmed transactions for SPV nodes has been unlocked with the use of BIP 157 instead of BIP 37, which had privacy leaks. Light clients who refused to use BIP 37 can now process unconfirmed transactions by loading the entire mempool transaction flow through this method. Meanwhile, the Mempool Transaction Filters draft proposes a future consensus layer soft-fork to make block filters commitment one of the block validation rules to protect light nodes from payment hiding attacks. This new method also reduces more bandwidth consumption compared to block filters and downloading full blocks for affected addresses.</summary>
