    <title>Taproot proposal</title>

    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Pieter Wuille has expressed his leaning towards not allowing P2SH wrapped Taproot. The reason being that Taproot's main benefit is better privacy and homogeneity, but supporting both P2SH-wrapped and non-wrapped SegWit v1 addresses could increase the number of places where a user may be characterized and identified. Despite Segwit being designed to support both, disallowing P2SH would require only slightly more complex validation code. As such, Wuille believes that keeping P2SH support would increase the number of combinations software needs to test, which may not be necessary given the progress made in bech32 adoption in the past year.</summary>
