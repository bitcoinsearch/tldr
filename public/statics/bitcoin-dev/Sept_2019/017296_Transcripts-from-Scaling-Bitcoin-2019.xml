    <summary>The Scaling Bitcoin 2019 Tel Aviv conference provided a wealth of information for bitcoin developers, with transcripts available for all talks. The training materials covered foundation topics, developing Bitcoin Core and Lightning network. Upgrades were also discussed, including LN payment networks and hubs, private information retrieval methods, and more privacy. The conference covered various upgrades, including accumulators, Taproot, Eray, elastic block caps, and plasma cash. Additionally, the conference discussed proof-of-necessary-work, threshold-scriptless-scripts, and zero-knowledge proofs towards trustless SNARKs. Private information retrieval methods were explored for lightweight clients, while ZeroLink Sudoku and TxProbe were used for more privacy. Overall, the Scaling Bitcoin conference was informative and beneficial for anyone interested in bitcoin development.</summary>
