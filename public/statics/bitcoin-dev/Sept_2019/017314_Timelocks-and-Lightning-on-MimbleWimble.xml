    <summary>In a discussion about the "magic shrinking blockchain" property in implementing relative locktimes, it was noted that this property did not apply to kernels. To validate the current UTXO set, all kernels must be validated, which is the same check applied to individual transactions. The design of Beam was identified as a straightforward port of Poon-Dryja and the Grin "Elder channel" design similar in spirit to eltoo. Lack of scripts is not a significant handicap for MW as multi-sig, atomic swaps, and payment channels are all possible.</summary>
