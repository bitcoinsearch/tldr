    <title>Draft BIP for SNICKER</title>

    <summary>A link to a draft of a BIP for a different type of CoinJoin called "SNICKER" has been shared. The purpose of writing this as a BIP is that it is not a difficult task for a wallet developer to implement and would only have value if wallet developers implemented it. It requires ECDH and ECIES, which are already available in libsecp256k1. There is uncertainty on the specifications, particularly for transactions and encryption specifications. The author went with the exact algorithm used by Electrum, but it could be considered dubious. Feedback on the draft is requested.</summary>
