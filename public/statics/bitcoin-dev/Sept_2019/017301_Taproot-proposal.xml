    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing the implementation of Taproot, a soft fork proposal that would make all outputs and cooperative spends indistinguishable from each other, improving privacy and homogeneity. The proposal includes several ideas such as Merkle branches to hide the unexecuted branches in scripts, Schnorr signatures to enable key aggregation/thresholds within one input, improvements to the signature hashing algorithm, and more. While many ideas have not been incorporated, an initial reference implementation of the consensus changes, plus preliminary construction/signing tests in the Python framework can be found on Github. Regarding P2SH-nested Taproot, some members prefer not to support it, as most services now support sending to native SegWit addresses and this would increase the number of places that a user may be characterized and potentially identified. However, there are four options for how to set the y signs for P and Q, and using (3) or (4) would reduce the size of a Taproot output by one byte to be the same size as a P2WSH output. Some users do not agree with this reasoning but still come to the conclusion of no P2SH-wrapped SegWit v1.</summary>
