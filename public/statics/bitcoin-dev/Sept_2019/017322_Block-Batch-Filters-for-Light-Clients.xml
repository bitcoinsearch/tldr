    <summary>The latest update to the draft for the BIP block batch filters can be found on the Bitaps Github page. The updated version includes changes such as a return to Golomb coding and a simpler, more effective schema implementation. Additionally, the total filter size is smaller than that of BIP 158, with estimated savings of over 20%. The filter is deterministic and could potentially be committed as a commitment in coinbase transactions in the future. The GCS parameters are flexible to maintain necessary FPS, and the filter has been split into two parts - unique elements and duplicated elements - with the latter being encoded more effectively.However, there are still open questions surrounding the optimal range for batch, why SIP hash is needed instead of just using the first 64 bits from pub key/script hash, and whether unique/duplicated elements should be downloaded separately or if filter types should be added for these purposes. Aleksey Karpov welcomes any feedback or discussions on these topics.</summary>
