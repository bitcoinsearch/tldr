    <summary>Aymeric Vitte has announced the release of Phase 3 of bitcoin-transactions, which has been financed by NLnet through EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Search and Discovery call. The new version includes several features such as creating transactions, decoding transactions, verifying transactions, converting and mapping addresses including bech32, creating and mapping wallets, and checking wallet recovery. Additionally, it also includes decoding and creating multisig redeem scripts, pubkey/privkey mapping, conversion and formats, and signing/verifying messages. The browser version of the new release is now available at https://peersm.com/wallet. The main objective of this project is to provide tools for anyone to manage their coins and make transactions independently without having to sync a full node or use wallets. The code is open source and provided under a MIT license which is available on GitHub. Aymeric Vitte invites comments and suggestions on the project.</summary>
