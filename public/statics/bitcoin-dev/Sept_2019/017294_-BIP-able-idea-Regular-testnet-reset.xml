    <title>[BIP-able idea] Regular testnet reset</title>

    <summary>Emil Engler is considering writing a BIP about resetting the testnet on regular/scheduled basis. The idea involves using every 210,000 block as the genesis of a completely new chain and forgetting the old one, making it impossible for any chain to be longer than 210,000 blocks. However, there are issues with implementing this idea, such as how to get it working with testnet3, which may require a hardfork, and whether it would be easy to change the chain while Bitcoin Core is running. Additionally, there may be concerns about planned attacks causing the chain to derive into multiple ones at every reset. Emil is seeking feedback on the idea.</summary>
