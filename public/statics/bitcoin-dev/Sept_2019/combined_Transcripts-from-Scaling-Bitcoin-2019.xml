    <summary>The Scaling Bitcoin 2019 Tel Aviv conference provided a wealth of information for bitcoin developers. The training materials covered foundation topics, developing Bitcoin Core and Lightning network. Upgrades were also discussed, including LN payment networks and hubs, private information retrieval methods, and more privacy. The conference covered various upgrades, including accumulators, Taproot, Eray, elastic block caps, and plasma cash. Additionally, the conference discussed proof-of-necessary-work, threshold-scriptless-scripts, and zero-knowledge proofs towards trustless SNARKs. Private information retrieval methods were explored for lightweight clients, while ZeroLink Sudoku and TxProbe were used for more privacy.In an email sent to Bryan Bishop, ZmnSCPxj expressed gratitude for the transcripts of talks from Scaling Bitcoin 2019 Tel Aviv. The training materials for bitcoin developers consist of Foundation topics, Developing Bitcoin Core, Lightning network, Upgrades and more privacy. The Foundation topics include discussions on bitcoin data structures, blockchain design patterns, hardware wallet design best practices, privacy concepts, etc. In Developing Bitcoin Core, developers learn about bitcoin core functional test framework, debugging bitcoin, rebroadcasting, signet, wallet architecture, libbitcoin, etc. Under Lightning Network, they learn about routing, sphinx and onion routing, topology, etc. Upgrades include accumulators, Taproot, BIP-securethebag, erlay, secure-fountain-architecture, elastic-block-caps, plasma cash, prism, proof-of-necessary-work, etc. Discussions also centered around threshold scriptless scripts, scriptless lotteries, survey of progress in zero-knowledge proofs towards trustless snarks, zkvm, bitml, private information retrieval methods for lightweight clients, scaling oblivious read-write, zerolink-sudoku, txprobe, atomic multi-channel updates, payment channel recovery with seeds, anonymous atomic locks, etc.Overall, the Scaling Bitcoin conference was informative and beneficial for anyone interested in bitcoin development.</summary>
