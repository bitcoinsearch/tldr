    <summary>The email discusses the idea of a "Bitcoin Classified Ads Network" that embeds a commitment to an advertisement in ordinary P2PKH UTXOs (or P2WPKH equivalents). The secondary network transmits the actual advertisements and the UTXOs used to commit to them. This makes advertising costly while reducing impact on Bitcoin blockchain space. Changing the advertisement is possible, but it requires paying for a transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain. The intermediate addresses used before reclamation by the advertiser are valuable as they also serve as commitments to advertisements, attesting to the validity of the advertisement and making spam have a cost. Providers would want to increase their "marketing budget" to be less likely to be evicted from nodes of the Bitcoin Classified Ads Network, which increases the minimum practical lockup-rate needed to spam the network, thus making spam costly. The email concludes by saying that generalized covenants are not needed if transfers of coin require paying to the issuer/lender of the coin.</summary>
