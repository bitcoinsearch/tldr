    <summary>In a message to Eric on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj presents a new use case for UTXOs. The use case involves a "Bitcoin Classified Ads Network" where advertisements are backed by an unspent TXO. In order to limit resource consumption, nodes will preferentially keep advertisements with higher UTXO values divided by advertisement size and drop those with too low UTXO value divided by advertisement size. This would force spammers to either rent larger UTXO values or resort to pre-Bitcoin spamming methods. ZmnSCPxj believes this use-case is viable and does not devolve to simply burning a 1-satoshi output. While he doesn't support generalized covenants, he thinks "renting a UTXO of substantial value" is a sound concept.</summary>
