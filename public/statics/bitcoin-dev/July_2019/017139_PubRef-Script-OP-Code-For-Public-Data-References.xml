    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential adoption of a new script version, which could introduce an incentive for users to reuse addresses. This is problematic for privacy and fungibility, as currently there is no incentive in the protocol to do so. The proposal introduces a way to reduce on-chain footprint and potentially reduce transaction costs, but there are concerns about increased validation costs and growing unprunable data. Additionally, other methods/proposals are suggested, such as batching, lightning, MAST, Schnorr signatures, and taproot/graftroot. The conversation also touches on the potential size savings and a hypothetical deduplication at the p2p layer.</summary>
