    <summary>A discussion was held on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding giving scripts the ability to refer to data on the blockchain. Mike Brooks suggested that this would reduce transaction sizes and enable miners to fit more transactions into new blocks. However, William Casarin pointed out that this would incentivize address re-use which would be bad for fungibility. Additionally, Pieter Wuille added that block validation does not require access to the whole historical chain and a change like this would massively increase storage requirements for validation.</summary>
