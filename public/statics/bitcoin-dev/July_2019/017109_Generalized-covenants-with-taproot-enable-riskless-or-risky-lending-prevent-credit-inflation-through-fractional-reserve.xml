    <summary>The email conversation between Tamas Blummer, Eric Voskuil and ZmnSCPxj discusses the use of unspentness-time of a UTXO to allow someone advertising a service or producer to "close up shop" by simply spending the advertising UTXO. This permits some time-based hedging for the merchant. Tamas suggests separating the owner lockup until maturity from the one using the advertisement service. However, Eric argues that he has seen no proposal requiring identity in the two roles, which is necessary to show that two distinct individuals operate in the roles. Furthermore, even identity would be insufficient, as two individuals can clearly collude in these roles. They also discuss the utility of temporary control of an UTXO and how it could keep track of, and thereby make scarce, arbitrary other things. However, Eric believes that the use of a covenant breaks the transferability of ownership, making it impossible to work for any perpetual asset. The current owner of a regular UTXO will want to be paid for temporarily giving up control, and that payment represents interest.</summary>
