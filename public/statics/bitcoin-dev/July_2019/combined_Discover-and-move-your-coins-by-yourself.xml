    <summary>Ayms has created a Github repository called Bitcoin Transactions by merging former bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets nodejs modules with additional features to be implemented as described in the README. The project is financed by NLnet via EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Search and Discovery call, making it open source and provided under a MIT license. Its aim is to provide tools for anyone to discover and manage their coins, as well as making transactions without having to sync a full node or as an alternative to wallets when people do not understand where their coins are.The project will provide a secure standalone offline js webapp inside browsers like https://peersm.com/wallet, but the app does not reflect the current state of the nodejs repo. The tool is somewhere bitcoin-cli outside of bitcoin core, more comfortable to use and not restricted to its wallet, available for any bitcoin-based coins. According to the developers, the project is not a remake of iancoleman's tool, but some features overlap. They will also extend all of this inside one tool with no limitations. Comments and suggestions are welcome, and the developers believe that the project will help everyone to discover and manage their coins, as well as making transactions by themselves. In conclusion, Ayms's Bitcoin Transactions project is a merge of former bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets nodejs modules with additional features to be implemented in the future. The goal of the project is to make it easy for people to manage their coins and make transactions without needing a full node or understanding where their coins are.</summary>
