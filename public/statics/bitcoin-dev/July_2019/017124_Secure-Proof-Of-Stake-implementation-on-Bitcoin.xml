    <summary>The consensus algorithm in proof-of-stake is vulnerable to stake-grinding attacks, which occur when the selection of a single staker for each block is based on hashing previous headers. The single staker can grind the R of some signature of a transaction from itself to itself, which will change the hash of the current block and subsequently the hash used in selecting the next single staker. This allows the staker to continuously become the next staker for each block and impose censorship on the network. Stake-grinding attacks can be easily hidden by the staker running multiple masternodes. Proof-of-work has openly admitted this vulnerability, and Bitcoin cannot support any type of proof-of-stake that is susceptible to this attack.</summary>
