    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andreas Schildbach brought up concerns about the use of a hardcoded filter in the Bitcoin protocol. He mentioned that this filter could encourage or enforce address re-use because the server decides on the filter, including the false positive rate. Wallets with many addresses may find the hardcoded filter too blurry, resulting in each block being matched. This means that wallets following the "one address per incoming payment" pattern, such as HD wallets, might be forced to wrap their key chains back to the beginning. However, another member of the mailing list pointed out that the false positive rate on the filter was chosen assuming a wallet would average a certain number of addresses, which is typically the case for HD wallets. Therefore, Schildbach's criticism might only be valid for wallets that exceed the average number of addresses.</summary>
