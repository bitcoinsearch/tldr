    <title>Bitcoin Core to disable Bloom-based Filtering by default</title>

    <summary>During a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andreas Schildbach expressed concern over the upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.19 release's plan to disable the NODE_BLOOM functionality by default. It was stated that over 10 million wallets depend on NODE_BLOOM for updates and it would cause a significant lack of availability if an alternative solution is not found. However, Electrum has a JSON-based protocol which provides information more efficiently and can be used as an alternative with nodes running additional software or indexes. Despite this, only 42% of listening nodes are currently using version 0.18, so it is expected that many users will not update immediately. Although the bloom feature will be disabled by default in Knots, developers will have enough time to implement, test and roll out an alternative solution before its complete removal.</summary>
