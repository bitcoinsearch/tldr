    <summary>The email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Eric Voskuil discusses the concept of using unspentness-time of a UTXO for advertising services or producers. This allows for time-based hedging for merchants who can recover locked funds by simply spending the advertising UTXO once the stock has been sold. The proposal separates the owner of the funds from the one using the advertisement service, allowing dynamic maturity for them. Burning is considered unsustainable as usage of services is unlimited while coin supply is limited. The covenant achieves the separation temporarily by forgoing the UTXO's use as money and allowing its temporary use to keep track of something else. The current owner of a regular UTXO will want to be paid for temporarily giving up control, and that payment represents interest.</summary>
