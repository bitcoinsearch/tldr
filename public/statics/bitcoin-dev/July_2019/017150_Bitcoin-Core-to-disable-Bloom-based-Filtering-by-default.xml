    <summary>In a message to bitcoin-dev on July 20, 2019, Matt Corallo expressed concern about the increasing popularity of less trustful and privacy-violating alternatives to Bitcoin. However, Corallo also pointed out that mitigations for these issues have been presented in a paper that has not seen much exploration. The paper, available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/763.pdf, discusses ways to address privacy concerns related to Bitcoin.Despite this, there have been moves towards custodial solutions, such as custodial Lightning Network (LN) and the L-BTC altcoin. In addition, there has been a recent push towards infrastructure for fully custodial accounts. The implication is that these developments may further erode privacy and trust in Bitcoin, contrary to Corallo's concerns.</summary>
