    <summary>In a recent email exchange, ZmnSCPxj argued that committing to the advertisement on the UTXO is similar to committing to a SCRIPT on a UTXO. He proposed the Graftroot idea, in which a public key is committed to on the UTXO and a SCRIPT signed by the public key is used to unlock the UTXO for spending. Using this analogy, he suggested committing a public key instead of the advertisement on the UTXO, thereby admitting advertisements on the advertising network using the advertiser pubkey. The advertiser would sign an "advertisement chain" consisting of a merklized singly-linked list of actual advertisements. However, Tamas Blummer pointed out that this approach puts the HODLer's funds at risk of the advertiser's misbehavior and does not achieve the trustless separation that the covenant achieves.</summary>
