    <summary>The github repository https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-transactions is a merge of former bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets nodejs modules with additional features to be implemented as described in the README. The project is financed by NLnet via EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Search and Discovery call, thus the initial dev fees have been removed and the code is now open source and provided in clear under a MIT license. The aim of the project is to provide all necessary tools for anyone to discover and manage their coins, as well as making transactions by themselves without having to sync a full node or as an alternative to wallets when people don't understand where their coins are. The project will provide a secure standalone offline js webapp inside browsers like https://peersm.com/wallet but the app does not reflect the current state of the nodejs repo.It is noted that the tool is somewhere bitcoin-cli outside of bitcoin core more easy to use and not restricted to its own wallet, available for any bitcoin based coins. The developers of this project believe that it's not a remake of iancoleman's tool but some features overlap, as well as for other existing tools, they will also extend all of this inside one tool with no limitations. Comments and suggestions are welcome. In conclusion,  Ayms created a github repository called Bitcoin Transactions which is a merge of former bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets nodejs modules with additional features to be implemented as described in the README. It is financed by NLnet via EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Search and Discovery call. The aim of the project is to provide all necessary tools for anyone to discover and manage their coins, as well as making transactions by themselves without having to sync a full node or as an alternative to wallets when people don't understand where their coins are.</summary>
