    <summary>In this context, the writer is responding to an individual named Eric who seems to have misunderstood a previous post. The post in question discusses the early recovery of UTXO and how it eliminates the time lock cost for the ad market. The advertisement is broadcasted to new nodes on the ad network if its backing UTXO remains unspent. Once the UTXO is spent, the advertisement is no longer valid and will be deleted by existing nodes. Therefore, the locked-ness of the UTXO is the lifetime of the advertisement. If the coins are disencumbered, whether they belong to the advertiser or are rented, then the advertisement is gone forever. Essentially, the advertisement exists only as long as the UTXO is unspent.</summary>
