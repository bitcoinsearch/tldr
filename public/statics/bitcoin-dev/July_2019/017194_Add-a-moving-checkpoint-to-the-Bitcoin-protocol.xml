    <summary>In a Bitcoin protocol discussion, Kenshiro proposed adding a "moving checkpoint" rule to the blockchain similar to that implemented in NXT coin. This rule would allow nodes to ignore any new block below nodeBlockHeight - N, making the blockchain immutable for blocks older than N. However, Alistair Mann raised concerns about how a state-sponsored netsplit lasting longer than N would be handled. Kenshiro responded by stating that such a scenario would be detected by the community well before reaching the reorg limit of N blocks (approximately 24 hours), allowing nodes to stop until the netsplit is fixed. In the unlikely event that no one notices the network split for more than N blocks and there are two permanent forks longer than N, nodes from one branch could delete their local history to join the other branch.</summary>
