    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev community, Mike Brooks, has proposed a feature that would allow scripts to reference data on the blockchain, reducing transaction sizes and allowing miners to fit more transactions into blocks. This feature would include pointers, which are currently missing from Bitcoin Script. However, another member of the community named Will warns that this could incentivize address re-use, which is discouraged due to its negative impact on fungibility.</summary>
