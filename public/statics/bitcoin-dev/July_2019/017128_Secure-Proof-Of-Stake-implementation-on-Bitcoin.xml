    <summary>The email thread discusses various aspects of Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation on Bitcoin and its potential weaknesses. It mentions network partitions and nodes being shut down as accidents of deployment that can disrupt consensus, and compares them to code accidents that can be minimized. The email also highlights the possibility of censorship attacks and their ability to steal funds from people. It proposes a way to detect repeated ignoring of transactions in PoS through public staking addresses and suggests burning the funds of an evil validator through a hard fork. However, it also notes that the ability to rent botnets means that even existing PoS coins might already be strongly controlled by a single entity. Finally, it briefly mentions Ethereum's upcoming PoS implementation with a different approach.</summary>
