    <title>PubRef - Script OP Code For Public Data References</title>

    <summary>The accuracy of the statement that PubRef is not susceptible to malleability attacks due to the immutability of blockchain is questioned as chain tips are not immutable and can be replaced. Data can only be referred to if buried under 100 blocks. There are other issues with PubRef such as encouragement of pubkey reuse which reduces privacy. The design of PubRef allows SCRIPT to access data in the transaction triggering its execution but cannot access data in past blocks or the block the transaction is in. An additional database containing every PUSHDATA in existence is necessary at every validator which existing pruning nodes would need to restart from genesis. The resolution of a PUBREF index to an intended value involves an O(1) array lookup with additional computational effort needed to build and maintain these indices.</summary>
