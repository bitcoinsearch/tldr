    <summary>In a recent email discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter suggested that node_bloom should not be end-of-life as it provides value. He noted that Andreas' Android Bitcoin wallet and BRD are significant users of node_bloom. Currently, privacy is a matter of individual choice in the Bitcoin protocol. Peter asked why people can't provide this network service if they want to. Peter believes that a large quantity of people following the Bitcoin headers based on longest weighted chain will provide network security. This can nullify potential miner-initiated hard forks, such as S2X. The Bitcoin-dev mailing list is a forum for developers to discuss issues related to Bitcoin development.</summary>
