    <summary>The discussion between Tamas Blummer and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the use of temporary control UTXOs for services that require it. Tamas argues that if there is a demand for such UTXOs, users will pay for it and cover the fees required by the service as well as the opportunity cost of temporary ownership paid to the original holder who gave up control. If the service is operated by an entity billing user, then it can use UTXOs of minimal value for its operation and ignore opportunity interest. However, if the service is a common good, a network without owner, then it could require temporary access to significant value UTXOs, thereby inducing opportunity cost to users. Alternatively, it could require burning ordinary UTXOs, which Tamas dislikes as it is unsustainable. Temporary access UTXOs with covenants could be used to build spam-limited public services that are not owned by an operator and financially benefit HODLers offering them riskless interest.</summary>
