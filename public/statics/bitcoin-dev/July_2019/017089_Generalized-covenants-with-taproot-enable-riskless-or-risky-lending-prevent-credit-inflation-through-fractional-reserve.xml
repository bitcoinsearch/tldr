    <summary>The value of the UTXO is significantly reduced due to its governance by the rules of a de-facto side chain with different rules. As a result, the value for those renting it from the advertiser is only that of the advertisement, which may not necessarily follow the opportunity cost. The covenant-supported temporary access is transitive, meaning that anyone in temporary control of a UTXO can recover its cost by sub-renting. The riskless interest provides a baseline of value on top of which there may be utility in the advertisement. In response to an argument about committing to advertisements on the UTXO, Tamas Blummer suggests committing to a public key instead and using this key to sign an "advertisement chain" consisting of merklized singly-linked lists with signed contents. However, ZmnSCPxj counters that this would put the funds of the HODLer at risk of the advertiser's misbehavior, effectively negating the trustless separation achieved by the covenant.</summary>
