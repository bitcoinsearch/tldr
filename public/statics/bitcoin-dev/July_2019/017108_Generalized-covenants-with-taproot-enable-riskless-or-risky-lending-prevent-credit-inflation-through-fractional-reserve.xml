    <summary>The email conversation between Eric Voskuil and ZmnSCPxj discusses the issue of encumbering UTXOs in a scenario where advertisements are broadcasted only to new nodes on an ad network if the backing UTXO remains unspent. ZmnSCPxj argues that early recovery of the UTXO entirely eliminates the value of the time lock cost to the ad market. Eric disagrees, stating that a UTXO that can be spent at any time is not encumbered. He also explains that constrained coins cannot be used as borrowed money nor the tracking of perpetual assets, and that using covenants in an irrational manner adds complexity without adding value. The email conversation ends with Tamas Blummer's response to Eric.</summary>
