    <summary>In an email conversation between Kenshiro and Oscar Lafarga, Kenshiro proposed a full change to Proof of Stake protocol to prevent energy waste and 51% history rewrite attacks. Kenshiro suggested the implementation of hardcoded checkpoints that could be set by each Bitcoin node client to prevent long-range attacks. He also stated that only one staker would be authorized to create a block in any given block preventing other stakers from spamming the network with illegal blocks. Kenshiro pointed out that a block explorer is only required during a 51% attack and only for nodes that are updating blocks during the attack. Oscar Lafarga, in his response, believed that Kenshiro's proposal wouldn't require any changes to the Bitcoin Core implementation and that it introduces security risk in the selection of block explorer and the Bitcoin Core release dispatch system. Oscar Lafarga claimed that he wasn't aware of any cases where similar checkpointing schemes have accomplished anything useful to improve the Bitcoin network.</summary>
