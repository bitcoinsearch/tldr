    <summary>A discussion between Tamas Blummer and Eric Voskuil explores different ways to impose cost on the use of Bitcoin services without direct billing. Burning bitcoins, paying high fees in self-dealing transactions, time-locking own bitcoins or someone else's, and transferable borrowed bitcoins are some of the suggested ways. The potential incremental value of transferability of output accrues to both the advertiser/renter and owner. However, this transfer incurs a fee if on chain, which may easily overwhelm the effective benefit. In the advertising scenario, this transfer can be achieved independent of Bitcoin by changing the advertisement. Eric Voskuil argues that it is the consumed cost that matters in this scenario. ZmnSCPxj presents a use case of "Bitcoin Classified Ads Network" where advertisements are backed by an unspent TXO to limit local resource consumption. Spammers will either need to rent larger UTXO values for their spam or fall back to pre-Bitcoin spamming methods.</summary>
