    <summary>Andreas Schildbach, a member of the Bitcoin development community, has stated that an estimated 10+ million wallets depend on NODE_BLOOM to be updated. However, he has not specified exactly which wallets are dependent on this feature. Despite the potential loss of security with bloom filters, people can still run NODE_BLOOM nodes and direct wallets to those nodes through DNS seed infrastructure. This update comes from a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
