    <summary>On Monday 22 July 2019, a discussion took place among bitcoin developers regarding the improvement of current filtering for segwit. One suggestion was to test scripts and scriptPubKeys against the filter. However, there was a consensus among protocol developers that BIP37, a public server-based transaction filtering system, was a conceptual mistake. Instead of extending it further, the suggestion was made to add Stratum (Electrum) support and limit usage of all pseudo-SPV protocols to trusted peers.The Neutrino protocol was also discussed as an alternative to bloom filters, but it was deemed controversial and less trustworthy. It was noted that the protocol uses significantly more bandwidth than other options. Eric Lombrozo had previously added segwit support, which was included and supported in Knots since v0.15.1. Although his mSIGNA wallet utilized this feature, it was never reviewed for Core. Overall, the consensus among developers seems to be that BIP37 should not be extended and that alternatives like Stratum and Neutrino need more review before being widely implemented.</summary>
