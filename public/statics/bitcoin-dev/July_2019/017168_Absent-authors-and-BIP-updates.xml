    <title>Absent authors and BIP updates</title>

    <summary>In a recent message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Karl-Johan Alm raised concerns about the issue of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) authors who leave permanently and do not respond to reasonable requests to change their BIPs. According to Alm, this leaves the community in an awkward situation where they are unable to make any necessary changes or updates to the BIPs. However, BIP 2 provides a solution by allowing for the assignment of a new champion to take over ownership of the proposal. The BIP 2 process involves the submission of an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and a formal announcement on the BIP repository on GitHub. This process can help ensure that the BIP remains current and relevant even if the original author is no longer involved.</summary>
