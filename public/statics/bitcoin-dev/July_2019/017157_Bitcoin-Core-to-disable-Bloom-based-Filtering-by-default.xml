    <summary>On Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter suggested that privacy should be an individual choice on the current Bitcoin protocol. He also questioned why it should be considered end-of-life since it provides value. Luke clarified that privacy is not EOL but rather disabled by default. Anyone can provide it by choice similar to Stratum/Electrum. Peter also believed that network security could be obtained by having a large number of people following the Bitcoin headers based on the longest weighted chain as a means of nullifying potential miner-initiated hard forks. However, Luke disagreed with this view and stated that such wallets strictly degrade security as they blindly trust miners. In fact, they make the network more vulnerable to 2X-like attacks.</summary>
