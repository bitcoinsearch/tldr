    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrew Chow proposed a canonical method for multi-byte types. He suggested designating a specific type to indicate that the type is multiple bytes. When such types are observed, parsers should move onto the next byte and interpret that as the type, keeping in mind the number of bytes that were read in for the type. However, another participant named 'm' questioned this proposal and suggested using Bitcoin compact uint, which most PSBT consumers already implement. The discussion is ongoing and no final decision has been made yet.</summary>
