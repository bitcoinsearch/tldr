    <summary>According to a message sent by Peter, who believes that Andreas' Android Bitcoin wallet and BRD are significant users of node_bloom, privacy is a matter of individual choice in the current protocol. He suggests that people should be allowed to provide this network service instead of it being end-of-life if it provides value. Additionally, he believes that having a large quantity of people following the Bitcoin headers based on longest weighted chain can provide network security as a means of nullifying potential miner initiated hard forks such as S2X.</summary>
