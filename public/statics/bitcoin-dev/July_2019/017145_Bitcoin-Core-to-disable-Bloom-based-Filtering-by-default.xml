    <summary>Bitcoin Core, a software that serves as a full node for the Bitcoin network, is set to turn off bloom filter serving by default in its next release. Bloom filter serving has been an option for several releases but has been identified as a well-known denial-of-service (DoS) vector. Other DoS vectors have gradually been closed, making bloom filter serving an obvious low-hanging fruit. Those who use this feature should already have been filtering for NODE_BLOOM-signaling nodes, and it is not anticipated that these nodes will be gone anytime soon. The change resolves well-known DoS vectors in Bitcoin Core, especially for nodes with spinning disks. It is suggested that clients who rely on the availability of NODE_BLOOM-supporting nodes consider migrating to a more modern and less trustful and privacy-violating alternative over the coming years.</summary>
