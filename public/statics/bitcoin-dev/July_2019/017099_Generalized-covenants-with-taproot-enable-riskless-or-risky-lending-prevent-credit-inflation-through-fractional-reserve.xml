    <summary>In a conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Eric, they discuss the concept of using unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to advertise services or products. ZmnSCPxj suggests that using UTXOs based on their unspentness-time can allow for hedging by merchants and time-based renting of advertising space. Eric points out that allowing either the owner or renter to spend the "locked-up" coin at any time would defeat the purpose of provable cost through surrendering control of the funds. Burning or spending the same amount would achieve the same result. ZmnSCPxj notes that burning has bad resource usage and adds unnecessary entries to the UTXO database. He also mentions that the use of UTXOs for advertising is not an original concept and was inspired by the Lightning Network channel gossip. The public announcement of channels serves as an advertisement for forwarding services, and channel closure revokes the existing advertisement. Overall, using UTXOs is a better option than burning or mining-fee-spending, according to ZmnSCPxj.</summary>
