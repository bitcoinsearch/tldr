    <summary>In this message, ZmnSCPxj apologizes for using toxic language in their replies to Kenshiro and acknowledges that such behavior should not be tolerated. They also apologize to subscribers of the list for their behavior. However, they make it clear that they do not believe Kenshiro's additions to the base proof-of-stake can fix the issues introduced by proof-of-stake, as additional mechanisms cannot improve efficiency. ZmnSCPxj admits that they cannot argue the point without becoming rude or introducing irrelevant arguments and, as a result, will no longer respond to this thread.</summary>
