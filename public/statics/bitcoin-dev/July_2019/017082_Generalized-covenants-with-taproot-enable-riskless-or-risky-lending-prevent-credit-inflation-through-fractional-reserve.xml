    <summary>The discussion between Tamas Blummer and Eric Voskuil centers around the value of Bitcoin encumbered with debt covenant. Eric argues that for something to have marketable value, it needs to be both scarce and useful. He further explains that Bitcoin's usefulness lies in its ability to be traded for something else that is useful. Tamas, on the other hand, believes that there is a deeper utility of Bitcoin than just its tradability. He suggests that Bitcoin is also useful because of its unforgeable register, and people may find having an unforgeable register of debt covered by reserves useful. Tamas proposes that coins encumbered with debt covenant represent temporary control of a scarce resource. Even though they are less desirable, he believes that they still offer the utility of using an unforgeable register. In this case, a register of debt covered by reserves. If people find this useful, then units needed to maintain that register will be valuable to some extent. The discussion delves into whether such encumbered coins can have value or not.Eric argues that ICO tokens can be traded indefinitely for other things of value, so the comparison isn't valid. He thinks that they've both made their points clear, and he sees no new ideas surfacing. However, after giving it more thought, Eric finds one case where a person could value such encumbered coins. In the case of tracking an asset that becomes worthless at a specific time, one could value a record of ownership and the ability to trade ownership of the asset during the period. Eric explains that renting such coins (e.g., to the tick issuer) to track the ticket could generate income for hodlers by temporarily giving up control. However, he notes that as soon as the rental cost exceeds the minimum tracking burn, rental becomes more expensive than just purchasing the coin. Furthermore, there can be no monetary value of encumbered coins, and the non-monetary (tracking) scenario is limited to fixed-term tracking. In conclusion, Eric feels that this use of Bitcoin would reduce the average cost of non-monetary blockchain storage, but he's not sure it's a use people want to facilitate with a protocol change. It's up to the community to decide.</summary>
