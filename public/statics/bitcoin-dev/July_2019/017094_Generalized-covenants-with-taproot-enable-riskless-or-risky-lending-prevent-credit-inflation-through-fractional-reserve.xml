    <summary>The use of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) for advertising services or products is better than burning or mining-fee-spending, according to ZmnSCPxj. Using the unspentness-time of a UTXO allows for someone advertising a service or producer to "close up shop" by simply spending the advertising UTXO. This allows some time-based hedging for merchants or entities renting out a UTXO for an advertisement. Burnt funds cannot be "un-burnt" to easily signal the end of a term for an advertisement, and burning currently has bad resource usage for practical applications. Moreover, practically burning requires spending to a provably-unspendable P2PKH or P2SH or similar output which adds UTXO entries to the UTXO database that will never be removed. It would be very nice to have non-0-amount `OP_RETURN` outputs, as `OP_RETURN` outputs are never stored in the UTXO database. However, this will require a change in node relay policy, which again will take time to make possible, and would not be practical today. The use of UTXOs to advertise services is not original to ZmnSCPxj; he found the LN channel gossip to be the inspiration for this. Publicly-announced channels indicate the backing UTXO that funds the channel. The purpose of publicly announcing the channels is to be able to provide the service of forwarding across the Lightning Network, thus the public announcement serves as an advertisement for the service. Channel closure immediately spends the UTXO and also doubles to "revoke" the existing "advertisement". ZmnSCPxj designed the Bitcoin Classified Ads Network around the UTXO spentness mechanism taking inspiration from this ability to "revoke" the advertisement.</summary>
