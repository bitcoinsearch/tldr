    <summary>The discussion between Eric Voskuil and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the use of UTXOs to advertise services or products. ZmnSCPxj suggests that advertisers should be required to burn a fraction of a coin, similar to how miners burn energy, to prove their commitment to the advertisement. However, Eric argues that burning funds is not practical and suggests using the unspentness-time of a UTXO instead. This would allow for advertisers to close up shop once their product is sold and reclaim the locked funds. ZmnSCPxj proposes a design where either the owner or renter can spend the "locked up" coin at any time by dropping the covenant, but Eric points out that this would allow for theft. Eric also notes that burnt funds cannot be "un-burnt" easily, and the best solution would be to have nodes automatically decay the spent value of older advertisements. Furthermore, Eric argues that spending the coin as a fee achieves the same result as burning it. He also mentions that not all full node implementations require a store of UTXOs and that compact UTXO representations will be remedied later. ZmnSCPxj explains that the use of UTXOs to advertise services is not original and was inspired by the Lightning Network channel gossip. Finally, ZmnSCPxj designed the Bitcoin Classified Ads Network around the UTXO spentness mechanism.</summary>
