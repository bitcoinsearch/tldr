    <summary>Jonathan Underwood has made a pull request on GitHub for the discussion regarding the security of signed data in one-of-one multisig. He argues that explicitly signing the data is more secure, even if the difference is apparent outside the signed data. In case of any vulnerability or a way to break the system for one-of-one multisig found, someone who signed a single sig xpub whitelist will not be exposed. Dmitry Petukhov suggests requiring m=1 for single-sig case and using 0 as an indicator that there are serial numbers following it. However, Jonathan mentions that 0x00 is single sig and 0x01 is multisig. He signs off as the Chief Bitcoin Officer at Bitbank Co., Ltd. and provides his public key fingerprint for encrypted messages.</summary>
