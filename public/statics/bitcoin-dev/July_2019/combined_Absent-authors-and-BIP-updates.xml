    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process has been facing challenges due to authors leaving the project, making it difficult to modify existing BIPs. BIP-2 provides a solution by allowing for the assignment of a new champion to take over ownership of the proposal. The BIP 2 process involves the submission of an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and a formal announcement on the BIP repository on GitHub. This process can help ensure that the BIP remains current and relevant even if the original author is no longer involved.To address the issue of authors leaving after their BIP is accepted, four potential solutions have been proposed. Firstly, allowing anyone to request a change of a draft/proposed BIP to "accepted" at any time as long as they prove that it fulfills the criteria given in BIP-2 without needing approval from the author. Secondly, allowing BIPs to expire after 3 years and allowing the BIP repository maintainer to assign a new champion if one appears. Thirdly, creating new BIPs with new assignations that supercede the old BIP, similar to how BIP 2 supercedes BIP 1, without the author's sign-off on the changes. Lastly, accepting the current process as it is and not making any changes.Karl-Johan Alm raised concerns about the issue of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) authors who leave permanently and do not respond to reasonable requests to change their BIPs. According to Alm, this leaves the community in an awkward situation where they are unable to make any necessary changes or updates to the BIPs. However, BIP 2 provides a solution by allowing for the assignment of a new champion to take over ownership of the proposal.</summary>
