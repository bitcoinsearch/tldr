    <summary>On a Bitcoin development forum, Andreas Schildbach suggested that the DNS seed infrastructure could direct wallets to certain nodes, which would be a helpful feature. Another user confirmed that this is already supported by default in sipa's bitcoin-seeder, which many DNS seeds use. However, some users express concerns about custodial wallets and light wallets being harmful to the network, with one user suggesting that BIP 37 is the only scaling technology that has proven successful and could help against the trend of bitbanks. Overall, the discussion highlights ongoing debates within the Bitcoin community about the best ways to ensure security and scalability while maintaining the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
