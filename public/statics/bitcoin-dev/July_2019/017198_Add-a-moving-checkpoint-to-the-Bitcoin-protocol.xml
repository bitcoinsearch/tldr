    <summary>In a discussion about a potential state-sponsored netsplit lasting longer than N blocks (24 hours), Kenshiro suggested that the community would detect it and nodes could stop until the netsplit is fixed. However, Alistair Mann pointed out that a netsplit cannot be detected but merely be suspected where the p2p protocol does allow arbitrary connecting/disconnecting of any peer. This mandates manual, out-of-band communications, which is error-prone and centralizing. He also mentioned that stopping nodes during netsplits creates several attack vectors. In the extreme case where no one notices a network split for more than N blocks and there are 2 permanent forks longer than N, nodes from one branch could delete their local history so they would join the other branch. However, Alistair raised concerns about China hosting more than 51% of hashpower and conducting a netsplit, and whether the rest of the world would have to delete their local history because they lack the hashpower to assert themselves as the proper branch. He believes that having to delete actual history everywhere across the globe but China is not worth limiting reorgs to 24 hours. Alistair concluded by saying that he is unconvinced that the moving checkpoint described would improve Bitcoin.</summary>
