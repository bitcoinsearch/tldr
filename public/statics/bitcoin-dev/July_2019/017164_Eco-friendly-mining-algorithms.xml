    <summary>In this message, the writer shares links to eco-friendly mining algorithms. The first link is to Proof of Stake v3.0 and provides an explanation of how it works. This algorithm is used in several PoS coins including Bitcoin Confidential. The second link leads to an article on CoinCentral that explains Proof of Capacity through a simple analogy. In this algorithm, hard drives are filled with lottery tickets and the person with the most matching numbers wins a reward. This approach is implemented in BurstCoin.</summary>
