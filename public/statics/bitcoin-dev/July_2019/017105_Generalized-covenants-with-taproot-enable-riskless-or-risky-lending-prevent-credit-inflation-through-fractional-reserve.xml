    <summary>In an email exchange between Eric Voskuil and ZmnSCPxj, they discussed the encumbrance of UTXOs for ad placement in a proposed ad network. ZmnSCPxj argued that the lifetime of an advertisement is tied to the unspentness of its backing UTXO, while Eric pointed out that there is no actual encumbrance of the UTXO and any unspent output is sufficient as proof of ownership. Additionally, Eric claimed that the proposed system's requirement of locked UTXOs would be surpassed by its opportunity cost, making it less effective than other ad networks such as AdWords. He suggested that Google could achieve similar results by simply accepting Bitcoin for ad placement.</summary>
