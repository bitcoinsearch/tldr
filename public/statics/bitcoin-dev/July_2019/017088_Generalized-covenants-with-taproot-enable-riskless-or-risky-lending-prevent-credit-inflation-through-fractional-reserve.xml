    <summary>In an email exchange between Tamas Blummer and ZmnSCPxj, the two discuss the use of covenant in solving problems that cannot currently be solved through other means. Blummer notes that consensus support for covenant is only necessary if an unchained setup using it is closed uncooperatively, and otherwise there is no need to disclose on-chain that a covenant was used. ZmnSCPxj counters with an "advertising" scheme that involves committing a public key instead of the advertisement on the UTXO, allowing advertisers to sign an "advertisement chain" with their advertiser pubkey. However, Blummer points out that this would require HODLers to trust the advertising service, which goes against the trustless separation that covenant provides.</summary>
