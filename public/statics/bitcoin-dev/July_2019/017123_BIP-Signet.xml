    <summary>The author, Karl-Johan Alm has written a BIP describing the Signet network, where signatures are used in addition to proof of work for block progress. This creates much better coordination and robustness, even with unreliability, for persistent, longer-term testing scenarios involving multiple independent parties. The motivation behind this new type of test network is to be more suitable for integration testing by organizations such as exchanges, or testing of next generation Layer-2 protocols like Eltoo or sidechain pegs. The specification describes a new type of network (called "signet"), which takes an additional consensus parameter called the challenge (scriptPubKey). The compatibility section explains that this specification is backwards compatible in the sense that existing software can use Signet out of the box. Finally, the document is licensed under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license.</summary>
