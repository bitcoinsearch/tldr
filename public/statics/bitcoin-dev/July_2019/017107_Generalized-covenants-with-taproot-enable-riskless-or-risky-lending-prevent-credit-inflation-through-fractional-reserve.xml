    <summary>The conversation between Eric Voskuil and ZmnSCPxj is about the encumbrance of UTXOs in an ad market and its relationship to opportunity cost. ZmnSCPxj argues that early recovery of UTXOs eliminates the value of time lock costs, but Eric responds by saying that he is responding to cryptoeconomic principles, not implementation details. Eric claims that the multisig unlock implementation reduces the UTXO to simply a UTXO, and therefore there is no actual encumbrance. Additionally, Eric points out that any UTXO is sufficient for proof of ownership in the ad network, although a UTXO with significant value can be prioritized by a service with limited bandwidth.
