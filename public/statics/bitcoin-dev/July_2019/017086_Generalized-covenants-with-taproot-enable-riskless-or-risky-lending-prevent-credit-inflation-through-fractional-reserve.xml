    <summary>ZmnSCPxj has responded to Tamas' idea of covenants for separating advertising services from HODLer funding. He suggests committing a public key instead of committing the advertisement on the UTXO. This advertiser pubkey is used to sign an "advertisement chain", which is a merklized singly-linked list whose contents are the actual advertisements, each node being signed using the advertiser pubkey. Each header of the advertchain also includes a `CLTV`-like construct, which is the Bitcoin blockheight that must be reached first before another advertchain header can be added, containing a new advertisement that replaces the previous one. This lets an advertising broker pay for some onchain UTXO to a HODLer, providing a `nLockTime`d onchain transaction returning the funds to the HODLer. The advertising broker can rent out the UTXO to providers who wish to advertise, without generalized covenants on the Bitcoin blockchain.</summary>
