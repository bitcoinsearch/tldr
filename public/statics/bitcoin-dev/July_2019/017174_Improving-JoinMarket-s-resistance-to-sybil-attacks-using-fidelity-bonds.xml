    <summary>The discussion in the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the concept of imposing opportunity costs on attackers by locking UTXOs instead of burning them. This could potentially give rise to a market of locking UTXOs in exchange for payment, which would create a transparent interest rate market for Bitcoin. However, there are concerns about whether this market would drive the cost of attack down to manageable levels for the attacker. The owner of the locked UTXO can derive potential profit from it by being a maker and pay some fee for the convenience. Alternatively, the owner can outsource that task to someone else. If the attacker is the entity who provides this outsourcing and captures a significant portion of the market, it can even receive some profit from the convenience fee while deanonymizing the joins. Pseudonymous entities control of that market can also not be sure.</summary>
