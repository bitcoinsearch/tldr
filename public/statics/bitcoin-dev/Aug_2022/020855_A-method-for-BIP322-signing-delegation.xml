    <summary>This post discusses a proposal for BIP322 polishing, specifically regarding delegating signatures to other scriptPubKeys for privacy purposes. Instead of using a complicated transaction scheme, the proposal suggests using a multisig approach that makes possible delegatees known at signing time. The proposal outlines steps to replace the message challenge and challenge solution with a witness stack containing n...1 0, generating the signature as if it were for a real P2WPKH-multisig transaction. The pros of this approach are outlined, including no recursive transactions and provable address verification, while the con is that public keys of delegators are known, potentially compromising privacy. Input from others is requested, particularly from luke-jr who participated in the original Github discussion on delegation.</summary>
