    <title>BIP Proposal: Receiving and Change Derivation Paths in a Single Descriptor</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange on August 3rd, 2022, Billy Tetrud explained that a descriptor format is used to define a space of address derivation paths, but it does not describe what each path is intended for. He suggested that defining the conventions of derivation path indexes should be a separate BIP, following the single responsibility principle. In response, the other party acknowledged their mistake in misreading the BIP proposal text and missing that it only describes 'receive' and 'change' as 'common usecase', rather than definitive designations for indexes. They agreed with Tetrud that there is no need to include such conventions in this BIP.</summary>
