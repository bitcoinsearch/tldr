    <summary>A user named Ali suggested a compensation scheme for low-fee transactions that involves attaching work to them as a way to combat spam. However, the scheme is vulnerable to ASICs and difficult to balance with them. To make non-standard txs reach miners, Peter Todd suggested proposing an alternative broadcast scheme like hashcash-based. Without such a scheme, experiments like changing the minimum fee rate for relay are pointless since they won't reach the intended parties.</summary>
