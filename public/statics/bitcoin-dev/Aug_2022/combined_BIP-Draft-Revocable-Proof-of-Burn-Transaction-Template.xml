    <summary>Veleslav has proposed a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for creating revocable proof-of-burn transactions. The proposal aims to standardize RPoB transactions for consistency, efficiency, reliability, and interoperability. A new transaction version number will allow future extensions. The BIP integrates bitcoin proof-of-burn with a revocation mechanic by specifying a taproot public key in the op_return payload and an output for revocation. It also considers operating under SPV assumptions, ease of implementation, and future extendability.The proposed RPoB transaction involves burning bitcoins by sending them to an output that is provably unspendable, demonstrating a commitment to the network. The BIP specifies several requirements for RPoB transactions, including a hash puzzle for revocation, a signature to prevent replay attacks, and a zero-value revocation output. The public key script must be a standard P2TW output. RPoB transactions consume block space but provide a secondary proof-of-burn that takes advantage of the limited and contested block space. The proposal increases the demand for the blockchain and transaction fees, which is critical for the long-term health of the network.Veleslav's proposed RPoB transaction has no compatibility issues with existing structures, making it a suitable application layer structure without any preexisting deployment. Two appendices discuss alternatives to blockchain-based proof-of-burn, such as proof-of-work and proof-of-payment, and how using a blockchain allows for trust calculations transferring proof-of-burn into a "default trust" value, making networks resistant to distributed denial of service attacks.</summary>
