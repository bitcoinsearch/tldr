    <summary>A new version of Bitcoin's Silent Payment implementation has been introduced through a Pull Request update. This version (PR #24897) is an improvement over the previous version, as it eliminates some manual steps and introduces a new descriptor type named "sp()". This descriptor has no range and contains exactly one key which generates a unique 'silent-payment' address. The silent payment address can be used as one of the outputs in a transaction, alongside standard addresses. The "send" RPC will identify and tweak the silent payment address automatically. The output generated always returns the same standard Taproot script (Segwit V1), but with HRP changed from "bc" to "sp" on the mainnet (or "tsp" on testnet and signet). However, this does not affect the consensus or auditability rules. To create a silent transaction, users simply need to use the silent payment address as one of the outputs. Additionally, there is a step-by-step signet tutorial available for reviewers to test the new version easily. With this new version, the process of making silent payments is easier and more efficient.</summary>
