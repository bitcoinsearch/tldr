    <summary>ZmnSCPxj discusses the use of L2 contracts and time-out based protocols in a conversation with James. They explore the possibility of using layered commitments with `OP_CTV` to enable speedy settlement styles for these contracts. ZmnSCPxj mentions that CTV style commitments have been used in their work on eltoo as an example of reducing interactivity in protocols, rather than byte savings per se. They also discuss the implementation of predetermined sets of UTXOs in offchain cases, which can be implemented with a single UTXO that is an n-of-n multisignature or P2WSH revealing an `OP_CTV`. Overall, the conversation provides insights into the technicalities of implementing efficient L2 contracts and time-out based protocols.</summary>
