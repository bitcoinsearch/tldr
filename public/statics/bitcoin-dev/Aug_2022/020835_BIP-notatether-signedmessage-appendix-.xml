    <summary>In a previous message, Ali mentioned that the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) in question is not a standard. This is important because it raises concerns about the N+1 problem. The instructions for the BIP are limited to a reference manual, which could have been hosted on any website, including Ali's own. However, Ali believes that these instructions should be made official.</summary>
