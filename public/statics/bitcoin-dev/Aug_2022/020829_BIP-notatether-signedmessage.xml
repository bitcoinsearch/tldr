    <summary>Ali Sherief has created a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), called notatether-signedmessage. He shared the link to the proposal on GitHub. The proposal outlines a new format for signed messages that are not intended for use with Ether or Ethereum-based tokens. Coinkite and other products will conform to this specification if they don't already. This information was shared by @DocHEX, who works at Coinkite and provided his PGP signature. No further details were provided in the context.</summary>
