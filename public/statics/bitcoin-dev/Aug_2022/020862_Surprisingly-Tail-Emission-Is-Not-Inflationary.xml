    <summary>The email conversation between Jaroslaw and Erik Aronesty on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the security of the Bitcoin system. Jaroslaw argues that large stakeholders will not be incentivized to mine and that trust in them is a mistake, while Erik argues that if fees are sufficient, clearance times will not increase. They both agree that swapping proof of work to proof of stake would be a degradation. The email includes a link to an interview with Milton Friedman about inflation.</summary>
