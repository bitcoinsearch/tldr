    <summary>Ali Sherief has created a new BIP called "notatether-signedmessage". The BIP defines a step-by-step process for signing and verifying messages from legacy, native/nested segwit, and taproot addresses. The BIP does not define a new signature format itself, except in the case of Taproot where a signature format is defined that has 1 byte header/recID, 64 bytes signature, and 32 bytes x coordinate of a public key. This is required to run the BIP340 Schnorr verify algorithm using only the signature - and the header byte is added for backwards compatibility. Otherwise, it completely integrates BIP137 signatures.Ali plans to move that format to its own BIP as soon as possible, in lieu that it is unacceptable to define formats in an Informational BIP. Ali has requested comments on the mailing list and has CC'd BIP editors. A correct link to the BIP has been provided as https://github.com/ZenulAbidin/bips/blob/master/bip-notatether-signedmessage.mediawiki.</summary>
