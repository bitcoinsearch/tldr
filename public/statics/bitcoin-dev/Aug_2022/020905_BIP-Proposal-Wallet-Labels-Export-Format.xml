    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Ali Sherief suggested that business processes are mostly CSV file oriented. However, Christopher Allen disagreed with this statement, stating that while amateur processes may rely on CSV files, professional accounting does not. He also expressed interest in seeing some separation of layers regarding output formats. Allen has been working with @nochiel on an export to a Plain-Text Accounting-friendly format using the beancount python app. The final tool will allow users to get any transactions from a descriptor from a random explora via Tor and then get price information from a random spotbit price server via Tor. It will then export a beancount compatible file. Allen explained that he uses the beancount cli app to add other details to the exported file, such as payer and payee notes, to make his accounting easier. Additionally, he would like to see an easier and interoperable way to merge these details (his account details from an Esplora and price details from Spotbit) with what his different wallets have available. Allen hopes that this idea will inspire others working on the wallet export format.</summary>
