    <summary>In March 2021, Jeremy Rubin posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list about delegating UTXOs to a script by creating a new transaction using that UTXO. This method was originally written in terms of normal transactions but could be extended to message signing transactions as well. In August 2022, Ryan Grant made a TODO post regarding a way for the initial signer to delegate to another scriptPubKey which would be needed for better privacy and CoinJoin/Lightning compatibility. Ali Sherief responded with a suggestion to place a MAST (two Merkle branches) where the first branch has the original signer's scriptPubKey, and the second branch contains the delegated signer's scriptPubKey. It is unclear what parties are involved in this requirement, but they can make signatures on the delegating and delegated keys.</summary>
