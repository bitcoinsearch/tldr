    <summary>An email was sent to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list on July 30th, 2022 by a user named alicexbt proposing that developers should not make any changes in the default minimum fee rate required for relay. Instead, if there are incentives for users and miners to change it, they should use a non-default value. The proposal suggests that miners could experiment with lower fee rates and see if this increases revenue by using it on odd dates (even dates remain default) for a month. It is suggested that analyzing how this worked for different mining pools could lead to a non-default value (lower or higher) becoming normal in the future.However, Peter Todd responded to the proposal stating that without a way for lower-fee-rate transactions to get to those miners, experiments like that are pointless. He proposed that if someone wants to suggest things like this, they should propose a way to get non-standard transactions to miners, like a hashcash-based alternative broadcast scheme. The email thread ended after this response.</summary>
