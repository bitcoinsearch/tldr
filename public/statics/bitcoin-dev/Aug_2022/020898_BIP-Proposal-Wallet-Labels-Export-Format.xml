    <summary>A proposed standard for the export and import of labels from a wallet was being discussed by Craig Raw and Ryan. Craig suggested using a CSV file format instead of JSON, citing its forgiving nature and accessibility to non-technical users. Ryan argued in favor of JSON, stating that CSV is not suitable for a standard and lacks strict escape rules. Craig responded by emphasizing the need for non-experts to manage labels outside of wallet software and noted that CSV files are already common in Bitcoin wallet software. The proposed format would be a two-column CSV file with a reference to a transaction, address, input, or output in the first column and the label in the second column. The CSV file may be compressed using the ZIP format and optionally encrypted using AES.The specification uses the comma-separated values (CSV) format, which is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. The first line in the file is a header and should be ignored on import. Importing applications may truncate labels if necessary. However, more context is needed to fully understand the purpose and significance of this proposed standard, including any potential implementations or industry acceptance.</summary>
