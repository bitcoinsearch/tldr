    <summary>In response to a new BIP proposal by Ali Sherief for notatether-signedmessage, Luke Dashjr inquires about not helping Kalle out with BIP322. Ali explains that while BIP322 may have superior message verification capabilities, wallets are not using it and instead rely on a chaotic mixture of legacy address sign/verify and nonstandard segwit sign/verify. Therefore, an effort must be made first to transfer these N signing implementations to a common ground, before enforcing BIP322. Message signatures are highly relied upon in some places, and it is necessary to ensure as many wallets as possible use the specification in the BIP for message signing and verification, along with implementing the legacy and segwit address parts. This BIP forces compliance with previous BIPs that extend the message signing format, particularly BIP137. Ali admits that the Taproot signature format should not be located inside this BIP but rather contained in a newer Standards Track BIP that supersedes BIP137. The proposal will only solve half of the problems, and the other half must be solved by getting other wallet implementations to implement this standard. It is a non-trivial task, and assigning a number to this BIP would help to get halfway to the finish line.</summary>
