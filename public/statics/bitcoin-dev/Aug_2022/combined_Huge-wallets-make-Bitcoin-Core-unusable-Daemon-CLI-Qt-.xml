    <summary>A user has reported experiencing exponential performance degradation when using the Bitcoin Core client with a 5-year-old wallet containing over 2 million transactions and 446,503 generated addresses. Most commands timed out while the CPU was maxed out, making the machine almost unusable. Increasing the timeout and/or the RPC threads made things worse. Loading the wallet in the "bitcoin-qt" caused everything to become unresponsive, including the system (OS/UI). This issue makes the standard client almost useless for the wallet feature. Currently, the only "solution" for huge wallets is to create a new one and send the funds there from time to time, but this solution is not elegant and can break old address monitoring, leading to privacy concerns. The user suggests that caching the entire wallet in memory could improve performance even more, but some code optimization is necessary. However, changing the wallet module takes significant time as it is a large module in Bitcoin Core.It was suggested to use removeprunedfunds RPC to remove old transactions and speed up balance calculations and transaction creation. The wallet is already entirely in memory, so improving cache usage is not an option. The user raised several related questions such as whether it is possible to optimize a huge wallet without moving the funds to a new one, reducing the wallet size, telling the CLI to ignore old addresses, or improving I/O treatment and/or CPU usage in the main thread on Bitcoin-Qt to avoid window freezing on big and huge wallets.If optimization is not possible, the CLI could just warn the user to execute the command 'archive.' The issue could also potentially become a problem if we have LN nodes that use the Bitcoin Core wallet infrastructure behind to open/close many channels for a long time. The provided links included possible bugs, including some issues experienced with loadwallet.Felipe faced an issue with a 5-year-old production server wallet containing 2.079.337 transactions and 446.503 generated addresses, which resulted in exponential performance degradation. Increasing the timeout and RPC threads in the config file worsened the situation, and even moving the wallet.dat to a fast SSD disk and increasing cache size couldn't improve performance. Felipe suggested caching the entire wallet in memory, but some code optimization might also be necessary. He asked several questions on improving cache usage, reducing wallet size, ignoring old addresses, improving I/O treatment and CPU usage, and whether it was possible to optimize a huge wallet without moving funds to a new one. Felipe proposed an "autoarchivehugewallets=1" feature in the file config to create a new wallet and move funds automatically and included links to related issues and tests.Wallet Qt is already unpopular among end-users, being slow to first sync, hard to use, and not modern. It becomes useless now also for servers in production, forcing them to use third-party solutions for huge wallets.</summary>
