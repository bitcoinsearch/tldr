    <summary>Michael Folkson discusses the history of BIP125/RBF rules and how they are implemented in Bitcoin Core. The BIP is more than just policy, it is a way for wallets and nodes to communicate, and the purpose of the BIP is to standardize communication. Since BIP125 is widely implemented, it should not be changed except for corrections to things that are errors deviating from the original intent. Security should never depend on assumptions of node policies. Folkson points out that L2 security is impacted by default policy rules to some extent. He suggests that we should aspire to similar standards for policy as consensus changes, given L2 protocol security is relying on them. He thinks we should strive towards the highest possible standards for step change default policy changes in Core. The new RBF rules as implemented in Core today are documented in the Core repo. The question is whether the new RBF rules will continue to be iterated upon as new research on L2 security comes to light or if a new static set of RBF rules is close to being finalized. In general, standards should be improving and we should be striving to do better and be more rigorous than whatever the standard was in 2015.</summary>
