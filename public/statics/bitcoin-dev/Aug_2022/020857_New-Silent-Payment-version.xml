    <summary>A new silent payment version has been added to PR #24897 in the Bitcoin codebase on GitHub. The update eliminates some manual steps from the previous version, such as setting the `keypool` to avoid costly multi-key scan. This is achieved by using a new descriptor type called "sp()" that contains exactly one key and introduces a new type of output called "silent-payment". The output returns a standard Taproot script with HRP changed from "bc" to "sp" on the mainnet (or "tsp" on testnet and signet). The silent payment address can be used as one of the outputs to create a silent transaction, and the "send" RPC will automatically identify and tweak it. The transaction can contain multiple outputs, combining silent and standard addresses. A step-by-step signet tutorial has been written for reviewers to test this new version easily.</summary>
