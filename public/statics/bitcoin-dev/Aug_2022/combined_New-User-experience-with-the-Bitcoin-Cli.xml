    <summary>The author shared their experience of encountering an error message while setting up the bitcoin.conf file after recently starting to run a node and learning how to be effective with it from The Blockchain Commons project. The error occurred when they combined chain= set in the bitcoin.conf with a network argument such as -testnet, which caused confusion when using the command 'bitcoin-cli -chain=testnet' that failed. After seeking help from the bitcoin-dev irc, the author was informed that there is currently no way to notify where the arguments are coming from a config file or client arguments. They suggest adding a new argument options category to generate a more descriptive warning in ArgsManager::GetChainName. The author also suggests changing the added argument -testnet to -test to match the CBaseChainParams or adding the argument of -test to maintain backwards capability.The author acknowledges that this is their first time contributing to the software and hopes that their suggestions will not be perceived as bike-shedding but rather a novice attempt to contribute in good faith. They welcome feedback on how the issue is presented and look forward to improving their effectiveness at engaging with the community.</summary>
