    <summary>The author recently started running a node and is learning how to be effective with it from The Blockchain Commons project. They shared their experience of encountering an error message while setting up the bitcoin.conf file, which they copied from an old setup. The error occurred when they combined chain= set in the bitcoin.conf with a network argument such as -testnet. The author sought help from the bitcoin-dev irc and was told that there is currently no way to notify where the arguments are coming from a config file or client arguments. They suggest adding a new argument options category to generate a more descriptive warning in ArgsManager::GetChainName.The author's second mistake was mixing the naming of test and testnet, causing confusion when using the command 'bitcoin-cli -chain=testnet', which failed. They suggest changing the added argument -testnet to -test to match the CBaseChainParams or adding the argument of -test to maintain backwards capability.The author acknowledges that this is their first time contributing to the software and hopes that their suggestions will not be perceived as bike-shedding but rather a novice attempt to contribute in good faith. They welcome feedback on how the issue is presented and look forward to improving their effectiveness at engaging with the community.</summary>
