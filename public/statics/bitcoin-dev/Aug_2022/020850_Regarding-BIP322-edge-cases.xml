    <summary>The Bitcoin community is exploring a way for the initial signer to delegate to another scriptPubKey, which is needed for better privacy and CoinJoin/Lightning compatibility. The details of this requirement are not clear, but it seems that MAST (two Merkle branches) could be used to achieve it. The first branch would have the original signer's scriptPubKey, while the second branch would contain the delegated signer's scriptPubKey. It appears that all parties involved can make signatures on the delegating and delegated keys. More documentation is required to fully understand this motivation.</summary>
