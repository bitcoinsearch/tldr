    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 322 still has several TODO items that need to be addressed. Though there is a Github issue/PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1347 for addressing all the TODO items, Ali threw it in the mailing list again to see if anyone else has suggestions for dealing with them. Ali copied and pasted some of the TODO items in the Specification section from an older copy of the draft at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/b6b0126e2d04793ba52a40f05d24538fa3f2c9ad/bip-0322.mediawiki. To deal with the TODO items, Ali suggests limiting what opcodes scriptPubKeys can sign from, which will be very helpful. The specification already limits this to a certain extent, but Ali believes that placing one of the NOPs at the beginning of the script to activate proof parsing mode will make these more recognizable. However, an opcode may not be necessary at all since the program can infer from context where the proof is coming from. For silent transactions, Ali has already given his suggestion in the PR that some subsection can operate with them by using its scriptPubKey. However, he is not sure about what goes inside the Witness stack of message_signature. As for the last TODO related to delegation to another scriptPubKey, Ali suggests placing a MAST, which consists of two Merkle branches—the first branch contains the original signer's scriptPubKey, and the second branch contains the delegated signer’s scriptPubKey.</summary>
