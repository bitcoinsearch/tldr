    <summary>In a Lightning-dev thread, Bastien TEINTURIER shared a gist and asked for feedback on his interpretation of a trick to protect against a malicious participant broadcasting a low-fee HTLC-success or Remote-HTLC-success transaction. The gist suggests that blindly doing a CPFP carve-out on the malicious participant could work as their txid is known. However, one of the responders suggested an alternative method that would be cost-effective and require zero fees. This method involves requesting parent transactions using P2P getdata(type='tx', id=$txid) and extracting the preimage if received. The responder also highlighted that the effectiveness of Bastien's proposal is uncertain as attackers could target miners with outdated states. Honest users may not be able to research which IP addresses belong to miners, creating a centralizing barrier to new miners.</summary>
