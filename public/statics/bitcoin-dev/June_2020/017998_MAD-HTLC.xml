    <summary>In an email to Itay, Ittay, and Matan, ZmnSCPxj discusses the unstated assumption in Bitcoin that miners are short-sighted. This is because deployment of new mining hardware controlled by others may occur at any time and sudden changes in hashpower distribution may reduce future earnings. In a world with RBF and CPFP, existing HTLCs can achieve the same endpoint as MAD-HTLC without additional branch and script opcodes needed by MAD-HTLC. ZmnSCPxj argues that both MAD-HTLC and standard HTLC lead to essentially equivalent endpoints. He proposes improvements to the HTLC model, such as making both Alice and Bob sign in the alice-hashlock branch and using SegWit signing to ensure the splitting of funds is enforced. These improvements can also be implemented with `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`.</summary>
