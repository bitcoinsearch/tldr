    <summary>In this email exchange between Nadav and ZmnSCPxj, they are discussing the potential for bribery attacks in the Lightning Network. They discuss a potential solution of introducing bribery proofs for failed attempts as an additional disincentive for attackers. However, ZmnSCPxj points out that this solution could also be subject to an inversion of the attack, where Alice waits for the timelock to expire and then bribes miners to prevent confirmation of Bob's timelocked transaction, getting her hashlocked transaction confirmed instead. There is a risk around locktime, particularly with natural orphaned blocks and short-term chainsplits. ZmnSCPxj suggests that making pseudonyms valuable and costly to lose is sufficient, and other HTLC-using systems could use similar disincentivizing methods. Chris Belcher is planning a fidelity bond system for SwapMarket makers, which would mimic the properties of LN channels.</summary>
