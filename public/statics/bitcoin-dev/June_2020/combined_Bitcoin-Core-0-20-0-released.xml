    <summary>Bitcoin Core has released two new versions, 0.20.0 and 0.20.1, with several changes and improvements across different aspects of the software.Version 0.20.0 includes new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements, and users are advised to upgrade for older versions. The release notes provide instructions on how to upgrade and specify that Bitcoin Core is supported on Linux kernel operating systems, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer. Known bugs are highlighted, such as the absence of the generated ‘configure’ script which must be installed by running autotools.Notable changes in this release include P2P and network changes, updated RPCs, build system updates, new settings, GUI changes, wallet changes, and documentation changes. Glibc 2.17 or greater is now required to run the release binaries. Additionally, the release notes highlight the new `-asmap` configuration option that has been added to diversify the node's network connections by mapping IP addresses Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) and then limiting the number of connections made to any single ASN.In mining, there have been several changes to block and transaction handling, such as introducing O(1) `OP_IF/NOTIF/ELSE/ENDIF` script implementation, removing REJECT code from CValidationState, and avoiding allocating memory for addrKnown where it is unnecessary. Several improvements have also been made to the P2P protocol and network code.The wallet has also seen many changes such as replacing %w by wallet name in -walletnotify script, making IsTrusted scan parents recursively, changing default address type to bech32, and removing deprecated fee bumping by totalFee. Improvements have been made to RPC and other APIs such as adding the RPC Whitelist Feature, exposing block height of wallet transactions, outputting a descriptor in createmultisig and addmultisigaddress, and updating validateaddress RPCExamples to bech32.Bitcoin Core version 0.20.0 brings a host of new updates for miners, with changes to block and transaction handling, P2P protocol and network code, wallet, RPCs, and other APIs. The `bitcoin-cli` utility now accepts a `-stdinwalletpassphrase` parameter that can be used when calling the `walletpassphrase` and `walletpassphrasechange` RPCs to read the passphrase from standard input without echoing it to the terminal. Finally, users are advised to report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub and to subscribe to security and update notifications.Version 0.20.1 includes several changes and improvements across various aspects of the software. The build system now supports building with the Android Native Development Kit (NDK), and there have been several changes to block and transaction handling in mining, including introducing O(1) `OP_IF/NOTIF/ELSE/ENDIF` script implementation. Improvements have also been made to the P2P protocol and network code, and the wallet has seen many changes such as changing default address type to bech32 and removing deprecated fee bumping by totalFee.RPC and other APIs have also been updated, with examples of validateaddress RPC now using bech32. Additionally, Bitcoin Core has added the RPC Whitelist Feature and exposed block height of wallet transactions. Users can find the full list of changes and fixes on their website.</summary>
