    <summary>The email is discussing the potential for WabiSabi to improve anonymity in CoinJoin transactions by allowing participants to pretend to be multiple people. By using a new persona to own coins after an initial state setup, it can be difficult for other pool participants to determine which participant owns which coin. This creates greater ambiguity and reduces the possibility of tracing leaves by value weight or identifying sockpuppets. The email suggests that this feature could "import" the possibility of PayJoin inside the CoinPool construction. Further research is needed to define better in-pool observers, but the use of equal-value leaves may come with a higher onchain cost in case of pool breakage.</summary>
