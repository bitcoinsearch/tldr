    <summary>The discussion in this context is about the proposal of a decentralized anonymizer network, which is different from the Tor network. The proposal aims at creating a network where nodes are anonymizing themselves and is not based on the Tor protocol. The author argues that the Tor network is weakened due to its dependence on a limited set of exit nodes and its centralized structure. The proposal suggests using "direct" within-Tor rendezvous points or Tor hidden services, which can hide that a bitcoin node is being operated. It also includes light clients that can act as relays. The proposal suggests making a bridge between Tor and clearnet by running two full nodes on the computer, one on the public network, and another on the Tor network. The Tor-fullnode can be used to propagate transactions but the eclipse attacker can still attack all Tor exit nodes and block outgoing transaction traffic to perform eclipse attacks. The convergence link is provided to explain how even with a reduced set of peers, it becomes difficult to know who is doing what and whom is talking to whom. The concept of exiting/bridging to clearnet(s) is not clearly detailed in this version but appears on the drawings.</summary>
