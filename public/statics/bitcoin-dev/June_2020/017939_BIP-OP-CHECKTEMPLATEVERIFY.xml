    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev group, Jeremy, proposed a new way to contribute fees to another transaction chain as an observer. This method can help solve issues related to application-DoS attacks beyond child-pays-for-parent (CTV). He has a design for this idea but is not ready to share it yet. Another member suggested the 'Pay for neighbor' (PFN) transaction, where a transaction that is not directly a child of another transaction can pay fees for other transactions. It would be like a "ghost child" transaction and could only be mined after its "ghost parents" are confirmed. The PFN transaction would require a hard fork, but Anthony Towns suggested making it a soft fork by putting the txids of the ghost parents into taproot annex. If some of the ghost parents are confirmed, the miners can get more fees than necessary, similar to CPFP. The mempool code needs to adjust the relationships between parent/child transactions for this ghost relationship idea. However, there could be complications regarding the transaction package size, which requires further analysis.</summary>
