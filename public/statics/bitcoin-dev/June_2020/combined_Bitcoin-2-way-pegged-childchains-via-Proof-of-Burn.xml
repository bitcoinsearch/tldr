    <summary>A proposal has been made to construct childchains on top of Bitcoin without any changes to Bitcoin or user/miner awareness. The childchain would simulate Proof of Work by requiring continuous burning of Bitcoin in return for fees on the childchain. The childchain security and 2-way-peg accuracy might be acceptable for lower value transactions at a scale determined by the burning rate. Childchains could replace additional Proof of Work chains for new blockchains. The proposal can be found in detail on bitcointalk.org. However, ZmnSCPxj critiques the concept of sidechains as a scaling solution for cryptocurrency, arguing that blockchains do not scale well and that Lightning Network is a better alternative for scaling. Lightning Network uses channels for scaling, where every channel is a consensus system between two participants, and atomic swaps are used to transfer between channels and the blockchain. Blockchain is used for arbitration, and channels are used for scaling. The childchain proposal would use burning of Bitcoin as proxy for unforgeable costliness and benefit from Bitcoin's censorship resistance and data availability. Large numbers of low-value transactions may provide enough childchain fees combined through childchain miners to afford much higher mainchain fees like "batching for fees". The proposal also has benefits similar to proof of stake without relying on internal permissions or tokens, trusted distributions, or centralizing mechanisms like staking by simulating proof of work. It aims to allow for growing the Bitcoin ecosystem and replacing the need to create alternative cryptocurrencies just to make a new blockchain. The author is seeking a review for any overlooked issues or interest in creating a proof of concept.</summary>
