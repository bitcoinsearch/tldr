    <summary>The author suggests that "super-clusters" can defeat common input heuristics, making it difficult for chain analysis techniques to be used for enforcement. CoinJoins are seen as suspicious by adversaries, while PayJoin and CoinSwap are not noticeable. The author argues that the desire for privacy is assumed to be suspicious, but protocols or social change could solve the taint issue. The author suggests that PJ/CS does not solve the taint problem and only alters it, leading to similar problems for users. Therefore, a protocol or social change may be necessary to tackle the issue of privacy.</summary>
