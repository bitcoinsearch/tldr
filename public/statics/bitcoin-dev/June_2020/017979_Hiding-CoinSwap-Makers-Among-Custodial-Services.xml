    <title>Hiding CoinSwap Makers Among Custodial Services</title>

    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed a new technique to improve the privacy of CoinSwap users. The technique involves makers operating in rounds and using transaction batching to service multiple clients at once with a single transaction. The proposal aims to mitigate blockchain size issues that CoinSwap has and incentivize makers to adopt the technique as it reduces their overall transaction costs. This approach also spreads taint around and increases the effort that chain analysis must go through to identify what really happened. Ultimately, this technique can slow down the CoinSwap process, giving an opportunity for makers to use batching and improve user privacy.</summary>
