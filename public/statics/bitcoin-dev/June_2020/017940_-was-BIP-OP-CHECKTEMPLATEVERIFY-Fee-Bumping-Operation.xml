    <summary>A proposal was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a new type of transaction called PFN (Parent Fixing Nonce) that would allow for fixing stuck transactions by modifying their parent transactions. However, concerns were raised about the feasibility and complexity of implementing this proposal due to the need for a new index of all past transactions for consensus. In response, another proposal was suggested for a Fee Bump transaction that could target a list of TXIDs or one TXID representing all ancestors it wished to be included in a block with. This would make it similar to normal transactions for inclusion and could have some minimums for mempool inclusion. However, there were still questions about whether the sender of a PFN transaction could RBF (Replace-By-Fee) it or increase the fee for its parent transactions without being able to replace any other transactions besides their own.</summary>
