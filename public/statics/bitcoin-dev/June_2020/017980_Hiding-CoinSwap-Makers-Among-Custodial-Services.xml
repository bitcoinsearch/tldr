    <summary>In this email exchange, Chris and ZmnSCPxj discuss the idea of CoinSwappers slowing down the CoinSwap process to allow makers to use batching. The idea is not explicitly explained in the email, but it appears that CoinSwappers are some sort of intermediary entity in the CoinSwap process. By slowing down the process, makers would have more time to batch their transactions and potentially save on fees.The email exchange is brief and to the point, with ZmnSCPxj agreeing that Chris's summary is fair. However, there are a few important links provided in the email that could provide more context for those unfamiliar with the terms being used. The term "CoinSwap" refers to a specific type of transaction that allows users to swap one cryptocurrency for another without revealing their identities. Batching is a technique that allows multiple transactions to be combined into a single transaction to save on network fees.Overall, it seems that the email exchange is focused on potential improvements to the CoinSwap process, specifically with regards to how batching could be utilized. While the details are somewhat sparse, the conversation highlights the importance of optimizing transaction processes in the world of cryptocurrencies.</summary>
