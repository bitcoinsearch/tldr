    <summary>A new building block, called WabiSabi, has been introduced to enhance CoinJoins in a research study. Unlike blind signatures, WabiSabi uses keyed verification anonymous credentials for verifying honest participation of users in centrally coordinated CoinJoin protocols. Blind signatures require standard denominations associated with a key and cannot convey more than a single bit of information from the signer to the verifier, both of which are coordinators in this setting. On the other hand, anonymous credentials carry attributes like homomorphic value commitments as in Confidential Transactions.This is an early draft with a narrow scope, introducing the abstract building block of WabiSabi. The researchers have invited feedback and criticism about the scheme and its potential applications at this stage. However, they do not address the structure of CoinJoin transactions, fee structures, or other implementation details yet, but discussions on these aspects are welcome.WabiSabi's repository can be accessed at https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi, and the latest version is available at https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf.</summary>
