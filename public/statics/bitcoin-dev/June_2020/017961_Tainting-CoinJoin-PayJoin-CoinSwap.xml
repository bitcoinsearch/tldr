    <summary>The context discusses the concept of taint analysis in Bitcoin transactions and how it can be resisted by involving other parts of the Bitcoin economy. Tainted coins are less valuable than untainted coins, however, taint is not a consensus among all Bitcoin users. The people knocking on doors often have limited reach, which creates real economic barriers for them to impose taint globally. Thus, jurisdictional arbitrage deals will exist. Censorship resistance is what can protect against such an attacker, which can impose its own non-consensual view of taint practically globally. To improve censorship resistance, CoinJoin and CoinSwap can be used. They aggregate multiple UTXOs and create many new UTXOs to different clients with shared taint, which spreads taint. However, they improve the global resistance to a potential global attacker using taint analysis and improve censorship resistance.</summary>
