    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin's fungibility continues as users express concerns about the discrimination of "dirty" and "clean" Bitcoins. A user suggests that Bitcoin should be designed in a way that there is no distinction between these two types of coins, as fungibility is important. The user argues that Bitcoin should remain neutral and independent of government control, acting as censorship-resistant money to give people freedom from tyranny. The use of protocols like CoinJoin, CoinSwap, and PayJoin can offer plausible deniability to any blockchain analysis entities, making it difficult for them to determine the true nature of the transaction. The user believes that if "dirty" Bitcoins are an actual thing, anyone could pollute random people's Bitcoin addresses with "dirty" coins, making it impossible to prove if it is a self-transfer or an unsolicited donation. Finally, the user argues that UTXO censorship would not work because customers can simply use services that respect freedom and do not use censorship.</summary>
