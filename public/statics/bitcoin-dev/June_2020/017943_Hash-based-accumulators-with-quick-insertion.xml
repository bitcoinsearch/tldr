    <summary>A mathematician named Germán commented on a piece of work, saying that he found it interesting and would like to make time to read it. He also suggested a way to indirectly support addition and removal by formulating it as a difference of sets, which is similar to the concept of collision-resistant replicated data types (CRDTs). The suggestion involves checking for membership through CheckMembershipInAdditionSet &amp;&amp; !CheckMembershipInRemovalSet, assuming an item could only be added/removed once. Germán also mentioned the possibility of supporting multiple addition/removal by attaching a count of how many times it has been added, but this might break some of the building blocks in the paper.</summary>
