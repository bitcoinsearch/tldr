    <summary>In a recent conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Chris on June 13th, they discussed the idea of CoinSwappers slowing down the CoinSwap process to allow makers to use batching. This strategy will not only improve privacy by pretending to be a service provider which uses batching but also provide practical benefits for CoinSwap takers who want to slow down the process for greater privacy. By being prepared to wait longer, the takers can save on miner fees as well.</summary>
