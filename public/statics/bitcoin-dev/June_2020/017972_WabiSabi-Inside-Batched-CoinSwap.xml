    <summary>In a cryptocurrency transaction scenario, Alice creates an unsigned funding transaction to MuSig(Alice, Macky), and then she and Macky create a backout transaction with `nLockTime` at L2. The plain MuSig signing ritual is completed before Alice broadcasts the original funding transaction. However, it was discovered that the taker funding transactions should have a nearer locktime L1, and the maker funding transactions should have a later locktime L2. This change will force Macky to claim the incoming funds earlier, which in turn unlocks the outgoing payout transaction when claimed.</summary>
