    <summary>Antoine proposed an AltNet+Watchdog proposal in Core that covers the need for a driver framework to plug alternative transport protocols such as radio, DNS, LN Noise, and Tor's Snowflake. The proposal is more generic than just pure LN as privacy-concerned users may want to broadcast their transactions over radio. For LN support, the proposal should detect network/block issuance anomalies, dynamically react by closing channels, fetch headers/blocks through redundant communication channels, and provide emergency transactions broadcast if time-sensitive transactions are censored. The proposal is a work in progress, and getting opt-in support in Core would make it easier for any LN routing/vaulting node to deploy it.  ZmnSCPxj suggested having a separate software daemon that performs de-eclipsing for Bitcoin full nodes. This deeclipser can use a plugin system and isolate the plugins from the main fullnode software. The deeclipser could query multiple plugins, including trying to connect to random nodes, polling known blockchain explorers, using their APIs over HTTPS (possibly over Tor), and connecting to Electrum servers. New plugins can be developed for new mitigations such as sending headers over DNS or blocks over mesh. By running a separate daemon from the fullnode, some amount of process isolation exists in case of problems with the plugin system. The P2P protocol can be used so that the fullnode run could be a non-Bitcoin-Core fullnode, such as btcd or rust-bitcoin.</summary>
