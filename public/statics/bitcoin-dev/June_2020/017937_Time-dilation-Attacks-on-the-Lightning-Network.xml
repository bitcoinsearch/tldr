    <summary>The issue of eclipsing Bitcoin nodes being risky has been raised, with a recommendation to mitigate it by running a Bitcoin fullnode on clearnet and a Lightning node over Tor. While there is a risk of running a Bitcoin node over Tor, the recommendation is to run both nodes separately to make them harder to attack. It is also suggested that those without public IP addresses can only be accessible through a Tor hidden service, which is the only Lightning-supported option. Checking that absolute timelocks are far in the future compared to the current blockheight is another way to determine if an incoming payment violates the max CLTV. However, it's important to note that different types of node eclipses require different mitigations.</summary>
