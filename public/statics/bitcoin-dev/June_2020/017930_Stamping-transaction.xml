    <summary>Mostafa has proposed a simple yet impactful idea of stamping transactions by putting the previous block hash in the transaction header. This technique can decouple translation from the block. He has explained his idea in detail on his website and suggests that the bitcoin developers consider it for the next big change, even though they tend to not change the core.</summary>
