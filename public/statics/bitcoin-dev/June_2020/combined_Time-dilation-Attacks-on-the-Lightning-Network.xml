    <summary>The article discusses different attacks on the Lightning Network and their mitigations. Gleb Naumenko and Antoine Riard have explored time-dilation attacks on Lightning and written a blog post and paper detailing their findings. They demonstrate three ways an attacker can steal funds and discuss countermeasures which may increase the attack cost. The article also suggests running a Bitcoin full node on clearnet while running a Lightning node over Tor as a mitigation strategy to prevent eclipsing of Bitcoin nodes. It is suggested that if a Lightning node is behind in its Bitcoin blockchain view, the victim could check that the absolute timelocks seem very far in the future relative to its own view of the current blockheight. However, it's important to note that different types of node eclipses require different mitigations. Antoine proposed an AltNet+Watchdog proposal in Core that covers the need for a driver framework to plug alternative transport protocols such as radio, DNS, LN Noise, and Tor's Snowflake.The email suggests the idea of having a separate software daemon for de-eclipsing in Bitcoin fullnodes. The proposed setup involves running this deeclipser on the same hardware as the Bitcoin fullnode and having the deeclipser bind to port 8334, which would be connected to by the fullnode using normal P2P protocol. Using the P2P protocol also means the fullnode can be a non-Bitcoin-Core fullnode, such as btcd or rust-bitcoin.The discussion in this context is about the proposal of a decentralized anonymizer network, which is different from the Tor network. The author argues that the Tor network is weakened due to its dependence on a limited set of exit nodes and its centralized structure. The proposal suggests using "direct" within-Tor rendezvous points or Tor hidden services, which can hide that a bitcoin node is being operated. It also includes light clients that can act as relays. The convergence link is provided to explain how even with a reduced set of peers, it becomes difficult to know who is doing what and whom is talking to whom. However, running mixed Bitcoin and/or LN nodes in clearnet and Tor, with or without different IPs, is not difficult for a Tor attacker to identify. The research presented in the email thread discusses a time-dilation attack on concurrent transactions that use timelocks, which can be performed with just one channel to the victim. The proposal suggests using "direct" within-Tor rendezvous points or Tor hidden services to create a network where nodes are anonymizing themselves, which can hide that a bitcoin node is being operated. The article discusses an attack on the Lightning Network that targets per-hop packet delay. The attacker routes via the victim, who should have at least two channels with the attacker. Furthermore, it is suggested that if a node doesn't observe a block within the last 30 minutes, it attempts to make a new random connection to someone in the network. The Tor network's dependence on a limited set of exit nodes weakens its security. One solution could be to make a bridge between Tor and clearnet by running two fullnodes on the computer. However, the eclipse attacker could still attack all Tor exit nodes and block outgoing transaction traffic to perform eclipse attacks.In conclusion, the general advice is to not use the Tor network for services it is not designed for, as it may lead to unintended consequences such as increased vulnerability to attacks. Running mixed Bitcoin and/or LN nodes in clearnet and Tor, with or without different IPs, is not difficult for a Tor attacker to identify. It is suggested to run Bitcoin full nodes and Lightning nodes on separate hardware and use a separate daemon for de-eclipsing. Additionally, it is important to consider the proposed solutions' limitations before implementing them.</summary>
