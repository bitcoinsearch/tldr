    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the bitcoin community, discusses an unstated assumption in Bitcoin that miners are short-sighted. This is due to factors such as the deployment of new mining hardware not being controlled by them which could potentially lead to transactions being taken by someone else and sudden changes in hashpower distribution resulting in reduced future earnings. However, this analysis assumes constant difficulty and within a day time frame, these factors are not expected to change dramatically. ZmnSCPxj also suggests an alternative scenario to MAD-HTLC where Alice already knows that Bob will take funds at locktime L, thus offering the entire fund minus one satoshi to miners at time L-1. If Bob tries beating this offer, it earns nothing and has performed an attack for no benefit. MAD-HTLC ensures that Bob's misbehavior leads to loss of the fidelity bond and can be implemented with OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY.</summary>
