    <summary>In an email exchange between Jorge Timón and Jeff Garzik on April 12, 2012, they discuss the issue of dropped transactions in Bitcoin. Garzik proposed four solutions for keeping transactions from being dropped, including N = 1 or 2, H1 = height of block chain when a transaction is received, H2 = H1 + (144 * N), and dropping the transaction if it has not made it into a block by the time the block chain reaches H2. Timón suggested adding a field expiration_block = H2 to the transaction instead, but Garzik argued that this would require the client to rewrite the transaction for each retransmit, which would be bad. Timón also asked if different peers get different H1 for the same transaction, to which Garzik responded that it is possible, but unlikely.</summary>
