    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter Vessenes suggests that CoinLab publish a "cost of subverting 1-n transactions with 90% probability" metric to help understand the number. He discusses the various ways to double-spend in Bitcoin, including buying multiple VPS's with different IP addresses and flooding the network faster with multiple nodes. He notes that trusted identities could be used for the Bitcoin flood network, which might prevent sybil attacks and provide guarantees of behavior from nodes. They discuss the amount of confirmation needed for large-volume transactions and how more difficulty shortens the safe time for such transactions. Finally, they inquire about the current implementation of replacement transactions and whether it is unimplemented or deprecated.</summary>
