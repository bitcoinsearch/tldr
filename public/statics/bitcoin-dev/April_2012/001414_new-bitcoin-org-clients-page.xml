    <summary>In an email exchange, Alan Reiner asked Amir Taaki about a screenshot of the Bitcoin page he was unable to access. Amir suggested using CTRL-F5 to refresh the browser and clarified that the order he added the clients in were Bitcoin-Qt, Armory, Electrum, and MultiBit. They discussed the descriptions for each client, and Amir explained that he tried to emphasize a theme for each one. For example, Bitcoin-Qt is stability, Armory is advanced, Electrum is convenient, and MultiBit is ease of use. Alan gave feedback on the descriptions for Armory, saying that it should mention the offline wallet feature, and for backups, it should mention the one-time printable feature. He also suggested that Bitcoin-Qt should go first on the list since it's the "reference" client and has the most quality control and stability. Finally, Amir shared a link to the new bitcoin.org clients page.</summary>
