    <summary>Jeff has requested for a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) related to the pong message. The link provided directs to the Bitcoin Wiki where BIP 0031 is described in detail. BIP 0031 specifies rules for handling the pong message, which is used to check if a connection between two nodes is still active. The proposal includes detailed technical specifications and guidelines for implementing these rules. By following these standards, developers can ensure that their implementations of Bitcoin are compatible with each other, improving the overall quality and reliability of the network.</summary>
