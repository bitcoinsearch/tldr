    <summary>The email conversation is regarding a proposal to add request/reply id in all messages of the Bitcoin protocol. The original idea was to make it easier to implement robust blockchain downloading by adding context information that allows for better handling of response and request messages. Jeff Garzik, the email recipient, argues against the proposal stating that the problems with waiting for "inv" messages and distinguishing between "getblocks" results and spontaneous "inv" notifications can be handled properly without adding "requestid" fields. He also suggests that stateless protocols are easier to implement and prove correct than stateful ones like this proposal. Jeff warns that by relying on another node to maintain one's state, nodes open themselves up to exploitation.</summary>
