    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and others, the topic of direct payee-to-payer communication arises. It is noted that the original design of Bitcoin had envisioned the pay-to-IP address mode as the normal way to make payments, but it was removed due to its unreliability and detrimental effect on privacy. However, there is a suggestion that direct communication should be done via a separate protocol than the Bitcoin P2P protocol. Andreas notes that Bitcoin Wallet for Android already supports directly sending transactions via NFC and QR-Code, with receiving such transactions handled the same way as if received via P2P. The transaction can be broadcast into the P2P network by the receiver, meaning the sender does not need internet access at the moment of payment.</summary>
