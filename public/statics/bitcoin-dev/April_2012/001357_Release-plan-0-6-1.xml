    <summary>The merge window for pull requests for a 0.6.1 release is now open and the goal is to have RC1 binaries available for testing in three weeks on April 23. This will be a bug-fix and code-cleanup only release, aiming to resolve major issues such as the client crashing with a correct passphrase (#1024) and bitcoin-qt being slow to shut down after recent commits (#1012). There are currently 189 open issues in the bug tracker and the aim is to get that number under 100. The goal of a quick release cycle is to start pulling new features for a 0.7 release in a month or so. If testers want their favorite feature to be included in bitcoin core faster, they should spend some time testing other people's favorite features as adequate testing is still the biggest issue.</summary>
