    <summary>In the given context, the speaker is suggesting that a certain function should have an assert as its first check. This is because there is a problem if the said function is called a coinbase tx. The details of what the function does and how it relates to coinbase tx are not provided. It is unclear who the speaker is addressing or in what context the conversation is taking place. It can be assumed that the conversation is related to software development due to the use of technical terms such as "function" and "assert". Further information is needed to fully understand the context and implications of the statement.</summary>
