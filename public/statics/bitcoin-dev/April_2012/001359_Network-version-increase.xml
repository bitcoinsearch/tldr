    <summary>On April 2, 2012, Jeff Garzik initiated a discussion about the numbering scheme currently used, which is 60000. Pieter Wuille suggested either increasing the number by one for every change or first cleaning up to 100000 and then starting from there. Jeff Garzik opined that it would be nice to have 100000 as the baseline frozen protocol. Wladimir agreed with the idea of increasing the number by one for now and not getting ahead of themselves.</summary>
