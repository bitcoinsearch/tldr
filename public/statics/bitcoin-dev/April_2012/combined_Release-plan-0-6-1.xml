    <summary>Bitcoin Core has opened the merge window for pull requests for a 0.6.1 release with the goal of having RC1 binaries available for testing in three weeks on April 23. The release aims to fix major issues, such as the client crashing with a correct passphrase and bitcoin-qt being slow to shut down after recent commits. Currently, there are 189 open issues in the bug tracker, and the aim is to reduce that number to under 100.The purpose of the quick release cycle is to begin pulling new features for a 0.7 release within a month or so. Testers can help speed up the process by spending time testing other people's favorite features, as adequate testing remains the biggest issue.</summary>
