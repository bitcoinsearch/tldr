    <summary>In an email thread discussing the possible implementation of a change to make bitcoin transactions more deterministic and predictable from a user standpoint, Jeff Garzik proposed removing transactions from the memory pool if they have not made it into a block for a specific period, ultimately giving the ability to tell bitcoin users that their transactions "expire" after a certain number of days. While this would only impact a small amount of transactions, it opens the door to deterministic transaction behavior. However, one concern is that users may exploit this behavior by creating transactions they know will get stuck and expire, similar to canceling zero-conf transactions, though this could potentially be detected by the recipient and flagged. Overall, this proposal could lead to better wallet/coin recovery and resending options for expired transactions.</summary>
