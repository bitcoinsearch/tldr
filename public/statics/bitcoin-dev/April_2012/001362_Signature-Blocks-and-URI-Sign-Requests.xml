    <summary>In a recent discussion about signature blocks and BIP 10, Gavin Andresen suggested that instead of reinventing the wheel, we should try to extend existing standards whenever possible. He proposed the idea of encoding signature blocks or BIP-10 transactions using S/MIME or any other appropriate "sign a message" standard to avoid the need for creating new solutions. Although he acknowledged the little details involved in character encoding, he believes it's better to leverage all the work already done by the IETF in nailing down those details rather than coming up with our own solutions.</summary>
