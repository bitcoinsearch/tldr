    <summary>The context is related to the Bitcoin protocol and its implementation. It states that making a second "getblocks" request, which is used to retrieve blocks from a peer node, will not result in more "inv" replies as the client prevents retransmits. However, the current prototype implementation modifies this behavior and always results in one "inv" with [0-500] elements. Additionally, it removes the filtering on previously transmitted block invs. The patch for this modification can be found on the GitHub repository of the Bitcoin project at https://github.com/sirk390/bitcoin/commit/17a27e3d56efa107697b53c193364a33951f1dd1.</summary>
