    <summary>Thiago, a developer, announced that he will integrate BitcoinJS into Diaspora, and the server side will be based on libcoin. He also mentioned that this code will be part of Diaspora, and every single Diaspora* Pod will be able to host its own users' wallets. Thiago appreciated any help during this development. In response to Thiago's post, Michael Grønager posted a solution to an error in compiling libcoin.</summary>
