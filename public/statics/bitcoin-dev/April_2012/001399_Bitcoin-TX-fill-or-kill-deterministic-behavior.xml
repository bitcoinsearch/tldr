    <summary>Jeff Garzik proposed a new method for Bitcoin transactions on 4/12/12. He suggested that instead of using a constant of 144 * N to determine when to drop a transaction from the memory pool, a field expiration_block = H2 could be added instead. This would make the process more explicit and flexible. However, there was a concern that different peers may have different values for H1 for the same transaction. It is unclear whether this issue was resolved.</summary>
