    <summary>In a discussion on Monday, April 02, 2012 4:55:03 PM, Alan Reiner requested thoughts on the topic at hand. The topic being discussed was the sign-request URI and how it related to the existing bitcoin: URI scheme. It was suggested that the sign-request URI should be an extension of the bitcoin: URI scheme to simplify the process by allowing sigNeeded to be omitted and implying "sign with a sending address".</summary>
