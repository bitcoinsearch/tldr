    <summary>In an email thread from April 2012, Alan Reiner expressed concerns about users exploiting the behavior of creating transactions that they know will get stuck and expire. He compared it to canceling zero-conf transactions, stating that if it's too easy for users to create these types of transactions, it defeats the purpose. However, he also mentioned that if the conditions are deterministic enough, the recipient could detect and flag them. Jeff Garzik responded to the thread, stating that expiration already occurs at random due to nodes shutting down and restarting or logging on and off the network.</summary>
