    <summary>On April 12, 2012, Jeff Garzik expressed his concern about the non-deterministic nature of transactions in Bitcoin. He suggested that removing transactions from the memory pool if they haven't made it to a block for a couple of days would make transactions more predictable. Garzik also proposed a change in the transaction announcement protocol to include the block the user wants to base on. This change would protect against double spends without needing confirmation and make expiry from the memory pool easy. Retransmission of transactions is possible with the updated base.</summary>
