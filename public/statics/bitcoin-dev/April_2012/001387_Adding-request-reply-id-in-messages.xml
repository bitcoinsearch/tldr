    <summary>The author of a proposal is defending it against claims that it would make the protocol more stateful. They argue that each reply is only the result of the current request and there is no new session information. Another individual suggests that while they are not against the basic idea, there is still state involved in the proposal as certain commands require keeping track of previous requests. However, the author argues that many of the described commands already have a natural nonce and therefore do not need special administration.</summary>
