    <summary>The email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik discusses the concept of chain transactions, network fee requirements, market-based fees and negotiation. They also discuss the idea of sending transactions directly to merchants and the need for more direct communication between payee and payer. Mike Hearn suggests that transactions should be passed around outside of the broadcast network, with the transactions and their dependencies being broadcast only when there's a lack of trust between recipient and sender. He notes that the original Bitcoin design had participants communicating directly and that the pendulum could easily swing back the other way. Jeff Garzik agrees but suggests that these sorts of payments and direct communication should be done via a wholly separate protocol than the bitcoin P2P protocol. He suggests that some HTTP derivative would probably make life easier for mobile payments and firewalled scenarios, and for client-&gt;merchant communications, for instance.</summary>
