    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposed protocol improvement for Bitcoin, which would add a new "requestid" field in messages and define how to use it. The proposal aims to make blockchain downloading more robust by adding context information to help distinguish between responses to "getblocks" requests and spontaneous "inv" notifications. However, some members of the email thread are against the change, arguing that stateless protocols are easier to implement and prove correct. Additionally, they express concern about the cost of implementing any protocol change and the potential for opening up nodes to exploitation if they start relying on external parties for state maintenance. Despite concerns, the discussion highlights the importance of ensuring the reliability and security of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
