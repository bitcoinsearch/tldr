    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Luke-Jr on April 3, 2012, they discussed the concept of avoiding reinventing the wheel when it comes to extending existing standards. The suggestion was made to use PGP/EC for signing and verifying messages instead of creating new standards. This option has advantages such as an already existing web-of-trust and keyserver infrastructure. However, Wladimir expressed concern that incorporating signing message functionality into Bitcoin could lead to dragging in unnecessary features. He felt that while signing messages is fine for logging into a website, anything more than that, such as handling different character encodings, would be going too far.</summary>
