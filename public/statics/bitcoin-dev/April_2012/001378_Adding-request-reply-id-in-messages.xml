    <summary>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Gavin Andresen, the topic of adding request/reply ID to all messages in the Bitcoin protocol was discussed. While Andresen believed it was a reasonable improvement, Wuille pointed out that the Bitcoin P2P protocol is mostly stateless, which makes it more secure. Additionally, he noted that attempting to use a request-reply system may not be as intuitive as it seems since the protocol is not fully based on such a system. Wuille suggested the addition of a "denied" message to indicate when a client is unwilling to answer, which could also report transactions that are not accepted into the memory pool.</summary>
