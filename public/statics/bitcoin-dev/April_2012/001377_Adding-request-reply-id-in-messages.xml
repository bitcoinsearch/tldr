    <summary>On April 12, 2012, Gavin Andresen posted on the bitcoin developers' mailing list regarding a proposed improvement to the bitcoin protocol. Christian Bodt suggested adding a request/reply ID in all messages, similar to what was done for the "checksum" field. Andresen stated that he found the proposal reasonable and asked for others' opinions. However, Pieter Wuille, another developer, pointed out that the bitcoin P2P protocol is not fully request-reply based and trying to use it that way may be less intuitive than it looks. For example, doing a second identical "getblocks" request will not result in more "inv" replies, as the client prevents retransmits. Wuille suggested that an extra "denied" message should also be included if the client is unwilling to answer, which may also be used to report transactions that are not accepted into the memory pool.</summary>
