    <summary>In an email thread on April 2, 2012, Pieter Wuille asked for opinions about a numbering scheme. The current value being used was 60000 and there were two options proposed - either to start increasing the number by one for every change or to perform a "cleanup" to 100000 first and then increment from there. Jeff Garzik expressed his preference for having 100000 as the baseline, or a "frozen" protocol.</summary>
