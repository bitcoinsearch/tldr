    <summary>The proposal is made to make Bitcoin transaction more predictable. Transactions in the current system can easily remain in limbo forever. The idea is to remove transactions from the memory pool if they haven't made it into a block for a couple of days; this will allow bitcoin users to be notified that their transactions "expire" after N days. It is suggested that clients may implement code that notices a TX has expired, assuming they themselves have stopped retransmitting it. Backwards compatibility should not be an issue as clients are free to retransmit their TX at any time, as usual, thereby "resetting the clock" for all peers who have forgotten the TX in question.</summary>
