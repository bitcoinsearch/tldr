    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal to improve the availability of blocks in the Bitcoin system. The proposal suggests advertising hash in addition to the size in the header block, which would help nodes reject downloads if they already have a matching block to save bandwidth. Wladimir agrees that it would make sense for clients to be able to reject blocks they already have. However, he points out that introducing a new feature like this can cause maintenance and compatibility issues.Another part of the proposal is to allow nodes to request upload and download blocks that have already been partially downloaded. However, Wladimir thinks that introducing a BIP for this is unnecessary as users can simply download the blockchain from an HTTP server or pass it along on a USB stick. He suggests that running a lightweight node like Electrum could be a better option for those with restrictive or slow internet connections.In conclusion, the email exchange emphasizes that not every aspect of the Bitcoin system needs optimization, and developers should focus on significant improvements while keeping everything working with minimal changes.</summary>
