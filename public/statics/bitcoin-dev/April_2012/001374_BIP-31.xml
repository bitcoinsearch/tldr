    <summary>On April 11, 2012, a discussion was held between Luke-Jr and Mike Hearn regarding the implementation of a BIP for the pong message. Mike provided a link to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0031 on the en.bitcoin.it wiki. However, Luke-Jr had previously suggested using the protocol version bump 60001 instead. Pull #1081 was referenced as making a few minor revisions along these lines. Jeff Garzik, founder of exMULTI, Inc., also participated in the discussion and stated that he had given his approval to Mike's original pull.</summary>
