    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposed soft-fork to fix a vulnerability in Bitcoin caused by the use of OP_CODESEPARATOR in transactions. The original poster argues that this could result in users losing funds if their transactions are deemed non-standard and prevented from being mined. He proposes an alternative solution, whereby the weight of a transaction is increased based on the number of OP_CODESEPARATORs executed, or a limit is placed on the maximum number of such executions. The response from another participant notes that non-standardness is meant to make soft-forks safer and solicit feedback, and that disabling the relay of such transactions partially mitigates the vulnerability until a proper fix can be implemented. They also discuss concerns around complexity and efficiency, and the importance of not invalidating secure transactions. The email thread highlights the need for caution when making changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and the potential risks involved in doing so.</summary>
