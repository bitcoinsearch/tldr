    <summary>In an email exchange, Varunram expressed concern over running a common signet (Signet1) controlled by a trusted entity. He worried that the maintainer's unscheduled work or emergencies could affect the testing process and that people would need to run Signet1 nodes in parallel with current testnet nodes. However, the original email sender assumed that the signer would run an automated script to generate blocks on regular intervals and that the signer would also run a faucet service for users to get coins as needed. The assumption was that even if the signer went on vacation, the network would continue to function. Ultimately, if a signer became unreliable, people could set up a new signet with a different signer and use that instead.</summary>
