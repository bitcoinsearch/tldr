    <summary>The author explains a method they have used to solve a problem involving submitting transactions and collecting reject messages. The method involves waiting for a certain amount of time before processing errors, and checking for the submitted transaction through the mempool. This approach works well in testing, but new transaction types generate reject codes 100% of the time, making this approach necessary. The author suggests that a new reject code for RBF based too small of fee would improve the user experience. Removing reject codes entirely would lead to a worse user experience, as it would be difficult to determine why a transaction failed without waiting for a full timeout. In response to a question about handling reject messages in Android Bitcoin Wallet and BitcoinJ, the author provides a link to the relevant code in BitcoinJ.</summary>
