    <title>Notice: List Infrastructure Migration</title>
    <updated>2023-06-13T17:47:15.860293+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016785.html" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>Starting this week, Bitcoin-oriented lists such as bitcoin-dev and lightning-dev will begin migrating from https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo to the Linux Foundation's new list infrastructure operated by groups.io. The exact switch-over date is unclear at the moment, but users are advised to unsubscribe prior to migration if they do not wish to be auto-subscribed to the new list management system. While each list is notified that migration is complete, users may continue to use these lists as-is. Archives are of utmost importance for prior art and historic value. A plan is being worked out with the Linux Foundation sysadmins to ensure that the current archive permalinks remain static or redirected to the correct post that lives at a new archive. The new archive will be operated independently outside from the Linux Foundation using an open source tool. This will allow all future archives to stay in place even if the underlying list infrastructure needs to change. Users can benefit from the search function and git clone for a local instance. Further details will be posted soon.</summary>
