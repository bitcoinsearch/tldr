    <summary>In a recent conversation, ZmnSCPxj shared insights on the disadvantages of maximizing privacy. According to him, doing a new signature for every in-flight HTLC every time the state is updated could be a lot of signatures for very active channels. However, he noted that this is already true for current Poon-Dryja channels in BOLT 1.0, so it is not a degradation of performance. He further explained that this modified form of Decker-Russell-Osuntokun might be less attractive for use with DLC as the Fulgurite effort would like. Nonetheless, they can mitigate this by splitting a channel into two sub-channels. One is for high-activity LN payments, and the other is for rare-activity DLC bets.</summary>
