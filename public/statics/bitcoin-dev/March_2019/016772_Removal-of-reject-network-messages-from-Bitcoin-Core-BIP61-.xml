    <summary>The user expressed their desire to comprehend a particular code and its functionality. They found it easier to read the code themselves than ask for explanations. The context specifically mentions the handling of reject messages in Android Bitcoin Wallet and BitcoinJ. However, upon inspection of the code, no specific handlers were found other than logging exceptions. To gain further understanding, the user requested assistance in locating where such handlers might be present in the code. A link to the relevant code was provided - https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/bitcoinj/core/TransactionBroadcast.java#L93-L108.</summary>
