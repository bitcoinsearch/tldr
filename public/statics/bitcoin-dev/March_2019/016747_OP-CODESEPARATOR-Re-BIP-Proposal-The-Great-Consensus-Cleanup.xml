    <summary>A proposal was made to lock in a blockheight to get rid of it 10 years in the future and use it as press that Bitcoin is going to lose $1,000,000 if some mystery person does not put their transaction through by then. However, there were concerns about the complexity of this proposal, as well as the fact that for a user to be adversely affected, they probably have to have pre-signed lock-timed transactions. Additionally, it was noted that OP_CODESEPARATOR in non-segwit scripts represents a significant vulnerability in Bitcoin today, and lots of effort has gone into attempting to find practical use-cases for its specific construction, with no successes as of yet. There was a suggestion to increase the transactions weight suitably as to temper the vulnerability caused by it or to add some sort of limit on the maximum number of OP_CODESEPARATORs allowed to be executed per script. However, any such limit could render some moderately-large transaction unspendable, so the argument for this was met with skepticism.</summary>
