    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Andreas Schildbach discusses the handling of reject messages in current code. He explains that these cases are already understood and handled by current code. The idea is to take reject messages seriously but not to overrate their lack. Network confirmations fill the gap. Gregory Maxwell requests further information and asks where in the code reject messages are handled. Andreas responds that it's implemented in bitcoinj's TransactionBroadcast class. If a certain consensus (currently: half of connected peers) is reached, received reject messages are collected and a RejectedTransactionException is raised.Andreas acknowledges that the handling of this exception in Bitcoin Wallet is extremely rudimentary and only shows the exception message. However, he hopes to improve on this soon.</summary>
