    <summary>The author of the email is proposing a code that would put the signature in the coinbase transaction, similar to witness commitment. However, there may be potential issues with this approach, as it could make DoS attacks easier. The solution proposed by David A. Harding is for people to connect their lite client to a trusted node or nodes on signet. The proper signer will be slower than the fake miner because of the signature being stuffed into the coinbase transaction. The true miner now has to create a block, sign it, and check if hash. There's a post from Maxwell that could be the idea Corallo is describing. The author then suggests setting up an interface where anyone could "order" reorgs whenever they wanted to.</summary>
