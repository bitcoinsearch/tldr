    <summary>Jacob Eliosoff inquired about the purpose of making OP_CODESEPARATOR non-standard if disabling it is not the objective. The response given was that it was done to reduce the risk of vulnerability caused by OP_CODESEPARATOR while a patch is being considered. This measure was taken to prevent it from being misused or mined easily.</summary>
