    <summary>The conversation around Bitcoin privacy has led to discussions about Payjoin and concerns over privacy leaks. When a user has 1 BTC in a single address and makes a Payjoin payment, the recipient can see the change address with an amount of 0.9 BTC on a blockchain explorer, posing a serious privacy issue. A standard solution could be implemented to prevent this by having an automatic splitting transaction when a wallet receives high amounts of Bitcoin, but this may not be practical for everyday users due to large and cost-ineffective transactions. Users who prioritize privacy can enable an auto-splitting feature in the wallet that automatically splits high-value BTC amounts into several addresses, which could work with small amount addresses and Payjoin to provide real privacy to Bitcoin users.However, there are tradeoffs involved in coin selection, utxo management, and payjoin contributed input selection, making it important for each individual user to consider their own needs when using their wallet. The discussion also highlights the impracticality of "pre-fragmenting" wallets to enhance privacy in Bitcoin transactions. ZeroLink post-mix wallets must prevent joining inputs together, limiting the maximum amount the user can pay. One solution could be to split one of multiple post-mix coins or support a Payjoin as either receiver or sender. If both ZeroLink and Payjoin become commonly used, it may become common for a Chaumian CoinJoin mix transaction to have outputs that merge into Payjoin two-input two-output transactions, allowing a ZeroLink post-mix wallet some limited amount of merging its post-mix UTXOs.</summary>
