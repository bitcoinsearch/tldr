    <summary>In this email conversation, ZmnSCPxj and Anthony Towns are discussing the use of `OP_CSV` in a settlement branch. ZmnSCPxj suggests using `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP  OP_CHECKDLSVERIFY  OP_CHECKDLS` instead of codeseparator for settlmenet txs as well as update txs. However, he encounters issues regarding the lack of `OP_CSV` in the settlement branch.Anthony suggests that relative timelock can be enforced in the settlement branch by refusing to sign a settlement tx that doesn't have the timelock set, rendering `OP_CSV` redundant. He also points out that because BIP-68 is enforced by consensus, update-1 isn't immediately spendable by settlement-1.</summary>
