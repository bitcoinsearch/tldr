    <summary>In an email conversation on March 12, 2019, Andreas Schildbach via bitcoin-dev explained that current code handles reject messages for Bitcoin transactions. However, he emphasized the importance of not overrating the lack of such messages and relying on network confirmations to fill any gaps. A timeout is also implemented as a backup measure. The person who received the email expressed a desire to understand this concept better by reading the code rather than asking questions. They attempted to find the handling of reject messages in Android Bitcoin Wallet and BitcoinJ but only found exceptions being logged. The person requested pointers to where in the code reject messages are handled.</summary>
