    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list recently discussed the idea of a proprietary extension to Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT). There were differing opinions on the matter, with Andrew Chow expressing concern that such an extension would go against the central idea of PSBT - containing everything required to construct a transaction. He argued that it is not reasonable to rely on parties in the transaction to remember details and have state.However, some participants disagreed and suggested that a proprietary extension could be used as long as it is only between their own systems or with a translator to talk to ordinary PSBT stuff. To address this issue, the participants proposed the addition of a versioning field to indicate the specific PSBT dialect being used. This would allow for better error messages and help identify any incompatible versions.It was also suggested that a table whose key is only 0xFF should be used as a "proprietary version field" with unspecified semantics, but with the understanding that specific users might stick a GUID or something in there as a way to recognize their own PSBTs. Andrew Poelstra's proposal includes adding several new fields to PSBT protocol, including an additional field to PSBT_GLOBAL_UNSIGNED_TX table containing only a txid of the unsigned transaction, a version field to the global table, and various fields for per-input and per-output tables. These include maps from SHA2 hashes to their 32-byte pre-images, maps from public keys to 32-byte "tweaks," and maps from signatures to sign-to-contract tweaks. Poelstra notes that some of these suggestions are premature and need further development and standardization of related protocols.Finally, Poelstra proposes adding a field (or family of fields) to every table that is "proprietary use" and guaranteed not to be defined by any future PSBT extension. Specifically, every field with key-type 0xFF could be considered "proprietary". The discussion highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity and compatibility of PSBT, while also allowing space for innovation and customization for specific use cases.</summary>
