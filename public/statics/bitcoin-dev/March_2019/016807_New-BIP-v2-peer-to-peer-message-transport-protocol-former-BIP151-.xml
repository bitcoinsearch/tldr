    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed the v2 messages structure, which includes a field size, description, data type, and comments for each message. The command field must start with a byte that defines the length of the ASCII command string up to 12 chars or a short command ID. Short command IDs are supported for high-frequency message types, but they are optional and may be negotiated between peers. Currently, there are only 26 different types of messages, so it may be better to make short command IDs a one-byte fixed-length field rather than dealing with variable size, mapping negotiation, per-peer mapping, and dual-logic processing. The list of all net message types in the src/protocol.cpp file was also shared.</summary>
