    <summary>Dear Varunram,Thank you for your email regarding the Signet idea. I agree that using a signet would be beneficial in testing reorgs without having to experiment with regtest. However, there are concerns about running a common signet (Signet1) controlled by a trusted entity. To test Signet on a global scale, individuals could spin up nodes in various locations and use centralised services like AWS since it is already trusted. It is also important to note that the maintainer may have unscheduled work or emergencies that could impact how people test on the Signet. In this case, people would need to run Signet1 nodes in parallel with current testnet nodes. While some may argue that Signet is trusted and this does not matter, it is still important to consider the potential issues that may arise. I appreciate your concerns and thoughts on this matter. Please let me know if you have any further questions or suggestions.Best regards,Kalle.</summary>
