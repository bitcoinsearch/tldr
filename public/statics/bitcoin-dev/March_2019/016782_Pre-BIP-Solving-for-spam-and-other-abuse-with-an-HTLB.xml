    <summary>Alistair Mann has collected community feedback on his proposal for a BIP on "Good Behaviour Bonds". On the mailing list, ZmnSCPxj suggests that HTLB over HTLC can improve privacy by obscuring the type of transaction. A modification is suggested to ensure that the redundant and [HASHOP] be not standardized, as this would enable better privacy. On Reddit, a user named /u/almkglor suggests that Bob could immediately fail the HTLB to Alice's benefit, which could be done with a new script. The proof-of-concept code will be modified to investigate and prove this change. @mappum on Twitter observes that the HTLB idea is "like proof-of-stake", which Alistair Mann finds useful despite HTLB having nothing to do with mining and PoS consensus. Alistair Mann expresses gratitude to those who contributed, including the 60+ non-bot visitors to the berewic.com site, stating that quiet interest is positive. Assuming no other major changes, the next update will be a formal write-up for the BIP.</summary>
