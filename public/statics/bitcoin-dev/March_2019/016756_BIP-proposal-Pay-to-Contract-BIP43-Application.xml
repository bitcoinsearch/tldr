    <summary>ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about the possibility of an attacker finding two contracts whose derivations alias each other and the possibility of multiple contracting systems. He shared this concern on GitHub and bitcoin-dev mailing list. Omar Shibli responded to Gregory Maxwell's feedback with some fixes which he submitted on Github. Omar Shibli further expressed his opinion that the security fix was redundant. In August 2017, Omar Shibli shared his method for embedding cryptographic signatures into a public key based on HD Wallets - BIP32, in a trade finance application. He proposed defining various levels in BIP32 path to compute child public keys and addresses. He also provided an example of contract commitment address computation. However, Gregory Maxwell found this construction insecure and mentioned a scenario where an attacker could take a payment made to one pubkey and assert it was a payment made to another pubkey. Gregory also pointed out that the proposal did not address durability issues. Omar Shibli updated the BIP to address Gregory's concerns.</summary>
