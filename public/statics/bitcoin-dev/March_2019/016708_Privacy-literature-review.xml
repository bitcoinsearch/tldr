    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin community, Ádám Ficsór, expressed appreciation for Chris Belcher's work on a literature review for Bitcoin privacy. The review, which can be found on the Bitcoin Wiki, covers all privacy issues in Bitcoin, including the Lightning network, and includes examples to demonstrate how the concepts work in practice. Belcher also created a new wiki category with smaller related articles. Ficsór noted that he is contributing to the same cause through presentations, starting with a two-part series that will eventually become a six-part presentation series. Part one focuses on network level privacy, while part two concentrates on blockchain level privacy. Links to the presentations are included in the message.</summary>
