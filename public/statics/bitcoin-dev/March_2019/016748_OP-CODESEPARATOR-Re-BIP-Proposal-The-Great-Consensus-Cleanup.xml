    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev community is discussing the removal of OP_CODESEPARATOR, which represents a significant vulnerability in Bitcoin. Some members suggest increasing transaction weight to make using this opcode more expensive and deprecating it, while others propose locking in a block height to get rid of it in 10 years and using it as a press opportunity. Additionally, there is discussion about adding restrictions like tx size limits, but this could equally break transactions. There are concerns about rendering some moderately-large transactions unspendable due to any limit on the maximum number of OP_CODESEPARATORs allowed per script. Transaction weight currently does not consider OP codes and changing it to something more akin to Ethereum's gas pricing sounds too complicated. Overall, the community appears to be exploring various options to address this vulnerability.</summary>
