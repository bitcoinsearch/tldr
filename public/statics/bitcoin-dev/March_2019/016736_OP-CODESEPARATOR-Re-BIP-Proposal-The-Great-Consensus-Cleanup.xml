    <summary>In a recent discussion, the desire to remove OP_CODESEPARATOR has been reiterated due to its significant vulnerability in Bitcoin. The argument that someone may have created something before which could be rendered unspendable is considered a highly unlikely remote possibility and not a sufficient reason to avoid fixing the vulnerability. Two possible solutions discussed are adding additional restrictions like transaction size limits or increasing the transaction weight when executing OP_CODESEPARATOR. However, these solutions come with their own set of problems and complexities. It is suggested that anyone who has gone through the trouble of using OP_CODESEPARATOR should read the discussion.</summary>
