    <summary>A proposal to fix a vulnerability in Bitcoin using OP_CODESEPARATOR has been suggested. The proposal includes soft-forking a rule that increases an input's weight by an amount equal to the number of OP_CODESEPARATORs executed times the sum of weight of the UTXO being spent and 40 bytes. However, it is argued that this may result in low fees and there may also be complexities in implementation. Additionally, a limit on the maximum number of OP_CODESEPARATORs allowed to be executed per script was also proposed but was met with skepticism due to concerns about rendering some transactions unspendable. It was also noted that non-standardness should not be used as an excuse to destroy people's funds permanently.</summary>
