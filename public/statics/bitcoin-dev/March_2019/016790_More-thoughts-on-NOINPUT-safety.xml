    <summary>In an email exchange between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns, the former expressed his concern about third-party reusing SIGHASH_NOINPUT signatures while discussing attack scenarios. He suggested that having a non-SIGHASH_NOINPUT rule would address the issue and was open to relaxing this rule in future versions of segwit. Anthony Towns then discussed potential problems with NOINPUT signatures, including the possibility of a malicious double spend, but Rusty wasn't convinced by this argument. Additionally, he disagreed with the idea of implementing "feel-good and complex 'safety measures'" that may not be helpful in practical failure scenarios. Instead, he supported the idea of a standardness rule that mandates a signature committing to the input tx as a safety measure for NOINPUT.</summary>
