    <summary>A recent discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list about Proprietary extension to Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) revealed different opinions. Andrew Chow expressed concern that such an extension would break the central idea of PSBT, which is to contain everything required to construct a transaction. He argued that relying on parties in the transaction to have state and remember details is not a reasonable assumption. However, other participants disagreed with this view. They suggested that it is acceptable for someone to use a proprietary extension to PSBT as long as it is used only between their own systems or with a translator to talk to ordinary PSBT stuff. As a solution, they proposed adding a versioning field to indicate the specific PSBT dialect being used. This would allow for more reasonable error messages and help to identify any incompatible versions. The discussion highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity and compatibility of PSBT, while also allowing space for innovation and customization for specific use cases.</summary>
