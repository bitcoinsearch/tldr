    <summary>In an email conversation, Matt Corallo proposed to keep the existing block header format and PoW while applying the signature rules to a field in the coinbase transaction for easier testing. However, moving the signature could make DoS attacks easy and defeat the purpose of having a test network. Greg had previously suggested allowing multiple keys to sign blocks, with one signing no reorgs and one signing a reorg every few blocks, but it is unclear how this would work practically. The idea behind signet is to have a global network that everyone agrees on, occasionally reorged. Therefore, giving users the choice of behavior might not be feasible.</summary>
