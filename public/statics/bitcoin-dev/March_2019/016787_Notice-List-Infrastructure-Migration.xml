    <summary>On March 18, 2019, Warren Togami Jr. announced on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that a new archive will be created independently outside of the Linux Foundation using an open source tool. The archive aims to provide a search function and git clone for a local instance. It is hoped that the archive will not need to move again even if the underlying list infrastructure changes. The location of the git archive is unclear but it could be timestamped by installing OpenTimestamps appropriately on the server maintaining it. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have the archive PGP signed.</summary>
