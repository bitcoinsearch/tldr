    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Trey Del Bonis suggests that having 20 different paper wallets may be excessive but it provides 390700800 possible wallets. However, mid-level hardware can check 50k addresses per second, meaning it would only take around 2 hours to check all possibilities. Therefore, Del Bonis advises against thinking this presents any kind of challenge to someone who finds your 20 pieces of paper and assumes you would only keep them if they are hiding your wallet. On the other hand, using a strong RNG would provide better entropy than relying on the printing company.Another member of the bitcoin-dev community suggested a method of creating wallets by printing out a list of 20 Chinese take-out menu items and using them as seed phrases. However, another member noted that this method would not be secure enough, as it only provides 77 bits of entropy and could be brute-forced in a couple of hours. They suggested using a BIP-39 seed phrase or adding extra secret phrases for additional entropy. Additionally, some vendors print only 35 different combinations of Chinese food items, which would further decrease the security of this method. The original poster admitted that this was just a fun idea they had while eating Chinese take-out and didn't have any real practical use.A Bitcoin developer has proposed using fortune cookies to create a wallet seed. Each number found on a fortune cookie is said to have around 6.6 bits of entropy, so about seven fortunes would be enough to create a "very secure" wallet seed. The information can be split between something physical and something remembered, making it harder to compromise. Furthermore, the scheme allows for easy deniability by creating decoy wallets using other fortunes. However, the idea is still in its early stages, and there are concerns about weaknesses such as people throwing away their fortunes. A Python script has been written to demonstrate the concept.</summary>
