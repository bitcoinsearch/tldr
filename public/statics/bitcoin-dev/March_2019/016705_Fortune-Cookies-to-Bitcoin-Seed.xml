    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev community suggested a method of creating wallets by printing out a list of 20 Chinese take-out menu items and using them as seed phrases. Another member noted that this method would not be secure enough, as it only provides 77 bits of entropy and could be brute-forced in a couple of hours. They suggested using a BIP-39 seed phrase or adding extra secret phrases for additional entropy. Additionally, some vendors print only 35 different combinations of Chinese food items, which would further decrease the security of this method. The original poster admitted that this was just a fun idea they had while eating Chinese take-out and didn't have any real practical use.</summary>
