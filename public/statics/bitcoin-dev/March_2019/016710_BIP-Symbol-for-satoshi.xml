    <summary>In an email exchange between Amine Chakak and Gregory Maxwell, the idea of switching the base unit of Bitcoin to Satoshi was discussed. However, Maxwell expressed his disagreement with the idea, stating that if Satoshi Nakamoto had wanted the currency units named after him, he would have done so himself. Maxwell also criticized the behavior as "creepy" and "harmful" to Bitcoin. Chakak also mentioned the use of satoshis as a base unit in the Lightning Network, but Maxwell corrected him, stating that Lightning uses units of 10 picobitcoin (1e-11 btc), which is significantly smaller. Finally, Chakak asked if it would be appropriate to write a BIP for the proposed change, but Maxwell advised against it, stating "Please don't."</summary>
