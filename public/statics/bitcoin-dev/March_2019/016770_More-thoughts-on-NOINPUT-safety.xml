    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list is discussing eltoo, a new proposal for improving the functionality of off-chain payment channels. One member suggests requiring every script to have a valid signature that commits to the input. They also discuss taproot, a proposed Bitcoin upgrade which allows for 2-of-2 spend without revealing a script at all. They outline a process for setting up an eltoo channel using partial signatures and NOINPUT signatures. The post describes the different cases for mutual close, unilateral close with no cheating, and unilateral close with attempted cheating. The goal is to make the process look no different from an ordinary "pay to public key" spend. The thread also discusses the idea of adding a "kickoff" transaction that spends the eltoo setup transaction.</summary>
