    <summary>The email conversation is discussing the issue of `OP_CSV` in the settlement branch. Without it, earlier states cannot be invalidated by later updates. One solution discussed is using a distinct public key for settlement transactions and enforcing `nLockTime` with `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`. Another possibility is using `OP_CODESEPARATOR` to distinguish between the two cases. However, both of these approaches require a flag that allows commitment to the scriptcode even if not committing to the input tx or scriptpubkey. This flexibility is not provided by BIP118, making key rolling necessary for A_s_i and B_s_i.</summary>
