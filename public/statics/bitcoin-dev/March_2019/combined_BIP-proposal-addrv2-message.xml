    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the maximum length of addresses for the Bitcoin protocol, raising questions about the suitability of 32-byte addresses for the I2P network. The spec could potentially include a maximum size for the message so that an add message should never be over a certain size, regardless of the included address size. It was suggested that clients should be discouraged from gossiping types they don't understand at all but not forbidden from doing so. A new P2P message called addrv2 was proposed to support longer node addresses over the P2P network for networks such as I2P and Tor v3 hidden services, which have 256 bit addresses and do not fit in the existing addr message. The addrv2 message is serialized in the standard encoding for P2P messages and can contain up to 1,000 addresses. Clients should reject messages with more addresses and addresses that have a different length than specified in the table for a specific address ID. Reserved network IDs include IPV4, IPV6, TORV2, TORV3, I2P, and CJDNS. Clients must ignore address types that they do not know about, but they may store and gossip address formats that they do not know about. The concept ACK discusses several considerations regarding the gossip protocol in Bitcoin, including whether it makes sense for a client to store and gossip address formats that they do not know about, especially those outside a certain overlay network. Three possible scenarios where a node may not know about an address format are discussed, followed by recommendations on how to proceed in each case. Despite concerns about gossiping information that cannot be verified, the authors suggest that it could be useful for nodes to share information about other networks to help bootstrap connections. Another consideration is the precision of the time field, as seconds precision can be overkill and harmful. To address this, it's suggested that the time field be reduced to 16 bits and turned into a "time ago seen" quantized to 1-hour precision. Finally, optional (per-service) data is suggested to be useful for various things, including optional flags. The authors acknowledge that while adding more information would create more topology mapping opportunities, it could also be beneficial for some use cases.</summary>
