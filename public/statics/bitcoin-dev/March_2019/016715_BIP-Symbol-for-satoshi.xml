    <summary>Non-engineers are unlikely to adopt scientific notation or mili/nano/pico prefixes for money. The convention is that most common currencies either have no change or only one that is 1/100 of the base unit, which is what practically all existing finance software and non-Bitcoin related UI that deals with money assumes. Bitcoin engineering blindness ignores evident cultural preference and pre-existing finance-related software. Tamas Blummer supports the BIP for bits as a base unit for Bitcoin. However, Gregory Maxwell finds it creepy and harmful to Bitcoin to name currency units after Satoshi. Lightning network does not use satoshis as a base unit but uses units of 10 picobitcoin. A BIP for satoshi as a base unit is not appropriate.</summary>
