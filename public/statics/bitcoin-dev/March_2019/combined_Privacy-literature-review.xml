    <summary>Chris Belcher, a member of the Bitcoin community, has been working on a literature review for Bitcoin privacy for the past few weeks. The literature review aims to cover all privacy issues in Bitcoin, including the Lightning Network, and provides examples to demonstrate how these concepts work in practice. The review is available on the Bitcoin wiki page dedicated to privacy, along with a new category specifically for smaller articles related to Bitcoin privacy that Belcher created.Ádám Ficsór, another member of the Bitcoin community, appreciated Belcher's work on the literature review and noted that he is also contributing to the cause through presentations. Ficsór is starting with a two-part series that will eventually become a six-part presentation series. Part one focuses on network level privacy, while part two concentrates on blockchain level privacy. Links to the presentations are included in the message.Overall, the Bitcoin community is actively working towards improving privacy in the network and sharing knowledge through various channels, such as literature reviews and presentations.</summary>
