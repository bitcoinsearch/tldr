    <title>Mailing list downtime, archive, and its future</title>

    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been down for a few weeks as the current host, Linux Foundation, is gradually deprecating their support for email. Moving forward, an alternative service provider will have to be found. However, there are concerns regarding the subscriber list and how it should be treated to avoid potential privacy issues. While some people rely on the mailing list for important announcements, it is crucial that list subscribers are not disclosed if the mailing list migrates to a new service. Feedback on this issue is appreciated. In the meantime, an archive of the mailing list content is available, including some old timestamps in the opentimestamps format for older content. The archive link is provided by Bryan, who can be contacted directly for feedback.</summary>
