    <title>BIP Proposal: The Great Consensus Cleanup</title>

    <summary>In a message on the Bitcoin Development mailing list, Matt Corallo requested a BIP number be assigned for a proposed soft fork to improve Bitcoin's security. The proposal includes changes such as making non-standard signature hash types invalid and enforcing strict rules around transaction timestamps to prevent time-warp attacks. The proposal also notes that several early-stage proposals such as Schnorr signatures, Taproot, Graftroot, and MAST are not expected to have any interaction with the changes in this BIP, but the sighash type byte rule defined above only applies to *current* signature-checking opcodes, as any new signature-checking is likely to be implemented via the introduction of new opcodes. A Backward Compatibility section is needed, and a bips repo PR should be opened after discussion on the ML. The proposal recommends SPV clients enforce the new nTime rules to avoid following any potential forks which occur.</summary>
