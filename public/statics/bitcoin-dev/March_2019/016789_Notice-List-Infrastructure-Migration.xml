    <title>Notice: List Infrastructure Migration</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Warren Togami Jr. announced that a new archive will be operated independently outside of the Linux Foundation using an open source tool. This move is aimed at ensuring that future archives will not have to move again even if the underlying list infrastructure changes. The new archive will include a search function and enable users to perform git clone for a local instance. Peter Todd, a contributor to the discussion, asked where the git archive would actually be created/maintained and suggested that it should be timestamped and PGP signed. In another message, a user requested more communication in advance with relaxed timelines for future migration phases.</summary>
