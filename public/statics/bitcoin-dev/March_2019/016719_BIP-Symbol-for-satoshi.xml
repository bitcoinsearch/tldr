    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell expressed his opposition to naming the smallest unit of bitcoin after Satoshi. He argued that if Satoshi wanted this, he would have done it himself and that the behavior is "creepy" and harmful to Bitcoin. However, another participant in the discussion disagreed, stating that having a common term for small amounts is important for improving user experience. They believe that using satoshis as a unit is more likely to achieve this goal than scientific notations. One potential issue with using satoshis as a unit is that it may sound strange or even humorous to native Japanese speakers. The discussion suggests that getting feedback from Japanese speakers on this topic could be useful. Regarding the proposal to formalize the symbol for satoshi, there is some disagreement about whether it has sufficient support to become a standard. The suggestion is made to wait for something to emerge that already has widespread usage, such as a symbol used by popular wallets or service providers.</summary>
