    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been down for a few weeks due to the Linux Foundation gradually deprecating their support for email. This means that an alternative service provider will have to be found to host the mailing list going forward. However, there are concerns regarding the subscriber list and potential privacy issues if it were to be disclosed during the migration process. It is crucial that this information remains confidential. Feedback on how to handle this issue is appreciated, as some people rely on the mailing list for important announcements. In the meantime, an archive of the mailing list content is available, including older content in the opentimestamps format. Bryan has provided the archive link and can be contacted directly for feedback.</summary>
