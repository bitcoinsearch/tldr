    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a discussion was held regarding the use of "reject" messages in the Bitcoin network. According to one member, nodes on the network cannot be trusted to send valid reject messages, and therefore this feature should only be used when connected to a trusted node. However, it was pointed out that nodes generally rely on the assumption they are connected to at least one honest peer, allowing for a convergence on the set of honest peers and the ability to ban or disconnect those who send invalid reject messages for valid transactions. Despite this, it was noted that the use of reject messages is likely only useful in a local development environment.</summary>
