    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Trey Del Bonis suggests that having 20 different paper wallets may be excessive but it provides 390700800 possible wallets. However, mid-level hardware can check 50k addresses per second, meaning it would only take around 2 hours to check all possibilities. Therefore, Del Bonis advises against thinking this presents any kind of challenge to someone who finds your 20 pieces of paper and assumes you would only keep them if they are hiding your wallet. On the other hand, using a strong RNG would provide better entropy than relying on the printing company.</summary>
