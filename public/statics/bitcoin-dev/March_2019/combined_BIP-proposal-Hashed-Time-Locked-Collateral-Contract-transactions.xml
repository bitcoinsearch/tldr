    <summary>Matthew has recently shared his proposed BIP for a new cross-chain debt protocol on Github, which is specifically for the Atomic Loans protocol. This proposal can be found in a document available at arxiv.org. Seeking feedback and response on his proposal, Matthew is curious about the process of getting a BIP number assigned or any other necessary steps that he needs to take.The proposed cross-chain debt protocol aims to enable users to create loans across different blockchain platforms. The Atomic Loans protocol ensures the security of these loans by using smart contracts and multi-signature addresses. Matthew's proposal includes the implementation of a "debt market" where lenders can earn interest on their loans while borrowers can access capital from different chains. The protocol also includes a feature called "cross-chain swaps," allowing users to exchange assets between different blockchains with the help of atomic swaps.In conclusion, Matthew's proposed BIP for the cross-chain debt protocol is an innovative solution that can bring more flexibility and accessibility to the blockchain community. He is seeking feedback and response on his proposal and is curious about the process of getting a BIP number assigned or any other necessary steps that he needs to take.</summary>
