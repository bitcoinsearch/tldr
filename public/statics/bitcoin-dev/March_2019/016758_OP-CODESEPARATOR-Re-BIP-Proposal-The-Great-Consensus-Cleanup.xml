    <summary>The discussion revolves around the topic of soft forks in Bitcoin. It is noted that there have been no soft forks since the time of Satoshi that invalidated transactions sending secured inputs to secured outputs, excluding the use of OP_NOP1-OP_NOP10. However, it is pointed out that even carve-outs for OP_NOP are not sufficient if nSequence is used to categorize pre-signed transactions into different categories. In this case, the transactions could become un-realistically-spendable. The purpose of soft forks is to invalidate otherwise-unused bits of the protocol, which is not inconsistent with the proposal being discussed.</summary>
