    <summary>A developer named Karl-Johan Alm has proposed a new network called "signet," which is similar to the existing testnet but completely centralized. Unlike testnet, signet blocks are signed by a specific key instead of using proof of work. The benefits of this network include predictability, stability, and ease of performing global testing. Anyone can create a signet at any time by creating a key pair and creating a challenge. Having a persistent signet would be beneficial for services that need a stable place to test features over an extended period of time. Karl-Johan Alm proposed a default persistent "signet1" be created, which can be replaced in future versions. The implementation-wise code adds an std::map with block hash to block signature. Karl-Johan Alm hopes to get signet code into Bitcoin Core eventually, and he is equally hopeful that developers of other implementations will consider supporting it.</summary>
