    <summary>A proposal has been made to increase the OP_CODESEPARATOR weight within P2SH transactions in order to eliminate any vulnerabilities caused by it without removing it entirely. The proposed weight increase would be 572ish bytes, which includes the p2sh redeemScript size limit, stripped txinput size, stripped txoutput size, and overhead for varints. The goal is to eliminate the vulnerability associated with OP_CODESEPARATOR, not to remove it completely. Dustin Dettmer suggested putting it in a deprecated state for some time and making its use more expensive, while also spreading the word that it will eventually be removed. Nodes could even send a reject code with the message "OP_CODESEPARATOR is deprecated."</summary>
