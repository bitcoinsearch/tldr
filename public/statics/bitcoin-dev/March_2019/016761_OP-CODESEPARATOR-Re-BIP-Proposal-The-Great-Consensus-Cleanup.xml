    <summary>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the potential risks and benefits of making a tx type like OP_CODESEPARATOR non-standard. The author questions the need for such measures if future disabling isn't the objective, and wonders about the gains by making them hard to use/mine. They argue against an absolutist approach to backwards compatibility as it is the #1 impediment to Bitcoin's adoption and growth. The discussion also considers the likelihood of existing transactions relying on these features versus the harms of continued support, including security risks and friction with other changes. The email thread touches upon the validity of soft forks that invalidate otherwise-unused bits of the protocol, as well as concerns around un-realistically-spendable transactions.</summary>
