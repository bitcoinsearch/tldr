    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev discussion, David A. Harding questioned why short-ids were optional and only specified for certain message types rather than being required for all message types. Gregory Maxwell explained that while allocating short-ids to existing messages is easily done, adding new protocol messages would require coordinating number allocation with all other developers working on protocol extensions, including experimental and private ones. This could lead to unnecessary disagreements and delays. Allowing nodes to use arbitrary command names eliminates this issue while also saving bandwidth by allowing mapping of short-ids through optional negotiation. After understanding the motivation behind this proposal, Harding found it reasonable. The full conversation can be found in the attached link.</summary>
