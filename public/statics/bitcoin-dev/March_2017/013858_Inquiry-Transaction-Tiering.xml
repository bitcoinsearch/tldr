    <summary>In an email exchange on March 29th, 2017, Martin Stolze questioned the assumption that rational economic interest drives all hash-power action in Bitcoin mining. He argued that even a small section of hash power motivated by rational economic interest would validate the concept. Additionally, he refuted the claim that 100% of miners need to be honest, pointing out that the system is distributed. As such, only a section of miners must be honest, which is easy to fulfill since greed motivates honest miners. Tom Zander suggested taking the discussion to a different forum rather than spamming the dev list.</summary>
