    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin development mailing list, Wang Chun proposed to remove the current block size limit of 1MB, but not activate it until far in the future. He suggested that the limit be removed at the next block halving in spring 2020, but only limiting the block size to 32MB which is the maximum size the current p2p protocol allows. With this patch in core's next release, Bitcoin will work just as before, and no fork will occur until spring 2020. However, Alphonse Pace, who replied to the email chain, raised concerns about the proposal. He argued that relying on the p2p protocol is not really a true 32MiB limit, and that it would likely remove many participants from the network, including small miners. He also pointed out that 32MB in less than 3 years appears to be far beyond limits of safety, and that hardware and networking layers cannot improve by those amounts in that time. Instead, he suggests waiting until SegWit activates in order to truly measure the effects on the network from increased capacity before committing to any additional increases.</summary>
