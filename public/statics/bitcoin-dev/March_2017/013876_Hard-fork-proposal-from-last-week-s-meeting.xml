    <summary>Peter from Bitcoin Unlimited proposes a UTXO check-pointing scheme that would reduce the time needed to get a new node up and running. He suggests working with miners to start including the root hash of the UTXO set in their coinbase transactions, and issuing regular transactions from semi-trusted addresses controlled by known people that include the same root hash in an OP_RETURN output. The results from this prototype commitment scheme could lead to support from the community and miners to enforce a new rule which requires the root hashes be included in new blocks. On the topic of existing proposals, Peter asks if there are any detailing a canonical ordering of the UTXO set and a scheme to calculate the root hash. In a separate email thread, Andrew Johnson and David Vorick discuss the potential burden on archival nodes from new nodes coming online and propose a solution involving paying archival nodes a small amount of bitcoin to retrieve older blocks.</summary>
