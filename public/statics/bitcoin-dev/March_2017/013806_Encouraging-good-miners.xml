    <summary>The suggestion has been made to add a preference for blocks with more transactions when two blocks of the same height are found in Bitcoin. This would increase the incentive for full blocks and make it more difficult for miners to attack the chain by mining small or empty blocks. However, some caution that adding complexity to the best chain logic could introduce exploitable flaws. More fleshing out of the idea is needed, including consideration of how the tiebreaker would work and whether it should apply to the current block and the previous one. The proposal was sent via ProtonMail on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
