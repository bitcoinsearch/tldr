    <summary>The discussion on user activated soft forks (UASF) and their effectiveness in situations where miners are opposed to broader economic interests was explored by David Vorick through a post on bitcoin-dev. The author Edmund Edgar, however, argues that UASF may not work for new features as miners could potentially orphan the entire class of non-standard transactions subject to the fork, thereby preventing any transaction affected by the proposed rule change from making it into the longest chain. If the Chinese government leaned on Chinese miners to prevent any confirmation from an address belonging to Uighur separatists, UASF may be useful in forcing some transactions through, says Edgar. They might also be interesting for feature upgrades in a world where mining is radically decentralized and upgrades are fighting against inertia rather than opposition.</summary>
