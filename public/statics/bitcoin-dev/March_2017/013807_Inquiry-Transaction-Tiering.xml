    <summary>AJ West has created a proof-of-concept project, Preferred Miner, to encourage discussion around miners as service providers. Currently, Bitcoin users prefer certain miners for various reasons including political positions, consensus ideology and physical location. West believes that certain miners will become preferred by users regardless of whether or not the Bitcoin developer community facilitates it. Two proposed ways of providing this service are creating segregated mempools managed by an authenticated third-party like Preferred Miner and creating transactions where the mining fee is outputted to an address owned by the preferred miner(s). However, both methods have pitfalls such as extra fees for users and the need for a directory of mining pools' receiving addresses for outputs. West is not looking for solutions but rather to express that having specific miners/pools process their transactions is important to some people.</summary>
