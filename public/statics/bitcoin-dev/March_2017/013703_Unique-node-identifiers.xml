    <summary>In an email conversation between Jonas Schnelli and Eric Lombrozo, Eric objected to BIP150 which is described as "a way for peers to guarantee node ownership". Eric explained that nodes are designed to not be identifiable in any way. Jonas argued that provable identity works by presharing of keys which is precisely what the new proposal is promoting. Eric believes that there is an obvious relationship between BIP150 and this new proposal. Despite the optional nature of BIP150's fingerprint-free authentication, Eric stands by his position and calls out the statement made by a Core dev that nodes are not supposed to be identifiable in any way.</summary>
