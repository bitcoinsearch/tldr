    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev community sent an email explaining that there is a backward compatibility issue between version 0.13.X+ and older versions. Specifically, when blocks are propagated from bitcoind 0.12.+ to newer nodes, they are not being propagated to those peers with newer versions, while these newer blocks are being propagated to peers with older versions without any issues. This conclusion was reached after testing different scenarios and observing that nodes 0.13+ receive blocks from 0.13+ nodes without any problems, and those blocks propagate to older nodes with no issues as well. However, nodes with segwit active only download blocks from other segwit peers, as old peers cannot provide the witness data they need to verify the blocks.</summary>
