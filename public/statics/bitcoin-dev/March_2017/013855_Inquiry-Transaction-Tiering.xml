    <summary>In a recent email thread on bitcoin-dev, Martin Stolze raised concerns about transaction processors or block generators having the authority to discriminate participants arbitrarily. However, Tom Zander responded to clarify that the current protocol allows for two parties to transact freely and miners or block generators do not have any authority to mine or not mine certain transactions. They only have a business incentive to do so. This distinction is crucial as it makes the decision an economic one rather than a political one. The distribution of miners also means that one miner cannot stop others from mining certain transactions, making it solely an economic decision. Therefore, the concerns raised by Stolze are based on a misconception and not applicable to the current Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
