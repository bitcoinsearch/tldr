    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Jared Lee Richardson expressed concern that miners could limit block sizes in Bitcoin and there would be little anyone else could do about it. However, Tom Zander disagrees, stating that people can take their money elsewhere if they don't like the fees associated with Bitcoin transactions. Zander argues that Bitcoin has value because people use it as money, and if that use case is suppressed, the value of Bitcoin will decrease. He encourages people to consider other cryptocurrencies or fiat if they are not satisfied with Bitcoin's fee market.</summary>
