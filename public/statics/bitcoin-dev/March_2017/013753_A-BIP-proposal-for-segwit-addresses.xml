    <summary>In Bitcoin Wallet, using Base 43 (alphabet: "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ$*+-./:") for QR code encoding is more efficient. The space character is left out because it gets replaced by "+" in URLs. Pieter Wuille proposed a new BIP for native SegWit addresses to replace BIP 142 on March 20, 2017. These addresses are not required for SegWit but are more efficient, flexible, and nicer to use. The format uses a simple checksum algorithm with strong error detection properties and is base 32. Reference code in several languages as well as a website demonstrating it are included. The proposal text can be found on GitHub.</summary>
