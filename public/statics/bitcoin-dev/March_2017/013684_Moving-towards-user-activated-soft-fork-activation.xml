    <summary>In an email exchange on March 7, 2017, Edmund Edgar and Gareth Williams discussed a potential hashpower activated soft fork to censor transactions in response to a user-activated soft fork that the majority of hashpower disagreed with. The proposed action would prevent the activation of the new scripting rule altogether, rather than enforcing it through a subset of transactions as the change's supporters wanted. While the hostility to this particular proposal may not break Bitcoin, it is important for the majority of hashpower to not be hostile towards users in general. The economic majority can always hard-fork to create something new if they are unhappy. Edmund Edgar is the founder of Social Minds Inc (KK) and Reality Keys.</summary>
