    <summary>The author of BIP9 has proposed an extension to the existing protocol that introduces an additional activation parameter for soft forks. The new parameter, called "activationtime", specifies a minimum median time past of a block at which the deployment should transition to the locked-in state. This allows full nodes to coordinate synchronized activation based on a median past time using the BIP9 state machine. The state transition workflow is the same as in BIP9 except when the activation time is greater than zero, in which case the workflow will be DEFINED -&gt; STARTED -&gt; PRE_LOCK_IN -&gt; LOCKED_IN -&gt; ACTIVE. The guidelines suggest setting the activation time to some date in the future and must be less than the BIP9 timeout. A living list of deployment proposals can be found on GitHub. An optional mandatory signaling function is also included in the reference implementation.</summary>
