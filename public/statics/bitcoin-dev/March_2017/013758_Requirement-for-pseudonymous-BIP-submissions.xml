    <summary>The context highlights the importance of anonymity in online spaces, particularly within the cryptocurrency community. The author expresses a desire to contribute more without having to create "throw-away accounts." They argue that being a recognizable target in this space is not desirable and can lead to negative consequences. The author also discusses recent threats made by BitFury's CEO towards developers who refuse to comply with his demands regarding the PoW. They assert that decisions should be made on merit and the interest of the project, rather than personal agendas. In addition, the author emphasizes the need for an outlet where people can contribute in a "proper cypherpunk way" while maintaining their privacy. They acknowledge that many developers have built public personas for personal or monetary reasons, but stress that anonymity should still be an option. Finally, the author advises against reusing personal accounts from work on GitHub, as the platform is not privacy-friendly.</summary>
