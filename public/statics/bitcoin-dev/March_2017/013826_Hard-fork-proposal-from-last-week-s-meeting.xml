    <summary>A proposal to remove the 1MB block size limit in Bitcoin Core's next release, but not activate it until spring 2020, has been put forward by Wang Chun via bitcoin-dev. The patch would mean no fork would occur until then, allowing three years for third-party services, wallets and exchanges to prepare for the change. The maximum block size would be set at 32MiB, which is the maximum size of the current p2p protocol. All hard fork proposals would become soft forks with the patch already in place, and there would be sufficient time to decide on which proposal to back.</summary>
