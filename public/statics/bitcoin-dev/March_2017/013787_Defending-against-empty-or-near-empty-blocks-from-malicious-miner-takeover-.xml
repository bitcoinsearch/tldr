    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alex Morcos expressed his disapproval of the proposal to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) as a softfork. Morcos argued that a sizable portion of the community viewed SegWit as preventing them from using the rules they wanted and that no consideration was given to this when designing the softfork. He also drew attention to the fact that when SegWit was first introduced, it kicked off a round of softfork/hardfork debate, with the primary concern being that miners could unilaterally impose an unpopular change to the protocol rules. At the time, Morcos was told by multiple people that miners had an "absolute right" to softfork in whatever rules they want, which he deemed absurd. Morcos believed that the process of softforks was a slippery slope, which the community is now sliding down.</summary>
