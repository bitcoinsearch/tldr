    <summary>A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been proposed in an email thread. The proposal suggests allowing users to publish an absolute upper bound called Excessive Block size (EB), which cannot be overridden by miners. The current EB is 1MB, but it can be configured in a config file as an advanced feature. Large users are encouraged to report their EBs publicly, and Core can ship a version with a default EB in line with both miner and economic majority after a 95% consensus fork. If 95% of blocks within a one month signalling period contain an EB greater than the previous consensus EB, a fork date is triggered at 6 months using the smallest 5th percentile EB published. After 6 months, any users who already have the new EB or greater begin using it to validate transactions. Users use the EB or the latest 95% consensus triggered value - whichever is less. Users are free to safely set very high EB levels, based on their current hardware and network speeds.The proposal aims to remove political issues from affecting core developers. It is recommended that major exchanges and users publicly announce their EB's so miners can have a more reliable signal to go on. Scaling includes more than just block size, and fees are inherently political because they create barriers for low-net-worth individuals transacting using this technology. If a small business in Africa cannot afford to set up a full node due to high fees, it affects participation as a hub. Miners and users should be free to wrangle each other over fees without developer involvement. If a smaller block size is needed, a reduced size can also be published and agreed upon by both users and miners using the same mechanism, but the largest 5th percentile is used. Any new node can follow these rules to validate all the blocks in a chain even if the sizes change (at most twice per year). In order to implement the system, a versioning system is used to ensure that the two networks (old and new) are incompatible, and this would require a soft fork beforehand. No code changes will be needed to fork the network as many times as both users and miners feel the need to do so. Users who do not update their EB within the 6 month period will be excluded from the majority fork. If the EB of a new node is set to be smaller than the current block size, it is only used for signal unless a fork occurs that results in a reduction active.</summary>
