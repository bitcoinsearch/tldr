    <summary>The email conversation between Eric Voskuil and Pieter Wuille on the topic of unique node identifiers has been reposted. The discussion revolves around the introduction of visible node identities on the network, which Eric believes is a step towards making every person who connects to the more centralized network identifiable. He argues that IP addresses are not strong enough for web wallets, APIs, exchanges, miners to prove that they are getting connections only from authorized "customers" that they know. The proposal is seen as misguided by both parties and trivial to fake. Eric also states that making the network private so that we can detect denial/disruption of service is pointless if the only threat is your own ISP or the state.</summary>
