    <summary>In the provided context, the speaker is discussing the potential challenges and solutions related to implementing protocol improvements and larger block sizes in a blockchain system. The speaker acknowledges that these changes can make things harder but suggests that it is possible to handle such improvements through a soft fork. This means that the system can be updated without forcing all users to adopt the new rules immediately.Furthermore, the speaker notes that it may be acceptable to migrate to a new system by disallowing transactions between old and new versions of the system. This approach could potentially simplify the transition process and ensure that the new system operates as intended.Overall, the speaker's comments highlight the importance of carefully considering the technical implications and potential challenges associated with updating a blockchain system. By taking a thoughtful and strategic approach, it may be possible to successfully implement important improvements and advancements while minimizing disruption to the existing user base.</summary>
