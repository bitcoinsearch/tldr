    <summary>Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician from Blockstream, has developed a new way to link multi-hop Lightning channel. The proposed method is built on “scriptless scripts” and allows for reblinding. In the process of constructing this new method, Poelstra treated x -&gt; xG as a hash function and found two separate but related things that can be done: (a) construct a signature which reveals the preimage; or (b) create a “pre-signature” which can be turned into a signature with the help of the preimage. Upon obtaining a challenge T = xG from D in an atomic Lightning path, Andrew uses a series of tricks to construct a path consisting of transactions that are signed with single uniformly random independent Schnorr signatures.</summary>
