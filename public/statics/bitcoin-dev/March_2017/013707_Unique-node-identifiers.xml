    <summary>In this email exchange between Eric Voskuil and Pieter Wuille, Voskuil argues that weak identity is insufficient to produce a problem scenario in Bitcoin. He takes issue with the "same except more secure" distinction of BIP150 as he believes it is problematic. Wuille counters by pointing out that excluding people is possible through the -onlyacceptconnectionsfrom=IP option, which Voskuil concedes. However, Wuille still disagrees with Voskuil's argument and dismisses visible node identities on the network as irrelevant. He sees them as just a cryptographic tool to keep a certain class of attackers from bypassing restrictions that people can already make.</summary>
