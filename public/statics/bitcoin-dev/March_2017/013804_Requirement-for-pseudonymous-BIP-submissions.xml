    <summary>The conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list started with a discussion about the inconvenience of creating new email and GitHub accounts to submit BIPs. It was pointed out that GitHub doesn't allow multiple accounts. This led to a suggestion from Luke Dashjr for a decentralized version control system that would let users create a crypto key, propose BIPs anonymously and get paid in crypto for the best commits. The proposed system would be developed using Mercurial, BitTorrent, and pynode by motivated grad students who know Python. A crowdfunding effort was suggested to support the development of this system.</summary>
