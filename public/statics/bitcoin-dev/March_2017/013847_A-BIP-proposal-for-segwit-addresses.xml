    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andreas Schildbach suggested using Base 43 for QR code encoding as he claimed it to be more efficient than the QR code alphanumeric mode which allows 44 characters. However, Peter Todd responded with concerns about the downsides of using non-alphanumeric characters in addresses, such as making them difficult to use in various contexts and not being familiar to non-English speaking users. He also questioned the need for transmitting addresses via voice communication. Todd further explained that when used for URLs, Base 32 (as well as Base 43) actually makes QR codes bigger due to the characters used for URL parameters. To make them shorter, he suggested using something like "Base 64url" or preferably Base 94 which includes all printable ASCII characters.</summary>
