    <summary>David Vorick, a member of the Bitcoin development community, has stated that it is too expensive for a home user to run a full node. He believes that user-run full nodes provide the strongest defense against political maneuvering. However, another member of the community disagrees and questions why it would be considered "expensive" for a home user to run a full node. They argue that while it may not be trivial and could take time to set up, running a full node from home is not necessarily annoying or expensive. The commenter provides links to various projects they have worked on, including simple Zcash and Bitcoin wallets, dynamic blocklists, and anti-spies and private torrents.</summary>
