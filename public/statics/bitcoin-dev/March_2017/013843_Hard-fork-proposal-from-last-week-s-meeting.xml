    <title>Hard fork proposal from last week's meeting</title>

    <summary>In an email conversation between Tom Zander and Johnson Lau via bitcoin-dev, Lau suggested preparing for a potential hard fork (HF) with unknown parameters. However, Zander clarified that this was not suggested and asked for comments on a specific suggestion. Zander then provided examples of things that would require a hard fork, such as implementing FlexTran, changing the block interval from 10 minutes, and fixing the sighash bug for legacy scripts. Additionally, he linked to a page on the Bitcoin wiki with other alternative ideas that would require a HF.</summary>
