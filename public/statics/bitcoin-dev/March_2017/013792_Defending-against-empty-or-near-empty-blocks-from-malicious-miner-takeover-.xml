    <summary>A proposed solution to reduce the chances of a blockchain split as Bitcoin moves towards larger blocks is to orphan the blocks of non-compliant miners prior to the first larger block. This suggestion has been made by a member of the Bitcoin community. Another technique suggested to achieve this goal involves majority miners continually re-organising a minority chain with empty blocks, which eliminates replay risk. Some members of the community believe that a peaceful split would be preferable to these proposed tactics for enforcing the upgrade.Peter R, who has recently been working with Bitcoin Unlimited and discussing the matter with miners and businesses, believes that the upgrade to larger blocks will not happen until miners are confident that no minority chain will survive. He suggests that users should have the power to adjust the size of blocks their nodes accept. Peter R also proposes that this could be accomplished by a simple patch to Bitcoin Core 0.14.An email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list at lists.linuxfoundation.org from cannon at cannon-ciota.info. The email includes a notice that all email correspondence not signed/encrypted with PGP should be considered potentially forged and not private. The author recommends using PGP if privacy is a concern for the recipient. The email concludes with a PGP signature block.
