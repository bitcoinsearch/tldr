    <summary>A proposal was made for a "Double UASF" as a counter-fork to the current miner veto on the activation of segwit. The proposed fork enforces every rule that UASF enforces, plus one additional rule. If 60% of blocks in any retargeting period signal for Double UASF, any descendant block that creates or spends a segregated witness output is invalid. The delayed activation of SegWit is causing a hold-up in the innovation of Bitcoin. This could be achieved if the economic majority agree to run code that rejects non-signalling SegWit blocks. Then from the perspective of all existing witness nodes, miners trigger the BIP9 activation. Mining is an expensive endeavour, and it is assumed that PoW/revenue incentives will keep miners honest. If that assumption is broken, Bitcoin has bigger problems.</summary>
