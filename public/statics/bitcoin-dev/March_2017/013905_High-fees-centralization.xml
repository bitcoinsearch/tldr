    <summary>The discussion revolves around the possibility of implementing blockchain sharding in a trustless manner. The concern is about resolving conflicts between the shards and committing transactions between them. Vladimir Zaytsev suggests organizing "branches" of smaller activity to join the main tree after they grow. However, it may not be necessary to accept everything in the chain, and it is too early to record every sight. Jared Lee Richardson points out that fees higher than $1 per transaction are inevitable without blocksize increases, most likely before 2020. He argues that if both monetary sovereignty and supporting daily transactions can be achieved, then why not have both? An altcoin with both will take Bitcoin's monetary sovereignty crown by default.</summary>
