    <title>Refund Excesss Fee Hard Fork Proposal</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user praxeology_guy proposed a change to the fee policy for bitcoin transactions. The proposal suggests reducing all fee/byte in a block to the lowest included fee/byte and having transactions specify which outputs get what portions of the transaction fee. However, this approach could incentivize miners to not completely fill blocks if low fee marginal transactions end up costing them money. An alternate approach suggested was to incentivize miners to follow transaction fees more by reducing mining rewards, which could be done through a soft fork requiring a chunk of all mining rewards to be sent to an unspendable address.</summary>
