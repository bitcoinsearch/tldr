    <summary>The proposal for increasing block size has been acknowledged, but the concern is that it forces all node operators to accept larger blocks in 2020, which may result in a loss of decentralization and coordination issues with small blocks. The decision to increase block size should not be made solely by Core, but rather left up to the users within the community. The suggestion is for Core to add a runtime option to allow node operators to increase the block size limit, making it a less controversial decision.</summary>
