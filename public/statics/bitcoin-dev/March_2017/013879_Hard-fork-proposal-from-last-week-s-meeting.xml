    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, Peter R asked if there were any existing proposals for ordering the UTXO set and calculating the root hash. In response, Praxeology Guy shared his proposal, "A Commitment-suitable UTXO set 'Balances' file data structure," which periodically takes snapshots of the state of the UTXO N blocks ago, where N is the snapshot period, and orders the UTXOs by TXID. He also implemented this in C and tested it. However, gmaxwell suggested that the UTXO data format will change and recommended changes to the chainstate database for efficiency. He pointed to another similar solution and said that these changes would be made after SegWit and after the database change.</summary>
