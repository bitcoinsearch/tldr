    <summary>The ongoing Bitcoin scaling debate has become politicized, with one side advocating for increasing block size via segwit and the other through a hard fork. Companies are hesitant to take sides due to the potential backlash. Pseudonymous submissions are not entirely rejected, but it is suggested that they should be carried by a well-known member of the Bitcoin community to ensure credibility. Bips are seen politically based on their usefulness to each side rather than who suggests them. Protocol changes cannot be made until after a protocol upgrade has been implemented.</summary>
