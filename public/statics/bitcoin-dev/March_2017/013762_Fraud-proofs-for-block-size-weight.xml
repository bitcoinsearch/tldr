    <title>Fraud proofs for block size/weight</title>

    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed a draft BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for fraud proofs which could help light clients detect blockchains that are invalid due to excess size and/or weight resulting from miners attacking with oversized blocks in an attempt to force a hardfork. While ideally all users should use their own full node for validation, many Bitcoin holders still do not and may require protection from these attacks to ensure they remain on the Bitcoin blockchain. The proposed solution can prove if a specific attack is happening and can reliably protect users by ensuring that the proof cannot be broken without also breaking the attempted hardfork at the same time. The draft is available on GitHub and is potentially ready for implementation, though suggestions for improvement are welcome.</summary>
