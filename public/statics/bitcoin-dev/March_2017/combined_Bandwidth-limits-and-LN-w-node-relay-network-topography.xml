    <summary>A recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list addressed a variety of topics, including bandwidth limits, Lightning Network, and network splits. The author suggested implementing global and per node up/down bandwidth limits, which could be communicated to peers and monitored for actual usage. They also proposed using Lightning Network to prepay for bandwidth/data and to pay different amounts for different types of data. Nodes would be incentivized to relay unconfirmed transactions and new blocks, with refunds requested for useless/duplicate/invalid/spam data and discontinued connections with nodes that don't refund.To identify network splits, nodes could find the hash of "nonce + pub key + tip blockhash" beating a difficulty threshold, sign, broadcast, and prove their existence and connectedness. History can be maintained and monitored for disruption, which could be made part of the messages that advertise available network bandwidth. One person expressed confusion about the importance of history in this context and why nodes trying to split would inherently not behave correctly and therefore be banned by other nodes. They also cautioned against the system becoming centralized and mentioned the Tor network's method of selecting nodes based on advertised bandwidth.The thread provided links for Zcash wallets, Bitcoin wallets, the torrent dynamic blocklist, checking a 10 million password list, anti-spies and private torrents, dynamic blocklist, Peersm, torrent-live, node-Tor, and GitHub.</summary>
