    <summary>The writer of this message has identified an issue with the function ParseScript in core_read.cpp. Specifically, they have found that OP_1NEGATE cannot be parsed, causing a runtime error at line 88. The writer is questioning whether this is a bug or not and notes that they are using version 0.12.1. It seems that the problem lies within the code itself, as the function is unable to properly parse OP_1NEGATE. This could indicate a bug within the system, although further investigation may be needed to determine the root cause of the issue. It is unclear what impact this issue may have on the overall functionality of the system. However, given that it is causing a runtime error, it is likely that it may be preventing certain processes from completing successfully. Overall, the writer's concern about the potential bug in the system highlights the importance of thoroughly testing and reviewing code to ensure that it is functioning properly. It also underscores the need for ongoing maintenance and updates to address any issues that arise.</summary>
