    <summary>The issue of nodes being rewarded with nothing on the bitcoin network is discussed in an email thread. The lack of rewards for nodes is seen as a problem for the decentralized system, as more nodes could help to reject blocks from a small minority of freeriders. Meanwhile, participants discuss the safety and feasibility of increasing block sizes, with one proposal suggesting removing the 1MB limit at the next block halving in 2020, but limiting the block size to 32MiB to allow third-party services to prepare. Various hard fork proposals are also discussed, with some seen as soft forks if implemented after the proposed patch. The email thread also includes links to various resources related to bitcoin wallets, dynamic blocklists, and anti-spies.</summary>
