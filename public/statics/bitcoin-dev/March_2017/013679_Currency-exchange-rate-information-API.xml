    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tim Ruffing brought up the need for the possibility to request periodic messages from the server during longpolling. Without this feature, clients would not be able to distinguish between a situation where the value is still in the requested bounds and when the connection has dropped, leading to wrong decisions by the user. Another participant in the discussion pointed out that this was actually the job of TCP, and asked if an explicit keepalive configuration was necessary or if it would vary based on client or network.</summary>
