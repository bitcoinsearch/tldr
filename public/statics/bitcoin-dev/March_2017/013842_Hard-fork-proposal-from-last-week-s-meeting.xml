    <summary>Juan Garavaglia disagrees with the conclusions of a whitepaper that suggests 4MB is unsafe for blockchain size. He believes that 32 MB in 2020 is possible due to Moore's Law, Butters' Law of Photonics and Kryderâ€™s Law. Alphonse Pace points out that empirical evidence does not support Juan's beliefs, with Intel struggling to make even 5-10% gains in CPU generation and disk space growth slowing, turning negative sharply due to the trend towards SSDs. Wang Chun proposed removing the 1MB limit at the next block halving in spring 2020, but limiting the block size to 32MiB, which is the maximum size the current P2P protocol allows. The proposal has faced opposition from some members who believe it is risky and have suggested waiting until SegWit activates before committing to any additional increases.</summary>
