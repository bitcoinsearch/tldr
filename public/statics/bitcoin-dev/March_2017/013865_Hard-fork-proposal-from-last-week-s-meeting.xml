    <summary>Some Bitcoin users are hesitant to run a pruned node due to limited storage space on their home computers. Many consumer computers only have a single 512GB SSD, leaving less than 200 GB of free space after standard usage. Bitcoin's consumption of more than half of that space can be seen as expensive and may prompt users to buy another drive. Several individuals have cited this as their primary reason for not joining the full node club. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list with Andrew Johnson adding his name at the end.</summary>
