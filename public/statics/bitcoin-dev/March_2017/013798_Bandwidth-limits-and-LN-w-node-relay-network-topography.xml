    <summary>The author suggests that it would be beneficial to have global and per node up/down bandwidth limits, with the ability to communicate these limits to peers and monitor actual bandwidth usage. They propose using Lightning Network to prepay for bandwidth/data and potentially pay different amounts for different kinds of data. The network could also identify useless/duplicate/invalid/spam data and request refunds while discontinuing connections with nodes that do not refund. Additionally, implementing these measures could improve spam/DDoS resiliency and incentivize relay of unconfirmed transactions and new blocks. It is suggested that relaying advertisements of available bandwidth and prices could be useful. To identify network splits, nodes could find a hash of "nonce + pub key + tip blockhash" beating a difficulty threshold and broadcast it to prove their existence and connectedness. This information could also be made part of the messages that advertise available network bandwidth.</summary>
