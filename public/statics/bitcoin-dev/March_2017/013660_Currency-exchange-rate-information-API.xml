    <summary>Luke-jr, a Bitcoin Knots developer noticed that Electrum had many implementations for each exchange rate provider due to lack of a common format for such data while investigating the possibility of adding fiat currency information to Bitcoin Knots. In response, he created an initial draft of a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) that would standardize this process so wallets and exchange rate providers could easily interoperate without having to reimplement the same thing many times. The current draft can be found on Github. One issue that Luke-jr is unsure about is whether to use XBT or satoshis as the unit of measurement for Bitcoin amounts. Although using satoshis would seem nicer, there is no pseudo-ISO currency code to integrate it nicely. Luke-jr is seeking feedback on his draft and ways to improve the interface.</summary>
