    <summary>The discussion on the cost of running a node was brought up in a Bitcoin development email thread. The argument against using small storage SSDs as the main hardware option for running a node is that it lacks cost-effectiveness. Keeping block sizes small has significant costs for everyone, and using arbitrary conditions to compare the cost of running a node with far more efficient options is not a good way to consider the costs. If operational costs rose to the point where a wide swath of users could not justify running a node, that would be a significant consideration. For many, modern hardware with above-average bandwidth caps is ideal for running a node. The consequences of keeping blocks small are important to consider, even if they are just the threat of a contentious fork by people who are misled about the real consequences. Some people are reluctant to join the full node club due to limited storage space on their computers and high costs associated with buying additional drives.</summary>
