    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.14.0 was released on March 8, 2017, with several notable changes and updates. One of the main updates is the addition of a new RPC command called 'bumpfee,' which allows users to replace an unconfirmed wallet transaction with a new one that pays a higher fee, increasing its chances of being confirmed quickly. The HTTP REST API has also been updated to return status code HTTP_BAD_REQUEST (400) instead of HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (500) when requests contain invalid parameters. The latest version of Bitcoin Core, 0.14.0, has been released with a focus on performance improvements and bug fixes. The update includes changes to the P2P protocol and network code, as well as validation and build system updates. Among the notable changes are the exclusion of RBF replacement transactions from fee estimation, the use of deterministic randomness for local nonces, and the implementation of an "assumevalid" setting to skip validation of scripts presumed to be valid. Bitcoin Core developers have released version 0.14.1 of the software. The update comes with a range of bug fixes and new features, including improvements to transaction fee handling and the option to purchase bitcoin directly from within the app. Developer Andrew Chow said the option to buy bitcoin via a "simple interface" was designed to make it easier for users to purchase bitcoin while ensuring they understood the risks involved. Bitcoin Core version 0.14.2 has been released with fixes for several bugs and vulnerabilities. The update includes a fix for the vulnerability identified in the recent WannaCry ransomware attack, which exploited a flaw in older versions of Windows to spread. The release also contains bug fixes and security improvements, including updated translations. Contributors to the release include Gregory Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, Peter Todd, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. In total, the release was made possible by contributions from more than 100 individuals.Finally, Bitcoin Core version 0.14.0 has been released, which includes new features, bugfixes and performance improvements. Notable changes include improvements to validation speed, network propagation, and the introduction of assumed-valid blocks and compact blocks, as well as manual pruning of the blockchain. Other changes include the ability to nest RPC commands in the debug console, a toggle for enabling or disabling p2p network activity, and an out-of-sync modal info layer. Additionally, JSON-RPC named arguments are now supported, and users can opt into RBF when sending transactions. Sensitive data is no longer stored in the debug console history, and the mempool is retained across restarts. The alert system has been removed, and the GUI has undergone several changes.The update includes changes to the GUI, wallet, tests, and QA. The GUI updates included several new features like the ability to show HD wallet state in status bar, show network/chain errors in the GUI, and add "Copy URI" to payment request context menu. In addition, the update has made several improvements to the wallet. These include allowing non-wallet owned change addresses in coin control, adding a high transaction fee warning, and smarter coordination of change and fee in CreateTransaction. The update also included several changes to the tests and QA. These changes were intended to improve testing speed and efficiency. For example, the update included using a single cache directory for chains and replacing rpc_wallet_tests.cpp with python RPC unit tests. Additionally, the update added some verbose logging to bitcoin-util-test.py and microbenchmarks to profile more code paths. Overall, version 0.14.0 of Bitcoin Core includes several important bug fixes and enhancements.</summary>
