    <summary>Luke has created a new stateless address format, which aims to address the shortcomings of current addresses. The current addresses have issues such as special-casing specific transaction types, producing undistinguished outputs, harming privacy by reusing addresses, and causing funds loss due to reuse of very old addresses. Luke's approach may seem complicated for parsing addresses to outputs but can be resolved by writing libraries for popular languages. He asks for thoughts on how his design might be improved before getting too deep into it. The details of his proposed stateless address format can be found at https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-genaddr/bip-genaddr.mediawiki.</summary>
