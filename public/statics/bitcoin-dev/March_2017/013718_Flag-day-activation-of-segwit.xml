    <summary>A post made by shaolinfry via bitcoin-dev on Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 3:50:27 PM discusses the mandatory segwit activation between Oct 1st, 2017 and Nov 15th, 2017. The post suggests that a check should be put in place to ensure that the bit hasn't locked-in already. It also suggests that as many as 5% minus one non-signalling blocks should be tolerated. Luke adds a disclaimer that these are technical suggestions and do not imply endorsement of the idea.</summary>
