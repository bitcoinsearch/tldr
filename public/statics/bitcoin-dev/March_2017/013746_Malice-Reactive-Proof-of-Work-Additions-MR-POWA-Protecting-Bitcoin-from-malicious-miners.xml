    <summary>The writer of this statement is in favor of having multiple Proof-of-Work (PoW) forks to choose from, but believes that it is problematic to have one chain running a rotation of algorithms. The reason for supporting multiple algos is to prevent attackers from secretly making ASICs ahead of time in the event of an emergency PoW fork. Having a large selection of algorithms makes pre-emptive ASIC manufacturing more difficult because attackers wouldn't know which algorithm will be used. However, once an algorithm is chosen, it should be the end of the story, with just one algo without rotation.</summary>
