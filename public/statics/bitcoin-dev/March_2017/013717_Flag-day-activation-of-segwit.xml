    <summary>It is suggested to obtain written cooperation agreements from the largest economic players in Bitcoin before setting a flag day. The major economic organs such as exchanges would run the BIP, and non-signalling miners would not get paid starting October 1st, and their blocks will be rejected. Miners would have to signal or find other profitable mining options. This would trigger the existing segwit deployment for everyone who has already upgraded to segwit compatible node software. However, buy-in from major economic organs, especially fiat egress points, is crucial before deploying this BIP. In case of failure, a second deployment of segwit with a flag day, or preferably using the bip-uaversionbits-strong BIP9/flagday hybrid would be required.</summary>
