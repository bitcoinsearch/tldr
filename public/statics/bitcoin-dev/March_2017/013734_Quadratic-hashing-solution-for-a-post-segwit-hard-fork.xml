    <summary>The context mentions the functionality of Segwit which allows transactions between old, new and mixed versions. The email thread dated March 17, 2017, from Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev discusses the difficulty in implementing new opt-in protocol improvements with the current system. However, it is suggested that a soft fork can be used to handle such improvements, including larger block sizes. Additionally, it is mentioned that migration to a new system can be achieved by restricting old -&gt; old or new-&gt;old transactions. The email is part of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the link to which is provided for further information.</summary>
