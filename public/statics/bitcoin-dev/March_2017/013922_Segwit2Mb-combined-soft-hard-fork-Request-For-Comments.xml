    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner proposed Segwit2Mb as a solution to the conflict between different political positions on segwit activation versus an increase of the on-chain blockchain space through a standard block size increase. The proposal combines segwit with a 2MB block size hard-fork activated only if segwit activates (95% of miners signaling), but at a fixed future date. However, concerns have been raised about the risk posed to the Bitcoin ecosystem by activating a hard fork with less than 18/24 months from a fully-audited and supported release of full node software to activation date. Sergio's parameters also pose a significant risk to the Bitcoin ecosystem broadly. There are many technological innovations coming down the pipe in the coming months such as Lightning, TumbleBit, and RootStock that could significantly reduce fee pressure as transactions move to much faster and more featureful systems.At least one email response suggests that Lerner's proposal would benefit from incorporating other proposals, including replay protection and utilizing the "hard fork signaling bit" in the nVersion of the block. Betting the security of Bitcoin on exponential on-chain growth is something which has historically never been seen, making the proposal potentially insecure.Sergio Demian Lerner has created a patch called SegWit2Mb that's designed to allow both the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the doubling of Bitcoin's block size limit from 1MB to 2MB. The hard fork is conditional to 95% of the hashing power approving the segwit2mb soft-fork and the segwit soft-fork being activated, which should occur 2016 blocks after its lock-in time. The tentative lock-in and hard-fork dates are April 29th, 2017, and August 29th, 2017, respectively. Once SegWit is activated, the hard fork will be unavoidable.Sergio's primary goal is to be minimalistic in reducing the number of lines modified in Bitcoin Core state to reduce the time it takes for core programmers and reviewers to check the correctness of the code, and to report and correct bugs. Sergio wants to give enough time to all active economic nodes to upgrade before the hard fork activation date. After the comments collected by the community, a BIP will be written describing the resulting proposal details. Contributions to the SegWit2Mb project are welcomed and awaited.</summary>
