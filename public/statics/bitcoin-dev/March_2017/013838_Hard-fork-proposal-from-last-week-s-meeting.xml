    <summary>On March 28th, 2017, Alphonse Pace via bitcoin-dev expressed a demand for a patch to be included in the immediate next release of Bitcoin Core. Luke-Jr responded, stating that it was likely a design requirement rather than a demand and that starting the lead time for a possible hardfork as soon as possible made sense. He also suggested avoiding multiple brief replies in a matter of minutes and combining them into a single reply.</summary>
