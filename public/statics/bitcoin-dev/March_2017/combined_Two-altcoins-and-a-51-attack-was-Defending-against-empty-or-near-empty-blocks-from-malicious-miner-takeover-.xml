    <summary>A recent post on the bitcoin-dev forum discussed the possibility of a blockchain split and associated risks with the upcoming network upgrade to larger blocks. The concern is that a minority group that does not want to follow the majority's ruleset could create an altcoin by changing the proof-of-work. This plan seems to be a response to the industry call for replay protection, but the author of the post finds it hard to believe that creating two new altcoins from Bitcoin would avoid either a split or confusion.Moreover, applying hash power towards disrupting Bitcoin assumes that participating miners are willing to accept a total loss on these operations. The author suggests writing code for replay protection as another option rather than creating new altcoins. However, it appears that no one, including miners, has any way to measure what software the economy or hash power is running, or the economic weight of that portion of the economy.</summary>
