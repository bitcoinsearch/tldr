    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrew Johnson suggests that increasing the capacity of the system would lead to more new nodes appearing. However, he is unsure how to empirically prove this. David Vorick raises concerns about the burden on archival nodes due to increasing load. Johnson suggests a potential solution in which archival nodes are paid a small amount of bitcoin to retrieve blocks older than a certain cutoff. This would incentivize running archival nodes and help mitigate the burden on them. Further discussion on disk space requirements is suggested to be taken to another thread.</summary>
