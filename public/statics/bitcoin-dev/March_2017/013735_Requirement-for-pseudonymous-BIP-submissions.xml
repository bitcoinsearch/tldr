    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently experiencing a debate over how to increase the block size, with one side advocating for an increase via SegWit and the other side advocating for a hard fork. The issue has become politicized, with critiques based on who is submitting the BIP rather than the content of the proposal. To avoid this problem in the future, Chris Stewart proposes a pseudonymous BIP system where authors are required to submit their proposals under a pseudonym. This would allow proposals to be examined based on their technical merits, rather than who submitted them. If an author wants credit for their proposal after it is accepted, they can reveal the preimage of the author hash to prove their identity. The goal is to maintain principled money and level the playing field by vetting claims from authority figures.</summary>
