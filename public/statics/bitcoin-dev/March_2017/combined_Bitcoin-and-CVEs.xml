    <summary>Simon is worried about the possibility of vulnerabilities in Bitcoin that may have been fixed but not publicly disclosed. He refers to a list of Bitcoin Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) which has not been updated for almost three years, except for CVE-2015-3641, which also lacks information. Simon suggests that clients and altcoins derived from Bitcoin Core should be patched for known vulnerabilities to benefit end-users. He wonders if anyone is keeping track of security-related bugs and patches like those found on the CVE list, and if that list can be shared with other developers. Simon is concerned that discreet log messages for fixes may make it difficult for third parties to identify and assess the importance of any critical patches applied. Lastly, Simon is curious about what has changed since 2014 to result in the defect rate, based on publicly reported CVEs, falling to zero. He questions whether there was a change in the development process or introduction of a bug bounty program.</summary>
