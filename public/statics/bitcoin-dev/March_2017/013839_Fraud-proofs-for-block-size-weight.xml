    <summary>In a discussion about the validity of blocks in Bitcoin, a user questions the assumption that all blocks are valid aside from size. They argue that as long as it can be assumed that the block is valid and a SHA256 midstate cannot be forged to result in a given hash value, it is not necessary to show that a leaf in the merkle tree is a parseable transaction. However, they concede that accuracy in counting the minimum number of transactions is important due to parts of the merkle tree being repeated. Luke Dashjr expresses concern about the proposal, stating that the only way to establish the number of transactions is to show that a leaf is a parsable transaction, and asks for any ideas.</summary>
