    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter R stated that non-upgraded miners who produce invalid blocks will have them orphaned as a way to encourage upgrades. However, Bryan Bishop responded by saying that this statement is false and that miner blocks will not be orphaned unless they intentionally produce segwit-invalid blocks, which they currently do not. Trevin later clarified that if non-upgraded miners follow the new rules, their blocks will not be orphaned, which is consistent with Peter's initial comment. The discussion centers around the activation of segwit through bip9-based soft-fork.</summary>
