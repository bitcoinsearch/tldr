    <summary>On March 28, 2017, Johnson Lau via bitcoin-dev suggested setting a time bomb in the client as a way to prepare for a potential hard fork (HF) with unknown parameters. He also referred to a BIP by Luke which suggested lifting the block size limit and removing many other rules. However, implementing this idea was found to be overly complicated. The proposal of a time bomb which shuts down the client after it becomes stale and refuses to start without an explicit override was considered a better option. Another suggestion was to make a softfork to decrease the block size to 1kB and block reward to 0, activating far in the future similar to the difficulty bomb in ETH. However, this idea was not well-received as it left the node open to attack from blocks that meet the criteria. Jeremy suggested the absolute minimum as an alternative.</summary>
