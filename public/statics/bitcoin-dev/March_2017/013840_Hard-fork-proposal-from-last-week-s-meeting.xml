    <summary>Juan Garavaglia disagrees with some of the conclusions drawn in a document, despite his respect for the experts involved. He believes that some estimations are inaccurate and outdated, such as the energy consumption per GH and cost of electricity. Juan also mentions his faith in Moore's Law, Butters' Law of Photonics, and Kryder's Law, which all support the possibility of a 32MB block size limit in 2020. Alphonse Pace suggests that Juan should read a paper that shows even a 4MB block size is unsafe, and SegWit provides up to this limit. Wang Chun proposes a hard fork approach that was rejected by coredevs last year, but he is proposing it again. The proposal involves removing the 1MB block size limit at the next block halving in spring 2020, only limiting the block size to 32MiB, which is the maximum size the current p2p protocol allows. This patch must be in the immediate next release of Bitcoin Core. Third-party services, libraries, wallets, and exchanges will have enough time to prepare for it over the next three years.</summary>
