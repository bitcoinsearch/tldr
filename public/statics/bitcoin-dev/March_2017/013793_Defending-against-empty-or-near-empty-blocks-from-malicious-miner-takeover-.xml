    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email, Peter R proposed that with a tightening of the rule set, a hash power minority that has not upgraded will not produce a minority branch; instead they will simply have any invalid blocks they produce orphaned, serving as a wake-up call to upgrade. However, Bryan countered this argument by stating that with bip9-based soft-fork-based activation of segwit, miner blocks will not be orphaned unless they are intentionally segwit-invalid (which they currently are not). It is unclear whether Peter R had told miners otherwise or not.</summary>
