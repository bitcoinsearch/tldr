    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community, Raystonn, has commented on the importance of low node costs for those handling transactions. He stated that if transaction fees are too high, it will discourage people from running a node for a network they don't use for their own transactions. This could lead to centralization of nodes being run only by those who settle large amounts. Tom Zander, a blogger and vlogger in the cryptocurrency space, agrees with Raystonn's observation. He believes that this is a good reason for on-chain scaling to be implemented before lightning hits.</summary>
