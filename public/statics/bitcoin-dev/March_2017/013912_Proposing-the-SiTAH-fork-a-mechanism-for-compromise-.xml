    <summary>The proposal suggests a solution to the stalemate between those in favor of a soft-fork SegWit and those wanting a hard-fork TX block size increase. The Soft-into-Time-Activated-Hard fork (SiTAH) is a soft-fork that locks into a predetermined hard-fork at a later point in time. After the soft-fork, there will be a transition period for everyone to upgrade their software before the hard-fork commences. This ensures a safe hard-fork without any massive disruption, but coordination is required for it to happen safely. The proposed SiTAH-fork is an incentive for both parties as those who want the hard-fork have an incentive to support activating the soft-fork, and those who want the soft-fork have the incentive to activate the hard-fork. For implementation with SegWit, the block weight function can be replaced by a version that allows for &gt;1MB of pure TX data when the median time-past of the last 11 blocks is greater than the HardForkTime. The majority of stakeholders, including devs, miners, and users, want both soft-fork SegWit and a hard-fork TX block size increase but favor one over the other and want to perform their favorite fork first out of fear that activating the other prevents their choice from being activated at a later point.</summary>
