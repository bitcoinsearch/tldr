    <summary>There have been some reorganizations in the Bitcoin testnet, which are not related to network issues. Bitcoin explorers such as blocktrail.com or blockr.io were following different chains at different heights, leading to the belief that there is a backward compatibility issue between 0.13.X+ and older versions. The issue can be replicated by forcing the latest version of bitcoind to exclusively use one or more peers of versions 0.12.X and older, resulting in the latest version node never receiving a new block. While it's unclear if this issue can be exploited maliciously, Bitcoin 0.13.X+ should remain compatible with older versions, and there is no notice for the node owner.</summary>
