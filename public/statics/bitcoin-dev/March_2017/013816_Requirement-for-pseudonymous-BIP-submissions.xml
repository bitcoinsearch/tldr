    <summary>In an email thread, Chris Stewart proposed a method that would allow individuals to reveal themselves after the BIP has been accepted. While this process cannot be forced upon people, it may become a de facto requirement by the BIP maintainer. The conversation then turns to making decisions based on merit versus financial gain. The author suggests that decisions within the project are based on return on investment (ROI), rather than merit. In fact, if killing the project or running all competing miners out of business is more profitable, many actors involved are obligated to attempt to do so. The author suggests that if merit were important, there should be a way to finance development that provides real financial incentives for merit. Additionally, the author believes that demurrage and increasing the money supply have more merit, but they are not profitable to existing Bitcoin investors, thus making them less discussed.</summary>
