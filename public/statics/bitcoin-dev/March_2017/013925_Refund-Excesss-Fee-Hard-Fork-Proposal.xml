    <summary>Based on the given context, it is suggested to look at the distribution of fees where most of the income is generated from transactions with fees near the "Lowest Invested First Basis" (LIFB). However, if miners are incentivized to not completely fill blocks due to low fee marginal transactions, this could be undesirable for Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). To address this issue, a flag for CPFP may need to be introduced so that the parent fee is not considered as LIFB.</summary>
