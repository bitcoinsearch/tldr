    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user raised concerns regarding the expense and scalability of having a commitment to a "balance" of an "address" (presumably referring to P2SH/P2PKH scripts). The user argued that this approach is not particularly useful for clients to use. However, another potential benefit was also discussed - creating infrequent utxo commitments that would allow new clients to download just the contents of the utxo set without having to retrieve the entire blockchain history, which is much larger.</summary>
