    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rodney Morris made a comment that if every personal computer is not able to run a full node, then bitcoin will be consigned to the dustbin of history. This statement exemplifies a failure to understand the Bitcoin security model, according to an anonymous post that responded to Morris's remark. The post argues that if a typical personal computer cannot run a node, there is no security. The cause of the block size debate, according to the post, is the failure to understand the Bitcoin security model.</summary>
