    <summary>In a discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tim Ruffing suggested that having a standardized way of indicating connection status to clients would be useful. This could potentially include an "out-of-date" warning similar to the one used in the Qt GUI when Bitcoin Core is catching up to the network. However, Ruffing later corrected himself and stated that he had mixed up two separate issues: keepalive for longpolling and the definition of low and high. Regarding the issue of keepalive for longpolling, Ruffing expressed uncertainty about whether it's better solved with TCP keepalive or on a higher layer. Meanwhile, on the topic of defining low and high, Ruffing felt that providing exact definitions in the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) would not be detrimental since it's a minor issue overall.</summary>
