    <summary>The Bitcoin scaling debate has become politicized, with critiques of changes based on who is submitting the BIP rather than its contents. To avoid this issue in the future, Chris Stewart proposes a pseudonymous BIP system where authors must submit under a pseudonym. The format would look like “BIP: 1337, Author: 9458b7f9f76131f18823d73770e069d55beb271b at protonmail.com,” and the author’s hash could be used to prove credit if desired after acceptance. This would make the BIP process more meritocratic, leveling the playing field by removing identity from the equation. It would also prevent trolls from discussing the protocol changes.</summary>
