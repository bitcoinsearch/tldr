    <summary>The implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in Bitcoin Core has been discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. After SegWit activation, Bitcoin Core nodes will not attempt to download any blocks from non-SegWit peers for bandwidth optimization, but non-SegWit blocks are still valid to all nodes. Eric Voskuil suggested that pre-SegWit miners would produce blocks that no SegWit node would ever receive due to protocol requirements, but this is an implementation detail and alternate implementations could differ. Non-SegWit miners can relay their blocks to a SegWit-enabled peer through various methods, including using the RPC call "submitblock" or running a bridge node. It is noted that Bitcoin Core has been implemented to not see valid blocks announced by certain peers, but this can be worked around. Overall, although documentation needs improvement, non-SegWit miners' blocks are expected to get relayed post-SegWit activation through bridge nodes currently running.</summary>
