    <summary>On the Bitcoin development mailing list, Juan Garavaglia raised a concern regarding backward compatibility issues between nodes running version 0.13.X+ and older versions. He noted that when a block is propagated from bitcoind 0.12.+ to newer ones, those blocks are not being propagated to peers with newer versions while these newer blocks are being propagated to peers with older versions with no issues. Pieter Wuille responded that this is expected behavior as nodes with segwit active only download blocks from other segwit peers, as old peers cannot provide the witness data they need to verify the blocks. This has raised concerns about the lack of documentation regarding this incompatibility and the importance of segwit bridge nodes for bridging mainnet.</summary>
