    <summary>The conversation between Praxelogy_guy and Sergio Demian Lerner revolves around the potential 4Mb block size increase with Segwit2mb. While Segwit does not immediately lead to 2 Mb blocks, it can achieve close to a 2Mb increase if all Bitcoin wallets switch to Segwit, which may take a few years. Lerner does not expect transactions per block to quadruple from one day to another. Praxeology_guy asks Lerner to confirm that he understands that the current Segwit proposal comes bundled with an effective 2MB block size increase. He seeks clarification on whether Lerner is proposing to remove this bundled policy change and have a different BIP that increases the block size.</summary>
