    <summary>On a Bitcoin development list, Peter R criticized the use of the term "network upgrade" instead of the accepted technical term "hard fork," which he found to be misleading. He also expressed frustration with the lack of clarity around whose proposal the "network upgrade" was and the use of sales tactics in the explanation of the proposal. Eric Voskuil had been the one to present the proposal on behalf of an unknown group. Ayms, who posted the original message, questioned why the proposal was being presented if there wasn't interest in confirming or improving it. Ayms also included links to Zcash wallets, Bitcoin wallets, a dynamic blocklist, and other projects they were involved with at the end of their message.</summary>
