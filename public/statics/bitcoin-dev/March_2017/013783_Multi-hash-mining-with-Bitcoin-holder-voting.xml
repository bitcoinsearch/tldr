    <summary>Adam Perlow and Nathan Cook have proposed a method of combining multi-hash with bitcoin stake voting to mine blocks under each hash function in a similar way to difficulty targeting. They suggest targeting a ratio of blocks mined under each hash function and analyzing the voting on this ratio in terms of "voting on a simplex," using existing research to choose a good method for doing so. The proposal also offers existing miners a way back in after a contentious hard fork, utilizing their hardware. The full proposal can be found at http://topynate.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/proportionateresponse.pdf (archived at http://www.webcitation.org/6pEZLlZoW).</summary>
