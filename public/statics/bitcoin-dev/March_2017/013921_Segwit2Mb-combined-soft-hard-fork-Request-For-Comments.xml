    <summary>Segwit2Mb is a project aiming to resolve the conflict between different political positions regarding segwit activation and an increase of on-chain blockchain space through standard block size increase. It combines segwit with a 2MB block size hard-fork activated only if segwit activates and 95% of miners signaling, at a fixed future date. The proposal aims to reunite the Bitcoin community and avoid a cryptocurrency split. Segwit2Mb does not aim to be the best possible technical solution but rather a least common denominator. The proposal does not compromise the future scalability or decentralization of Bitcoin as small block size increases have been proven not to affect Bitcoin value propositions. In the worst case, a 2X block size increase has much lower economic impact than the last Bitcoin halving.</summary>
