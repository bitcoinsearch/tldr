    <summary>In an email exchange, Andrew Johnson suggested that users could run a pruned node to avoid storing a complete copy of the blockchain. However, he noted that pruned nodes are not the default configuration, which may explain why more users do not use them. If pruned nodes were the default, it would likely increase the burden on archive nodes. Johnson suggested that further discussion about disk space requirements be taken to another thread.</summary>
