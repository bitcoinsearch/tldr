    <summary>In March 2017, a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around the issue of backward compatibility between Bitcoin Core versions 0.13.X+ and older versions. The problem was that when nodes running version 0.12.+ tried to propagate blocks to newer nodes, those blocks were not being propagated to peers with newer versions while these newer blocks were being propagated to peers with older versions with no issues. Pieter Wuille, in response, pointed out that this behavior was expected as nodes with SegWit active only download blocks from other SegWit peers, as old peers cannot provide the witness data they need to verify the blocks.Earlier, there were bridge nodes being run on testnet at one point to prevent forks. The commit for this can be found on GitHub.</summary>
