    <summary>A discussion among members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the safety and feasibility of increasing the block size limit for Bitcoin transactions. One participant suggested a paper as reading material, but another dismissed it as unconvincing due to questionable assumptions and a focus on miner costs instead of node costs. The conversation also touched on a proposed hard fork approach to removing the 1MB block size limit in the future while still limiting the maximum block size to 32MiB. Some participants expressed concerns about the potential risks and impact on smaller miners. Overall, the discussion highlights the ongoing debate within the Bitcoin community regarding how to scale the network to accommodate increasing demand without compromising security or decentralization.</summary>
