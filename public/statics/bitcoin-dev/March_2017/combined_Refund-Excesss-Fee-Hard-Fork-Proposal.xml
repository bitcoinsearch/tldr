    <summary>A proposal to change the fee policy for bitcoin transactions has been put forward in a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposed hard fork change involves refunding excess fee amounts higher than the lowest included fee in a block, which would reduce all fee/byte in a block to the lowest included fee/byte and have transactions specify which outputs get what portions of the transaction fee. This change aims to address issues with miners seeking pure profit by filling their blocks with transactions that have the highest fee/byte, leaving users who want to create transactions with the lowest fee watching the LIFB so that they can make a transaction that offers a fee at or above the LIFB for reasonable inclusion time. While this proposed hard fork change is a big one, it is uncertain whether such a hard fork will be worthwhile due to potential performance problems associated with it. Additionally, if fees are very small and there is little difference between a high priority fee/byte and the LIFB, then the issue may not be significant. An alternate approach suggested in the discussion was to incentivize miners to follow transaction fees more by reducing mining rewards, which could be done through a soft fork requiring a chunk of all mining rewards to be sent to an unspendable address.To address potential issues with Child Pays For Parent (CPFP), a flag for CPFP may need to be introduced so that the parent fee is not considered as LIFB. Overall, the proposal to change the fee policy for bitcoin transactions is put forward, but it remains unclear whether it will be worthwhile to implement.</summary>
