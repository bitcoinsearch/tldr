    <summary>In an email conversation, Trevin Hofmann and Bryan discussed the issue of non-upgraded miners producing invalid blocks which will be orphaned. While Hofmann argued that if non-upgraded miners do not produce blocks that are invalid per new rules, their blocks will not be orphaned, Bryan contended that there is no need for a "wakeup call to upgrade" as the point of a soft-fork is to reduce incompatibility. He suggested that they can run "border nodes" to be more sure about this.</summary>
