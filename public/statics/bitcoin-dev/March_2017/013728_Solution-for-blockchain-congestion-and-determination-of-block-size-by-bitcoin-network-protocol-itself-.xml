    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin community has asked whether a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) should be submitted to address concerns over spamming the network, block sizes and release schedule/consensus levels. Responding to the query, another member noted that there was no quadratic hashing solution to these problems, and suggested the proposal would be similar to BIP107, which is already in place. However, there were no further details about when such a proposal might be released or what consensus levels it would need to reach.</summary>
