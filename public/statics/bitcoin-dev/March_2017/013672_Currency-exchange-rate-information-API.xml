    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tim Ruffing suggests that servers should be authenticated at a minimum to prevent attackers from manipulating exchange rates. HTTPS would be sufficient for this purpose as it operates at the same layer. He also questions whether longpolling is useful and if the historical rate feature is necessary for typical applications. When displaying historical transactions, it makes sense to use the market rate at the time the payment was made. If a service or wallet doesn't want to provide/use historical information, it can simply not implement that part. The client should be allowed to decide on which time scale the data should be (tick, min, hour, day, etc.) and clearly define the type field. Pushing may be more appropriate for "current" rates than polling, but this adds complexity in other places.</summary>
