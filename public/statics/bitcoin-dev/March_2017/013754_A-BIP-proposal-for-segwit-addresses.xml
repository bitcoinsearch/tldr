    <summary>Andreas Schildbach, a developer, suggested using Base 43 for QR code encoding in Bitcoin Wallet to make addresses shorter. However, this method may not be efficient as it can cause significant downsides such as non-alphanumeric characters that may be difficult for non-English-speaking users and incompatible with certain contexts. The suggestion was made in response to the use of Base 32, which is seen as less efficient than the QR code alphanumeric mode that can accommodate 44 characters. Peter Todd, another developer, advises reviewing the "Rational" section of the BIP for more details.</summary>
