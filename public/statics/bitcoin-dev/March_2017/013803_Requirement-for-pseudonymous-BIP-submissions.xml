    <summary>A post on the Bitcoin development mailing list discussed the importance of anonymity for developers. The poster expressed concern that being a "recognisable target" could discourage contributions and suggested that developers should not build public personas. The post also criticised BitFury's CEO for threatening to sue developers, stating that decisions about the project should be made on merit alone. Another issue raised was privacy concerns with using personal accounts on GitHub. In response, another poster argued that sometimes recognition is more important than merit. They suggested that the focus should be on creating a safe space for merit and recommended http://gplspace.org/.</summary>
