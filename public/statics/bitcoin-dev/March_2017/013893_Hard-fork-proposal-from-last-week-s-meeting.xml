    <summary>The cost of running nodes is an important factor in maintaining a decentralized network. Incentives to run nodes can encourage more people to participate in the network. For example, if someone has servers that are not being fully utilized, they could decide to run nodes without incurring additional costs while also receiving rewards. While this may not be profitable, it does not interfere with the primary function of the servers. However, simply relying on incentives may not be enough. People are unlikely to run nodes for a network they do not use for their own transactions. This could lead to centralization if transaction fees become too high for most economic activity. It is therefore important to address on-chain scaling before lightning hits. Tom Zander has created simple wallets for both Zcash and Bitcoin, as well as a dynamic blocklist for torrents. He also offers tools for anti-spies and private torrents. His projects can be found on GitHub, along with his node-Tor project for anonymous browsing.</summary>
