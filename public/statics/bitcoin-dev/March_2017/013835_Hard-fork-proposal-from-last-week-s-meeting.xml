    <summary>In an email thread on Tuesday, March 28th, 2017 at 19:34:23 CEST on bitcoin-dev, Johnson Lau proposed that the community should prepare for a potential hard fork with unknown parameters. However, this suggestion was not agreed upon and Tom Zander asked for comments on a specific suggestion instead. Tom Zander is known for his blog and vlog on cryptocurrencies, which can be accessed through his website https://zander.github.io.</summary>
