    <summary>A suggestion was made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to encourage miners to include more transactions in their blocks. This proposal is aimed at discouraging miners from mining empty blocks for a speed advantage and instead incentivizing them to mine full blocks. The proposal suggests that when two blocks of the same height are found, preference should be given to the block with more transactions. This would increase the incentive for miners to include more transactions in their blocks, as a miner thinking the faster propagation of a smaller block will win him the reward, but that would no longer be a good assumption. However, some argue that this measure is not primarily meant to stop malicious miners from attacking the chain by mining small or empty blocks since they can still attack the chain in many ways.</summary>
