    <summary>A recent email exchange between Jorge Timón and Luke Dashjr on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed the need for better organization in Bitcoin's full block validation specification. Timón suggested that the "Creation of proofs" section should precede "Proof verification," and recommended a clearer definition for "full-weight block proof." Dashjr added a definitions section to the spec and clarified language around rechecking blocks known to be invalid. The two also discussed the need for establishing the correct number of transactions in a block and how a "full tx size proof" can help achieve this, although it was noted that current methods may not be sufficient.</summary>
