    <summary>The message discusses the activation of SegWit, which is defined by BIP9. The current proposal suggests that if at least 1916 out of 2016 blocks in a full retarget cycle signal readiness for SegWit, it will be activated in the retarget cycle after the next one. However, some people are suggesting that this requirement be changed to only require one block out of 2016 to signal readiness. Some participants who do not upgrade may refuse to build on SegWit blocks or even build on malicious invalid SegWit blocks. In response, the suggestion is to fork and let them learn the hard way. The message also includes code related to SegWit activation and a discussion about whether it is BIP9 compatible.</summary>
