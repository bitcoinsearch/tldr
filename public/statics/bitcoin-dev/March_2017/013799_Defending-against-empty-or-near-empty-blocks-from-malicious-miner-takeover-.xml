    <summary>A conversation on the Bitcoin development list has raised concerns over the language used to describe future network upgrades. The discussion centred around whether it was misleading to use the term "network upgrade" instead of the accepted term, hard fork, and whether a proposed attack on the old chain was an attempt to transfer economic activity from BTC to BTU. There were also questions raised about the ethics of minority hash power producers in such situations.</summary>
