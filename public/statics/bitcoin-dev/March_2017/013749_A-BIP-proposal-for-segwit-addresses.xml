    <title>A BIP proposal for segwit addresses</title>

    <summary>Pieter, a developer, has proposed a new BIP for native segwit addresses to replace the current BIP 142. These addresses are optional but offer better efficiency and flexibility in addition to being user-friendly. The format of these addresses is base 32 with a simple checksum algorithm that provides strong error detection properties. Reference code in multiple languages as well as a website demonstrating it are included. The text of the proposal can be found on GitHub.</summary>
