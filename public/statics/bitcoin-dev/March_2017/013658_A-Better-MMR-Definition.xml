    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille suggested that maintaining a lookup table from prevouts to transaction output (TXO) tree positions can be done by wallets or service providers for their own coins instead of every full node and miner individually for everyone's coins. Bram Cohen countered that this approach falls apart if the goal is to support proofs of non-spend, which is the purpose of the exercise at hand. No further details were provided.</summary>
