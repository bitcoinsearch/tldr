    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently experiencing a debate on scaling, and the politicization of protocol-level changes could hinder technical progress. To avoid this, Chris Stewart proposed the use of a pseudonymous BIP system, requiring authors to submit their proposals under a pseudonym. This would allow the focus to be solely on the proposal's technical merits, rather than who submitted it. Any individual submitting patches to the BIP would not be required to submit under a pseudonym. By doing so, it would level the playing field in terms of meritocracy, with the BIP process becoming even more meritocratic. The author can reveal the preimage of the author hash to prove they were the original author of the BIP after its acceptance. The goal is to maintain principled money and vet claims made by authority figures, to prevent the system from devolving into one based on democratic vote or the votes of select few elites.</summary>
