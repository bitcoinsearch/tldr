    <summary>In a message to bitcoin-dev, Martin Stolze describes his interest in being able to choose where he conducts business using Bitcoin. He proposes that the physical location of the miner is irrelevant as Bitcoins blockchain is a digital space and whoever governs this block space has authority over it. As such, transaction processors could be motivated to behave in accordance with user interest if fees are dependent on revenue, provided that users are willing to pay a fee. Martin suggests transaction tiering as a means for transaction processors to respect user interests. However, Tim Ruffing replies, indicating that the physical location or jurisdiction of the miner does not have legal implications for law applicable to the relationship between sender and receiver of a payment. Furthermore, there is no need for a mechanism that enables users to select miners given that almost nobody cares who will mine a transaction.</summary>
