    <summary>There have been reports of reorganizations in the Bitcoin testnet, with forks being created by multiple users mining different blocks on each chain. Investigations have revealed that the issue occurs with nodes running version 0.12, which may have longer or different chains than those running newer versions such as 0.13. The problem lies in the communication between the different versions, and newer blocks are not being propagated to older nodes, while older blocks are being propagated without issues. This indicates a backward compatibility issue, which can be replicated by forcing a node to exclusively use peers running 0.12 or older versions. While there have been no reported malicious uses of this issue, it is important for node owners running 0.13 or higher to be aware of the potential for isolation by 0.12 peers.</summary>
