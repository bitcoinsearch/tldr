    <summary>The proposal to optimize transaction selection by introducing a second dimension has been criticized for unnecessarily complicating the process for miners. The use of block weight in Segwit already solves this issue, making the proposed solution redundant and potentially problematic. The Bin Packing Problem is also referenced as an example of the complications that could arise from introducing additional dimensions. Overall, it is argued that the proposed solution would not make any significant improvements and should be reconsidered.</summary>
