    <title>A Commitment-suitable UTXO set "Balances" file data structure</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, praxeology_guy proposed using Merkle tree hashes to store output transactions and output numbers. However, another member of the list was not in favor of this format and suggested using a patricia trie instead to allow for incremental updates. The proposed Merkle set format would work well for the intended usage and could be synced with the work difficulty reset interval of 2016. A shorter block period would result in more frequent checks on UTXO set integrity, but it may require nodes to keep more copies of the balances file. With a patricia based format, it would be possible to make much more common UTXO commitments with minimal cost of updating and reorgs could be handled by undoing the last few transactions in the set and rolling forward.</summary>
