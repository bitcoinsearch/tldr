    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on March 6th, 2017, Tim Ruffing discussed the need for a periodic message system in longpolling. Longpolling is a process that allows clients to request updates from a server, and without periodic messages, clients cannot distinguish between a situation where the value is still within requested bounds and a situation where the connection has dropped. This lack of distinction could lead to a wrong decision by the user if they assume the value is still in bounds when the server has actually died.</summary>
