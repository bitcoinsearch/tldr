    <summary>Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician from Blockstream, has developed a new technique to link multi-hop Lightning channels using “scriptless scripts”. The proposed method allows for reblinding and is based on treating x -&gt; xG as a hash function. Poelstra found that this approach can be used to construct a signature revealing the preimage or create a “pre-signature” which can then be turned into a signature with the help of the preimage. To achieve this, Andrew uses a series of tricks to construct a path consisting of transactions that are signed with single uniformly random independent Schnorr signatures after obtaining a challenge T = xG from D in an atomic Lightning path. This innovative approach may have significant implications for the development of the Lightning Network, allowing for more efficient and secure transactions.</summary>
