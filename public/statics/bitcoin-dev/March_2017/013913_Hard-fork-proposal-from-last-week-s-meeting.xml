    <summary>The cost of running a node that could handle 300% of the 2015 worldwide nonbitcoin transaction volume today would be a rounding error for most exchanges even if prices didn't rise. However, some people question why PayPal has multiple data centers, and why Visa and banking systems have multiple data centers each. The reason behind it is that a global payment system requires that much juice to run at high transaction volumes. It's essential that Bitcoin's security is maintained by active full nodes run by everyday users. Despite this, the assessment that handling such a load would be a rounding error in the budget of a major exchange or Bitcoin processor may not be accurate unless there is professional experience working directly with transaction processors handling millions of financial transactions per day. The quality of the thread as a whole has been low.</summary>
