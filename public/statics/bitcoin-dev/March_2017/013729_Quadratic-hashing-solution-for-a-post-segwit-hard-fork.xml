    <summary>After some discussion, it has been proposed that a post-segwit hard fork could involve a partitioning of the block into three segments: a 1MB old transaction non-witness segment, a new XMB segwit non-witness segment, and a new XMB witness segment. This would allow users of older, more expensive validation transactions to continue using them, albeit with higher fees required for the restricted space. Additionally, new segwit blocks, which don't have the hashing problem, could be included in the new non-witness segment of the block. The proposal is designed to address the issue of block size limits and increase efficiency without compromising the security of the blockchain.</summary>
