    <summary>According to recent reports, downloads from SourceForge are currently blocked in China due to the Great Firewall of China. Despite this blockage, it is still relatively easy for users in these countries to bypass network hurdles and gain access to downloads. The issue does not appear to be related to any recent sanctions.To ensure that users in these countries can access downloads without difficulty, it may be beneficial for downloads to be hosted on neutral territory. However, simply providing the SHA256 of a malware-free binary could also be an effective solution. This would allow users to verify the authenticity and safety of the downloaded file, even if they are unable to access the website directly.It is worth noting that users in countries with restrictive internet policies have become quite adept at navigating network hurdles, even those who do not possess advanced technical skills. Nonetheless, ensuring that users can access important downloads without significant hurdles remains a priority for many organizations.</summary>
