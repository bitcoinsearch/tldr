    <summary>In an email conversation on October 24, 2012, Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen discuss the memory usage of Bitcoin and ways to avoid redundant inventory announcements. The memory usage is currently bounded by the memory pool size, but they consider the worst-case scenario for an attacker trying to saturate upstream bandwidth or use lots of memory. They suggest setting a bloom filter that matches everything and then requesting old blocks in the chain. Andresen would like the worst-case to not be any worse than the current situation of requesting full, old blocks.</summary>
