    <summary>The proposed approach to improve security in Bitcoin transactions is to move towards "uploading transactions" rather than "sending BTC to an address". This will help maintain balance between hot and cold wallets, enable multi-sig scripts, and offer better privacy by ensuring that separate transactions cannot be linked together into a single payment. In addition, SSL certificates, optional expiry times, upload targets, messaging options, opaque tokens, ability to specify payment amounts in other currencies, recurring payments, dispute mediation, suggested tip/service charges, ability to pledge for assurance contracts, minimum confirmation levels, and more desirable features are suggested.The payment upload side would include a list of Bitcoin transactions that make payments to the requested outputs, the provided opaque token, an optional signature for linking payments across merchants, and optionally, an invoice for a refund. It is recommended that protocol buffers be used over JSON since they are easier to work with in code, have a more efficient encoding, and have fewer sharp edges than JSON does.In a 2012 email exchange, Mike Hearn suggested using the SSL identity of the server taking part in a protocol as a simple solution to a problem. However, SSL itself is not non-reputable, so further measures would need to be taken for certain concerns. The idea of a signed invoice and blockchain transactions was also discussed as a potential solution but with the caveat that if dispute mediation had not been set up, there would be nobody to prove faultlessness to.The importance of being able to prove faultlessness to prospective customers was considered in the email exchange, even if formal direct remedy was not available. This could allow businesses to protect themselves from accusations of wrongdoing and demonstrate their trustworthiness to the public.It is suggested that it's worth brainstorming different feature ideas for the future to ensure a robust design. After sending payment, having a receipt that proves following the payee's instructions is important. A signed invoice and blockchain transactions can provide it, but there needs to be dispute mediation in place as well. Another feature that could be included is where-to-send-refund information with payments to handle overpayments and refunds efficiently. However, other features can wait until later versions of the protocol.In summary, there is a need for a payment protocol that offers better privacy and security for Bitcoin users. The critical issues that need to be addressed include the insecurity of Bitcoin addresses against man-in-the-middle attacks, providing receipts after sending payment, and implementing a protocol for gathering signatures from multiple devices. The proposed approach is to move towards "uploading transactions" instead of "sending BTC to an address" and to include features such as SSL certificates, optional expiry times, upload targets, messaging options, opaque tokens, ability to specify payment amounts in other currencies, recurring payments, dispute mediation, suggested tip/service charges, ability to pledge for assurance contracts, minimum confirmation levels, and more.</summary>
