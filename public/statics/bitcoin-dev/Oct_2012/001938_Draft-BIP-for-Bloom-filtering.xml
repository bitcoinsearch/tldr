    <summary>A proposal for adding parts of the merkle branches when returning a 'merkleblock' was discussed in an email chain. The proposal was to avoid slow roundtrips by including transactions that the requesting node hasn't received or announced with an 'inv'. Gavin Andresen, in response, agreed that complicating the BIP for this rare case is not necessary and suggested requiring an extra 'inv' round-trip instead of making serving/relaying nodes keep track of which transactions they have or have not sent to their peers.</summary>
