    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Pieter Wuille, they discussed the meaning of "each hash and key in the output script" and its application in matching single and multi sig outputs. They clarified that it refers to all data push operations and includes 1-byte constants. Regarding the entire output script, if one wants to match a particular multisig output script, they did not provide a clear answer.They also talked about sharing parts of the merkle branches and whether or not it is worth it. They disagreed on this matter as Pieter argued that when including M out of N transactions of a block, you never need more than N-M path entries in total to reconstruct the merkle root. However, with the proposed format, it requires M*ceil(log2(N)). For a 1000-transaction block, when matching ~everything, you need &gt;300 KiB of overhead, while almost nothing is required.</summary>
