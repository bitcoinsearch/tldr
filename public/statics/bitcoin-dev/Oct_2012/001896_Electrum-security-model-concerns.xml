    <title>Electrum security model concerns</title>

    <summary>The author of the message is requesting a proper discussion on understanding the bitcoinj security model. They have found an old page which states that pending transactions are not provided to the app, but this has not been true for a long time. The author has rewritten and extended the page, and it now links to the ETH paper. The Electrum page is designed for end-users, whereas the bitcoinj page is designed for app developers. There are no bitcoinj-based clients that explain transaction confidence to end users. The author believes that in the future, software used by end-users and merchants will diverge significantly, making it easier to tailor documentation to each user demographic. Additionally, they predict that Electrum type services will go away as more optimizations such as bloom filtering and better peer selection logic are developed, making SPV clients comparable in speed without the need for a specific server operator.</summary>
