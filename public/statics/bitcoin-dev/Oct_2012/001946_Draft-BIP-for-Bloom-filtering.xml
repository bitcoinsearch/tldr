    <summary>The argument of implementation complexity has been put forth regarding the implementation of certain components in a library code. The effort required for partial tree encoding and custom compression has not been fully understood, but the implementation may be possible over the next few weeks. Example code is being sought for representing partial Merkle trees. The hash function used is not cryptographically strong and this raises concerns about a potential bandwidth attack. However, it is mentioned that attacks on bandwidth can be carried out through other means such as repeatedly downloading blocks or spamming random generated transactions to whoever connects. Therefore, it seems odd to worry about a much more complicated attack.</summary>
