    <summary>The proposed change to the Bitcoin reference implementation to redefine transaction validity rules has received support from Gavin Andresen, who believes it is important to allow people an opportunity to fix their software. He also asked if there were any objections from other transaction-validating implementations. The proposed change was put forward by Pieter Wuille, and while some have raised concerns, overall it appears to be a positive step for the Bitcoin community.</summary>
