    <summary>Arklan emailed Steve to try and see the test cases he had worked up, but has not heard back. However, Arklan plans to go through the RC tonight. In addition, Arklan includes two quotes in the email. Jeff Garzik posted a call for testing in a forum thread regarding a release candidate QA sanity testing plan. The email also includes a signature with links to deploy New Relic APM and join the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
