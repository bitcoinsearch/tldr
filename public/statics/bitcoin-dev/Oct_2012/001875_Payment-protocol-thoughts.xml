    <summary>In an email exchange between Jeff Garzik, a former bitcoin core developer, and Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab, the issue of double-spending was brought up. Vessenes mentioned that roughly 3-5% of initial members of the Bitcoin Foundation had double-spent. Garzik asked for clarification on whether Vessenes meant that they had paid twice or sent the same coins elsewhere after sending them to CoinLab. Vessenes responded saying he had meant 'sent twice' but assured Garzik that there were no double-spends that he was aware of. The conversation took place in October 2012.</summary>
