    <summary>The Bitcoin community has agreed upon a 0.7.1 release to fix the Windows bug related to "click on a bitcoin: URI and nothing happens". Additionally, there is a proposal to fix the "I upgraded from a binary running an incompatible version of BDB and now I get a DB_RUNRECOVERY error on startup" problem. A pull request has been made which fixes half of the above-mentioned problem, along with several other cases of broken wallets. Another proposed solution involves deleting the bad blkindex.dat file and re-creating it from the blk000?.dat files. Gavin Andresen, a prominent member of the Bitcoin community, asks if there are any other high-priority pull requests that need to be included in the upcoming 0.7.1 release. Finally, he suggests including some other pull requests that could potentially fix the new raw transactions API.</summary>
