    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list has suggested finding a country with more permissive laws for hosting and accessing Bitcoin-related content. Another member, Luke-Jr, questions the legality of restricting access to certain countries at the request of the USA and suggests that non-US developers evaluate their own laws to determine if they can host or access Bitcoin content. The specific reason SourceForge has restricted access should also be made known. However, Luke-Jr notes that GitHub may also be problematic as it is US-located. The email thread includes an ad for New Relic app performance management.</summary>
