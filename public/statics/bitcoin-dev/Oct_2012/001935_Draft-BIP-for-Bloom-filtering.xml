    <summary>There are some questions that need to be answered. One of them is why the number of matching transactions is limited to 255, which was a copy/paste error in the previous statement. Another question is related to the meaning of "each hash and key in the output script". It is an informal way of referring to data elements, and inserting a key can match both single and multi-sig outputs. The third question is whether sharing parts of the Merkle branches is worth it, and the answer is probably not according to the context.</summary>
