    <summary>In an email exchange in October 2012, Gregory Maxwell raised a concern about the inefficiency of constantly resending common tree fragments. He also pointed out that this inefficiency contradicts the privacy argument for the particular mechanism being used. The reason being that if the filter is not set somewhat broadly, it could uniquely identify the user. However, setting the filter too broadly would result in more bandwidth being used.</summary>
