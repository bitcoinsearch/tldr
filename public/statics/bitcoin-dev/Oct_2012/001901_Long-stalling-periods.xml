    <summary>The author of the text reports that they have removed their blockchain information and started redownloading it using the latest git version (tagged v0.7.1rc1) on a fast connection with an SSD disk. They are experiencing a lot of duplicate blocks being processed, which slows down the process significantly while the chain height does not increase anymore. The author wonders if this is expected and if there is a way to limit unnecessary block downloads. The text then goes on to display a series of SetBestChain messages, indicating new best chains at different heights and dates. The author received some accepted blocks but also encountered several errors where they already had the block or fetched inputs that were not found in the mempool. Finally, the author added addresses from two different IP addresses and received more blocks, including one that was already in their possession.</summary>
