    <summary>A user named Arklan expressed interest in testing a project and requested a link and instructions on how to access it. Pieter Wuille announced that he had merged his "ultraprune" branch into mainline, which involved significant changes and welcomed any testing. The ultraprune feature uses an ultra-pruned copy of the block chain for validation instead of a transaction index into the block chain, resulting in better performance and a smaller working set size for validation. The changes include new files, directories, and RPC calls, with LevelDB replacing Berkeley DB for better I/O performance. Wuille believes this is an evolution towards separation between validation nodes and archive nodes, which is needed. No link or instructions were provided for Arklan.</summary>
