    <summary>The Testing Project, aimed at creating a self-organizing community for QA testing, has hit some roadblocks. While Steve is great at creating test cases, creating a "community" of testing poses a challenge. The BetterMeans platform did not help and was more of a hindrance than a help. Gavin Andresen hopes to move on from the failed experiment and tag a 0.7.1rc1 release in the next few days. He wants to establish a process for QA testers to sanity-test release builds and sign-off as either "Tested/problems found" or "Tested/OK". Additionally, he wants a place online where he can verify if all supported platforms have been tested before releasing the final version. There is currently no relationship between the Foundation and the Testing Project.</summary>
