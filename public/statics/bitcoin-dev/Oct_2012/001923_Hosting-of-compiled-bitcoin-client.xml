    <summary>In an email conversation, Mark Lister and Wladimir discuss the issue of Sourceforge blocking downloads in certain countries. Mark argues that the problem is not related to cryptography but instead to trade with sanctioned countries where making files available for download is considered a form of trade. Wladimir agrees with Mark's assessment and adds that he believes the issue is also related to the Great Firewall of China since Sourceforge downloads are blocked there as well. Despite the restrictions, both Mark and Wladimir note that it is relatively easy to bypass them.</summary>
