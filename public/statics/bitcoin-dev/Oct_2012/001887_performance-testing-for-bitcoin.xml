    <summary>There is a question on the best way to obtain performance numbers for modifications to bitcoin. While profiling it while running on testnet might work, it would take a long time to get data. The query is whether there is any way to speed this up if we only needed to provide relative performance between tests, in a sense a fast performance regression test. One possibility suggested is to replay real bitcoin transactions to a test-net-in-a-box network that has the actual blockchain history loaded into it but then operates at a far reduced hash difficulty to facilitate running quickly. However, the writer is interested in knowing if there are existing techniques/scripts for some kind of perf testing with traffic that approximates real-world traffic since the test infrastructure that ships with bitcoin does not appear to provide this. It is unclear whether the writer intends to use any of these methods or wants to know about them in general.</summary>
