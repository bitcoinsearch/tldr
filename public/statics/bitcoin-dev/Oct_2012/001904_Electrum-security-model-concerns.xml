    <summary>In this email thread from 2012, Mike Hearn discusses various issues related to Bitcoin with other individuals. One topic discussed is the Electrum project, which has a daemon for merchants. The conversation also touches on transaction confidence and how it can be communicated effectively to users. Hearn suggests that there is a middle ground where it is not hidden, but explained. The lack of reported double-spends against unconfirmed transactions is also mentioned, although Hearn acknowledges that people may not report all losses. He proposes adding one-liners that link to a page explaining different security models. Another topic discussed is finding someone trustworthy and capable to work on the bitcoin.org website. Hearn notes that this is challenging due to the politicization of the matter and the potential for allegations of misconduct. He emphasizes the need for Bitcoin to have a stronger voice and suggests creating an FAQ to address these issues. Overall, the email thread highlights some of the challenges and complexities involved in developing and promoting Bitcoin.</summary>
