    <summary>The author suggests that it's worth brainstorming different feature ideas for the future to ensure a robust design. Bitcoin addresses alone are insecure against man-in-the-middle attacks, and embedding a signature and cert chain into the invoice itself would help solve this problem. Allowing several different sigs/cert chains is also pretty easy and keeps the design open to cases where SSL may not be appropriate. After sending payment, having a receipt that proves following the payee's instructions is important. A signed invoice and blockchain transactions can provide it, but there needs to be dispute mediation in place as well. The author also proposes a protocol for gathering signatures from multiple devices as an extension or variation of the basic payment protocol. This could be implemented by wrapping invoices with another protocol, although there are different ways to do it and no agreement on what it should look like yet.</summary>
