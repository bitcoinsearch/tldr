    <summary>According to Jeff Garzik, any level of testing is useful and appreciated in Bitcoin software testing effort. Various types of testing that are helpful include "it works" testing, major features testing, stress and fuzz testing, regression testing, unit function testing, full peer automated testing, and data-driven tests. The community can help by downloading and running the Release Candidates and the latest version of Bitcoin software and reporting any problems or success on a forum thread. It is challenging to organize any testing regime with open source volunteers, but any amount of testing and test-case writing, large or small, is helpful to Bitcoin.</summary>
