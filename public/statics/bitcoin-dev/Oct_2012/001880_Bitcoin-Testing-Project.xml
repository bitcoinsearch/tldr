    <summary>In this email conversation, Steve expresses his willingness to work for free, but he would love to be able to ditch his day job. He has over 400 test cases and believes that people should be compensated for writing test cases, executing them, passing or failing them in that order. He adds that QA should not be judged based solely on bug reports, which is unfair and will result in a race to report bugs. Steve says that he personally believes that Bitcoin testers should earn Bitcoins for their work, and workflow and testcase software should be put in place so that people can be measured and compensated for their work. Steve also talks about the confusing time and how he doesn't know if he is doing right from wrong, trying to lead without leading and feels like he is wasting people's time. He offers to provide more information on various workflow stuff off-list.</summary>
