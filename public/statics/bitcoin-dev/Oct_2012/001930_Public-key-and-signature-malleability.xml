    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed to establish strict rules to define the Bitcoin network and eliminate dependency on OpenSSL's implementation. This proposal was supported by Wladimir who expressed concern about the possibility of changes in OpenSSL API leading to unexpected behavior and forks, which could be beyond the control of Bitcoin. It was suggested that all parsing and processing should be defined self-containedly without referencing specific implementations of other libraries. The goal is to make the protocol as well-defined as possible.</summary>
