    <summary>In the context provided, an attacker's worst-case scenario for getting a user to saturate their upstream bandwidth or use lots of memory is discussed. The suggestion given is to set a bloom filter that matches everything and then request old blocks in the chain. Although this method would be slightly worse than shipping a full block, it would still achieve the desired outcome. However, if the goal is simply to saturate bandwidth or disk IOPS, the attacker could simply request random blocks repeatedly. This method would likely prove effective in achieving the desired outcome without the need for a specialized approach like setting a bloom filter.</summary>
