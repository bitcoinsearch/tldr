    <summary>Arklan Uth Oslin suggests having a separate Bitcoin test list, but Jeff Garzik points out that the current Bitcoin-devel list is low traffic and there is no issue of crowding. Arklan hopes that more people will get on board with testing in the future and having a separate list would help with archival purposes. The context also includes two quotes from Arklan: "As long as there is light, the darkness holds no fear. And yet, even in the deepest black, there is life" and "I want to leave this world the same way I came into it: backwards and on fire."</summary>
