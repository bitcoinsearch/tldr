    <summary>Jeff Garzik, the CEO of exMULTI, Inc., created a forum thread called "Bitcoin cookbook" on Bitcointalk.org. The purpose of this thread is to gather real-world examples of advanced uses of Bitcoin in step-by-step format. Those who have a recipe to share can create a new thread and then mention it in the cookbook. The hope is that some of these recipes will eventually be migrated to the wiki, although the wiki is not an ideal place for discussion and questions.</summary>
