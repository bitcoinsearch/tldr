    <summary>It has been reported that downloads from SourceForge are blocked in China due to the Great Firewall of China. However, it is still quite easy to bypass the blockage. The issue seems to be unrelated to recent sanctions. Users in these countries can quickly learn how to bypass network hurdles, even non-technical users. It would be beneficial to host downloads on neutral territory, but providing the SHA256 of a malware-free binary could also suffice.</summary>
