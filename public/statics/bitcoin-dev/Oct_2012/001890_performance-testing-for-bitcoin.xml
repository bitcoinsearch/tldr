    <summary>In an email exchange between Ian Miers and Jeff Garzik on October 3, 2012, Ian inquired about the best way to get performance numbers for modifications to Bitcoin. He was primarily concerned with script evaluation performance and was experimenting with adding new instruction types, but needed to test their effect on performance by being able to intersperse transactions with the new instructions with existing ones. To achieve accuracy, he wanted his simulated traffic to approximate real-world traffic. Jeff responded that it was important to be specific about what aspect of performance was being measured because "performance" is a vague term. Many aspects of blockchain performance can be measured by importing blocks via -loadblock=FILE, but other performance measurements, such as how fast a block relays through the network, cannot be as easily measured. Ian also asked if there was any benchmarking or instrumentation in bitcoind. The email exchange ended there and did not provide further information on this topic.</summary>
