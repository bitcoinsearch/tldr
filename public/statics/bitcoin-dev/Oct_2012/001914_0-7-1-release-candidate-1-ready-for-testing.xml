    <summary>In an email thread on October 11, 2012 between Arklan Uth Oslin and Jeff Garzik, Arklan suggests the creation of a separate Bitcoin test list. However, Garzik points out that the current bitcoin-devel list has low traffic and there is no issue of crowding. He also mentions that having a separate list would make it more difficult for people to chime in. Garzik is the founder of exMULTI, Inc. and his email address is jgarzik@exmulti.com.</summary>
