    <summary>The context is a discussion between Ian Miers and Jeff Garzik about how to obtain performance numbers for modifications to Bitcoin. Ian Miers was looking for ways to speed up the process of measuring performance as profiling it while running on testnet would take a long time. Jeff Garzik suggested being specific about what aspects of performance are being measured since "performance" is vague. He also recommended measuring blockchain performance by importing blocks via -loadblock=FILE but noted that other performance measurements such as how fast a block can relay through the network cannot be easily measured.</summary>
