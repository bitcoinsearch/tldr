    <summary>On October 10, 2012, Jeff Garzik proposed to freeze the tree following the 0.7.1 release until ultraprune was either added or rejected. Wladimir agreed with this proposal and stated that getting ultraprune in should be a priority. He had already pulled small changes that were previously approved for post-0.7.1. However, Wladimir later realized that 0.7.1 was still in rc (release candidate) and not final. He had merged #1901 from laanwj/2012_10_remove_strlcpy, #1900 from Diapolo/optionsmodel_getters, #1913 from sipa/noi2p, and #1879 from sipa/fdatasync, but did not believe any of these changes would cause issues in rc2. The proposal is to freeze the tree after the 0.7.1 release until ultraprune is pulled, or rejected if that were to happen. Critical bug fixes and common sense exceptions still apply. Ultraprune does not have to be perfect to be pulled, and the pull would occur at the beginning of 0.8, leaving room for final details to be worked out in-tree. The main hurdle is getting everyone to ACK the overall design and direction of the ultraprune branch, especially Gavin. High-level design ACKs are more important to Bitcoin overall than fine-grained code review, as code mistakes can be fixed in-tree during 0.8 development once everyone agrees on the correct design. The real code mistakes and sharp edges will only be found through wide field testing. Jeff Garzik has given his Design-ACK. If there were problems, a branch would be created for 0.7.x at eb49457 and master would become the 0.8.x branch. The main challenge was getting everyone to acknowledge the overall design and direction of the ultraprune branch, particularly Gavin. However, high-level design ACKs were stated to be more important than fine-grained code review for Bitcoin's overall progress. Code mistakes can be fixed in-tree during 0.8 development once everyone has agreed on the correct design. The real code mistakes and sharp edges will only be discovered through wide field testing.</summary>
