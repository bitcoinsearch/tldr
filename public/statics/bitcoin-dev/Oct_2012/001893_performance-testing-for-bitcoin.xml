    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2012, Ian Miers was seeking advice on how to get performance numbers for modifications to Bitcoin. He was primarily concerned with script evaluation performance as he was working on adding some new instruction types and needed to test how that would affect performance. To achieve accuracy, simulated traffic was required to at least approximate real-world traffic. Jeff Garzik replied stating that specific aspects of blockchain performance can be measured by importing blocks via -loadblock=FILE, but other performance measurements like "how fast does a block relay through the network" cannot be easily measured. Joel chimed in with his opinion that benchmarking only good approximations of real-world traffic is not enough, and that worst-case scenarios should be benchmarked to avoid creating a DoS vulnerability. Finally, there was a call to action to deploy New Relic APM for application performance management.</summary>
