    <summary>The proposal is to freeze the tree after the 0.7.1 release until ultraprune is pulled, or rejected if that were to happen. Critical bug fixes and common sense exceptions still apply. Ultraprune does not have to be perfect to be pulled, and the pull would occur at the beginning of 0.8, leaving room for final details to be worked out in-tree. The main hurdle is getting everyone to ACK the overall design and direction of the ultraprune branch, especially Gavin. High-level design ACKs are more important to Bitcoin overall than fine-grained code review, as code mistakes can be fixed in-tree during 0.8 development once everyone agrees on the correct design. The real code mistakes and sharp edges will only be found through wide field testing. Jeff Garzik has given his Design-ACK.</summary>
