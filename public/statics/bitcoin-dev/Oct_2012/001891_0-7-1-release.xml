    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Wladimir on October 3, 2012, it was decided to do a 0.7.1 release to fix the "click on a bitcoin: URI and nothing happens" bug on Windows. They also agreed to add a pull request for in-place reindexing of blockchain data files and another one for adding LOCK() for proxy related data-structures to avoid random crashes due to missing synchronization primitives. These were considered as very-high-priority pull requests that should go into the 0.7.1 release while the rest could wait. Links to the pull requests were included in the email.</summary>
