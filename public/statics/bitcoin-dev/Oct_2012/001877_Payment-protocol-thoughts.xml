    <summary>In an email exchange from 2012, Mike Hearn suggested that using the SSL identity of the server taking part in a protocol could be a simple solution to a problem. However, it was noted that SSL itself is not non-reputable, so further measures would need to be taken for certain concerns. The idea of a signed invoice and blockchain transactions was also brought up as a potential solution, but with the caveat that if dispute mediation had not been set up, there would be nobody to prove faultlessness to.The exchange considered the importance of being able to prove faultlessness to prospective customers, even if formal direct remedy was not available. This would allow businesses to protect themselves from accusations of wrongdoing and demonstrate their trustworthiness to the public.</summary>
