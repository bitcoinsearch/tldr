    <summary>In an email exchange dated October 26, 2012, Mike Hearn discusses the possibility of a denial-of-service attack on the Bitcoin network. He mentions that while it hasn't happened yet, it is trivial to do so and the only reason for such an attack would be random griefing. Altcoins have been attacked in the past, but the Bitcoin network has been fortunate in terms of low levels of griefing, likely because DOS attacking Bitcoin is harder than people believe. Hearn argues that just because people aren't attacking much now doesn't mean that a new vulnerability should be accepted, especially a normative vulnerability in the protocol. In response to the suggestion that governments might be a source of concern, he disagrees, stating that this kind of thinking is "black helicopter junk."</summary>
