    <summary>On October 10, 2012, Jeff Garzik proposed to freeze the tree following the 0.7.1 release until ultraprune was pulled in or rejected. Wladimir agreed with this proposal and stated that getting ultraprune in should be a priority. Wladimir also mentioned that he had already pulled all small stuff that was previously acknowledged for post-0.7.1. Thus, the freeze could start.</summary>
