    <summary>Rob Meijer has proposed an updated version of MinorFs, a filesystem concept that provides private members to objects, which could be used by Bitcoin on systems supporting AppArmor. The purpose is to give pseudo-persistent processes their own private but decomposable and delegatable piece of filesystem storage, which is suitable for applications that want to protect user data such as Bitcoin wallets from malware running under the same UID as that user. However, there are some concerns about whether MinorFs can work without changes to Bitcoin and if not, what is the minimal amount of changes needed.Rob Meijer is trying to rewrite MinorFs in Python in a way that would make it easier and more natural for application developers who want to protect user data. He seeks feedback from bitcoin developers to create an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity of persistent private storage for bitcoin. The author emphasizes accommodating bitcoin developer needs in the next version of MinorFs so that code to use MinorFs where available can be added to bitcoin.In an email thread from September 3, 2011, John Smith expressed interest in Rob Meijer's proposed updated MinorFs that can be used by Bitcoin on systems that support AppArmor, such as Ubuntu and OpenSuse. Smith noted that stricter privilege separation between applications on a least-authority basis is necessary for Ubuntu to keep up with Android and MacOSX. He also mentioned the need for OS-level protection for private data managed by applications running as the same user, citing examples like SSH, browsers, and PGP.Rob Meijer has designed a set of specifications for the update of MinorFs, a least authority-based set of filesystems that provides private members to objects. He seeks input from Bitcoin developers to create an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity of persistent private storage for Bitcoin. Meijer proposes that the next version should take an approach that better suits common development languages and practices. In addition to this, he has also started developing a library named LibMinorFs, which would make the usage of MinorFs by applications like Bitcoin more convenient.Rob Meijer wants Bitcoin developers to think about what attributes from the current granularity level should be kept, what attributes should be dropped, and what properties should be added to arrive at an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity of persistent private storage for Bitcoin. He solicits input that helps him help them to get the next MinorFs version.Meijer had put down the initial set of specs for a rewrite of MinorFs, which he plans to do in Python instead of Perl due to compatibility issues with rare perl modules. The new version will be built on top of current Unix/ACL permissions, similar to the android model with a UID per application/user. Meijer also plans to introduce finer granularity levels where subsystems delegate sub-trees to each other in a pass-by-reference way.Currently, wallet encryption is a simpler solution for end-users than MinorFs. However, MinorFs can complement wallet encryption by providing the pseudo-persistent process that private members provide to objects. The author has clarified that MinorFs can't guarantee that any file-system comes with once the underlying media becomes flaky. However, he also admits that he hasn't thought about proper ways to do backups yet. Moreover, there is no guarantee that MinorFs will never corrupt the wallet; hence, it is essential to find out the proper way to do backups.In response to Rob's announcement, individuals in an email thread expressed interest in the updated version of MinorFs. One individual noted that more strict privilege separation between applications would be necessary for Ubuntu if they want to keep up with Android and MacOSX. Another participant noted that wallet encryption is useful but not a substitute for OS-level protection. The API for MinorFs is defined in the inc/minorfs/ directory and the usage shown in src/testmain.cpp.</summary>
