    <summary>In an email conversation on January 27th, 2013, Peter Todd discussed the contents of seed.txt, which is a dumpfile produced by bitcoin-seeder. The file contains information about all non-banned IP addresses that have successfully connected to bitcoin. There is uptime data available, but it only covers up to one month. The connectability percentage is a decaying average with a time constant of up to a month.Peter Todd mentions that he has a script prepared that combines data from one or more seeds.txt files into a pnSeed[] array C source code. He plans to add this script to the repository. Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd are discussing the running of a dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance. IPv4 is currently supported but not IPv6, even tunnels are broken. Todd states he can set up tor if there is demand. Garzik asks how long Todd plans to run it for and Todd replies indefinitely as it's cheap at around $7.5/month. Todd also offers to give others a machine image copy easily too. They then discuss the outdated pnSeed list which nanotube usually updates. Todd suggests a simple script to transform Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[] although these should be filtered with SORB's dynamic ip list or similar and given an expiry time.The author has set up a testnet DNS seed using Pieter Wuille's bitcoin-seeder, with some modifications for testnet on a dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance. Currently, only IPv4 is supported because EC2 doesn't support IPv6, even tunnels are broken. The author also hasn't set up tor yet but can do both if there is demand. The next step is to create a new strTestNetDNSSeed in the Satoshi client, but it would be better if at least one more person had a testnet seed to include in the list. It is recommended to leave IRC enabled too. Additionally, the author mentions that the pnSeed list is outdated. The author asks Pieter if he has written any start/stop/monitoring scripts for the seeder and shares their modifications at git://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin-seeder.git in the "testnet" branch, intending to send a pull request once it's had some testing.Peter Todd, in an email conversation with Jeff Garzik, informed that everything is running on a dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance. Currently, only IPv4 is supported as EC2 doesn't support IPv6. Todd further added that he can set up both IPv6 and Tor if there is demand for it. Jeff Garzik suggested creating a new strTestNetDNSSeed in the satoshi client, but he also mentioned it would be better to have at least one more person contributing a testnet seed to the list. IRC should remain enabled too, according to Garzik. Todd noted that the pnSeed list is way out of date, which usually gets updated when nanotube is poked. They discussed transforming Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[], which might be a nice alternative. It is unknown how long Todd plans to run this, but he presumes it will continue indefinitely if there is interest and users. Overall, the conversation between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik revolves around the possibility of running a seed node on an Amazon EC2 micro instance. Todd plans to run the node indefinitely, given that it is relatively cheap to run at $7.5/month. He also mentioned that he can provide a machine image copy easily to anyone else who wants it. They also talked about updating the pnSeed list, which is out of date. Nanotube usually does the update, but a simple script that transforms Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[] might be a nice alternative. By creating a scripted and repeatable process, it would make updating the list more transparent and easy to maintain. Additionally, the author has set up a testnet DNS seed using Pieter Wuille's bitcoin-seeder, with some modifications for testnet on a dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance. Currently, only IPv4 is supported because EC2 doesn't support IPv6, even tunnels are broken. The author also hasn't set up tor yet but can do both if there is demand.</summary>
