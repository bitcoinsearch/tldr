    <summary>The author of this email suggests that on testnet, people should be given the opportunity to test how their code handles attempts to spend the genesis block coinbase and other transactions made to the genesis block address. The reason being, there is a possibility that Satoshi still has the key and could cause such a situation himself. The author requests Gavin, who may have the private key for testnet3's coinbase, to release it or fix the issue for the eventual testnet4. While the case can be tested on a private testnet, it would be beneficial if people were forced to test it against their will.</summary>
