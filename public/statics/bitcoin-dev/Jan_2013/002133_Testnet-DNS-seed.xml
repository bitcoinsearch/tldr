    <summary>The author has set up a testnet DNS seed using Pieter Wuille's bitcoin-seeder, with some modifications for testnet on a dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance. Currently, only IPv4 is supported because EC2 doesn't support IPv6, even tunnels are broken. The author also hasn't set up tor yet but can do both if there is demand. The next step is to create a new strTestNetDNSSeed in the Satoshi client, but it would be better if at least one more person had a testnet seed to include in the list. It is recommended to leave IRC enabled too. Additionally, the author mentions that the pnSeed list is outdated. The author asks Pieter if he has written any start/stop/monitoring scripts for the seeder and shares their modifications at git://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin-seeder.git in the "testnet" branch, intending to send a pull request once it's had some testing.</summary>
