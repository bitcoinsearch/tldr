    <summary>Peter Todd, in an email conversation with Jeff Garzik, informed that everything is running on a dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance. Currently, only IPv4 is supported as EC2 doesn't support IPv6. Todd further added that he can set up both IPv6 and Tor if there is demand for it. Jeff Garzik suggested creating a new strTestNetDNSSeed in the satoshi client, but he also mentioned it would be better to have at least one more person contributing a testnet seed to the list. IRC should remain enabled too, according to Garzik. Todd noted that the pnSeed list is way out of date, which usually gets updated when nanotube is poked. They discussed transforming Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[], which might be a nice alternative. It is unknown how long Todd plans to run this, but he presumes it will continue indefinitely if there is interest and users.</summary>
