    <summary>In an email conversation on January 27th, 2013, Peter Todd discussed the contents of seed.txt, which is a dumpfile produced by bitcoin-seeder. The file contains information about all non-banned IP addresses that have successfully connected to bitcoin. There is uptime data available, but it only covers up to one month. The connectability percentage is a decaying average with a time constant of up to a month.Peter Todd mentions that he has a script prepared that combines data from one or more seeds.txt files into a pnSeed[] array C source code. He plans to add this script to the repository.</summary>
