    <summary>In a discussion about testnet3 genesis block, Gavin Andresen stated that it is identical to the main network genesis block, except for a different timestamp and nonce. The coinbase of the testnet3 pays to the same public key as the main network, but he doesn't have the private key for it. He suggested it would be a good idea to implement this change for testnet4 in the future.</summary>
