    <summary>Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd are discussing the running of a dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance. IPv4 is currently supported but not IPv6, even tunnels are broken. Todd states he can set up tor if there is demand. Garzik asks how long Todd plans to run it for and Todd replies indefinitely as it's cheap at around $7.5/month. Todd also offers to give others a machine image copy easily too. They then discuss the outdated pnSeed list which nanotube usually updates. Todd suggests a simple script to transform Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[] although these should be filtered with SORB's dynamic ip list or similar and given an expiry time.</summary>
