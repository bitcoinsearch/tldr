    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik, Todd suggests that on the testnet, people should be given the opportunity to test their code's ability to handle attempts to spend the genesis block coinbase and other transactions made to the genesis block address. He reasons that since Satoshi may still have the key to the genesis block, he could potentially cause such a situation himself. Garzik acknowledges Todd's suggestion.</summary>
