    <title>Draft BIP for Bloom filtering</title>

    <summary>The update provided mentions that Matt has done excellent work, and testing has been done on bitcoinj and bitcoin-qt, with a few minor tweaks needed. The remaining work includes some bug fixes on the bitcoinj side, adjusting the default FP rate requested by BCJ to be 0.0001, and introducing a new part to the filter protocol that allows clients to control auto-expansion. Auto-expansion is volatile and can lead to unpredictable false positives per block, so it needs to be controlled. With auto-expansion disabled, the FP rate adjusted, and a bug fix on the bcj side, syncing a wallet using a bloom filtered chain was successful.It is mentioned that this work should go into 0.8, and it will be more compelling to advertise it this way. In case of any showstopper problems, the code using the new messages won't be deployed into clients. Overall, it seems like progress is being made, and the team is working towards improving network performance.</summary>
