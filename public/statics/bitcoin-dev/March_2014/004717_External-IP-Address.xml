    <summary>In an email conversation, Sam suggests looking for X-Client-Update to check if the check-in was logged. He also mentions that errors are trapped, and the IP address is always displayed in the headers. However, Wladimir replies thanking Sam for his effort but stating the current idea is to phase out centralized external services in favor of peer-based address detection. Wladimir provides a link to a Github page for Bitcoin where this information can be found.</summary>
