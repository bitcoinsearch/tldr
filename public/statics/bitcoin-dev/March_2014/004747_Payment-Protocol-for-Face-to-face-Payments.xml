    <summary>The practical byte limit of a QR code depends on the physical size of the code. If the display screen is large and security permits, larger QR codes can afford more bytes. However, if the display screen is small, like a postage stamp, the practical byte limit is low. Testing QR codes in real-world conditions before picking the best path is ideal. The discussion highlighted that BIP73 needs an external server, and internet connectivity is not a rarity these days, so near-field web servers also work fine. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin Core developer and open source evangelist, made these comments during a discussion about the practical limit on QR code size.</summary>
