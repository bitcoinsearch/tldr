    <summary>Electrum 1.9.8 has been released and includes features initially planned for version 2.0. The Electrum servers were upgraded to version 0.9, which stores a Patricia tree of all UTXOs, allowing the client to request the balance of any address directly. New commands have been added including getaddressbalance, getaddressunspent, and getutxoaddress. Two commands for message encryption have also been added - encrypt and decrypt - using ECIES encryption algorithm. The key can be obtained using the 'getpubkeys' command. The Qt GUI also has access to these functions. Additionally, command-line commands that require a connection to the network spawn a daemon, making scripting more efficient by opening only one connection. Packages for download are available on https://electrum.org/download.html and binaries for windows and mac will be available in the coming days.</summary>
