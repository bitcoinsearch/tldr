    <summary>In a conversation between Justus Ranvier and Gregory Maxwell, the latter suggested using "dust-b-gone" to relay dust in transactions. However, Ranvier argued that this solution was sub-optimal as it introduces a third party, leaving room for server downtime. Instead, he proposed starting the server oneself, emphasizing the efficiency of aggregating multiple bits of dust in single transactions. While it is possible to OP_RETURN to include dust, miners are unlikely to prioritize these transactions over those with higher fees per byte.</summary>
