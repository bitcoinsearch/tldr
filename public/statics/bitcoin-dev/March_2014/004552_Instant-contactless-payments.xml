    <summary>In an email exchange from March 6, 2014, Mike Hearn and an anonymous individual discussed the idea of implementing a feedback system for Bitcoin payments. The proposed system would allow users to provide feedback on a payment using an ECDSA signature from one of the addresses involved in the payment, signing an identifier of the payment and a feedback score. However, as Hearn pointed out, this could be complicated because it raises questions about what constitutes a "Bitcoin user" and what would stop someone from paying themselves to accrue positive reputation. The anonymous individual acknowledged these concerns and suggested that the feedback system would need to include some way to rate those giving the feedback. Additionally, the system would need to take into account the possibility of a ring-of-trust, where one person's negative opinion of a user could outweigh another person's positive opinion. Ultimately, the decision to give individuals control and responsibility over their own good/bad user lists would depend on whether it was seen as a good or bad thing.</summary>
