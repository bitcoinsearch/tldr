    <summary>The author of the message shared that they are working on a multisig system, with early drafts available on Github. The system uses BIP-0032 HD wallets and will soon have BIP-0039 support for key compatibility. Public keys are currently sorted in scripts to avoid ambiguity. The haskoin-wallet can be downloaded using 'cabal install haskoin-wallet' command and the 'hw' command can be checked out to use importtx to bring transactions into the wallet. The wallet supports both regular and multisig accounts. The author hopes to work on a proper standard for compatible implementations. They also shared a link to a document explaining how they do it now and signed off with "Be Happy :)"</summary>
