    <summary>The context discusses the current state of HD in Bitcoin and how it is being overhyped without any code to back it up. The author argues that until major user wallets and bitcoind have basic HD support, it is premature to build anything on top of HD. The Waiting For Godot situation is also mentioned, including an example with Bitcoin Wallet failing to rotate addresses due to this issue. A stalled attempt to add a simple, stateless RPC is attributed to the same problem. The author concludes that we have no clue at this juncture how difficult the HD rollout will be.</summary>
