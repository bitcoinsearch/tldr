    <summary>The MultiBit HD view is that the issue of Bitcoin units presentation is locale-sensitive. To address this issue, the configuration panel has been designed giving multiple options to users such as icon, m+icon, μ+icon, BTC, mBTC, μBTC, XBT, mXBT, μXBT, sat along with settings for leading/trailing symbol, commas, spaces, and points. The NIST guidelines are followed while representing SI unit symbols. Currently, MultiBit HD is configured to use m+icon taken from the Font Awesome icon set; however, it seems that μ+icon is more sensible according to earlier posts. Jeff Garzik raised a concern about Bitcoin wallet moving to mBTC, which was disappointing as the consensus was uBTC. He suggested going straight to uBTC because humans and existing computer systems handle numbers to the left of the decimals just fine.</summary>
