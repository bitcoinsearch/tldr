    <summary>A hardware wallet is being developed to address the security of transmission of person-to-person pay-to addresses. The hardware wallet uses a decentralized ledger of "device keys" that are not related to Bitcoin keys but can be used to provide advanced knowledge of a public key for encrypting messages without a third-party CA or prior dialogue. The distributed ledger of device keys is referred to as the "Web-of-trust re-imagined." Some users on Bitcointalk want their vanity addresses to be easily found and verified by others through a web-of-trust system. Currently, users sign their own addresses and quote them in forums, which is not secure. The use case for vanity addresses is not currently being addressed. Onename.io is a web-based client that can be used to register profiles with Namecoin blockchain.</summary>
