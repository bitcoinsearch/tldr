    <summary>In an email conversation, Tamas Blummer suggested using a hash of the words "Bitcoin", "Litecoin", "Dogecoin" instead of a directory of magic numbers. Pavol Rusnak pointed out that this method would still result in collisions and therefore require a directory. Additionally, even if there were no collisions, a registry of names would still need to be kept up due to inconsistencies such as "Peercoin" vs "PPCoin" or "Testnet" vs "TestNet".</summary>
