    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, the former stated that wallets cannot assume that remote parties have an HD wallet for a long time, as interoperability common sense implies that the environment will be heterogeneous. Andresen replied that if the remote party is involved in a multisig and speaks the "Let's set up a multisig wallet together/Let's spend from a multisig" protocols, then it should be reasonable to assume they're HD-capable. However, remote parties paying into or receiving funds from a multisig don't have to support it, which is what P2SH provides.</summary>
