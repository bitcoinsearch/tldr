    <summary>On March 2014, Odinn Cyberguerrilla voiced his disagreement with the proposal of use cases for W3C payments workshop, citing a requirement to accept an agreement on the Web Payments community site in order to join teleconferences and collaborate with others in the web payments group. He claimed that such requirements inhibit innovation and free thought. In response, someone pointed out that all specs created by the W3C are committed to be royalty-free, hence the need for the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) which guarantees all contributions will never be encumbered by patents or charged royalties for. A separate message from Brent Shambaugh requested Bitcoiners to contribute use cases for the W3C payments workshop. He provided a link to an editable wiki page where members of the Web Payments Community Group can submit pull requests, and a template that includes key use cases for the solution and regions and currencies. The message also contained a promotional link to download a free O'Reilly book about graph databases.</summary>
