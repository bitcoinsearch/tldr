    <summary>It seems that Drak is suggesting that the fork has been under more development and upstream has stalled. This causes a problem because it becomes unclear which repository is the main one. As a result, development forks properly, which is a shame because it doesn't nurture community contributions around the project. On March 15th, 2014, Peter Todd responded to Drak's suggestion by saying that people actually using his 'pythonize' code have been linking directly to his tree in things like documentation and build scripts, so the URL is probably not a problem. He also opened a pull-req on the bitcoin.org repo to change the URL. Peter Todd can be contacted at 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</summary>
