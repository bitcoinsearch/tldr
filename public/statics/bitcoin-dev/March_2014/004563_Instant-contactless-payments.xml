    <summary>According to a tech expert, messages transmitted via NFC should not exceed 1 KB for snappy experience. This leads to questions regarding the usage of bulky X.509 certificates in payment request messages. The Bitcoin Wallet does not sign payment requests, so it cannot be tried how it would feel. However, it is suggested that a signed PaymentRequest could be put into an NFC tag and read from it. The use of common X.509 certs are bigger than they need to be due to the use of RSA rather than ECC. An RSA signature alone can be 256 bytes, which makes it bulkier. SSL may migrate to mostly ECC (secp256r1) based certs over time.</summary>
