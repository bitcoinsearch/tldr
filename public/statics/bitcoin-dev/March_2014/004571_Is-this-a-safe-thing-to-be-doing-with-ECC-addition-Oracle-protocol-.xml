    <summary>In a thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, participants discussed the issue of ensuring public key integrity. One suggestion was for parties to insist on seeing a hash of the other party's public key before sharing their own. This would prevent the selection of a public key based on the one presented by the other party. The use of multisig was also proposed as an alternative solution. In response to a scenario where a private key could be abused, the recommendation was made to exchange public keys before being allowed to combine them. Edmund Edgar, founder of Social Minds Inc, participated in the discussion and shared information about his company and Reality Keys, a service they offer. Finally, there was a brief advertisement for Perforce, a version control system.</summary>
