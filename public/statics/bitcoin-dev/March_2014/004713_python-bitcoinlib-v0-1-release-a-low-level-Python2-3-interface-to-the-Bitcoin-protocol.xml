    <summary>In a discussion about adding Peter to a GitHub repository, Drak suggests pulling in some code and giving Peter commit access to the repo. The author notes that people have been linking directly to their 'pythonize' code in documentation and build scripts, so the URL is probably not an issue. However, they did open a pull request on the bitcoin.org repo to change the URL. A digital signature is included in the email.</summary>
