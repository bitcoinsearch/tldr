    <summary>Some users on bitcointalk are interested in having their vanity addresses easily accessible for others to find and verify ownership. However, the current method of signing their own addresses and posting them on forums is not secure. The idea of using PGP keyservers was considered but would only work for single vanity addresses. A potential solution could be utilizing webfinger where servers of a business can prove ownership of a specific address. It is unclear if this use case is currently being addressed in any plans. Links to relevant discussions on bitcointalk are provided for further reading.</summary>
