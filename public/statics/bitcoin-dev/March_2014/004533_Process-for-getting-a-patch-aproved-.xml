    <summary>In this conversation, Kevin asks for guidance on submitting a patch. Wladimir suggests using GitHub instead of sending patches through the mailing list as reviewing can take some time and patches sent to mailing lists may get lost. He explains that the GitHub model is better for this project as there will be an 'issue' appearing until it is either merged or closed otherwise, ensuring that it doesn't get overlooked. However, if the proposed change concerns a protocol change, it is advisable to discuss it on the mailing list as people building other implementations read there and not on GitHub.</summary>
