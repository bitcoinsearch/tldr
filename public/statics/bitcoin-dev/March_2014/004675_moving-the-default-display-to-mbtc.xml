    <summary>In an email thread from March 2014, Tamas Blummer brought up the idea of using internal accounting in satoshis and displaying it based on locale. This idea had been previously raised in March 2013 and had received the most votes on a bitcointalk forum. However, it seemed that the idea was ignored and the "ship left" without addressing the arguments. The email also included a signature from Tamas Blummer, who is the founder and CEO of Bits of Proof, a company that provides blockchain software solutions. The email thread was part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge. The context suggests that the problem regarding internal accounting in satoshis and display based on locale was solved, though no further details were given about how or when the issue was addressed.</summary>
