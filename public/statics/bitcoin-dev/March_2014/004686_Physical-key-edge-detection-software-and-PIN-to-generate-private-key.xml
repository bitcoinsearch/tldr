    <summary>The proposed method for generating a Bitcoin private key involves using a physical key, edge detection software and a PIN. The shape of the physical key is converted into an equation using image recognition software that applies edge detection to the incoming video feed. The hash of this equation and a user-generated five-digit PIN can then be used to create a Bitcoin private key. This idea was submitted as part of the standard track for BIP XX by Jack Scott on March 13, 2014. It remains an idea and has not been implemented yet.</summary>
