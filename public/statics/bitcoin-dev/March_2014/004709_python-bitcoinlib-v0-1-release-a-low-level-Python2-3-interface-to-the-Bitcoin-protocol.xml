    <summary>Peter Todd, a software developer, noticed that the ngccbase Colored Coin client added a python-bitcoinlib dependency, specifically his fork. He also mentioned that there is now a rudimentary python-bitcoinlib package in Arch Linux. Todd's fork is based on Jeff Garzik's implementation, and the bulk of the code structure is his work, modulo "pythonizing" that he has done. Todd provided a GitHub link to Garzik's implementation for those who are interested in its history.</summary>
