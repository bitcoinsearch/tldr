    <summary>A suggestion was made by Mike Hearn to BitPay that they should use mBTC instead of uBTC. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, responded that using mBTC could cause problems for accounting packages that are hard-limited to two decimal places. Additionally, popular software systems assume more than two decimal places violates the Principle Of Least Astonishment. Garzik emphasized the importance of community coordination in making decisions like this, rather than random apps making decisions without considering the broader implications.</summary>
