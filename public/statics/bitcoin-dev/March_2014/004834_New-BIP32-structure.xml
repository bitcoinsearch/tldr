    <summary>In a conversation dated March 26, 2014, Mike Hearn asked about the purpose of the "reserved" feature in Bitcoin. He couldn't recall why it was implemented and asked if it had been intended to split out multisig outputs from cointype. Another participant in the conversation confirmed that this was indeed the case. The "reserved" feature was meant to enable multisig addresses to be created from the same seed, while cointype was proposed afterwards.</summary>
