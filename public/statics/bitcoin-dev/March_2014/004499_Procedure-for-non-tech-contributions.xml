    <summary>Peter Todd proof-read rc1 and submitted his changes via pull-req to the Github repository. Drak suggested using Github's direct file editing feature to make updates to pull requests without technical knowledge, but it was not possible in this case as the file was not available at the repository. Peter also raised concerns about sending payments to a Mt. Gox-held wallet to edit the bitcoin wiki, which he believed was a hard blocker for new contributors. He mentioned that he registered for the wiki but never received the confirmation email, suggesting that the whole process may be broken.</summary>
