    <summary>The email exchange between Drak and Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, discusses the complexity of setting up a multisig payment protocol. Currently, wallet software struggles with multisig, making it difficult for users to exchange public keys, track balances, and build P2SH addresses from public keys reliably. Additionally, malicious parties can set up fake multisig addresses and run off with funds if inexperienced users fall victim to their scams. In response, Drak suggests creating a BIP to help future implementations of multisig wallets become more user-friendly and secure. Jeff Garzik acknowledges the problems with multisig and agrees that a BIP could go a long way in aiding usability.</summary>
