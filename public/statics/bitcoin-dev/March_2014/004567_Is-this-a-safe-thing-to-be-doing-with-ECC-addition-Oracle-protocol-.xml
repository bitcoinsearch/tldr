    <summary>In an email sent on March 4th, 2014, Odinn Cyberguerrilla stated that "nothing is safe." Edmund Edgar then posed a question regarding the safety of a transaction involving ECC public keys. He asked if anyone could think of a way for Odinn to spend money resulting from add_pubkeys() without having the necessary key and if they would be alarmed to see people running software capable of doing this. Edgar is the founder of Social Minds Inc. and Reality Keys.</summary>
