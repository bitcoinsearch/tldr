    <title>New BIP32 structure</title>

    <summary>A user noticed that greenaddress.it is creating seeds with 24 words instead of the usual 12, and wanted to know if they were using the default structure for BIP32 wallets. However, it seems that bitcoinj is not compatible with their structure. In a discussion about lightweight or server-based wallets like Electrum or myTREZOR, it was suggested that instead of using a "gap limit" for unused addresses, the number of unused addresses since the beginning of the sequence should be counted. This would make things more predictable for the user and eliminate confusion about the "gap limit."</summary>
