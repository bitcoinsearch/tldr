    <summary>Tamas Blummer suggested that it would be helpful to include the number of shares needed and a few bytes fingerprint of the secret into individual shares on the user interface. Matt Whitlock expanded the BIP so that it additionally applies to BIP32 master seeds of sizes 128, 256, and 512 bits. The most significant change versus the previous version is how the coefficients of the polynomials are constructed. Previously they were SHA-256 digests. Now they are SHA-512 digests, modulo a prime number that is selected depending on the size of the secret. Tamas Blummer questioned how others weight security vs. usability in these questions. However, Matt Whitlock pointed out that intentionally omitting the information about the number of shares needed is a security risk. If an adversary gains control of one share and can see exactly how many more shares he needs, he may be able to plan a better attack.</summary>
