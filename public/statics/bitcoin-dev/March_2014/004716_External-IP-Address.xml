    <summary>The author of the message stumbled upon a function called GetMyExternalIP() in net.cpp for a small project and noticed that the current method used for it needed to be phased out. They then created a site called ip.bitcheck.us which captures the IP, user agent, and time for analysis and sends that information when clients visit the site. The site does a quick search for "Mozilla" in the user agent to redirect browsers that go there. The information sent includes GET / HTTP/1.1, Host: ip.bitcheck.us, User-Agent: /Satoshi:0.8.6/, Connection: close, while the received data is HTTP/1.1 200 OK, Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2014 05:31:51 GMT, Server: Apache mod_fcgid/2.3.10-dev, X-Powered-By: Satoshi v1.0, X-Client-Update: yes, Content-Length: 9, Connection: close, Content-Type: text/html, and 127.0.0.1. The author explains that errors are trapped so that the IP address will always display, and any error information is contained in the headers.</summary>
