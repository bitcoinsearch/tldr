    <summary>In an email dated March 28, 2014, Mike Hearn discusses the benefits of creating a clean protocol for repeated payments in both directions. He argues that having a "refund" field in the protocol would allow for more intelligent wallet UI and make producing good UIs easier. Additionally, he suggests that using tags like "refund" or "VAT" in the payment could be displayed by the UI to provide users with a better understanding of their transactions.</summary>
