    <summary>In this email conversation between Andreas Schildbach and Alex Kotenko, they discuss the possibility of inventing a URI for Bluetooth. They agree that BT MAC should be considered as the server address, and payment request ID can be considered as the request path. While HTTP is well known and proven to be quite good for tasks like this, it might be an overkill in this case. They also discuss the compatibility of QR codes with Base43 and calculate the efficiency in terms of PR data size vs. amount space used in a QR code. Finally, they agree to skip this discussion and go with the Bluetooth URI scheme they have agreed upon.</summary>
