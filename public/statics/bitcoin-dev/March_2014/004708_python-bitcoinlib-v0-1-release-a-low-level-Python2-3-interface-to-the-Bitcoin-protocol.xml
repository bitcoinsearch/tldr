    <summary>The developer, Peter Todd, has released a new version (v0.1) of his python-bitcoinlib library on Github. The library provides easy access to Bitcoin's data structures and protocol in a Pythonic way. It includes support for all data-structures related to transactions, scripting, addresses, and keys, which is quite usable; although some p2p network-related code is missing. Also, the API will probably not change that much. The release is signed by Peter Todd's PGP key, as well as every publicly pushed commit.</summary>
