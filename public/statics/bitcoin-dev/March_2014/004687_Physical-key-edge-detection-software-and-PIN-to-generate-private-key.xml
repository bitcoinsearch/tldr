    <summary>In an email exchange, Jack Scott proposed a new method to generate a Bitcoin private key using a physical key, image recognition software, and a PIN. The idea is to convert the shape of a physical key into an equation that describes it by applying edge detection software to an incoming video feed. However, Wladimir pointed out some practical nits. Physical keys are vulnerable to photography-based reproduction attacks and computer vision algorithms' output is notoriously noisy. If used as input for hashing a private key, it may become hard/impossible to reproduce. Also, physical objects may deform over time.</summary>
