    <summary>The context is a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the implementation of BIP70, a proposal for a payment protocol that aims to improve Bitcoin transactions. In particular, Alex Kotenko raises concerns about the use of external servers in BIP73, which is required for implementing BIP70. He explains that he needs to maintain backwards compatibility with wallets that do not support NFC and BIP70 while avoiding the use of external servers. Kotenko suggests extending BIP72 to include encoded payment requests in URLs directly in a backwards-compatible way instead of using base43 encoding, which is non-compatible with BIP21. He questions whether the increased complexity of base43 encoding is worth the gains in total byte capacity when compared to base64 encoded requests in binary QR code format. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, responds to the discussion and provides links to additional resources for learning about graph databases and network behavioral analysis &amp; security monitoring.</summary>
