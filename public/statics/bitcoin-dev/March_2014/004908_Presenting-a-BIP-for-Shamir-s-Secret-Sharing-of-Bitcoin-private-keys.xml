    <summary>In an email exchange between Matt Whitlock and Jeff Garzik on March 29, 2014, the former argued that a 6-of-9 multisig system would not work for a board of seven directors with a majority threshold of four, as any six board members could sign a transaction without the consent of the president or CFO. However, Garzik disagreed with Whitlock's assertion and brought up bitcoin's script language as a solution. By adding conditionals to the script, such as OP_IF, boolean logic can be used to create a more flexible system than a single CHECKMULTISIG would allow. Garzik is a bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist currently working at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
