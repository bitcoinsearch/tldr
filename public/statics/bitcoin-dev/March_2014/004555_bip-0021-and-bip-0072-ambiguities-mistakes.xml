    <summary>The writer wants to create a parser for bip-0021 URIs with the new bip-0072 payment parameters, aiming for complete accuracy. The writer highlights that the internet RFC 3986 governs the general syntax for URIs and suggests that any bitcoin URI scheme should use it instead of the earlier RFCs. However, bip-0021 never mentions RFC 3986, while bip-0072 explicitly refers to RFC 1738, which is obsolete. The old standard requires more escapes than necessary, so updating bip-0072 to refer to RFC 3986 would allow shorter and more readable bitcoin URIs. The second issue is that neither bip describes what to do with international characters. The writer thinks that character encoding needs to be defined, and RFC recommends that all new URI schemes use UTF-8 as their encoding. Therefore, it should be added into bip-0021.Lastly, the writer notes an error in the bip-0021 BNF grammar, which never mentions the '&amp;' separator between query elements. The writer seeks clarification on the procedure for correcting these issues, suggesting submitting a pull request with the changes. Additionally, the bitcoin-qt client already uses QUrl to parse bitcoin URIs, based on RFC 3986, indicating that it may have already implemented these suggestions.</summary>
