    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0rc2 is a release candidate for a new major version that brings both new features and bug fixes. The binaries are available for download from the Bitcoin website. Users are encouraged to test it and report bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub. If no serious bugs are found, this release candidate will become the final 0.9.0 release.This version includes several changes such as renaming the reference client to Bitcoin Core to reduce confusion between Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software, and switching to an autotools-based build system instead of individual (q)makefiles. The Windows 64-bit version of the client has been introduced in this release due to frequent reports of users running out of virtual memory on 32-bit systems during the initial sync. However, release candidate 2 windows binaries are not code-signed, so users are advised to use PGP and SHA256SUMS.asc file to verify their binaries. The minimum requirements for Macs have also changed - a 64-bit-capable CPU running OSX 10.6 or later is now required, dropping support for older Macs.This release contains some fixes for transaction id malleability issues and drops the default fee required to relay transactions across the network to 0.01mBTC per kilobyte. Additionally, the relay fee may be changed with the -minrelaytxfee command-line option, and miners may change the default minimum fee they accept with the -mintxfee command-line option.There have also been several changes to RPC, command line options, block-chain handling and storage, GUI, mining, protocol and network, validation, and miscellaneous improvements. The latest bitcoin release includes a number of new features and enhancements. Among the most notable changes are the addition of a '-regtest' mode, which is similar to testnet but private with instant block generation using the 'setgenerate' RPC. Additionally, a new script called 'linearize.py' has been added to contrib, which creates a bootstrap.dat file. Finally, a separate bitcoin-cli client has also been introduced.A long list of contributors was acknowledged for their contributions to this release.</summary>
