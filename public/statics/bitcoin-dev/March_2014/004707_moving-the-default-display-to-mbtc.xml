    <summary>The conversation is centered on the topic of default display only regarding the mBTC / uBTC questions. Bitcoin Wallet has already moved to mBTC, which was disappointing since the consensus was initially with uBTC. There is a suggestion to move directly to uBTC because humans and existing computer systems handle numbers to the left of the decimals just fine. The discussion also touched upon displaying other concepts such as other currencies and microdonations. It is suggested that another issue be opened or a process BIP be addressed to tackle this matter. However, it seems that the scope of the thread may not cover this topic.</summary>
