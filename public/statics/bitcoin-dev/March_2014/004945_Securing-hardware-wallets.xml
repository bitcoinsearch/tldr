    <summary>The author of this context is seeking feedback on their whitepaper which outlines a method for securing hardware wallets from compromise by using a "Warden" computer. The paper addresses the issue of hardware wallets being a tempting target for attackers due to wide adoption, and the potential for malware to be inserted into the hardware or software, or for the random seed to be generated in a predictable way. The proposed solution involves using a separate computer to manage the wallet and protect private keys from compromise. The author suggests that the paper has the potential to be turned into a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The full text of the paper can be found on GitHub.</summary>
