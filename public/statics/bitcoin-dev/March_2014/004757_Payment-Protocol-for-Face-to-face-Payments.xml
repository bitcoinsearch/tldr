    <summary>In a 2014 email conversation about QR codes and payment requests, Mike Hearn discussed the overlap between PKI signing in BIP70 and the concept of serving unsigned payment requests with confidentiality and authenticity for local face-to-face transactions. However, Roy Badami argued that in many cases, the PKI in BIP70 wasn't helpful for face-to-face transactions at bricks-and-mortar establishments where the legal name of the entity running the establishment or any electronic identifier might not be known. He suggested that in such situations, it was essential to have assurance that the payment was going to the person/organization operating the machine behind the counter. Roy stated that he would miss the simplicity of BIP21 QR codes for face-to-face transactions because the payment protocol complicated and weakened the assurance that one is paying the entity that prepared the QR code. At the end of the email, there was an advertisement for a free O'Reilly book on graph databases.</summary>
