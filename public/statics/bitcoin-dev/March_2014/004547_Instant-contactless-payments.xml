    <summary>In this context, Alex Kotenko is discussing the potential value of Bitcoin v0.9 and its transaction fees. They believe that with this update, transaction fees will become floating and eventually reach equilibrium that reflects real-world value, albeit a tiny and stable one. However, the fees may also fluctuate depending on system load. The conversation then turns to the idea of a stable currency, which would slowly become worth more over time in line with economic growth. To maintain stable prices, a fake currency backed by a basket of goods may be necessary.</summary>
