    <summary>In an email conversation from March 28, 2014, Mike Hearn suggests fixing a warranty issue in the spec by defining a fixed expiry time. He proposes using 2.5 years (30 months), which would allow for shipping time. The question is then raised whether there is enough RAM for this timeframe. Additionally, the conversation notes that warranties usually result in defective goods being replaced rather than refunded. In Germany, the next smaller unit of time is two weeks under the Fernabsatzgesetz, which allows for mail-orders to be returned for a refund. It is unclear if this law applies to other countries or if it has been adopted into EU law.</summary>
