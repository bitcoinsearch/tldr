    <summary>The suggested way to improve payment requests is to finish and standardize the Bluetooth support, as encoding entire payment requests into QR codes can make them large. The proposed method includes adding an encryption/authentication layer on top of the Bluetooth support because it runs over RFCOMM sockets. The authentication involves proof of owning the Bitcoin key that's in the address part of the URI for backward compatibility. Two options for the authentication layer are SSL, or rolling a custom lightweight thing where a basic ECDH is done with the server's key being the same as the address key. Rolling such protocols could be subtle, so it would need to be reviewed by people familiar with such things. This presents an excellent opportunity to grow the community, and perhaps a volunteer in the forums who enjoys crypto can help. Andreas' app already has some support for this, and Alex can prototype with that. A BIP needs to be written and made sure it's interoperable.</summary>
