    <summary>In this email thread, Mike Hearn pointed out that partially signed and multisig transactions within bitcoind go through the raw transaction API, which does not do anything if the signature pushes the transaction to a higher fee level. Peter Todd responded by suggesting that it should be documented that the raw transaction API and Bitcoin Core wallet should not be used to hold customer funds. He also warned that SPV is not secure enough for businesses unless they run their own full node. The raw transaction API has no support to handle fees at all. It is important to note that users should use Bitcoinj or something else instead of the raw transaction API.</summary>
