    <summary>BitPay is developing a new standard for authentication based on bitcoin-like addresses as they believe that X.509, the current standard, should be abandoned. They hope to work with the community to establish a complete, decentralized authentication protocol. To support this sentiment, two articles have been written; one examines commonly proposed alternative ideas to X.509 such as web of trust and perspectives/convergence, while the other is a summary of well-known crypto-usability research papers published over the past 10-15 years, covering SSL and PGP. Additionally, a book called Security &amp; Usability by O'Reilly contains 34 papers and essays on the topic.</summary>
