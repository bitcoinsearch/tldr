    <summary>In an email, Troy Benjegerdes expressed interest in selling corn for Bitcoin and proposed a blockchain-based system that allows him to audit the code executing the trade. He shared his previous proposals for such a system within the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, he also stated that Bitcoin is a centralized system and suggested that those who want decentralization should go with altchains. In response, another person argued that Bitcoin is not a centralized system, and bringing up altchains was a red herring. The conversation ended with a plea to keep the discussion on-topic to avoid becoming a moderated mailing list.</summary>
