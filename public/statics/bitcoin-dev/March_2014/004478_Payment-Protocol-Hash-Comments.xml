    <summary>PHP does support sha2, contrary to the claim that it cannot do SHA-2. This is evidenced by the resources available on the php.net website, including the mhash.constants page and the hash-algos function page. A discussion thread from 2014 on the Bitcoin-development mailing list also touched on the use of SHA-1 versus SHA-2 in the context of BIP70, with some participants questioning the inclusion of SHA-1 due to its retirement. The thread also raised questions about whether end-users should be able to see details like the pki_type and certificate chain, similar to how browsers display such information.</summary>
