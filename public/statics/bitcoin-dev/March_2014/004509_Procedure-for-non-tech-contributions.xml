    <summary>Tom Geller, a writer and presenter from Oberlin, Ohio, made edits to the release notes of 0.9.0rc2 on March 3, 2014. He posted a pull request at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3787 and welcomed corrections as needed. However, the edits failed testing. In his email, Tom mentioned that he assumes he'll get emails as others add comments. He also requested anyone willing to help him privately contact him. Tom's work includes articles, marketing, videos, user guides, and books.</summary>
