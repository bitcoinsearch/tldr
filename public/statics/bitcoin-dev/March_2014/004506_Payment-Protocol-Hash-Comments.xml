    <summary>In an email exchange on March 2, 2014, Mike Hearn discusses the rationale for adding SHA-2 to the spec with Gavin the previous year. Although it may have only applied to certain versions of PHP, SHA-2 has been available in standard PHP since version 5.1.2 as part of the hash() function. The majority of PHP installations are version 5.2 and above according to usage stats. As such, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, Drak suggests removing SHA-1 from the specification.</summary>
