    <summary>In March 2014, there was a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about the concept that money should have low, single digits for everyday prices. Mark Friedenbach argued that this idea is not only Western-centric but also English-centric. He suggested using uBTC instead to align with the existing kBTC/BTC/mBTC/uBTC conventions. However, accounting software practices have limitations when handling SI notation and sub-unit prefixes. Friedenbach recommended relabeling uBTC to a new three-digit symbol with a proper 3 letter code.The topic sparked various opinions from participants, including Andreas Schildbach, who believed that users care more about the amount in local currency than the Bitcoin price. Jeff Garzik suggested going straight to uBTC since humans and existing computer systems handle numbers to the left of the decimals just fine.On another note, a free guidebook on graph databases called "Graph Databases" is now available for download. It is the first edition and provides an in-depth understanding of graph databases and their applications. The book was written by three acclaimed leaders in the field and can be downloaded from http://p.sf.net/sfu/13534_NeoTech.Lastly, the Bitcoin-development mailing list welcomes interested parties to join them.
