    <summary>The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Payments Workshop has recently come under scrutiny due to the CLAs (Contributor License Agreements) required for participation. One individual, who was initially interested in joining the Web Payments conference calls, declined once they reviewed the requirements expected of them. The agreement stated that in order to join the teleconference and collaborate with others in the web payments group, participants must agree to the Web Payments community. However, this includes agreements that inhibit innovation and free thought, such as "agreeing to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements" and numerous other requirements. The individual believes that collaborative efforts should not be subject to such requirements that restrict innovation and free thought. As a result, they will not be participating in web or telephone conferences with the W3C / Web Payments folks until these burdensome requirements are removed.Meanwhile, Brent Shambaugh has been working on some use cases for the W3C payments workshop, which he would like to include Bitcoin in. He is using a template asking for the name of the solution, key use cases, and regions and currencies. Additionally, the use cases must consider adding real money to the service, buying a physical good in the real world, paying for physical services, converting virtual money back into paper money, transferring money from one person to another (even if the second person is not signed up for the service), buying products online, resolving disputes, viewing transactions, and securing the wallet. The use cases can be edited on https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/wiki/WebPaymentsMobileUseCases and submitted as a pull request to https://github.com/w3c-webmob/payments-use-cases.</summary>
