    <summary>The discussion revolves around the internet connectivity issues in Germany and London. Bitcoin transactions require internet connectivity as the receiver cannot verify double-spending or anything else about the transaction. BIP73 requires an external server, which means near-field web servers also work fine for internet connectivity. However, it is still a problem in many places like old buildings with thick walls, basement pubs, and overcrowded places with overloaded radio environments. Thus, mobile connectivity should not be relied on for making payments. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, and open-source evangelist concludes the discussion.</summary>
