    <summary>The speaker suggests that a clean protocol for repeated payments in both directions can be created, where "refund" and "payment" are not special compared to other charges. They argue that this would not require more effort than an auto-remembered call-in phone number, and users could delete the information if they did not care. However, the speaker also notes that the purpose of the refund field is to enable intelligent wallet UIs to display refunded payments in a way that users will understand. Without this feature, producing good UIs becomes more difficult.</summary>
