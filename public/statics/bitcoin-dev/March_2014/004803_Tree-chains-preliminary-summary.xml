    <summary>In a recent conversation with an executive at a Bitcoin company, it was revealed that their developers were subscribed to the development list but refused to post due to their fear of being shot down by Peter Todd. The executive explicitly named Todd as the source of the problem, stating that his immediate knee-jerk reaction to anyone who disagrees with him is making the forum aggressive and ugly. The aggressive atmosphere puts other people off from contributing. The executive also noted that Todd's insights are often deeply suspect, and a friendly atmosphere is valued more than his contributions. Ground up redesigns of Bitcoin like what Todd proposes are more appropriate for bitcointalk.</summary>
