    <summary>In some locations, lack of internet connectivity is an issue for customers trying to conduct bitcoin transactions. However, this does not necessarily mean that these locations are completely unsuitable for such transactions. While some customers may lack internet access, others may have private wifi or hardwired connections that work. Mobile networks also vary, meaning that some customers may have mobile connectivity while others do not. Despite these challenges, it is still possible for bitcoin transactions to occur in these areas as long as there are reliable means of verifying double-spending and other transaction details.</summary>
