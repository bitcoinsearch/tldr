    <summary>In this email conversation, Wladimir and the recipient discuss the possibility of a future BIP standard. They point out that unsigned payment requests do not have an "origin" or referrer, making it difficult to differentiate them. If the request has a certificate, the CN becomes the "Pay To" string displayed for the merchant. However, without a certificate, the best way to differentiate signed requests is by prominently displaying the Merchant string. The green part of the display should only show the "Pay To" line, with the rest as content. A blank "Pay To" line would make the lack of a certificate apparent.</summary>
