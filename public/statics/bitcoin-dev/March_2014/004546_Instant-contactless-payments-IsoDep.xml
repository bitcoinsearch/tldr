    <summary>The email thread is discussing the possibility of using IsoDep protocol to trigger an app via a NDEF tag. The concern is that the connection may break when the phone is picked up, so fallback options such as HTTPS or Bluetooth may be needed. One suggestion is to dispatch different IsoDep applications to different apps, but there is currently no mime type or similar concept to avoid conflicts between apps fighting for access to IsoDep endpoints. The email ends with an advertisement for Perforce, a tool that claims to offer hassle-free workflows and faster operations for version control.</summary>
