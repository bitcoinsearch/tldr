    <summary>In this context, the speaker is discussing the use of tags in a contact list to identify certain types of payments. They suggest that if a payment comes with a specific tag, such as "refund" or "VAT", the user interface could display that information. The speaker then goes on to explain that in the case of a blockchain-based payment system, the address serves as the tag and it is not possible to add additional data. They clarify that this means that the UI would display whether the payment was a refund, but they do not see the relevance of VAT in this context.</summary>
