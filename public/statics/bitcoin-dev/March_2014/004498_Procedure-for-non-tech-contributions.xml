    <summary>On March 2, 2014, Peter Todd suggested using the pull request method to encourage proofreading of a text file with corrections applied. He submitted his changes via pull-req on Github and mentioned that no fancy software was required for diffing changes. However, Drak pointed out that editing files directly on the site is possible as Github allows it. It also automatically creates a fork and topic branch where more edits could be made and added to the pull request. This makes contributing easy even for non-techy people.</summary>
