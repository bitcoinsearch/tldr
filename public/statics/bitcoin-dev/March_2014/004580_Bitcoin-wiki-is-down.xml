    <summary>On March 8, 2014, Tom Geller informed others that the Bitcoin wiki was down. He inquired about a communication procedure or point person for such occurrences. It was later revealed that the wiki was undergoing changes in control and operation. The message implied that there was nothing to fear as a result of the change.</summary>
