    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mike Hearn discussed the impact of modern devices such as smartphones and tablets not having swap files. This design decision ensures a responsive UI without blocking on disk, but creates issues for storing keys or transactions in memory. While BIP 70 has an expiry field for payment requests, there is no equivalent for refund addresses. Hearn suggests adding a new refund field that embeds a PaymentDetails structure instead of just a list of outputs, as otherwise a wallet would have to look out for refunds for payments made years ago. Alternatively, solving the problem internally by doing a wallet-specific swapping process may result in huge Bloom filters that hurt efficiency. Key expiry is fundamental to scalability.</summary>
