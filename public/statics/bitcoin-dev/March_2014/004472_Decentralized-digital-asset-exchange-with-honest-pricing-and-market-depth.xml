    <summary>The email conversation is regarding the accuracy of historic market data on cryptocurrency exchanges. The discussion revolves around whether or not the seller would care if parallel networks have front-run via a sybil attack. The primary goal of markets is price discovery, but trade itself. The actual trades are always public, and some kind of "archivers" could collect and maintain old orders for historic bid and asks, etc. People who take money from buyers and sellers care most about 'accurate historic market data'. However, the accuracy of historic market data is not as important as long as **MY** personal trade data is accurate and I got a good enough price, and I know who I'm dealing with. As long as use buyers and sellers can see the code, and have a good eye for knowing when someone's pushing the market around, they can just put their orders in and relieve some speculators of their money. Just get me working code for cross-chain trades, and we'll work on the accurate historic data problem later.</summary>
