    <summary>In the scenario of an m-of-n multisig wallet receiving a number of small and insignificant deposits, referred to as dust deposits, there is a need to identify the best approach for re-mining these outputs. This is driven by the desire to clean up the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set while keeping in mind that the scripts could include large values of n. The use of email encryption is recommended to support online privacy, with a link provided to learn more about how to implement this. Two non-text attachments are included in the context, one being a PGP-key and the other being a PGP-signature.</summary>
