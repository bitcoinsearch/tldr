    <summary>There is a discussion about the advantages and risks of using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates. While some believe that ECC will still be implemented despite the risks, others argue that Certificate Authorities (CAs) are vulnerable to patent trolls and may not want to take any chances. In response to concerns about patents, Adam Back shares that there is no need to worry as it is only patent FUD (expired, ancient and solid prior art). Additionally, Mike Hearn suggests that the reason most certs are still using RSA is due to the high cost of the Certicom ECC patents, which RIM has been telling CA's to pay for. However, there is hope that secp256r1 was defined without any back doors.</summary>
