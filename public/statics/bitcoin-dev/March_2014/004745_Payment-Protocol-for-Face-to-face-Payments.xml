    <summary>In an email conversation between Adam Back and Andreas Schildbach, the topic of practical and convenient QR code size was discussed. Adam stated that a sensible limit for QR code size would be under 100 bytes due to poor operating in varying light conditions. This was one of the driving factors behind BIP 73.Andreas asked if BIP 73 required an external server (the web server) to function properly. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, confirmed that internet connectivity is not rare these days and near-field web servers also work fine.</summary>
