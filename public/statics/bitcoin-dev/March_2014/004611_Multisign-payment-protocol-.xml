    <summary>Armory, a Bitcoin wallet management software, has announced that it will be working on new wallets and BIP32 integration after its next release in a couple of weeks. The company plans to introduce the concept of a wallet “bundle”, where all wallets in a bundle are protected by the same backup and stored in the same file. Armory also plans to allow separate parties to create multisig-intended wallets with public parts that can be exported and combined with other users. The system uses BIP-0032 HD wallets, and there will soon be BIP-0039 support for key compatibility. A document explaining the process can be found here: http://haskoin.com/~xeno/hd-multisig-wallet.html</summary>
