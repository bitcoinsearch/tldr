    <summary>Bitcoin Wallet switched to mBTC, despite some users asking for ÂµBTC instead. MultiBit HD offers a configuration panel with multiple display options, allowing customization to meet individual needs beyond the offered default. The NIST guidelines for representation of SI unit symbols were applied, including no conversion to native language and no RTL giving icon+m. Bitcoin Wallet's users did not complain about confusion due to the switch from BTC to mBTC, but many emails and questions arose if exchange rates differed by over 10%. Andreas Schildbach admitted he was not aware of the thread and decided to switch to mBTC after watching other wallets. Jeff Garzik suggested going straight to uBTC, as humans and existing computer systems handle numbers to the left of the decimal point well, but QuickBooks does not like three or more decimal places. Bitcoin Wallet's users appear to be more concerned with the amount in their local currency than the Bitcoin price.</summary>
