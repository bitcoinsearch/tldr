    <summary>The Bitcoin community is working towards the adoption of HD wallets, which is likely to see a significant migration away from random private keys. Gary Rowe, speaking from the MultiBit perspective, has revealed that all future protocol development (with the exception of critical security and network compatibility fixes) will be put into an HD wallet. He anticipates a release of HD code within two months, with private beta occurring within weeks. Trezor and Electrum may be earlier than this. Hive and Haskoin are also committed to HD. The best way to make a feature happen is just to write it. Devrandom is already working on a watchdog service, as is another group (TrustedCoin), and that's an obvious use for multisig/p2sh. They have APIs already, and it's just a case of standardising them once more experience is gained. Most popular end user wallets except blockchain.info and Bitcoin Core will support HDW soon enough.</summary>
