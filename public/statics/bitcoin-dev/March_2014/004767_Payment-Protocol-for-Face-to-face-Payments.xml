    <summary>The discussion is regarding inventing a URI for Bluetooth. The suggestion is to follow existing URI patterns, with the Bluetooth MAC address considered as the server address and payment request ID as the request path. The proposed URI scheme would be "bt:/". Concerns were raised about the use of a slash, which may need to be escaped if used in a URL parameter. However, it was pointed out that HTTP URLs used in BIP72 already have this feature. Testing showed that QR codes are limited to approximately 600 characters in binary mode, which means that only unsigned and short payment requests can be included. Longer signed requests will not work. The decision was made to go with the agreed-upon Bluetooth URI scheme and old-style payments over a P2P network as a fallback instead of using payment requests in QR codes.</summary>
