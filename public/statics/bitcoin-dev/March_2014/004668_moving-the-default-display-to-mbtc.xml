    <summary>When it comes to Bitcoin transactions, the decimal points involved can be overwhelming for some users. For instance, while a cup of coffee may cost 3.12345 mBTC, it can be less annoying if presented as 3123.45 uBTC. This is subjective, though, as some people may find the former more familiar. Merchants can solve this problem by rounding off the prices before presenting them to customers. Some wallets are also designed to make digits larger than two decimal places smaller and more precise visually. However, there hasn't been any compelling argument for keeping prices in mBTC other than that some people have already adopted it.</summary>
