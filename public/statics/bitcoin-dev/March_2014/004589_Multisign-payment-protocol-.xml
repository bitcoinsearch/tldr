    <summary>Alan Reiner, founder of Armory Wallet, expressed his concern over the lack of improvement in BIP 10 for multisig wallets and suggested that it should be discussed and improved. He added that he tried to implement offline transactions with BIP 10 two years ago but received no help to improve it. Gavin Andresen, a bitcoin developer, shared his experience and explained that standardization requires a great idea, implementation, agreement by all, refinement, and finally standardization. Drak proposed a BIP for payment protocol using multisig as it is currently complex to generate and keep track of. He highlighted the need for a simpler method to aid the future usability of multisig wallet implementations.</summary>
