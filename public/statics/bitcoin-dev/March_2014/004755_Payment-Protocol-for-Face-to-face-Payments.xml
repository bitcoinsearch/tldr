    <summary>In an email conversation dated March 20, 2014, Adam Back asked about the practical and convenient size limit for QR codes. The response given by another person noted that technically, the limit is 3 KB, but in their experience, codes above 1.5 KB become difficult to scan. They suggested staying below 500 bytes for easy scanning. However, they also mentioned that there is still potential for improvements in scanning technology.Adam Back also asked about the message size of the payment protocol and how much of it comes from the use of x509. The response indicated that a minimal payment request uses 50 bytes, while x509 adds about 4000 bytes on top of that. This leaves room for improvement in the payload of the PaymentDetails. The response also speculated that X.509 certification may not be possible via QR until specialized CAs issue space-efficient certificates using ECDSA.</summary>
