    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Gregory Maxwell on March 16, 2014, it was discussed that there were problems with the encryption methods in the current release of a software. Voegtlin was not aware of the flaws and promised to fix the code. However, Maxwell pointed out that the implementation leaks about 7 bits of data per message chunk and there could be incorrectly decrypted messages. As a result of these issues, Voegtlin decided to remove the encryption methods from the current release, retagged 1.9.8, and updated the packages.</summary>
