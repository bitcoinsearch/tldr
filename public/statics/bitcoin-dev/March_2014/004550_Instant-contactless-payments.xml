    <summary>In this context, Mike Hearn and another individual discuss the possibility of using a self-signed certificate as a basic start to accrue reputation for Bitcoin users. They also explore the idea of having a Bitcoin user add reputation by signing such a certificate rather than relying on a central signing authority. The discussion revolves around the use of ECDSA signatures and a distributed store of those signed messages to form a reputation score. The aim is to find a way for any user to add to the reputation with just the Bitcoin infrastructure without having to learn X.500 certificate signing on top of EC signatures.</summary>
