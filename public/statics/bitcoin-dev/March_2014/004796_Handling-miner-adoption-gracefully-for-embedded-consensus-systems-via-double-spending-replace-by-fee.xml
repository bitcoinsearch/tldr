    <summary>In March 2014, Peter Todd suggested forking the Bitcoin Core software as a way to encourage miners to support it. This was not a new idea, as there had already been at least one public miner-oriented fork of Bitcoin Core prior to version 0.7. However, Todd believed that miners who continued to run vanilla Bitcoin Core were neglecting their duty to the community. Despite this, he also stated that having more forks could be beneficial for decentralization.</summary>
