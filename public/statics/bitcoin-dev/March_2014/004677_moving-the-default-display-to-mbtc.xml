    <summary>A decision has been made to implement uBTC into the next Armory release. However, caution was given with using the word "consensus" as it does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the entire community. Other wallets have already switched to mBTC, and making another change may not be a popular choice. Using uBTC would make Armory different from other wallets that are in wide usage. Some of the wallets and services that use mBTC include blockchain.info, MultiBit, Bitcoin Wallet (Android), Hive, Bitcoinity, KnC Wallet (defaults to BTC but can be switched to mBTC in settings, uBTC not an option), Mullvad, and btcstore.eu. A search for [bitcoin "mBTC"] and [bitcoin "uBTC"] revealed that many sites and services have prices listed in mBTC, while only faucets appear to use uBTC.</summary>
