    <summary>The writer expresses concern about the use of iso-dep protocol for payment verification via phone, as it disconnects as soon as the call is picked up. They argue that users should have the choice to manually verify payments without time pressure and at their own viewing distance. The memo field also presents a challenge for risk analysis. While NFC requires the screen to be on and unlocked, the writer hopes future OS updates will allow payment apps on lock screens. To optimize the bootup process and achieve fast contact periods, the Android wallet app may require further optimization. The writer contends that the process is already short if Android Beam is not used.</summary>
