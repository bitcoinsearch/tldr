    <summary>In an email exchange, Alex Kotenko and another individual discuss the possibility of inventing a URI for Bluetooth. They agree that the BT MAC should be considered the server address, and payment request ID can be the request path. They consider implementing HTTP-over-Bluetooth but decide it may be overkill. The compatibility issue is brought up, but they agree to stick with BIP21 as it is widely supported. A comparison is made between Base 64 via binary QR and Base 43 via alphanum QR in terms of efficiency in PR data size versus the amount of space used in a QR code.</summary>
