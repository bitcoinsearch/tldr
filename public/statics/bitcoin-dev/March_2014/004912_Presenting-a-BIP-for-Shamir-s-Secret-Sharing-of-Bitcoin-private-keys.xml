    <summary>Gregory Maxwell and Watson Ladd discussed the possibility of computing a signature from shares without reconstructing the private key using MPC techniques for Bitcoin. However, Maxwell pointed out that practically speaking, it would not be possible unless the technique used is carefully selected to make it possible. Additionally, he believed that such a scheme would require a change to the Bitcoin scripting language, which would take too long. Hence, he preferred that they standardize a formulation that has this property. Ladd agreed with Maxwell's preference but mentioned that there exists a paper on this technique for Bitcoin. Nonetheless, he was unsure where it was located, and this proposal was not such a scheme. In conclusion, Maxwell aimed to make his BIP useful in the present without requiring changes to the Bitcoin scripting language.</summary>
