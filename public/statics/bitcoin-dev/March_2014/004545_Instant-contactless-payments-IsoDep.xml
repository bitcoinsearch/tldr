    <summary>In an email exchange on June 3, 2014, Andreas Schildbach questioned the use of iso-dep in a certain situation, noting that the connection would break as soon as the phone was picked up. If the phone is not willing to immediately authorize, it would have to revert to HTTPS or Bluetooth. The discussion then turned to whether it was possible to dispatch different isodep applications to different apps and avoid conflicts between them. While intent filters could be added, there was no mime type or similar concept to prevent apps from fighting for access to IsoDep endpoints.</summary>
