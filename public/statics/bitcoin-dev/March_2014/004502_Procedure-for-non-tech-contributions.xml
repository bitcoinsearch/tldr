    <summary>In a discussion thread on March 2, 2014, Tom Geller expressed concerns about sending payments to a wallet held by MtGox that is required for editing the bitcoin wiki hosted by the exchange. He believed it could prevent new contributors from joining and remarked that he had registered but never received a confirmation email. However, MtGox's priority was low in moving the wiki to new hosting. The suggestion was made to contact SomeoneWeird on IRC as they were handling manual approvals of new editing accounts.</summary>
