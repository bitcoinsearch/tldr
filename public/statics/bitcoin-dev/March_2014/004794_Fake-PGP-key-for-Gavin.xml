    <summary>In this message, Troy Benjegerdes speculates that corporate industrial espionage and organized crime outfits are more likely to use fake PGP keys than intelligence agencies, which would stick to compromised X509, network cards, and binary code blobs. The message goes on to discuss instances of developers in the censorship circumvention problem space experiencing similar attacks in the past. The Doctor, a developer for Project Byzantium, suggests that intelligence agencies may have motives beyond acquiring Bitcoins for attempting a cybil attack against developers. They may be interested in making it easier to substitute alternate versions of software that can be used to spy on users and take them down. The message ends with The Doctorâ€™s PGP signature.</summary>
