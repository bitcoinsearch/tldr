    <summary>The context discusses two separate topics, the first being the control of the Mt. Gox wiki and the second being text editing on Github. In regards to the former, "SerajewelKS" and "gmaxwell" confirmed in IRC/bitcoin that fixes are underway, but no specifics were given. For the latter, Wladimir provided a simple solution for editing text on Github which involves going to the release-notes page, clicking "edit", making desired changes, and adding a commit message describing the change. The author thanks those who gave advice and will soon go over the 0.9.0rc2 text. The context concludes with contact information for Tom Geller who is a writer/presenter specializing in articles, marketing, videos, user guides, and books.</summary>
