    <summary>On March 12, 2014, a discussion took place regarding partially signed transactions in Bitcoind. Mike Hearn shared what is expected by default for such transactions and raised a question about whether the act of filling out the signature could result in a higher fee level. He wondered if this could be calculated in advance based on the initial transaction size and number of required signatures. Drak responded to the discussion.</summary>
