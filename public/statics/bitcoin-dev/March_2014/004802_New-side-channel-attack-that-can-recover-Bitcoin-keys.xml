    <summary>The context suggests that if one is concerned about the NSA compromising their hardware or software, they should use multisig transactions and sign on diverse hardware/software stacks. By generating multiple private keys on different hardware/software stacks, the single point of failure can be eliminated, thereby mitigating whole families of possible attacks. These attacks could range from the NSA compromising the hardware random number generator in a CPU to them listening to EMF radiation coming from a dedicated server in a data center. The most probable attack is when a data center employee is tricked into letting somebody have access to a dedicated server. According to Gavin Andresen, it is important to take precautions in order to avoid such attacks.</summary>
