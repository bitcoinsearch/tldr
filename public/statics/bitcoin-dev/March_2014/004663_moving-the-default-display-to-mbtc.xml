    <summary>In an email dated 13th March 2014, Alan Reiner mentioned that Marty Zigman was creating a Bitcoin plugin for NetSuite accounting platform. However, Zigman had to switch to micro-BTC long ago due to the system's limitations. Reiner suggested that the system will track up to 3 decimal places without causing automatic rounding and other issues. He also expressed willingness to revisit the issue if possible, given Armory's upcoming release. Tamas Blummer, founder and CEO of Bits of Proof, questioned why 'bit' couldn't be added as an option or even default to Armory.</summary>
