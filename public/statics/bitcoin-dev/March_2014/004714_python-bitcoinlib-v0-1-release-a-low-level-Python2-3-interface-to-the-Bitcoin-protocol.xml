    <summary>On March 15, 2014, Peter Todd announced the release of v0.1 of Python-bitcoinlib, a Python2/3 library that offers an easy interface to the Bitcoin data structures and protocol. The approach is low-level and "ground up", with a focus on providing tools to manipulate the internals of how Bitcoin works in a Pythonic way, without straying far from the Bitcoin Core implementation. The current status of the library as of v0.1 is that the support for data-structures related to transactions, scripting, addresses, and keys are all quite usable and the API is probably not going to change that much. Bitcoin Core RPC support is included and automatically converts the JSON to/from Python objects when appropriate. The release and others in the future are signed by Todd's PGP key, as well as every publicly pushed commit.Todd mentioned that he hasn't had any need for the p2p network-related code for some time, so it's not in good shape and lacks unittests; Bloom filters for one are missing the Merkle-block support to actually make them useful. But the RPC support makes up for that for many uses.Jeff Garzik responded to Todd's announcement and said that it sounds great and he is glad to see this with a more active maintainer. Maintaining -three- client libs was a bit much for him.Lastly, Drak asked if it would make sense to pull the stuff in and add Peter with commit access since Todd's repo is top of the fork tree.</summary>
