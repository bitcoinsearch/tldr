    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 is now available as a release candidate for a new major version bringing both new features and bug fixes. Users who are running on an older version should shut it down, wait until it has completely shut down, uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). There have been frequent reports of users running out of virtual memory on 32-bit systems during the initial sync, so the new version includes Windows 64-bit installer. The minimum requirements for this release have been updated and now require a 64-bit-capable CPU and Mac OS 10.6 or later. The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous releases, so if you run 0.9 and then decide to switch back to a 0.8.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the old release. This release contains a few fixes for transaction ID (TXID) malleability issues such as: -nospendzeroconfchange command-line option, IsStandard() transaction rules tightened to prevent relaying and mining of mutated transactions, additional information in listtransactions/gettransaction output to report wallet transactions that conflict with each other because they spend the same outputs, bug fixes to the getbalance/listaccounts RPC commands, which would report incorrect balances for double-spent (or mutated) transactions, and a new option: -zapwallettxes to rebuild the wallet's transaction information.This release drops the default fee required to relay transactions across the network and for miners to consider the transaction in their blocks to 0.01mBTC per kilobyte. Note that getting a transaction relayed across the network does NOT guarantee that the transaction will be accepted by a miner, and the minimum relay/mining fee-per-kilobyte may be changed with the minrelaytxfee option. The wallet code still uses a default fee for low-priority transactions of 0.1mBTC per kilobyte.Other changes in the 0.9 release include moving away from the bitcoind executable functioning both as a server and as a RPC client, with the RPC client functionality being split into a separate executable, 'bitcoin-cli'. The behavior of the `walletpassphrase` RPC when the wallet is already unlocked has also changed between 0.8 and 0.9. This release also contains new notion of 'conflicted' transactions, reported as confirmations: -1, updated help and tests for 'getreceivedby(account|address)', and adding new 'addrlocal' field to 'getpeerinfo' output.To reduce confusion between Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software, the reference client has been renamed to Bitcoin Core. For 0.9.0, an autotools-based build system has been adopted instead of individual (q)makefiles. The GUI has switched to Qt 5.2.0 for Windows build, payment request (BIP 0070) support has been added, and the options dialog has been improved.The latest release of the Bitcoin client includes several improvements and features. The addition of an open URI dialog, coin control features, and an improved receive coins workflow are among the updates. The 'Receive' tab has been turned into a form for requesting payments, while historical address list functionality has been moved to the File menu. The client has also been rebranded as 'Bitcoin Core'. Initialization and shutdown have been moved to a thread, eliminating "Not responding" messages during startup. On OS X, the update uses the user notification center to display notifications, and a flag has been added for better font rendering on Retina displays. A fix has been implemented for the bitcoin-qt startup crash when clicking the dock icon, and a fix has been added for the Gnome bitcoin: URI handler on Linux.The update also includes several miscellaneous additions, including a Linux script to limit outgoing bandwidth and a '-regtest' mode which is similar to testnet but private. A separate bitcoin-cli client has been added as well. The credits for this release include contributions from numerous individuals, including Gavin Andresen, Peter Todd, Jeff Garzik, and many others.</summary>
