    <summary>Electrum 1.9.8 has been released with features initially planned for version 2.0. These features include upgraded Electrum servers that store a Patricia tree of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This allows clients to request the balance of any address directly. New commands have been added, such as getaddressbalance, getaddressunspent, and getutxoaddress. Two commands for message encryption have also been added using ECIES encryption algorithm. The key can be obtained using the 'getpubkeys' command. Additionally, command-line commands that require a connection to the network spawn a daemon, making scripting more efficient by opening only one connection. Packages for download are available on https://electrum.org/download.html and binaries for windows and mac will be available soon.However, there were issues raised about the implementation of the encryption algorithm used in Bitcoin wallet. It appears insecure in several ways and is not actually implementing ECIES. The primary issue is that it uses a trivial 16-bit check value instead of a cryptographically strong MAC tied to the ephemeral secret. This means that an arbitrary message encrypted to a third person can be decoded if they allow no more than 65536 queries to a decryption oracle to decrypt some other message. There may be other problems or mitigating factors that are hard to follow in the implementation. Furthermore, there were issues raised about the implementation leaking approximately 7 bits of data per message chunk and potentially resulting in incorrect decryption of messages. In response, Thomas Voegtlin promised to fix the code and removed the encryption methods from the current release of Electrum 1.9.8. In March 2014, Thomas Voegtlin received feedback about a flawed implementation of his code. The flaw was related to Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) encryption and the fact that the nonce point was not being checked for its position on the curve. This could result in the private key being recovered by attackers. Additionally, the implementation had other issues, such as not using a strong random number generator.Upon receiving this feedback, Voegtlin thanked the person who alerted him to the flaws and promised to fix the code. However, further concerns were raised about the implementation leaking data and potentially causing incorrect decryption of messages. The situation was described as "screwy and suspect." It is important to note that the specifics of the code's flaws were difficult to follow, according to the person who identified them. Despite this, Voegtlin took the feedback seriously and expressed a willingness to address the issues.</summary>
