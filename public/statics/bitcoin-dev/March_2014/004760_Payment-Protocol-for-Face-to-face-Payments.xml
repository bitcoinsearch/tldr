    <summary>In an email conversation in March 2014, Adam Back suggested exploring raw ECDSA signed message based certificates. However, the current system is still in use because it is difficult to create and run a new Certification Authority (CA). Bitpay's certificate is about 1.5kB in DER format and contains a 2048-bit RSA server key and 2048-bit RSA signatures. ECC certificates are not widely used due to backward compatibility issues with old browsers. Entrust sells ECC certificates, but their intermediate cert is still RSA. ECC roots have been submitted and included, but most websites still use RSA certs for compatibility reasons. The possibility of adding another feature that uses some bytes into PaymentRequests is mentioned, though QR codes are considered impractical due to data size constraints, and Bluetooth may be a better alternative.</summary>
