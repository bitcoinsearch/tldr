    <summary>In a discussion about using bitcoin for face-to-face transactions, Mike Hearn and another person talked about not knowing the legal name of the entity running an establishment during such transactions. Mike provided an example of traditional British pubs that may have individual names but are owned by a company whose name might not be prominently advertised in the pubs. Another example he gave was traders at music festivals who may not have clearly advertised business names that customers will be aware of. These examples highlight potential challenges in obtaining certificates for actual business names in face-to-face transactions.</summary>
