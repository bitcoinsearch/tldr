    <summary>The discussion concerns defining a fixed expiry time for products in the EU. It is suggested to set it at 2.5 years, which allows for shipping time and covers the 2 years warranty period. The conversation then shifts to PaymentDetails and whether it can be used for refunds. While most of the fields are optional, they cannot be known in advance, except for time. Refunds after expiry would have to be ad-hoc and would not provide the same UI as refunds filed before expiry. Another issue raised is that the refund address is currently unprotected, but tampering with it should not be possible when submitted over HTTPS or Bluetooth. Finally, there is a suggestion to use a full-blown PaymentRequest with optional PKI signing for refunds, although normally, sellers do not know or care about the identity of buyers for refunds outside their own tracking system.</summary>
