    <summary>The conversation in context is related to the refund policy of Bitcoin payment scheme, with a focus on establishing an appropriate time frame for refunds. The current discussion revolves around whether two months or three months would be more suitable for refunds, as well as concerns regarding RAM usage and EU DSD compliance. Mike Hearn suggests that two months be adopted, as it would help merchants comply with EU DSD regulations and keep RAM usage in check until a more sophisticated refund scheme is implemented. Roy Badami points out that establishing a fixed expiration time for refunds, such as 2.5 years (30 months), would be better, given that most products are covered by a two-year warranty in the EU. On the other hand, Andreas Schildbach states that the specific timeframe for refunds varies across countries, and suggests that the smallest possible unit of time in Germany is two weeks, while in the UK, it is seven days. Despite this, the general consensus is that a couple of months for refunds may still be too short, especially if there are delays in the shipping process.</summary>
