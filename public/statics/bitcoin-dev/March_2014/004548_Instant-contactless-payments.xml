    <summary>In the given context, the idea of using a Stealth address or HD wallet root as an identity for gaining reputation is discussed. If this approach is used, address re-use would not be mandatory. The X.520 name in the signing cert that signed the payment request could serve as the identity. Even a self-signed cert could be used for this purpose, but it would compromise security benefits and a key rotation would delete the reputation. Therefore, it is more practical to accrue reputation to the name itself.</summary>
