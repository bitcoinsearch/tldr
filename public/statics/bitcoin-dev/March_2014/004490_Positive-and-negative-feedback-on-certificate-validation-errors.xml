    <summary>In an email thread, Jeremy Spilman expressed concerns over the use of third-party "root certificates" as a form of positive feedback for signed payment requests made through a cryptographic currency. Currently, signed payment requests are indicated by a green background while unsigned requests do not have this indication. However, Spilman questions the need for external certificates and their potential impact on security. He suggests that if the payment is signed by the ECDSA private key to which it's being sent, then it should be marked with the green background. Furthermore, he proposes implementing a "signing fee" extension or a compile-time option to disable this feature for small businesses who may find it too expensive to take secure payments. The email thread ends with a quote from Troy Benjegerdes advising against picking a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel or trying to buy a hacker who makes money by the megahash.</summary>
