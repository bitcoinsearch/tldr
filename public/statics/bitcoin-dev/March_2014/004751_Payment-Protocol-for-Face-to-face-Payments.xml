    <summary>In an email exchange from March 2014, Mike Hearn discusses the overlap between PKI signing in BIP70 and the need for confidentiality and authenticity in local face-to-face transactions. The PKI in BIP70 is not useful in this scenario as it does not provide any electronic identifier or legal name for the entity running the establishment. In many cases, customers simply want to be assured that they are paying the person or organization that operates the machine behind the counter. Hearn believes that the payment protocol complicates and weakens this assurance, missing the simplicity of BIP21 QR codes for face-to-face transactions.</summary>
