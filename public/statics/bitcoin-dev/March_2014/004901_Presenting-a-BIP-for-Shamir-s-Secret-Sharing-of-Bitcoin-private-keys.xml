    <summary>In this email thread, Chris Beams asks Matt Whitlock to expand on use cases for which he sees Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme as the best tool for the job. Chris also inquires about whether Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme would be superior to simply going with multisig in the first place and if these approaches are complimentary towards defense-in-depth. In response, Matt adds two new sections to address Chris's questions and provides a link to the updated BIP on Github.</summary>
