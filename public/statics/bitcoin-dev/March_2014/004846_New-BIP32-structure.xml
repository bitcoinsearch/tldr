This can cause synchronization on an Android device to take up to a minute when running on a 3G connection. It is unclear whether this delay is caused by the large number of addresses or block headers.It should be noted that the author has not conducted a comprehensive examination of server performance and is only able to make observations based on their own experiences with Electrum servers. The slowdown in server performance is likely related to the resources available on the server, as well as the number of requests being made to it.</summary>
