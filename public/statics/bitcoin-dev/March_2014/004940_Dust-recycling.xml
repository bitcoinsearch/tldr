    <summary>In a discussion on March 29, 2014, Justus Ranvier suggested the need for a standard output type to make it easier to send the entire transaction to miner fees. He joked that this output type could be called a "return operator." This would allow for even large transactions that would normally be dropped by fee/kB rules to propagate. Another user suggested using dust-b-gone to relay such transactions as someone else's problem.</summary>
