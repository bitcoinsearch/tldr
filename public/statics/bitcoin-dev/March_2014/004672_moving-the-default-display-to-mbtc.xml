    <summary>The use of milli- and micro- notation for currency units in Bitcoin is not well supported. There was a suggestion to use 1 XBT = 1 uBTC, but some people have already started using XBT to mean the same as BTC. Redefining XBT could lead to accidentally sending too much or too little money. The confusing mess surrounding symbols and denominations makes Bitcoin look unprofessional and opens up potential for mistakes. Introducing a new unit, such as skipping nanoBTC for XBT, would make mistakes even more common. Consistency is important and adding another unit would only complicate matters.</summary>
