    <summary>In an email conversation on March 28, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed his reluctance to manage a business relationship with every shop he buys something from. He believes itâ€™s too much effort and suggests that the buyer-to-seller relationship should be the scope of BIP70 for now. Tamas Blummer responded agreeing that the payment protocol has a narrow scope of a web cart-customer, but added that what is needed is a protocol that deals with the concept of business relationships instead of individual requests. This would eliminate the need for addresses and allow parties to terminate the relationship at their own discretion. Blummer provided links to his website and Bitcoin development information. The email thread also contained HTML and non-text attachments which were not described in detail.</summary>
