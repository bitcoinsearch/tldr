    <summary>On March 13, 2014, Jack Scott proposed a method to generate a Bitcoin private key using a physical key in conjunction with image recognition software and a PIN. This proposal was submitted under BIP XX, titled "Physical key / edge detection software and PIN to generate a Bitcoin private key". The idea is to use edge detection software applied to incoming video feed to convert the shape of a physical key into an equation that describes the key. The hash of the key's equation plus a user-generated five-digit pin can then be used to create a Bitcoin private key.The proposal received interest from Brooks who suggested that a real-world "key" would be less secure than a Bitcoin/PGP "key". However, he acknowledged that a physical/visual "key" could be any complex, high-contrast image, like a motion tracking target. He recommended that the standard should enforce some minimum level of complexity to prevent simple and easy-to-reproduce/steal keys. Additionally, he suggested that if the level of complexity required was high, it would be better to have a QR code of the private key instead.</summary>
