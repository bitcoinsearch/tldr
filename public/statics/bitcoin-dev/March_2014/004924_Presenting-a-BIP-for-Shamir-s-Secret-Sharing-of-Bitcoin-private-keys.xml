    <summary>A discussion between Roy Badami and another individual on March 29, 2014, suggests that some individuals are taking base58-encoded private keys and running them through ssss-split. The process seems to have advantages as it can be easily reassembled on any Linux machine without special software. Furthermore, B Poettering's Linux command line SSSS implementation is included in most Linux distributions. However, the other individual respectfully points out that it is also possible to run base58-encoded private keys through GPG, which is also included in most Linux distros. Despite this, Badami mentions the existence of BIP38.</summary>
