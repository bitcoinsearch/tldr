    <summary>In an email dated March 12, 2014, Gary Rowe commented on the BIP39 word list being integrated into Bitcoinj. He stated that it will likely become the standard for Android, Trezor web, and several desktop wallets. Anyone who deviates from this word list would find themselves isolated. Regarding the timestamp, MultiBit HD uses a simple timestamp of "number of days since midnight of Bitcoin genesis block in UTC with modulo 97 checksum appended." Thus, a new seed generated on January 27, 2014 would have "1850/01" as its checksum. The users are tested when creating a new wallet to ensure they have written down the timestamp along with the associated 12/18/24 words. It is unclear if the checksum in this case is another value calculated over the mnemonic list. Jean-Paul questioned if the checksum was being changed or if the input seed was being fudged to produce a specific checksum. Jean-Paul also questioned whether including this information in the BIP would be more beneficial than it simply being specific to MultiBit HD.</summary>
