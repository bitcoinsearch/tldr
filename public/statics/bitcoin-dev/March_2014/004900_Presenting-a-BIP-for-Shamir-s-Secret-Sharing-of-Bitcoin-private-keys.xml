    <summary>In March 2014, Chris Beams reached out to Matt on Github to ask about the use cases for Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Specifically, he wanted to know when it would be superior to multisig or if they were complementary approaches. He noted that the Motivation and Rationale sections of the BIP in its current form did not address these questions. To address these concerns, Matt added two new sections to the Github page. It is not clear from the context what these sections were specifically about, but they were meant to expand on the use cases for Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.</summary>
