    <summary>The conversation in this context is between Matt Whitlock, Dev Random and Watson Ladd. They discuss a research article on Bitcoin wallet security that refers to an ACM paper, but which has no URL provided for it. The discussion centers around the implementation of threshold ECDSA with keys derived from separate seeds versus one seed that is then split up. They also touch on how threshold ECDSA can work with BIP32 and if anyone is working on a BIP for it. Although multisig is catching on quickly in the ecosystem, Shamir Secret Sharing BIP is proposed as a measure that can be used today, with no changes to existing Bitcoin software.</summary>
