    <summary>The discussion is about the standard unit to represent Bitcoin, with the majority of participants preferring either μBTC or mBTC. MultiBit HD offers a configuration panel with options for different combinations and settings for leading/trailing symbols, commas, spaces, and points as per NIST guidelines. The default setting is m+icon from the Font Awesome icon set, but earlier posts suggest that μ+icon may be more appropriate. Jeff Garzik is disappointed that Bitcoin Wallet moved to mBTC, which he believes may cause additional user confusion when transitioning to uBTC later on. He suggests going straight to uBTC, while Wendell agrees with him and wants to implement it right after the fee system is improved.</summary>
