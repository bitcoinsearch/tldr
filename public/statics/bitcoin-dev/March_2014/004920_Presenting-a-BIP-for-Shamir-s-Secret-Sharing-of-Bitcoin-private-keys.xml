    <summary>There is a discussion on fragmented backups for bitcoin wallets. Armory has had fragmented backups for over a year, which allows for the distribution of seed shares to beneficiaries and friends in order to reconstitute a master seed after death. The user needs clear ways to identify which fragments are associated with which wallet, and which fragments are compatible with each other. They need a way to save some fragments to file, print them, or simply write them down. Without it, the math fails silently, and you end up restoring a different wallet. Alan Reiner worked on implementing this feature in Armory, including an interface that will test up to 50 subsets of make sure the math produces the same values every time. This is an advanced tool, but it might not be for everyone. In another conversation, there is a mention of people taking base58-encoded private keys and running them through ssss-split. This can easily be reassembled on any Linux machine without special software. Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme is also mentioned as being perfect for distributing seed shares to beneficiaries and friends in order to reconstitute a master seed after death. Matt Whitlock is presently working on extending his draft BIP so that it applies to BIP32 master seeds of various sizes.</summary>
