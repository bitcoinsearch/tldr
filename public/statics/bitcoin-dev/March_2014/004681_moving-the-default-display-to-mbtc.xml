    <summary>In a forum post on bitcointalk.org, a user expressed their support for using uBTC (micro-bitcoin) as the standard unit of measurement for Bitcoin. The user argued that Dogecoin's success with a low-valued large-balance currency proved the psychological value of such a system. They suggested that using uBTC would simplify transactions and avoid the need for another unit change in the future. The user also proposed inverting the exchange rate to quote USD/uB instead of uB/USD, similar to how Yen are quoted relative to USD. In response to some objections raised by other users, the original poster defended their proposal and argued that it was already popular and would not require a significant amount of work to implement.</summary>
