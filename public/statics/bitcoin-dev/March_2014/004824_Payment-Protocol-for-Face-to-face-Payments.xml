    <summary>In Germany, it is common for businesses to be named after the family who runs them and their legal form of the company. This means that often people do not know the official name of a business but instead refer to them as "bakery", "indian restaurant" or "snack vending machine". Mike Hearn suggests that for cases like these where there is no official name, they would need to come up with a new solution. However, this would require creating their own infrastructure which may not be feasible.</summary>
