    <summary>In this email thread, Mike Hearn and Andreas Schildbach discuss the possibility of using IsoDep protocol with NFC tags to authorize Bitcoin transactions on Android devices. Andreas notes that there may be conflicts between different apps trying to access IsoDep endpoints and suggests exploring whether it's possible to dispatch different IsoDep applications to different apps. Mike suggests having a NDEF tag trigger the app, which would then start an IsoDep protocol. However, he is unsure if this is possible with the Android API. The email thread ends with advertisements for Perforce and a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
