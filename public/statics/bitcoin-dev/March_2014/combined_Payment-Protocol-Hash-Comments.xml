    <summary>The BIP70 protocol discusses the use of SHA-256 and SHA-1 algorithms for hashing payment messages. The protocol outlines that if the pki_type is x509+sha256, then the PaymentRequest message is hashed using the SHA256 algorithm to produce the message digest that is signed. If the pki_type is x509+sha1, then the SHA1 algorithm is used. However, this reference may be outdated as the field to be hashed is actually 'PaymentRequest', not 'Payment' message.PHP does support sha2, contrary to the claim that it cannot do SHA-2. The resources available on the php.net website, including the mhash.constants page and the hash-algos function page, show evidence of it. A discussion thread from 2014 on the Bitcoin-development mailing list also touched on the use of SHA-1 versus SHA-2 in the context of BIP70, with some participants questioning the inclusion of SHA-1 due to its retirement. In an email exchange on March 2, 2014, Mike Hearn discusses the rationale for adding SHA-2 to the spec with Gavin the previous year. Although it may have only applied to certain versions of PHP, SHA-2 has been available in standard PHP since version 5.1.2 as part of the hash() function. The majority of PHP installations are version 5.2 and above according to usage stats. As such, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, Drak suggests removing SHA-1 from the specification.On March 2nd, 2014, Jeremy Spilman posted a message on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding SHA-1 support in PHP development. The message referenced BIP70 and discussed the use of SHA-256 and SHA-1 algorithms for hashing payment messages. The message had some minor comments, such as clarifying that the field to be hashed should be 'PaymentRequest' instead of 'Payment' and being more explicit about the hashing process. Furthermore, it questioned the need for SHA-1, which is retiring soon, and whether end-users should have access to details such as pki_type and certificate chains.The email thread begins with a discussion on adding support for SHA-2 algorithm in PHP. Drak mentions that PHP does support SHA-2, contradicting Mike Hearn's previous statement that PHP can't do SHA-2. Jeremy Spilman then provides some comments on the Payment message hashing process mentioned in BIP70. He suggests making the field to be hashed clear and explicit, as well as retiring SHA1 since it is being phased out. In addition, he asks if there should be a way for end-users to view details such as the pki_type and certificate chain. The discussion ends with a note from Mike regarding the need for a living version of the payment protocol document, as reverse engineering the current spec by manually reading all the BIPs and layering them in one's head is not feasible.</summary>
