    <summary>On March 2, 2014, James Hartig reported that he downloaded the Linux tar.gz to his OVH box and his server was terminated, with a screenshot from the email. The company claimed that he was attacking IP address 88.198.199.140 over port 443. Wladimir responded, expressing doubt that bitcoind would connect to port 443 or "attack" anything, and asked if there was anything in debug.log regarding that IP.</summary>
