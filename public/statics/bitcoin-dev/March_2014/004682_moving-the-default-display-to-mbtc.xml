    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, argued that using mBTC as the default unit of measurement in the main reference implementation, Bitcoin-Qt, was unwise. He believed that uBTC would have been a better choice as it can solve existing, known problems and make auditing easier. Garzik also argued that supporting accounting packages limited to two decimal places with mBTC defaults is a security risk due to the need for decimal point conversion, which makes auditing more difficult. Despite this, he acknowledged that revisiting the issue of a unit switch was likely to happen at some point in the future. Another contributor to the discussion, Drak, suggested that changing the defaults in Bitcoin-Qt would be the best way to influence the wider community to make the switch to uBTC. Bitpay was also mentioned as a company that could take the lead in making the switch to uBTC.</summary>
