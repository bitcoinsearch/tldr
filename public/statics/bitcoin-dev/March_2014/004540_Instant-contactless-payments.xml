    <summary>In an email dated March 6, 2014, Mike Hearn discusses his first experience with a contactless payment made through NFC technology. He notes that this type of frictionless payment experience is likely to become the norm and that Bitcoin will have to adapt to match it. Among his suggestions for improving Bitcoin's usability are the implementation of HD wallets and the development of a decentralized reputation network. Hearn admits that the latter would be a complex undertaking but suggests that social data could be exchanged to build trust between users. The idea of multiple reputation networks with different curators is also floated as a way to prevent centralization.</summary>
