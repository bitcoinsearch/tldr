    <summary>Mike Hearn, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has been working on implementing HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets for the bitcoinj branch of bitcoin. Electrum and Trezor are also making good progress in this area. Mike believes that most popular end user wallets except blockchain.info and Bitcoin Core will soon support HD wallets. HD is important for some multisig flows, including the watchdog type where change going back to the wallet needs to be detected. Devrandom and TrustedCoin are already working on a watchdog service which is an obvious use for multisig/p2sh. A proposed flow for watchdog type multisig has been provided by Cryptocorp and a reference implementation off the Electrum 2.0 branch exists. It works just like a regular spend from a UX point of view, unless the watchdog decides that it needs a second factor for a risky transaction.</summary>
