    <summary>In an email thread dated March 31, 2014, Jeff Garzik brought up the topic of using Namecoin in combination with SIN or PGP identity. It's unclear what prompted this discussion, but Roy asked if Namecoin is still actively maintained. It's worth noting that Namecoin is a cryptocurrency that also doubles as a naming system, allowing users to register domains with the .bit extension. As of September 2021, Namecoin's GitHub repository shows recent activity, with the latest commit made on August 18, 2021. Additionally, the project has a website that provides updates on its development progress. While it may not be as popular as Bitcoin or Ethereum, Namecoin appears to be a viable option for those interested in decentralized domain registration and online identity verification.</summary>
