    <summary>The author of the message is considering the idea of implementing a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would create a payment protocol using multisig. Currently, setting up a multisig requires exchanging public keys and working out how to get the public keys from addresses. This process can be challenging for users, and it leaves them vulnerable to malicious parties who could generate a multisig address+script that allows them to run off with funds. It is also complex to generate and keep track of. Although there have been attempts at creating browser interfaces to make it easier, they still lack the ease created by the payment protocol. The author suggests that a BIP could aid future usability of multisig wallet implementations.</summary>
