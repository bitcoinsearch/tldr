    <summary>In an email exchange on March 27, 2014, Pavol Rusnak and Thomas Voegtlin discussed increasing the number of available unused addresses to 10 or 20 in the bip32 version of Electrum. They also considered specifying a "gap limit" for accounts, where the scan would stop as soon as they hit the first account with no transaction history. Currently, TREZOR uses a gap limit of 0, meaning that the first X=10 addresses are unused. Rusnak agreed with the suggestion, but wondered if they could just look at the first address of each account instead of the first 10.</summary>
