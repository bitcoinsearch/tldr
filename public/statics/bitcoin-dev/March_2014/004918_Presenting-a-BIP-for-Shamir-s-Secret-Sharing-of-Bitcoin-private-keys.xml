    <summary>Armory has implemented "Fragmented Backups" which are loved by advanced users, although it may be difficult to standardize across different languages. The implementation uses finite field math with recursion, list comprehensions and python arbitrary-big-integers in about 100 lines. The user interface is crucial for this feature to be usable, as users need clear ways to identify which fragments are associated with which wallet, which fragments are compatible with each other, and ways to save, print, or write down fragments. Armory provides all of this including an interface that tests up to 50 subsets to ensure the math produces the same values every time. The secret is put in the highest-order coefficient of the polynomial, and the other coefficients are deterministic ensuring that if an M-of-N wallet is printed out, the first N fragments will be the same when printing out an M-of-(N+1) wallet later. Armory is an advanced tool, and its fragmented backup feature might not be for everyone.In a separate email, Matt Whitlock mentions his desire to distribute seed shares to beneficiaries and close friends so that they can reconstruct his wallet's master seed after his death. He is working on extending his BIP to apply to BIP32 master seeds of various sizes.</summary>
