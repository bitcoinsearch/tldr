    <summary>The discussion revolves around finding a practical QR code size limit and minimizing the payment protocol message size from the use of x509. Encoding entire payment requests into QR codes is not feasible as they can already be large when signed. The focus should be on standardizing the Bluetooth support, which would require adding an encryption/authentication layer on top, along with writing a BIP for it to ensure interoperability. The authentication process would require proof of owning the Bitcoin key in the address part of the URI. For the auth layer, SSL could be used, or a custom lightweight protocol could be rolled out. This would require review by experts familiar with such protocols. The discussion presents an opportunity to grow the community by finding a crypto enthusiast volunteer.</summary>
