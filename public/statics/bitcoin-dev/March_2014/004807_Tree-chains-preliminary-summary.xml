    <summary>A discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about the need for moderation to maintain a friendly environment for technical discussions. Alan Reiner expressed concern that despite Peter Todd's valuable technical contributions, his communication style was hostile and corroding, making it scary for others to discuss things. He suggested some kind of negative reinforcement for those who insulted other contributors' intelligence and character publicly. Jeff Garzik agreed that abrasive or hostile attitudes could turn away potential contributors and suggested an openly stated moderation policy as a possible solution. The discussion also included a link to a free O'Reilly book on graph databases.</summary>
