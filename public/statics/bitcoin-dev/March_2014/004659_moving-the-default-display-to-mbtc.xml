    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeff Garzik criticized the idea of random apps making decisions about Bitcoin units without community coordination. In response, someone else pointed out that it's too late to push for micro-Bitcoin (uBTC) since it would have made normal balances very large. They also argued that milli-Bitcoin (mBTC) is more user-friendly than micro or nano and would be a good fit for software designed for everyday use. The person also suggested that using more than two decimal places violates the Principle Of Least Astonishment for many people and that wallets can choose how much precision to display. Finally, they joked that prices should be denominated in satoshis to avoid surprising users who are used to currencies without fractional components.</summary>
