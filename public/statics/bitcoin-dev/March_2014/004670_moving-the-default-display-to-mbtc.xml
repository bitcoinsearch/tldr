    <summary>In March 2014, a discussion about using milli- and micro- notation for currency units took place among Bitcoin core developers. Mark Friedenbach pointed out that this was not well supported, and suggested using the notation 1 XBT == 1 uBTC instead. This suggestion had previously been made by Tamas and jcorgan on Github, and received support from Jeff Garzik, who is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay.</summary>
