    <summary>The raw transaction API in bitcoind does not take into account sig pushes that increase the fee level of partially signed and multisig transactions. This could lead to issues with app development if not carefully documented. To avoid problems, developers may need to implement a fee loop in their own apps, where they create a transaction with an estimated fee level, add signatures, and submit. If the transaction is rejected for too low fees, they would need to increment and try again until successful.</summary>
