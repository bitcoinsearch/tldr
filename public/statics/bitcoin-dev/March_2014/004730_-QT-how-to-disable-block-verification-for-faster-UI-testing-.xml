    <summary>In an email thread, Angel Leon asked how to avoid database corruption while developing the UI for Bitcoin-Qt. Wladimir replied that he uses various separate Bitcoin data directories and makes copies before doing risky actions. He also uses -regtest to quickly set up test scenarios. Wladimir asked Angel what specifically he was trying to test, and suggested that if he was switching between 0.8.x and 0.9.x with the same directory, he should see the downgrading warning in the README.txt file located at https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/README.txt.</summary>
