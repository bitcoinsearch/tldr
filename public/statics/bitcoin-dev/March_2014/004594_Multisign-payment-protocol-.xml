    <summary>The email thread is discussing the feasibility of using BIP 10 for multisig and coinjoin, which has some deficiencies. The payment protocol may be adapted to handle all the requirements for multisig integration, but it would require a flexible and extensible design. The process for standardizing something is also discussed, which involves implementing an idea, refining it, and then standardizing it. Multisig wallets are currently at step 2 of this process, while the BIP is step 5. The email suggests creating a BIP for payment protocols using multisig, which could aid future usability of multisig wallet implementations. The email is from Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, and includes links to BitPay, Inc., and a free O'Reilly book on Graph Databases.</summary>
