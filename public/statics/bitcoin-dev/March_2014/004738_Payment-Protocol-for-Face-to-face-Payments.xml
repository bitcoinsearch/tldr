    <summary>In an email conversation between Alex Kotenko and Andreas Schildbach, Kotenko expresses his concerns with the lack of coverage for his use case in BIP70. Specifically, he wants to maintain backwards compatibility with wallets not supporting NFC and BIP70 while avoiding the use of external servers. He suggests extending BIP72 to include encoded payment request in the URL directly in a backwards compatible way. Meanwhile, Mike Hearn discusses standardizing the VIEW intent and adding Bluetooth support later if/when encryption/auth are added to the RFCOMM link. Jeff Garzik is listed as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc. A link to BIP 73 is provided.</summary>
