    <summary>In this conversation, Tamas Blummer and Gavin Andresen discuss the Bitcoin payment protocol and its potential limitations. Blummer believes that incremental development is important, but only if it offers benefits compared to current payment processor solutions. He suggests three improvements for the protocol: symmetrical payment options, aggregating and netting for multiple installments, and enhanced security with checks on both payment addresses and refunds. Andresen agrees with the idea of incremental development, but cautions against adding too many features at once and creating insurmountable problems. The conversation also briefly touches on how the current payment protocol handles salaries (it doesn't) and the need to focus on solving existing problems before creating new ones.</summary>
