    <summary>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and an unidentified recipient, Schildbach questions the use of PaymentDetails as a solution to a problem. He argues that none of the fields, other than outputs and network, can be known in advance at the time of initial payment. The recipient suggests that communication between the merchant and buyer would be necessary in cases where a refund is needed after a year or more, noting that people's contact information may change over time. However, the recipient advises against setting a low expiration time for the refund address.</summary>
