    <summary>The proposal suggests counting the number of unused addresses in each account independently instead of using a "gap limit". The topology of the sequence of addresses is of no interest to the user, and users often misinterpret "gap limit" as the "number of unused addresses available". The author further explains their proposal with pictures. Currently, Electrum creates new addresses depending on the address picked by the user which leads to unpredictable behaviour and large gaps in some cases. This proposal aims to have a constant number of unused addresses in each account instead of something that depends on the topology.</summary>
