    <summary>The message highlights the importance of planning and specifying the user experience for fully interoperable "multisig" implementations. The writer suggests avoiding exposing end users to the concept of a key for the feature of a "group account for an organisation," as it may lead to confusion. Instead, the UI should be designed in terms of people with social network integration to avoid setting up profiles. The writer also recommends defining all the rendezvous protocols for interop. CoinVault is using a partially signed transaction format with 0-length placeholders. The writer suggests using placeholders of the expected signature length to avoid miscalculating the fee based on the final size and refers to TransactionSignature.dummy() in the API.</summary>
