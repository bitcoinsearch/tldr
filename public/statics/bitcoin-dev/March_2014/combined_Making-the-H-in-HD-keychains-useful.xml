    <summary>The author of the article discusses the challenges related to the usability of HD keychain wallets from an application development perspective. HD stands for hierarchical, but according to the author, existing implementations are lacking in flexibility and usability. The problem lies in the lack of a clear separation between signing keys and hierarchical nodes. This makes it difficult to allocate keys correctly without creating confusion or chaos. To solve this issue, the author suggests two possible solutions. Firstly, allocating a specific child for hierarchical derivation and the rest for signing keys. Secondly, using a different mechanism for generating a sequence of signing keys from a given node. The latter solution would allow for a clear distinction between organizational hierarchy and signing keys, which is necessary for designing applications that can share these structures without risking confusion.In conclusion, the author argues that until a clear separation is made between signing keys and hierarchical nodes in HD keychains, they will remain underutilized.</summary>
