    <summary>The author of the given context believes that multisig outputs should be used as a tool to build helpful features rather than just being a feature in itself. They suggest creating a protocol, implementation, and BIP for multi-user money pools, dispute mediated transactions, watchdog services, and micropayment channels. The author also mentions that they have already worked on micropayment channels without a BIP. The author concludes that simply focusing on multisig will not work well.</summary>
