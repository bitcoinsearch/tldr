    <summary>After encountering issues with using QR codes for payment requests, Mike Hearn suggests that standardizing Bluetooth support would be a better approach. He recommends adding an encryption/auth layer on top of RFCOMM sockets to authenticate ownership of the Bitcoin key in the address part of the URI. There are two options for the authentication layer: using SSL and requiring signing of the session public key with the Bitcoin key or rolling a custom lightweight protocol using basic ECDH. The latter would need review by individuals familiar with such protocols. Hearn suggests finding a volunteer from the forums who enjoys cryptography to grow the community.</summary>
