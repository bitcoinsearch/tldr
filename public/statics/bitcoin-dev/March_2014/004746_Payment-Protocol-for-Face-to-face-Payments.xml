    <summary>In a conversation between Jeff Garzik and Adam Back, the discussion centered around the practical and convenient size limit for QR codes. Garzik stated that the limit should be under 100 bytes, as larger sizes lead to poor operating conditions in varying light conditions. This was one of the motivations behind BIP 73. Andreas Schildbach brought up the need for an external server with BIP 73, which Garzik acknowledged but noted that internet connectivity is not rare these days. The conversation ended with a mention of a free book about graph databases that can be downloaded.</summary>
