    <summary>James Hartig, a software engineer at Grooveshark.com, reported to Wladimir that his server was terminated after downloading the Linux tar.gz to his OVH box. He attached an email screenshot which claimed that he was attacking 88.198.199.140 over port 443. However, James denied any such attack and mentioned that he didn't even get a chance to compile as the server was terminated right after finishing the download. Wladimir found it unlikely that bitcoind would connect to port 443 and asked if there was anything in debug.log regarding that IP. James is still trying to convince them that he wasn't attacking anyone so they can re-enable the server.</summary>
