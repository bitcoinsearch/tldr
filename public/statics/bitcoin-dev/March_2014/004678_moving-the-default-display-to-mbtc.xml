    <summary>On March 13, 2014, Mike Hearn proposed to add uBTC (microbitcoin) to the next Armory release. However, Alan Reiner cautioned against using the word "consensus" since a few people on a mailing list do not make a consensus. He also pointed out that most wallets had already switched to mBTC (millibitcoin), which may give them a competitive advantage. Alan was not aware of how many wallets had already made the switch to mBTC and said that he was willing to take a leap of faith to help push the "consensus." Despite this, he still planned to make uBTC configurable in the next Armory release, with the default setting being uBTC.</summary>
