    <summary>In this email conversation, Andreas Schildbach and another person are discussing the PaymentDetails field and whether it can be used for refunds. Andreas doesn't see how it can be an answer because most of the fields cannot be known in advance, but the other person suggests that only a few fields such as outputs, time, and expiry_time would be needed. However, Andreas raises concerns about the lack of protection for the refund address and suggests signing it with a key that is also signing the Bitcoin transaction. The other person agrees that tampering should not be possible over HTTPS or Bluetooth, but they also propose the idea of a full-blown PaymentRequest with optional PKI signing for refunds, although normally a seller wouldn't need to know the identity of a buyer for refunds.</summary>
