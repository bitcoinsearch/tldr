    <summary>In a conversation about Host Card Emulation (HCE), Andreas Schildbach explained that HCE offers the required dispatch ability called Application ID (AID). Existing smart cards can contain different payment applications, and the terminal can request one specific application within the card. However, there is no pre-existing infrastructure to support HCE. HCE seems to cover only the payer side, and there is no API for "reader emulation" which they would need for apps to support the payee side. On the reader side, one simply does an IsoDep "connect()" and sends commands with "transceive()". After sending the initial ISO 7816-4 "SELECT APPLICATION" command, which triggers Android HCE routing mechanism to route all following PDUs to your HCE app, anything sent with "transceve()" on the sender side will be received within the HCE application in the "processCommandApdu" method. The only limitation is that there is a strict request/response model where the reader terminal (or the reading phone) sends a request, and the HCE phone sends a response.</summary>
