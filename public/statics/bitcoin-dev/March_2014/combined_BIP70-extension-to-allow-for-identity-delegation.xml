    <summary>The lack of identity delegation in BIP70 is a significant problem for payment processors, as it creates security risks. Mike Hearn proposes a solution in the form of an extended certificate that would be added to the X509Certificates message in the PaymentRequest. This new certificate would be signed by both the SSL cert of the payment processor and their delegated ECDSA key. The proposal also considers alternatives, such as using the User-Agent field or creating the extension certificate as an X.509 cert, but ultimately recommends a unique format to ensure safety. There were concerns about the deployment of this extension, but Hearn argued that it extended and specialized the existing PKI without sacrificing backwards compatibility.The current UI may not be sufficient in alerting users to potential issues with payment processing due to a lack of authenticated fields beyond the memo field available to payment processors. Including the merchant name in the memo field and ensuring that hardware devices or second factor wallets display the memo should suffice for now. One proposed solution is to include a certificate viewer in the UI to allow advanced users to inspect the certificate and potentially find additional fields. However, this solution may only benefit advanced users and may not be feasible due to PKI CA's reluctance to sign certificates with arbitrary data.In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Mike Hearn, Schildbach expresses concerns about the deployment of a new extension, suggesting it is too early to implement it widely. He also asks about the current specification and whether multiple PKIs could be used at once. Hearn replies that the proposal does not allow for multiple PKIs and explains that the extension does not replace the existing PKI but rather specialized and extended it. Dev Random raises concerns about the technical expertise required to perform delegation signature for small businesses or individuals. One solution proposed is for a simple GUI app to be produced that allows them to open CA cert files and produce the ExtendedCert file, which can then be sent to the PP. However, for small businesses without a CA cert, there are no great solutions yet. The idea of having another scheme where a merchant can be name spaced under the payment processor is also discussed, but the question of what exactly the "merchant identifier" means is left unresolved. It is suggested that payment processors become certificate authorities themselves, with BitPay becoming their own CA that doesn't issue SSL certs but rather "local business certs" that contain a verified street address. However, setting up such a scheme requires real work, with questions around how the verification process would work and what it actually means when a payment processor issues a cert containing verified information.</summary>
