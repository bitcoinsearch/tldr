    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Marek expressed his agreement that the 'version' field of bip32 is not necessary and xpriv/xpub should be sufficient for all cases. He added that it is unnecessary to use different BIP32 roots for different altcoins. Marek stated that he uses one xpub for Bitcoin, Testnet, and Litecoin simultaneously. By having the "cointype" distinction in the bip32 path itself, he ensures that he does not reuse the same pubkey across blockchains, which may create privacy issues otherwise. In response to Pavol Rusnak's comment that cointype in path is for separation purposes, not for identification, Pieter Wuille was perplexed and requested an explanation.</summary>
