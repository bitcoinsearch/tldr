    <summary>Addy, a crawler operator, responded to Mike's inquiry about a big drop in reachable nodes on http://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/. Addy explained that the drop was due to restarting the crawler for updates. As a result, the crawler became disconnected from all reachable nodes temporarily causing the drop in reachable nodes. It took approximately 15 minutes or 3 snapshots before the crawler stabilized again. Addy also mentioned that they will consider annotating these drops with a note.</summary>
