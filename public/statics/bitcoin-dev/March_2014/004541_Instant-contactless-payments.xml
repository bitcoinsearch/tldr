    <summary>The email discusses the current use of NFC for Bitcoin transactions with Andreas' Wallet being the only one supporting it. The writer suggests that adding Bitcoin support to London's contactless payment system, Oyster, without hardware replacements would be an ideal solution. They also propose using transaction fees to define a cap on confirmationless payments rather than tying it to external price definitions. The email offers feedback on the actual POS implementation needed and testbase if required. A link to a video demonstrating the current NFC process is provided. The email also mentions the possibility of providing a brief explanation of Oyster cards as some people may not know about them and asks if the recipient has been to London lately where contactless cards are now accepted alongside Oyster cards.</summary>
