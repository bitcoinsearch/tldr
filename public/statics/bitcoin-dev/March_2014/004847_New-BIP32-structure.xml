    <summary>In an email conversation on March 27th, 2014, Thomas Voegtlin discussed plans to increase the number of available unused addresses in the BIP32 version of Electrum. The aim was to set a "gap limit" for accounts, with TREZOR currently using 0, meaning that the scan would stop as soon as it hit the first account with no transaction history. This is indicated by its first X=10 addresses being unused.</summary>
