    <summary>James Hartig, a software engineer at Grooveshark.com, reported that his server was terminated after downloading the Linux tar.gz to his OVH box. The email screenshot he received indicated that he was attacking 88.198.199.140 over port 443. In other news, Gavin Andresen requested users to download and test version 0.9.0rc2 for Bitcoin Core from https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/test/. The new release includes upgraded git dependencies, Windows 64-bit build support, Solaris compatibility fixes, and the ability to check the integrity of gitian input source tarballs. The latest Bitcoin release, version 0.9.0, also includes several changes such as tightened transaction rules to prevent relaying and mining of mutated transactions, dropping support for older Macs, and changes to the build system, RPC, command-line options, block-chain handling and storage, wallet, mining, protocol and network, validation, and build system. The GUI has been improved with the addition of payment request support, an options dialog, a send confirmation dialog with transaction fee display, a total balance on the overview page, and the ability for users to choose a data directory. The update also allows for the saving and restoration of window positions, the addition of a vout index to the transaction ID in transaction details, and a network traffic graph in the debug window. Additionally, there is now Coin Control Features and a receive coins workflow that makes the 'Receive' tab into a form to request payments. The update also adds the ability to move initialization/shutdown to a thread, preventing "not responding" messages during startup. A separate bitcoin-cli client has been added, and Linux users can now use the script (contrib/qos/tc.sh) to limit outgoing bandwidth. Finally, Bitcoin has been rebranded as Bitcoin Core.</summary>
