    <summary>Andreas Schildbach, the creator of Bitcoin Wallet, has written a document detailing the different methods used in the payment protocol for both the old version and BIP70. The document serves as an overview, with plans to delve into further details in separate documents where necessary. The document can be found on the Bitcoin Wallet's GitHub page under Payment Requests. Andreas invites anyone with questions about compatibility to contact him. In 2014, Andreas presented his work on leveraging the payment protocol for face-to-face payments.</summary>
