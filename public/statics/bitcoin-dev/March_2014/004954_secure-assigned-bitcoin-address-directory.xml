    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, vv01f proposed a solution for users to easily find and verify their vanity addresses through a web of trust (WoT). Currently, users sign their own addresses and quote them in forums, but this centralized storage is not secure and messages could be easily swapped with the next hack of the forums. vv01f suggested using PGP keyservers, but this would only work for single vanity addresses. Webfinger was proposed as a potential part of the solution where servers of a business could tell and prove if a specific address is owned by them. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, was also a part of the conversation.</summary>
