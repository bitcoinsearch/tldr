    <summary>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Mike Hearn published on March 2, 2014, Schildbach expressed concerns about the deployment of a new extension. Hearn had proposed the extension, but Schildbach believed it was too early to implement it widely. He also asked about the current specification and whether multiple PKIs could be used at once. Hearn replied that the proposal did not allow for multiple PKIs and explained that the extension did not replace the existing PKI but rather specialized and extended it. He also addressed Schildbach's suggestion that the fix should stay local to X.509 by stating that it would sacrifice backwards compatibility. Finally, Hearn argued that having two signature fields was not a big deal and only affected the X509 parts.</summary>
