    <summary>Tom Geller, a writer/presenter from Oberlin, Ohio, has expressed his gratitude to all who assisted him in getting involved. Mike Hearn contacted Tom and proposed the idea of creating a "Bitcoin Developer Network" subsection on bitcoin.org. Currently, the website is targeted towards consumers and the wiki is undergoing some technical difficulties. The idea is to provide professionally curated web content for developers to learn how to work with Bitcoin. Saivann, a web developer, is available to assist with visual design if individuals are willing to produce content.</summary>
