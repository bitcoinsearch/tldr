    <summary>A discussion is taking place regarding the practicality and convenience of QR code size limitations. The technical limit is understood to be 3 KB, but codes over 1.5 KB are difficult to scan. It is suggested that improvements in scanning technology can allow for larger QR codes. The amount of payment protocol message size attributed to x509 is around 4000 bytes, which leaves substantial room for improvement. Raw ECDSA signed message-based certificates are proposed as an alternative to X.509 certification, which may not be possible via QR codes until specialized Certificate Authorities can issue space-efficient certificates using ECDSA. Bitpay's certificate is provided as an example of a 1.5KB DER format that contains a 2048-bit RSA server key and 2048-bit RSA signatures. However, it is suggested that even 2048-bit RSA is weaker than 256-bit ECDSA.</summary>
