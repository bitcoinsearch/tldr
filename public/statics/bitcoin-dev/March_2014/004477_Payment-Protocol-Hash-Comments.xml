    <summary>On March 2nd, 2014, Jeremy Spilman posted a message on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding SHA-1 support in PHP development. The message referenced BIP70 and discussed the use of SHA-256 and SHA-1 algorithms for hashing payment messages. The message had some minor comments, such as clarifying that the field to be hashed should be 'PaymentRequest' instead of 'Payment' and being more explicit about the hashing process. Furthermore, it questioned the need for SHA-1, which is retiring soon, and whether end-users should have access to details such as pki_type and certificate chains. Although SHA-1 support is there for PHP developers, it is apparent that SHA-2 cannot be used. The discussion brought up the issue of SHA-1's retirement and whether it should even be included in the system. Additionally, there were questions about how specific details should be made available to end-users.</summary>
