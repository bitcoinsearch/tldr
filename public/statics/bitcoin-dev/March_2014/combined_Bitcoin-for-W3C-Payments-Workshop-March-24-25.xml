    <summary>In March 2014, Odinn Cyberguerrilla expressed his disagreement with the proposed use cases for the W3C payments workshop. He cited a requirement to agree to the Web Payments community site in order to join teleconferences and collaborate with others in the web payments group. The agreement includes agreements that inhibit innovation and free thought, such as "agreeing to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements" and numerous other requirements. In response, someone pointed out that all specs created by the W3C are committed to be royalty-free, hence the need for the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) which guarantees all contributions will never be encumbered by patents or charged royalties for.Brent Shambaugh, a Bitcoin enthusiast, has been working on some use cases for the W3C payments workshop, which he wants to include Bitcoin in. He is using a template asking for the name of the solution, key use cases, regions, and currencies. The considerations for use cases include adding real money to the service, buying physical goods in the real world, paying for physical services, converting virtual money back into paper money, transferring money from one person to another, buying products online, resolving disputes, viewing transactions, and securing the wallet. Brent encourages others to contribute to the project and thanks them for their time. He provided a link to an editable wiki page where members of the Web Payments Community Group can submit pull requests, and a template that includes key use cases for the solution and regions and currencies. The use cases can be edited on https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/wiki/WebPaymentsMobileUseCases and submitted as a pull request to https://github.com/w3c-webmob/payments-use-cases.</summary>
