    <summary>In an email thread from March 21, 2014, Andreas Schildbach welcomed Chris D'Costa's access to post on the dev list. D'Costa's project was the Meek hardware wallet and they were working on a solution to avoid MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks when communicating pay-to information over a non-secure transport mechanism. The email also included a promotional message for a free book download on graph databases. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list managed by SourceForge.net.</summary>
