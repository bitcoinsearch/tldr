    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik, CoinVault's use of a partially signed transaction format was discussed. CoinVault had been using 0-length placeholders for missing signatures in the transaction scripts but Hearn suggested using placeholders that are the length of an actual expected signature when forming the transaction. This is because bitcoinj will do so to avoid miscalculating the fee, which is based on the final size. The zero-length placeholder is not new as it is what bitcoind produces and expects by default in a partially signed transaction. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
