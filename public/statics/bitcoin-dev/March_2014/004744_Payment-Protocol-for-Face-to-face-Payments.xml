    <summary>In this conversation between Andreas Schildbach and Alex Kotenko on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, they discuss ways to send Bitcoin payments via NFC or QR code while still being able to use BIP21 URI for backward compatibility. They also explore using Bluetooth in the "r" parameter as an option. Alex expresses concerns about potential QR code capacity, and Andreas suggests Base43 encoding, which he invented in 2011 to be URI compatible with Android intent dispatcher. They also discuss extending BIP72 to include encoded payment request in the URL directly in a backwards compatible way, but Andreas notes that it would be space inefficient. They compare base43 to base64 encoded request in a binary QR code format and discuss its compatibility with existing technologies. Finally, Andreas suggests using binary QR codes instead of alphanumeric QR codes for efficiency.</summary>
