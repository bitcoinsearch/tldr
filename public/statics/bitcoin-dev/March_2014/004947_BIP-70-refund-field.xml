    <summary>On March 28th, 2014, Mike Hearn proposed the addition of a refund field that embeds a PaymentDetails structure to BIP 70 to make refunds easier to implement on phones. The absence of a time limit for when a refund can be received can make it hard for wallets to look out for refunds for payments made years ago. Alternatively, a wallet-specific swapping process could be implemented to solve this problem, but key expiry is fundamental to scalability. The use of stealth addresses with a per-order UUID is proposed as a solution to improve scalability, particularly in the case of refund addresses. By using a single stealth address to scan for payments, refunds can be detected cheaply and checked against a database. A compromise on privacy may be required due to the unexpected drop to 40 bytes for OP_RETURN in the standard.</summary>
