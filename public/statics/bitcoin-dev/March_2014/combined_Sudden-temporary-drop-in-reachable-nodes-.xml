    <summary>On March 25th, between 7:20 pm and 9:35 pm, a significant drop in reachable nodes on http://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/ was observed by an unknown person who sought clarification from Addy, a crawler operator. The person was concerned about whether this was a technical glitch or an actual network event. Addy explained that the drop was due to restarting the crawler for updates, which disconnected it from all reachable nodes temporarily, resulting in the drop in reachable nodes. The crawler took approximately 15 minutes or 3 snapshots before stabilizing again. Addy also mentioned that they will consider annotating these drops with a note. It is unclear from the context whether this was a one-time occurrence or if it has happened before. However, it can be inferred that Addy is responsible for maintaining the crawler and monitoring the network's health. Overall, the context highlights the importance of having reliable monitoring systems in place for blockchain networks, which are vulnerable to various forms of attacks and glitches.</summary>
