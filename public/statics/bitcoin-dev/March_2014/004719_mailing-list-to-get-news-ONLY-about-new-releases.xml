    <summary>In this post, a user is seeking information about a mailing list where they can receive notifications solely related to new releases of the bitcoin-qt client. They have expressed their dissatisfaction with the RSS subscription provided on the official Bitcoin website and requested an alternative option. The user specifically asked if there was a mailing list available for this purpose. Unfortunately, no such mailing list has been mentioned in the post, and the only option for staying updated seems to be the RSS subscription provided on the Bitcoin website.</summary>
