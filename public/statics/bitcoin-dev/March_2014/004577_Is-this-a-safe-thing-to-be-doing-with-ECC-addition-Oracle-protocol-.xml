    <summary>The email thread discusses the security of EC Diffie-Hellman and the importance of well-known, well-studied operations in a good cryptosystem. It is mentioned that EC point addition is invertible which makes it insecure, while EC-scalar multiplication is not, hence why EC Diffie-Hellman is secure even when there is timing asymmetry. Alan Reiner also gives an example of creating a keypair and giving someone minus the public key, which can only be detected after the private key has been abused. To avoid this situation, parties must exchange their public keys before combining them. The email ends with a promotion for Perforce, a version control software.</summary>
