    <summary>In an online conversation that took place on March 29, 2014, Chris Beams reached out to Matt to ask for further elaboration on the use cases for Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Specifically, he wanted to know when this tool would be more effective than using multisig. Chris also questioned whether these approaches complement each other and serve as a defense-in-depth mechanism. He noted that the Motivation and Rationale sections of the BIP were silent on these issues.Matt responded positively to Chris's inquiries and agreed to answer his questions.</summary>
