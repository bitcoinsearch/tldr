    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik on March 12, 2014, the topic of partially signed and multisig transactions within bitcoind was discussed. Hearn asked what happens if filling out the signature pushes the transaction into a higher fee level. In response, Garzik explained that these types of transactions go through the raw transaction API in bitcoind, which does not do anything if the signature pushes the transaction to a higher fee level. Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist who works for BitPay, Inc.</summary>
