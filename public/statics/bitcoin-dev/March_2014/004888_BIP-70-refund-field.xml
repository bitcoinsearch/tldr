    <summary>In an email conversation between Andreas Schildbach and an unidentified person, they discuss implementing a fixed expiry time for warranties in a product specification. Schildbach suggests 2.5 years would be appropriate, allowing for shipping time. However, the other person raises concerns about the amount of RAM needed for a two-year warranty and notes that most warranties result in replacement rather than monetary refunds. Despite this, they both agree that having a fixed time limit in the spec is a good idea, with the option to make it configurable in future protocol versions. The conversation includes a non-text attachment of a cryptographic signature.</summary>
