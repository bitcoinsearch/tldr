    <summary>The context discusses the practicality of using QR codes as a means to encode entire payment requests, with the consensus being that it is not ideal due to limited data capacity and potential issues with X.509 certificates. Instead, the focus should be on standardizing Bluetooth support for submitting transactions and refund addresses, which already requires a backchannel. To ensure security, an encryption and authentication layer would need to be added on top, either using SSL or a custom lightweight protocol. This presents an opportunity to involve the community in developing and reviewing the proposed solution.</summary>
