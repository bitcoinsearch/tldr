    <summary>In an email conversation on 03/12/2014, William Yager discussed the ease of implementing PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 for a group of people, including himself, even on devices with limited RAM. Despite using an aggressive number of rounds (2^16 and 2^21), it can still run reasonably quickly on slow embedded ARM processors. For example, TREZOR, which uses a 120MHz ARM processor, completes 1024 rounds of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 in approximately one second. Based on these numbers, 2^16 would take around one minute, while 2^21 would take roughly half an hour.</summary>
