    <summary>The discussion revolves around the integration of the BIP39 word list into Bitcoinj and its effect on MultiBit HD, as well as a proposed additional check to reduce blockchain search load for SPV clients when restoring wallets. The timestamp used in MultiBit HD is explained as "number of days since midnight of Bitcoin genesis block in UTC with modulo 97 checksum appended," with new seeds generated having "1850/01" as its checksum on January 27, 2014. This method of generating a checksum is specific to MultiBit HD and not related to internal word list checking. The question is raised whether this should be included in the BIP or only implemented if deemed useful by the wider community.</summary>
