    <summary>There is a discussion about the implementation of BIP70 by BitPay or BopShop, which is seen as an easy process that doesn't require much effort. However, the author is not particularly enthusiastic about it, stating that there is no reason to be until the spec goes further than what was previously possible. The conversation then shifts to the potential implementation of BIP70 by Trezor, which would allow for signed payment identities to be presented on the screen through a firmware update. The author questions whether they would support it at that point.</summary>
