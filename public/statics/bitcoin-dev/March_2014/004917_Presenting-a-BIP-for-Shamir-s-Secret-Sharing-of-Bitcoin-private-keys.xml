    <summary>On March 29, 2014, Tamas Blummer proposed the use of Shamir's Secret Sharing to decompose a seed for a BIP32 master key. He suggested adapting the BIP for a length used typically for 16 or 32 bytes and having a magic code to indicate its use as key versus seed. The proposal has been expanded to include BIP32 master seeds of sizes 128, 256, and 512 bits. The updated proposal can be found on Github at https://github.com/whitslack/btctool/blob/bip/bip-xxxx.mediawiki. The most significant change from the previous version is the construction of coefficients of polynomials that were previously SHA-256 digests. They are now SHA-512 digests, modulo a prime number selected based on the size of the secret.</summary>
