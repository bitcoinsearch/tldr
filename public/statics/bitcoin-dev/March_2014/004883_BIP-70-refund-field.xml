    <summary>In an email exchange on March 28, 2014, Mike Hearn questioned whether BOPShop would be supporting BIP70. The response was that supporting BIP70 by BitPay or BopShop is easy since it does not require more than what was previously done without it. The responder stated that they were not opposed to BIP70 but saw no reason to be enthusiastic about it until the specification went further than what was possible before.</summary>
