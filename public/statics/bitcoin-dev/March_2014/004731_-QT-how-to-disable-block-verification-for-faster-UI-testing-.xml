    <summary>The conversation is between Angel Leon and Wladimir regarding database issues and development of the UI. The issue discussed was that when Angel opens the official binary, there is some sort of database corruption which causes Bitcoin-Qt to reindex blocks on disk, a process that can take up to an entire day. Wladimir suggests having separate bitcoin data directories and making copies before doing something risky. He also recommends using -regtest for quickly setting up test scenarios. He also cautions against switching between 0.8.x and 0.9.x with the same directory as it may cause database problems, and provides a link to the downgrading warning. Angel mentions that he is not trying to test anything specifically, just coding, building and launching over and over, and would like to make the startup of the Qt client faster. Angel's Twitter handle is mentioned at the end of the conversation.</summary>
