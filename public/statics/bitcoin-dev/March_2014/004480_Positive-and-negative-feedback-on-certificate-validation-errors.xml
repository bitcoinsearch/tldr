    <summary>In an email conversation on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Wladimir suggested a green stamp watermark for future BIP standard to differentiate signed requests. However, Jeremy Spilman pointed out that for an unsigned payment request there isn't really an "origin" and the best way to differentiate signed requests is by prominently displaying that Merchant string in the green part of the stamp. The rest of the content should be displayed as normal and if there's no cert then all you have is memo. It was suggested that Saivann could do some graphics work for this at some point.</summary>
