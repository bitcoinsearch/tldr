    <summary>In a communication dated March 28, 2014, Tamas Blummer inquired about how the current payment protocol was designed to handle salaries. Gavin Andresen replied that it does not address such issues and suggested that they should walk before running. He recommended addressing the problems with the minimal payment protocol first before attempting to solve everything at once.</summary>
