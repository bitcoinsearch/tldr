    <summary>Andreas Schildbach discussed the limitations of NFC payments on smartphones, stating that the screen must already be on and unlocked for it to be active. However, he noted that future OSes may allow payment apps on the lock screen, just like music players. He also provided an update on Android's host card emulation (HCE) feature, which allows a phone to emulate an ISO-DEP smartcard and process ISO7816-4 APDU commands like a smartcard would do. This feature only works when the display is on but can be used even when the screen is locked by changing the "android:requireDeviceUnlock" setting in the manifest file. Any app that registers itself for HCE and sets its category to CATEGORY_PAYMENT in the manifest will automatically show up in Android's system settings under "Tap &amp; Pay."</summary>
