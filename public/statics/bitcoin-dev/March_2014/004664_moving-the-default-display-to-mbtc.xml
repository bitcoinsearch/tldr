    <summary>In the email thread, Alan Reiner expressed his interest in revisiting the issue of using mBTC, which was also supported by Armory and could be easily implemented. However, it was mentioned that people and software do not handle extra decimal places well, and QuickBooks support without converting any numbers would render mBTC insufficient. Garzik argued that mBTC could pose a security risk since decimal point conversion would have to be performed to support accounting packages limited to two decimal places, which could make auditing more difficult. Shipping with mBTC defaults was deemed unwise since it did not solve existing problems that uBTC could solve, and considering the inevitable switch from mBTC to uBTC.</summary>
