    <summary>In an email exchange on December 3, 2014, William Yager suggested a way to implement semi-trusted devices such as desktop PCs for secure wallet management. The idea was to allow more powerful devices to do the key stretching work without compromising wallet security. However, Pavol Rusnak pointed out that disclosing "preH" to a compromised computer (between steps 4 and 5) would make further steps 5-9 less important. He expressed regret that the spec had only been worked on recently.</summary>
