    <summary>A discussion on bitcointalk revealed that users wanted their vanity addresses to be available for others to find and verify ownership through a web of trust. However, the centralized storage in forums was considered insecure. The idea of using pgp keyservers was suggested but it would only work for single vanity addresses. A solution proposed was integrating OpenPGP into payment protocol, or defining new types of Bitcoin addresses such as stealth addresses to handle privacy issues. BIP70 was also mentioned as a possible solution via certificate authorities. Additionally, a standard for taking X.509 certificates and using them to sign OpenPGP user IDs was being discussed.</summary>
