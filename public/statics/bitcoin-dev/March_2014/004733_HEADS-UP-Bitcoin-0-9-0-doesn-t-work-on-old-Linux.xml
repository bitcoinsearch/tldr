    <summary>On March 19, 2014, a user named Jesus Cea reported an issue after upgrading to Bitcoin 0.9.0. When attempting to run the program, an error message appeared indicating that version `GLIBC_2.15' and `GLIBC_2.14' were required but not found. This issue was later confirmed as a known problem and can be found on Github under issue number 3803. The response from Wladimir did not include a solution to the problem.</summary>
