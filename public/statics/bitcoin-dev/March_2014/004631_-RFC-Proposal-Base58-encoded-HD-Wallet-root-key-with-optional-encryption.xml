    <summary>In an email conversation between Pavol Rusnak and Jean-Paul Kogelman on March 12, 2014, they discussed the differences between BIP 39 and Kogelman's proposal. BIP 39 offers an easy list of words compared to a long string of case-sensitive letters and numbers. However, BIP 39 does not have a genesis date field, password typo detection, and a user-selectable KDF. While BIP 39 only offers one fixed length of entropy, it supports 12/18/24 words. Wallet implementors can use their own word lists in BIP 39, but they are encouraged to use the list provided. The possibility of outsourcing KDF outside of the "standard" breaks much more compatibility than this.</summary>
