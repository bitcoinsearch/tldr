    <summary>In this post, Tom Geller, a non-developer writer with experience in open-source communities, asks for clarification on how he can contribute to the bitcoin community through writing, editing, and marketing. He provides two examples of issues he has encountered while trying to contribute: one regarding proofreading changes for 0.9.0rc2 and another about outdated information on the Bitcoin wiki page for Bitcoin payments.Tom seeks guidance on where to submit his contributions and whom to alert when errors or inaccuracies are found. He welcomes off-list replies and provides his contact information as a writer/presenter who offers services ranging from articles to user guides and books.</summary>
