    <summary>In a discussion between Matt Whitlock and devrandom, the former proposed the use of Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) as a means of securing bitcoin wallets. Although Threshold ECDSA was considered to be a more desirable option, Matt expressed his lack of understanding and the limited information available on it. He suggested SSS as an easily implemented and understood measure that can be used with existing bitcoin software. Devrandom noted that multisig is gaining popularity in the ecosystem and all production wallets can send to P2SH addresses, except for Blockchain.info wallets. This was a significant issue for Matt, who had been working on a Bitcoin project for several months. However, this problem was resolved recently when Blockchain.info merged in his pull request.</summary>
