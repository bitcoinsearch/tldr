    <summary>In a thread started by Mike Hearn on March 26, 2014, the topic of discussion was the cointype and its purpose. The cointype is set to zero for Bitcoin and is there to support altcoins based off the same root seed. While at that time, nobody seemed very bothered about altcoins, sometimes feature requests were made.However, Pavol Rusnak chimed in and pointed out that there is one altcoin that is still pretty important today - Testnet. This suggests that even though altcoins may not have been a priority back then, they have become more relevant over time.</summary>
