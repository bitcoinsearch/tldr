    <summary>The email thread is between Gavin Andresen and Drak regarding the need for a protocol to enable different wallet implementations to participate in multisig transactions. Andresen suggests the establishment of multisig wallets of various sorts, which require protocols for contribution of keys by all participants. He also suggests the use of HD wallets, assuming that each party uses them, to simplify things. Furthermore, there should be protocols for gathering signatures for a multisig spend, which is where the payment protocol is useful. PaymentRequest message should be passed around so all participants know what is being paid for, and maybe a partially-signed Payment message is where the signatures are gathered. There might also be a need for a protocol for "I don't want to be part of this multisig anymore/I lost control of my private key don't trust me in this multisig anymore".</summary>
