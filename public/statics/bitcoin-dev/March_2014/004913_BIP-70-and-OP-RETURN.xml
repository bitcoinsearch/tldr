    <summary>In this context, Mike Hearn is discussing the encoding of OP_RETURN scripts into Output structures. He seems unsure about the question asked, which appears to answer itself in the first paragraph. The question at hand concerns whether all BIP70-compatible clients will support the creation of standard output types, including OP_RETURN outputs. The message ends with a note advocating for online privacy through email encryption and a link to learn how to do so. Attached are two non-text files, one being an application/pgp-keys file and the other being an application/pgp-signature file.</summary>
