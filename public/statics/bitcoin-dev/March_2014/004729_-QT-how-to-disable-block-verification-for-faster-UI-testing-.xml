    <summary>When developing a user interface for Bitcoin-Qt, it's important to consider the -checklevel parameter in the command line options. Passing 0 assumes little to no verification, which can lead to database corruption and the need to reindex blocks on disk, a process that can take an entire day. This has happened multiple times when opening the official binary for non-development use. The question is posed to others in the development community as to how they avoid these issues while still developing the UI. The context was posted by Angel on Twitter at @gubatron.</summary>
