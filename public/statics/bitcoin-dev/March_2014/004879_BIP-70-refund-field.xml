    <summary>In an email conversation from March 28, 2014, Gavin Andresen and Tamas Blummer discuss the current payment protocol in regards to handling salaries. Gavin states that the protocol doesn't handle salaries, and suggests focusing on the minimal payment protocol they have now before trying to solve everything at once. However, there is a proposal for recurring payments from the KillBill folks that BitPay has yet to review. Tamas suggests moving ahead with that candidate extension since BitPay seems to be lagging behind in their review.</summary>
