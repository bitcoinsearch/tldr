    <summary>The email conversation from March 25, 2014 between Ricardo Filipe, Peter Todd and Gavin Andresen revolves around the scalability of Bitcoin. Peter Todd argues that Bitcoin doesn't scale due to issues in updating the state of the UTXO set, which requires bandwidth equal to all transaction volume. This leads to O(n^2) scaling, making it infeasible. Gavin Andresen disagrees, citing Satoshi's original thoughts on scaling which envisioned tens of thousands of mining nodes and hundreds of millions of lightweight SPV users. However, Peter Todd points out that there are currently only a few pools of miners due to salary considerations. Ricardo Filipe believes this is a fundamental disagreement, but suggests tree chains could help decentralization. The conversation ends with an agreement to either disagree or focus on moderating the list for sensible discussions.</summary>
