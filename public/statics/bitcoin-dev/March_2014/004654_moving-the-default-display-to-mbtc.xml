    <summary>The discussion is about the unit of measurement used for Bitcoin, with some advocating for the use of millibitcoin (mBTC) and others preferring microbitcoin (uBTC). There seems to be no clear consensus on which unit to use, and some believe that multiple unit changes negatively impact users. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, suggests that BitPay should also use mBTC. However, he acknowledges that a massive adoption of Bitcoin isn't ready yet, making it highly optimistic to assume another 1000x shift anytime soon. Wladimir, another developer, has given up getting any consensus about this or even getting people to care. He notes that everyone agrees that a decimal shift would be good, but nothing happens in the end. Andreas made the change to mBTC because people in the community are familiar with it and it seems to be catching on. Moving to muBTC would require more coordinated education effort.</summary>
