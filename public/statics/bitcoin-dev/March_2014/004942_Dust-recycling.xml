    <summary>In a discussion on 03/29/2014 at 08:05 PM, Gregory Maxwell suggested using "dust-b-gone" to make it someone else's problem to get relayed. However, this solution was deemed sub-optimal as it introduces a third party and could cause issues if their server goes down. It was then proposed that a universal solution would be preferable. The email also included a call to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and a link to learn how to do so. The email included two attachments, one being an application/pgp-keys file and the other an application/pgp-signature.</summary>
