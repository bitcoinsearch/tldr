    <summary>In a conversation dated March 5th, 2014 at 4:21:52 PM, Kevin asked about how to patch an issue with Bitcoin. However, Luke clarified that there was no need to do so as it was not actually an issue for Bitcoin. He explained that when public keys are properly used, there is only ever one signature per public key.</summary>
