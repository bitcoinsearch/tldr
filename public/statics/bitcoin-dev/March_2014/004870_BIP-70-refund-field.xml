    <summary>The current payment protocol has a narrow scope and does not fit the concept of business relationships. It is suggested that a new protocol be implemented that focuses on this idea rather than individual requests to escape the complexity of addresses. The problem with using PaymentDetails as an answer is that none of the fields can be known in advance, aside from outputs and network. If communication between merchants and buyers is established, refunds can be processed if necessary. However, it should not be accepted to set a low expiration time for refund addresses.</summary>
