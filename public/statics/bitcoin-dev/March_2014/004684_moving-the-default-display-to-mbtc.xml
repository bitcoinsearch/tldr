    <summary>In this conversation, Mike Hearn and the other participant are discussing the use of sub-satoshi denominations in Bitcoin. Mike suggests that a hardfork is not necessary anytime soon, but the other participant argues that future price assumptions should not be made when making decisions about denomination changes. The discussion then turns to the popularity of mBTC and micros, with the other participant arguing that the popularity of mBTC is an ad populum fallacy. However, they acknowledge that the current adoption of mBTC by some wallets and services is a valid argument for its continued use. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when making decisions about Bitcoin denominations.</summary>
