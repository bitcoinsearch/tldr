    <summary>The email exchange between Mark Friedenbach and Gregory Maxwell discusses the potential of two-way atomic chain transfers and the issues that come with them. Friedenbach argues that the re-org issue is handled in the 2-way pegging scheme while Maxwell suggests that it could be problematic for secondary coins to become unbacked, leading to inflation. They also discuss the merge-mining of pegged chains, which could lead to attacks on the pegging pool. Friedenbach proposes the idea of tree-chains reducing dependence on miner validation. In the tree-chain model, every single chain is an altcoin.</summary>
