    <summary>Jean-Paul Kogelman, on 3rd of December 2014 at 04:17 AM, wrote about the updates made in the spec after incorporating the requested features. The Scrypt dependency that was present in initial drafts has been removed and new key derivation functions (KDFs) have been added along with plausible deniability. A reference implementation has also been made available. He further enquires if the recipient is aware of BIP-0039, which is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal related to mnemonic code or seed phrases for creating deterministic wallets. The link to this proposal is shared in the email signature.</summary>
