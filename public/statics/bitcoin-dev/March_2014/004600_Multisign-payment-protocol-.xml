    <summary>The conversation started with a statement about wallets being unable to assume remote parties have an HD wallet, which could be invalidating the assumption that each party uses HD logic. Jeff Garzik liked the idea of assuming each party uses HD wallets but Gavin Andresen pointed out that it assumes a different reality from the current one. He suggested that multisig wallets are a different reality and when we move towards it, we should do it correctly from the beginning. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
