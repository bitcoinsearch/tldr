    <summary>On March 27th, 2014, Marek Palatinus raised two concerns regarding Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that needed to be addressed. The first concern was related to the gap factor for addresses. Although some software can watch an unlimited amount of unused addresses, it is a serious issue for lightweight or server-based wallets such as Electrum or myTREZOR. Currently, myTREZOR uses a gap factor of 10, which is generally suitable for most users. In response, Thomas suggested increasing the number of available unused addresses to 10 or 20 in the BIP32 version of Electrum.Another idea proposed by Marek Palatinus was to get rid of the topology and count only the number of unused addresses since the beginning of the sequence instead of using a "gap limit." The topology of the address sequence is of no interest to the user, and users often misinterpret the "gap limit" as the "number of unused addresses available." By providing users with the exact number of unused addresses, it would be easier to understand and make things more predictable because the wallet would always display the same number of available unused addresses (except when waiting for confirmations). This proposal aimed to simplify the process for users and improve their experience with Bitcoin wallets.</summary>
