    <summary>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Peter Todd on March 25, 2014, Todd argued that Bitcoin doesn't scale due to the bandwidth required to update the state of the UTXO set when creating a block. He claimed that this results in O(n^2) scaling, which is not feasible. However, Andresen disagreed with Todd's assessment, citing Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin to have tens of thousands of mining nodes and hundreds of millions of lightweight SPV users. In response, Todd provided links to evidence, such as the distribution of mining pools, to support his argument. Todd also challenged Andresen to consider solutions like tree-chains and Andrew Miller's non-outsourcable puzzles to improve decentralization.</summary>
