    <summary>In an email exchange between Jean-Paul Kogelman and Pavol Rusnak, Jean-Paul expressed concerns about users not being notified of password errors when using a cryptocurrency wallet. Upon entering a password with a typo, the user is presented with a wallet balance of 0 after the blockchain has been scanned. Jean-Paul stated that this is not the kind of experience he would want to present to his users. Pavol responded by saying that it's not possible to have both plausible deniability and typo checking at the same time. He also mentioned that optional outsourcing of the KDF (Key Derivation Function) could break compatibility between different clients because developers may use different algorithms.</summary>
