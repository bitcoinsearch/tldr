    <summary>In an email exchange between Jeff Garzik and Drak on March 11, 2014, the idea of assuming that each party uses HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallets is discussed. Drak expresses liking the idea, as it would simplify things greatly. However, Garzik points out that this assumption is based on a different reality from our current one. Garzik suggests that when transitioning to multisig wallets, which are a different reality from our current one, it is important to do it correctly from the beginning. The email exchange ends with Gavin Andrese's signature.</summary>
