    <summary>In an email exchange in March 2014, Mike Hearn discussed calculating the size of a transaction in advance based on the initial transaction size and number of required signatures. He noted that assuming each signature to be placed in the transaction is 73 bytes is not difficult. However, if the transaction does not contain a 73-byte sentinel value, it may be harder to ensure that this part was done correctly. Multisig signing is an example of untrusted input from an adversary, so it's better to handle it correctly rather than trying to make it easier. This may include internally converting every not-yet-signed dummy signature into a 73 byte pushdata prior to calculating the size.</summary>
