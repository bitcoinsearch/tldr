    <summary>In an email exchange discussing the functionality of secret sharing software (SSSS), Matt Whitlock and Alan Reiner debate whether omitting parameters from shares is beneficial. Whitlock argues that including minimum subset size information would provide too much information to an adversary, while Reiner believes that obfuscating information makes it difficult for users to understand what they are working with. Reiner contends that failing silently when given incorrect shares or an insufficient number of shares is problematic, because users may make backups of wallets without correctly remembering the M-parameter. The threshold is also omitted from SSSS shares, which can lead to incompatibility issues and insecure distribution of fragments. Reiner does not see a benefit in adding complexity for the sake of obfuscation, as attackers will have limited access to other fragments.</summary>
