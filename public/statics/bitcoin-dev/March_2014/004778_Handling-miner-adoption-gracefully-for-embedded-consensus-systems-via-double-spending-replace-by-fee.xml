    <summary>The email thread discusses the recent attention on proof-of-publication, focusing on the reduction of OP_RETURN length prior to the 0.9 release to 40 bytes. Peter Todd highlights a security flaw in that OP_CHECKMULTISIG sigops weren't taken into account, which can potentially bloat mempools and make transactions unminable. He suggests ditching bare OP_CHECKMULTISIG outputs, which would require changes and currently only affects Counterparty. Troy Benjegerdes proposes a new coin with an explicit 'data' field of 169 bytes, adding 1 byte to each transaction if unused and providing a small but usable data field for proof of publication. This system may prove more reliable than various hacks to overcome the 40-byte limit in Bitcoin. The email concludes by encouraging the Bitcoin 1% to evaluate the market risk they face from the 40-byte limit and consider implementing some of Todd's proposed alternatives.</summary>
