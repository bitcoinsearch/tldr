    <summary>In this discussion, Dev Random, Matt Whitlock, and Watson Ladd are discussing the security of Bitcoin wallets. They reference an article on freedom-to-tinker.com which discusses new research on better wallet security for Bitcoin. However, Matt Whitlock notes that the article references an ACM paper for which no URL is provided. They then discuss the idea of threshold ECDSA, which has better security properties than splitting up a single seed. Dev Random suggests using Shamir Secret Sharing as a measure that can be easily implemented without changes to existing Bitcoin software. The discussion also raises questions about whether threshold ECDSA can work with BIP32, and if BIPs are being developed for it.</summary>
