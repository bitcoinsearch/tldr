    <summary>The use of multisig is orthogonal to the payment protocol and requires its own set of protocols for establishing multisig wallets, gathering signatures for a multisig spend, and leaving a multisig wallet. The establishment of multisig wallets would involve a protocol wherein all participants contribute keys using BIP32 HD public keys so that privacy is ensured from the beginning. Multi-person shared wallets, escrows, and "wallet protection service" wallets would require slightly different protocols. Gathering signatures for a multisig spend could utilize the PaymentRequest message passed around via the payment protocol. A partially-signed Payment message may be where the signatures are gathered or signatures may be sent separately and submitted by one participant to create and submit the Payment and get the PaymentACK. A UI mock-up was provided for the multi-person-spend case. Finally, there may be a need for a protocol for leaving a multisig wallet.</summary>
