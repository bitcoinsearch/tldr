    <summary>In 2013, Bitcoin Wallet moved to mBTC, which was not the expected uBTC. This move could result in additional user confusion if they have to transition to yet another decimal place. Wendell had suggested moving to uBTC after the fee system is improved and was waiting for the signal to do so. Jeff Garzik suggested going straight to uBTC as humans and existing computer systems handle numbers to the left of decimals well, unlike QuickBooks which has trouble with more than three decimal places; he also introduced himself as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc.</summary>
