    <summary>In this context, the discussion is primarily about BIP 70 compliance with regards to Bitcoin Core and Android Bitcoin Wallet. The conversation begins with a statement that if clients are not spec compliant, they should be. However, the specific functionality of BIP 70 is unclear. Currently, only Bitcoin Core and Android Bitcoin Wallet implement BIP 70. The suggestion is made to create a request and test it out to see what happens.A question is posed regarding whether all BIP 70 compatible clients support the creation of all standard output types, including OP_RETURN outputs. The conversation ends with a call to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible, with a link provided for further information.</summary>
