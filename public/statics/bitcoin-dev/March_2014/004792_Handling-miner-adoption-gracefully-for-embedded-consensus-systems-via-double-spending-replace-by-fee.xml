    <summary>The discussion over chain parameters in the context of distributed systems development versus bitcoin development is a topic of debate. However, Troy Benjegerdes finds it irresponsible for Bitcoiners to claim any discussion about alternate chains as off-topic. He believes that if bitcoin-core is for distributed systems, then all the different altcoins with different hash algorithms should be viable topics for discussion. Nonetheless, this kind of discussion does not belong here, as it is not related to distributed-systems-development but instead to bitcoin-development.</summary>
