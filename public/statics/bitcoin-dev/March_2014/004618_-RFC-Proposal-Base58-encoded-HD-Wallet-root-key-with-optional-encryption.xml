    <summary>In an email exchange between Jean-Paul Kogelman and Pavol Rusnak, Kogelman announced updates to a spec that included removing Scrypt dependency, adding new KDFs, and plausible deniability. Rusnak asked if Kogelman was aware of BIP-0039, which offers an easy list of words as opposed to a string of case sensitive letters and numbers, only offers one fixed length of entropy, doesn't have a genesis date field, lacks password typo detection, doesn't have a user selectable KDF, can't outsource the KDF computation to a third party, and allows wallet implementers to use their own word lists, breaking cross wallet compatibility.</summary>
