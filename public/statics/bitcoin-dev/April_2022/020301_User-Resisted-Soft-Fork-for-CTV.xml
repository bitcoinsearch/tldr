    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing a controversial soft fork proposal for the upcoming Consensus TimeLock (CTV) upgrade. The proposal has been met with opposition, and some members are preparing for a User Resisted Soft Fork (URSF) in case the miner signaling threshold for CTV is reached but the community wants to prevent the soft fork from activating. Bitcoin Core 23.0 release candidate does not include any CTV code or activation code, so if a miner runs this out of the box, it will not signal for CTV. Michael Folkson has set up a ##ursf channel on Libera IRC to monitor developments and discuss working on an additional release that may ultimately reject blocks that signal for CTV. The controversy stems from concerns about Jeremy Rubin's involvement and the rushed nature of the proposal, causing caution and conservatism to be thrown out the window.</summary>
