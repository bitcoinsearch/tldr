    <summary>In a recent message, Robin challenged Michael's proposal to build use cases of CTV and compare it with other proposals for covenants. Robin asked Michael if he had any writeups or strong reasons to favour a different proposal, and whether he had written any code in this regard. Robin compared Michael's complaints about CTV activation to Jeremy's work on the BIP, implementation, explanation of use cases, speaking at conferences, organising workshops, and building the Sapio framework for community experimentation with covenants. Robin pointed out that Jeremy even offers bug bounties for any security flaws in the code. Robin argued that Michael's framing of Jeremy's contributions as "immature" is disrespectful to all the work he put into BIP-119. Robin also questioned why anyone should wait for someone else to do what Michael thinks is ideal. Robin suggested that bike shedding is just as big of an issue as "contentious soft forks", and pointless activation drama is a huge issue in bitcoin protocol development because it is so draining. Robin concluded by encouraging Michael to work on what he thinks is the right path forward instead of criticising Jeremy for progressing with his excellent work.</summary>
