    <summary>In the context, darosior requested people's opinion on whether BIP118 should be done before or in place of BIP119. While some agree with this proposal, it may not be possible to prioritize one over the other due to limited reviewer time. Richard, however, prioritizes eltoo and focuses on BIP-118. He explains that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT can emulate CTV if its "ANYONECANPAY" behavior is made optional. Additionally, he suggests that ANYONECANPAY could be paired with APO-AS for eltoo commit transactions, but settlement transactions in eltoo use just APO and do not necessarily need to be paired with ANYONECANPAY. Richard also proposes including SIGHASH_GROUP with APO for eltoo to allow the counter-party who commits a settlement tx to use for fees their settled to_self balance. Finally, Richard believes that other reviewers looking at different protocols than eltoo would benefit the BIP-118 proposal.</summary>
