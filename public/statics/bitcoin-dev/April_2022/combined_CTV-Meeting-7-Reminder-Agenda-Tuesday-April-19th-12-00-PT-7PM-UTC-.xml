    <summary>The 7th meeting of the developers has been postponed to the time of the 8th meeting due to scheduling conflicts with the Miami conference. The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at noon Pacific time and will discuss the possibility of activating CTV in 2022. An open discussion will be held on topics such as why they may or may not wish to activate CTV, what would need to be done if they did want to activate it, and what the path might look like if they decide not to activate it. Written thoughts will be published ahead of the meeting for reference. If anyone is unable to attend, they can leave a comment in response below and it will be referenced in the minutes of the meeting.</summary>
