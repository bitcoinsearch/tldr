    <summary>In an email exchange between Billy Tetrud and others, the issue of hot key theft in vault proposals was discussed. Tetrud proposed an alternative solution to the problem, the OP_BEFOREBLOCKVERIFY opcode, which would automatically swap control of UTXOs to the intended recipient after a timeout. The MES vault proposal commits to the destination address during unvaulting by using CheckOutputVerify, while another paper implemented the MES vault in Elements using CAT and CHECKSIGFROMSTACK. However, with such a significant security caveat, CTV vaults are not seen as a compelling example of using CTV, and there is still ongoing research on covenant design. The conversation ends with several questions about building secure vaults using CTV and other methods.</summary>
