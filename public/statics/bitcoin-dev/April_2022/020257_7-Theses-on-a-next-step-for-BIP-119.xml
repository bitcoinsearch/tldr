    <summary>Michael Folkson, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, has expressed his opposition to the activation of a CTV soft fork in the near term and called for others to do the same. He argues that attempting to activate the fork could cause uncertainty, confusion, and disruption, which would make future consensus-based soft forks difficult to implement. Folkson also points out that many individuals on a list of those opposed to CTV are not actually against it, while others lack technical details to support their opposition. Additionally, he warns against attacking developers who propose improvements and write code, as well as against using opposition to change as a way to undermine open-source projects. Finally, he suggests that those who oppose the CTV activation attempt should voice their opposition, run full node software that doesn't include CTV and its activation code, and consider joining a UASF-style effort to resist the activation attempt if necessary.</summary>
