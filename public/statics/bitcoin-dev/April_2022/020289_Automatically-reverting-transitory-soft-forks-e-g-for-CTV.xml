    <summary>The email conversation between David A. Harding and Matt Corallo discusses the challenges of developing covenants in Bitcoin that would best serve the needs of users with varying opinions. While it is difficult to assign objective weights to different aspects of covenant design, looking at what real Bitcoin users pay for could help reconcile differences in opinion. However, getting good data for this kind of question requires more than five years as deploying nontrivial things in Bitcoin takes a long time. The risk of doing a fork in Bitcoin is also discussed, highlighting the challenges that come with it, such as people threatening to run a fork-causing client or some miners not validating blocks resulting in a fork, among other risks. Ultimately, exploring design tradeoffs and utility for different covenants classes remains crucial in finding the most suitable designs.</summary>
