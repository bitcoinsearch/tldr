    <summary>Michael Folkson, a member of the Bitcoin community, expressed his opposition to a potential User Resisted Soft Fork (URSF) in response to a proposed Soft Fork for CheckTemplateVerify (CTV). In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Folkson stated that the proposed URSF was unnecessary and inconsistent with the ideals of personal freedom and private agreements. He argued that the rejection of a soft fork through a consensus change would be more invasive than CTV's activation process. Folkson also challenged the claim that the community opposes the activation of CTV, stating that endorsements for the proposal far outnumbered those who opposed it. He criticized the notion that a small group of people could block changes that have no impact on them and suggested that finding ways to activate non-invasive changes should be everyone's goal. Folkson concluded by stating that expressing uncertainty over whether CTV is the best option is not persuasive enough to resist its activation.In his email, Folkson responded to Michael Rubin's announcement of the Speedy Trial signaling period for the CTV soft fork, which he felt was rushed and lacked caution and conservatism. Folkson suggested that it was prudent to prepare for an eventuality where the miner signaling threshold might be reached but the community wants to prevent the attempted soft fork from activating. To this end, he proposed the creation of an additional release that may ultimately reject blocks that signal for CTV. Folkson highlighted that running a Bitcoin Core release will not signal for a CTV soft fork out of the box and that rejecting all blocks during the lock-in period or all blocks that include OP_CTV in the script would be a forceful/invasive consensus change. He further emphasized that resisting CTV via an escalating soft fork is not conservatism or apathy, but fundamental opposition.</summary>
