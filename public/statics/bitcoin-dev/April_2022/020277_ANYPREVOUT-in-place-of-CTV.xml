    <title>ANYPREVOUT in place of CTV</title>

    <summary>The sender of the email is looking for a working implementation of APO to try out some proposed use cases, such as eltoo and covenants. They haven't seen much in the way of APO implementations recently but would appreciate any links. The email then switches to a discussion about implementing a tweaked version of BIP118 instead of or before BIP119. The author argues that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT presents proven and implemented use cases that are more widely accepted than CTV's. They suggest that APO-AS covenants can emulate CTV just fine and cover the use case for vaults. The author believes that BIP118 could benefit more Bitcoin users given the interest in and demand for simple covenants and better off-chain protocols. The email includes several links for further reading on the topic.</summary>
