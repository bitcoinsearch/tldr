    <summary>In a mailing list, TheBlueMatt raised concern on discussing specific covenant designs to move forward with, as there are several drafts available without actual implementations or sample usages. A suggestion was made to fix this issue in the short-term, rather than using it as an argument for or against something in the long-term. However, it is unclear how this can be fixed and whether there is any consensus or alternative solutions proposed. The email was sent using ProtonMail secure email.</summary>
