    <summary>Darosior suggests a tweaked version of BIP118 before doing BIP119. Richard agrees with it and thinks that both proposals compete for scarce reviewer time. Darosior also mentions that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT can emulate CTV just fine if its "ANYONECANPAY" behavior is made optional. Richard asks why is it necessary to make ANYONECANPAY optional to emulate CTV and if there is a write-up explaining how APO-AS without ANYONECANPAY approximates CTV. Darosior replies that he is not aware of any specific to CTV but the fields covered in the CTV hash are close to what APO-AS covers, committing only to the number of inputs and hash of inputs' sequences. To fully emulate CTV, it should be optional. Richard wonders if there is another way to make ANYONECANPAY default for APO-AS. He also suggests including SIGHASH_GROUP with APO for eltoo. The BIP-118 proposal could benefit from input from reviewers looking at other protocols than eltoo.</summary>
