    <summary>There is a contentious CTV soft fork activation attempt in Bitcoin, and the latest news suggests that Speedy Trial miner signaling for the soft fork will no longer start on May 5th as previously communicated and may now instead start around August 1st 2022. Michael Folkson is skeptical that this soft fork activation attempt will obtain community consensus and will no longer be contentious in the next three months, and if it doesn't, he suspects we'll be in the same situation with a URSF effort required 2-3 months down the line. There is concern that people don't have the time to follow Bitcoin drama 24/7 and hence struggle to separate noise from signal. Michael Folkson has asked them to pay attention so they can make an informed view on what to run and what to support. He recommends relying on the status quo and tried and trusted i.e., Bitcoin Core, when in doubt, and alternative releases such as those seeking to attempt to activate CTV or indeed those seeking to resist the activation of CTV should only be considered if users are informed about exactly what they are running. Jeremy Rubin replied to a thread on the mailing list regarding the proposed alternative path, stating that it was offered up for discussion to a public working group for feedback as a potential plan and not a committed plan. He said that the reason there was no mailing list post about it was that it did not get enough buy-in from those iterating, and he wanted to be sure a follow-up plan carried some buy before wider dissemination. Rubin also suggested that readers read Michael Folkson's personal blog post from April 17th, which stated that software builds for a CTV Bitcoin Client for all platforms would be available within a week from that date. Michael Folkson replied to Rubin, saying that he saw Rubin's personal blog post and replied to it, and that Rubin inaccurately informed the list on something no one has communicated committed intent for. He criticized Rubin's approach to potential chain splits and called them stunts. Folkson recommended that Rubin do these stunts on a different blockchain if he continued with them.</summary>
