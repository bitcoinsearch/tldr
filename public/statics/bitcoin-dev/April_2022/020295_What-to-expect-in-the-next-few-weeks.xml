    <summary>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson warned about a potential "messy" situation in the coming weeks regarding Bitcoin's consensus rules. He urged people to pay attention and make informed decisions about what to run and support. Folkson also noted that those who were around in 2015-2017 will know what to expect and that the right outcome endured in 2017. However, he cautioned against blindly trusting authorities, as this goes against the bitcoin ethos and could harm the community. Folkson also expressed concern that information may be withheld until the last minute and that some parties may seek to take advantage of a contentious soft fork activation attempt. He recommended relying on the tried and trusted status quo, such as Bitcoin Core, and only considering alternative releases if well-informed. Folkson invited those interested in resisting the contentious soft fork activation attempt of CTV to join ##ursf on Libera IRC.</summary>
