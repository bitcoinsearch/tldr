    <summary>Tim Ruffing, Elliott Jin, and another individual have collaborated to create a MuSig2 BIP proposal. The proposal is compatible with BIP340 public keys and signatures, supports tweaking, and allows for deriving BIP32 child keys from aggregate keys. Additionally, the proposal enables creating BIP341 Taproot outputs with key and script paths. Interested parties can review the draft on Github, where they will find comprehensive information about the proposal. The team has tested the proposal and written a reference implementation in python. However, it is important to note that the proposal is still a draft, and minor tweaks may be necessary to the algorithms and test vectors before implementation.</summary>
