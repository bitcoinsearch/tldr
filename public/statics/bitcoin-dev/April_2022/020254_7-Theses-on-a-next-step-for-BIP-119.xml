    <summary>In an email thread, Michael Folkson via bitcoin-dev raised the question of what would happen if 90% of miners did not signal for the proposed Speedy Trial activation attempt. In response, Zac pointed out that miners do not have the mandate to decide the fate of softforks. Once a softfork has been merged, it already has consensus and must be activated by miners eventually. The various activation methods exist to ensure miners cannot sabotage a softfork that has consensus. The way Michael phrased his question made it sound like miners have any say over softforks, which is not the case.</summary>
