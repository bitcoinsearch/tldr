    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tobin Harding sought help with parsing the extended private key seed found in the BIP174 test vector. He explained that he was implementing the test vector PSBT workflow in Rust and had everything working except for the ability to create the extended private key from the seed. The BIP174 specification and the specific section of the workflow where the seed was needed were provided by Harding along with the xpriv and seed values from the test vector for reference. However, despite trying to decode the seed as both base64 and base58, Harding was still unable to create the extended private key from the seed.Achow101 replied to the email thread and explained to Tobin that the seed is encoded as a WIF private key and decoding it will result in a 32 byte seed which can be used as specified in BIP 32. Tobin expressed surprise at not being able to recognize the WIF private key from the 52 characters and asked why the seed isn't just the 32 bytes of seed data.It is worth noting that the BIP174 specification and test vectors can be found on GitHub and the PSBT workflow starts at a specific line. Despite the challenges faced by Tobin, the discussion on the mailing list has provided valuable information on how to properly parse the extended private key seed and implement the test vector PSBT workflow in Rust.</summary>
