    <summary>The author of the message is seeking help with parsing the extended private key seed found in the BIP174 test vector. They have been working on implementing the test vector PSBT workflow in Rust and everything is working except for the ability to create the extended private key from the seed. The BIP174 specification and test vectors can be found on GitHub and the PSBT workflow starts at a specific line. The author has provided both the xpriv and seed that they are working with, but they have been unable to use the seed to create the extended private key. They have tried decoding it as both base64 and base58, but still haven't had any success.</summary>
