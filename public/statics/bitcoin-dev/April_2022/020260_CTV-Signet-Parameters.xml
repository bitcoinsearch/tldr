    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin responds to Russell O'Connor's skepticism of bare-CTV in BIP-119. Rubin explains that while there are situations where committing to outputs early during high-fee times and completing the transaction later during low-fee times can result in lower fees, this advanced commitment may cause more block space to be used overall. However, Rubin also provides examples where CTV uses less space, such as when batching transactions for sets of customers at different fee priority levels or when needing to pay top-of-mempool rate for the soonest confirmation possible. Additionally, he notes that a bare-CTV can be used to delay a "trigger"-transaction, but it currently does not support any co-signing ability and is unaddressable. Nonetheless, Rubin suggests that even if bare-CTV were removed from the spec, CTV in Segwitv0 would still exist.</summary>
