    <summary>The author of the message suggests that there has been confusion between Bitcoin vaults and covenants. They argue that CTV is useful for Bitcoin vaults, as it can pre-commit to a Cancel transaction directly in the Unvault Script, thus reducing interactivity and simplifying fee bumping. However, the author believes that CTV alone is not sufficient as it cannot be used to receive coins on a single-sig script with a vaulting step in a single-party situation. The author proposes using something like TLUV with IN_OUT_AMOUNT instead. The author acknowledges that committing entirely to withdrawal amounts in advance is very impractical and poses a significant user experience barrier. They suggest that users do not think in coins but in amounts to transfer. Thus, the current implementation(s) of Bitcoin vaults face this problem, which CTV does not solve. The author suggests that new applications leveraging ANYPREVOUT could be deployed instead. Finally, the author notes that while CTV is useful, they doubt it is necessary nor sufficient for practical vaults. They believe that APO-AS covenants cover this use case and are more widely accepted than CTV's. The author proposes that BIP118 is a soft fork candidate that could benefit most Bitcoin users, as it enables CTV's features. In summary, the author provides suggestions for differentiating the concepts of Bitcoin vaults and covenants and proposes alternative solutions to address the limitations of CTV for practical vaults.</summary>
