    <summary>The concept of rationality and the idea that "two people are perfectly rational and start from the same information, they will agree" is challenged by Zman, who argues that rationality is subjective and depends on individual goals. However, if individuals consider a specific goal and given facts, they can still reach the same conclusion. The importance of establishing a consensus around goals is highlighted, and the use of a future market is suggested as a way to understand the goals of individuals without them having to reveal their actual goals. It is noted that irrationalities embedded in the design of the human mind will still be difficult to break, and an uninformed market may behave randomly.</summary>
