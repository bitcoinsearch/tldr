    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Keagan McClelland asked about the process by which nodes decide which blocks to orphan when only some of them have to signal and others don't. The response from aj clarified that in this semi-mandatory signaling system, only "threshold" blocks must signal, so if only a small percentage of miners aren't signaling and the threshold is set high enough, no blocks will be orphaned. However, if any block would cause the whole threshold period to fail, it would be orphaned. To learn more about this signaling system, aj provided links to the bip-0008.mediawiki page on mandatory signaling and a pull request on GitHub.</summary>
