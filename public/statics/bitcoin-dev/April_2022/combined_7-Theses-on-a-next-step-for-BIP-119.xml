    <summary>The ongoing debate over the activation of CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) soft fork on Bitcoin Core has been a contentious issue among developers. Michael Folkson, a developer on the platform, has expressed his concern that if Jeremy Rubin's activation attempt causes uncertainty and confusion, it will make future soft forks that do have community consensus orders of magnitude harder to pull off. The email exchange between Michael and Robin highlights different perspectives in the Bitcoin community about the activation of CTV.While some believe that CTV is a necessary change that should be activated soon, others are concerned about the risks involved and believe that more time should be taken to evaluate alternatives. Jeremy Rubin advocates for the activation of CTV and shares his next steps towards achieving this goal. Overall, the debate centers around whether CTV poses a significant enough risk to warrant opposition, or whether it is a necessary step towards enabling important use cases and research opportunities.A client similar to Taproots has proposed parameters for a Speedy trial release which may lead to a chain split. The Bitcoin Core release candidate (23.0) does not have any new soft fork code or activation code, but some individuals oppose activating a CTV soft fork in the near future. Opponents can voice their concerns by registering on Jeremy's site or running full node software that doesn't include CTV and its activation code. Those who want to resist the soft fork activation attempt may consider joining a UASF-style effort.However, Michael Folkson, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, opposes the activation of the CTV soft fork in the near term. He argues that it could cause confusion, uncertainty, and disruption, making future consensus-based soft forks difficult to implement. Folkson also points out that many individuals on a list of those opposed to CTV are not actually against it, while others lack technical details to support their opposition. He cautions against attacking developers who propose improvements and write code, as well as using opposition to change as a way to undermine open-source projects.Finally, he suggests that those who oppose the CTV activation attempt should voice their opposition, run full node software that doesn't include CTV and its activation code, and consider joining a UASF-style effort to resist the activation attempt if necessary. It is important to resist soft forks that don't have community consensus to ensure Bitcoin does not splinter into different assets/blockchains with varying combinations of active soft forks.In an email exchange, Robin criticizes Michael's opinions on the activation of CTV and accuses him of stalling protocol development. He also accuses Michael of downplaying the support for CTV and refusing to spend time working on activating covenants while criticizing their activation. In response, Michael denies being a full-time CTV developer or advocate and states that the onus is on those proposing the consensus rules to get community review and consensus.Folkson advises those who oppose this soft fork activation attempt to voice their opposition, run full node software that doesn't include CTV and CTV activation code such as Bitcoin Core and if/when necessary and available run full node software that proactively rejects application of the CTV rules. He states that the primary focus should be resisting soft forks that don't have community consensus and ensuring Bitcoin doesn't splinter into a large number of different assets/blockchains with different combinations of soft forks active.In response to Linus's email, Folkson argues that any soft fork introduces chain split risk into the equation and that a contentious soft fork activation attempt contains more chain split risk. Therefore, he suggests that if there is a need for a contentious soft fork activation attempt, it should be done quickly to get it over with. Folkson also discusses the potential chain split risk associated with CTV and offers suggestions for those who oppose the soft fork activation attempt, such as registering their opposition on Jeremy Rubin's site and running full node software that doesn't include CTV and CTV activation code.</summary>
