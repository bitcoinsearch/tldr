    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky has proposed a new standard called BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to add pay-to-contract key tweaking data fields to PSBTs (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions). The proposal aims to extend the existing PSBT standard by adding new fields for pay-to-contract key tweaking data for P2C protocols. P2C tweaks are used to create a cryptographic commitment to some message using elliptic curve properties. In order to spend an output containing a P2C commitment, the same commitment should be added to the corresponding private key. The proposed PSBT input field for inputs spending UTXOs with previously created P2C public key tweaks will allow signers to produce valid signatures. The proposal abstracts details of specific P2C protocols and provides a universal method for spending previous outputs containing P2C tweaks. The scope of this proposal is limited to spending transaction outputs containing P2C tweaks and does not address construction of new P2C commitments or transactions containing them in their outputs.The new per-input type introduced in the proposal, PSBT_IN_P2C_TWEAK, includes 33 bytes of compact public key serialization specifying to which of keys the P2C tweak may be applied, and the 32 byte value which must be added to a private key to produce correct ECDSA and/or Schnorr signature ("key tweak"). This new field provides sufficient information for creating valid signatures for spending different output types containing tweaked public keys such as bare scripts, P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, witness v0 P2WPKH and P2WSH, nested witness v0 P2WPKH-P2SH and P2WSH-P2SH, and witness v1 P2TR outputs.The proposal introduces a new `PSBT_IN_P2C_TWEAK` field which contains the original key as a field key and the tweak as a field value. P2C-tweaked public keys are already exposed in the PSBT_IN_REDEEM_SCRIPT, PSBT_IN_WITNESS_SCRIPT, PSBT_IN_TAP_INTERNAL_KEY and PSBT_IN_TAP_LEAF_SCRIPT fields. The proposal is compatible with existing consensus rules and does not require any modifications.It is important to note that possible future witness versions, including witness v1 non-taproot outputs may not be supported or covered by this BIP and may require the addition of new fields to the PSBT inputs. External signers who may not have any information about such commitment can use this proposal to produce valid signatures. Overall, this proposal is aimed at providing a universal method for spending previous outputs containing P2C tweaks, applied to the public key contained within any standard form of the scriptPubkey.</summary>
