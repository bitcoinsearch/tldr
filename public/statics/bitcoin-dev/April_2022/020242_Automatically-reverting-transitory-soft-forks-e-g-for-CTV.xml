    <summary>A proposal has been made to address criticisms against CTV, a proposed soft fork for Bitcoin that would add new features to the scripting language. The criticisms include concerns over usage and support requirements for an unused CTV. The proposal suggests making CTV an automatically reverting consensus change with an option to renew, similar to a soft fork described in BIP50. Any use of OP_CTV would effectively be an "if-else" statement in Script terms. While this approach allows for experimentation with new features without committing to live with them forever, it creates a big footgun and incentivizes miners to censor spends of the reverting opcode near its reversion date. There is also a bias towards keeping the change and activating CTV now, or decisively not activating it, may bring further discussions about CTV in the future.</summary>
