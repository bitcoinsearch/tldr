    <summary>From the discussion between Russell and Nadav, it is clear that a CTV vault setup can be created where an unvault to a multisig wallet is possible. However, this does not provide any advantages of either wallet type and still has all the downsides of a multisig wallet. The purpose of a wallet vault is to gain the security of a multisig wallet without the need to sign using as many keys. In a conversation with Billy Tetrud, Russell discusses the COV proposal in MES which allows checking if an output's scriptPubKey matches the corresponding script item from the stack, but also allows for some wildcard values. These wildcards include OP_PUBKEY and OP_PUBKEYHASH as placeholders representing any 32-byte or 20-byte push value respectively. Malleability issues can be resolved by signing the transaction with the hot wallet key. There is no need to rotate anything into place. Overall, the discussions revolve around the technical aspects of wallet vaults and COV proposals in MES, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of different setups.</summary>
