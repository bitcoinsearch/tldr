    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin community suggested creating a problem page on bitcoinproblems.org to address the issue of designing a PQ TR commitment in each key. This would allow for a softfork to enable spends in the event that QC becomes a reality and normal key path spends need to be disabled. The author/maintainer of the problem can be anyone who makes a PR to the repository, and the problem doesn't necessarily have to focus on a TR solution but could describe the problem with potential solution directions. Christopher Allen provided links to resources related to this approach, including a website and an academic paper.</summary>
