    <summary>Michael Folkson, a Bitcoin developer, has requested that people pay attention to what software they run and support when it comes to Bitcoin's consensus rules. He acknowledges that not everyone has the time to follow Bitcoin drama 24/7, so he suggests listening to those in the past who showed good judgment and didn't seek to misinform as a simple heuristic. However, he admits that this is an imperfect heuristic. Ideally, the community would have sufficient time to come to an informed view independently on what software to run without being rushed into making decisions. Folkson fears that the situation could get messy, and that contentious soft fork activation attempts of CTV may be made as convoluted as possible in a way intended to confuse, with information being withheld until the last minute. He believes that it is generally better to rely on the status quo and tried and trusted, which in this case would be Bitcoin Core. Alternative releases such as those seeking to activate or resist CTV should only be considered by those who are informed on exactly what they are running. Folkson ends his post by hoping that those behind the contentious soft fork activation attempt will see sense and that the community can go back to more productive things than resisting contentious soft forks.</summary>
