    <summary>Alice, a user on the bitcoin-dev forum, asked David Harding about the possibility of reverting consensus changes for soft forks that have already been activated. Alice provided an example where some users are not in favor of witness discount in segwit transactions. However, this specific case is not a good example as it would actually be a soft fork to revert the discount, which would tighten existing rules and decrease block size. The discussion on the forum suggests that it may not be possible to revert activated soft forks without causing disruptions to the network.</summary>
