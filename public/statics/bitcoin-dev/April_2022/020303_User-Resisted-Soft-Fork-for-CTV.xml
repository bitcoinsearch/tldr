    <summary>The sender of this message addresses two individuals, Michael and Jorge, regarding their behavior on a particular list. The sender asserts that making personal attacks on the trustworthiness of participants based solely on disliking an activation proposal is ethically inappropriate. They link to Wikipedia's policy on "Assume Good Faith," which states that contributors should assume that other editors are acting in good faith and avoid accusing others of malicious intent without evidence.The sender also notes that it goes against the spirit of the project to judge technical solutions based on who presents them. They argue that one should not be so technically adrift as to rely solely on reputation when evaluating proposals. Instead, they suggest that disagreements should be addressed on the basis of technical merits.Finally, the sender advises that if one disagrees with people rather than ideas, they should take their grievances elsewhere. They suggest that personal attacks have no place in professional discourse and that such behavior would be more appropriate in "smuttier sections of the Internet."</summary>
