    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev post, Buck O Perley discussed the importance of decision making and testing before soft forking a proposal into consensus code. They questioned the significance of using hard numbers to measure use cases and interest in proposals. The discussion then moved to ways this could be achieved through metrics such as transaction creation, library support, and demos of major use cases. While CTV had been used on signet, there was still some uncertainty about its usefulness, with aj expressing doubts about the benefits of using it over a taproot-only opcode like TXHASH. In the absence of clear metrics, miners and R&amp;D have different success metrics. Additionally, new ideas, such as TLUV and Taro, have emerged since Taproot's activation. However, not all features are the same, and although CTV has attracted excitement from those interested in long-term store of value, they are unlikely to use it until decades later.</summary>
