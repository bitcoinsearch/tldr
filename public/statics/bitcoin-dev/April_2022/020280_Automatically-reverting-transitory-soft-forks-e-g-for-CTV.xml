    <summary>There are multiple covenant designs that have been proposed, but none of them have actual implementations or sample usages, except for CTV. The lack of serious proposals aside from CTV indicates the difficulty in coming up with a preferable alternative. Each proposal has its own issues - being either abstruse, hard to analyze for safety, or encouraging wasteful verbosity. Despite its limits relative to more "general" designs, CTV is a simple and well-reviewed system. The discussion could be about other designs, but they are unlikely to be implemented in the near future due to the lack of complete specifications and tooling. This absence of progress after years of discussion highlights the challenge of creating viable covenants.</summary>
