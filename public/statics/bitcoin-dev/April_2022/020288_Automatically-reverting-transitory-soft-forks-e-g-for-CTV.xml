    <summary>In an email exchange, James O'Beirne expressed his opinion on the ongoing discussion about covenant designs. He stated that there are several different designs for covenants that have been proposed and shared on the list but doesn't see why a specific one is being considered to move forward with at this point. In response to this, Matt suggested that there are no serious proposals for covenants other than CTV and the lack of interest in serious covenants designs might be due to various reasons. Matt further added that CTV is a simple covenant system even though it has limits compared to more general covenant designs, and its design has undergone a level of review beyond the other possible designs seen on the list. However, a citation was requested to support this statement. Overall, the email exchange discussed the ongoing discussion around covenant designs and the potential difficulties of finding a preferable alternative to CTV.</summary>
