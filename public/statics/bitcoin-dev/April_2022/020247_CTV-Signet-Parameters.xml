    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, participants talked about the criteria for soft-forking a proposal into consensus code. They emphasized the importance of demonstrating real-life use cases and sufficient testing before implementing any changes. The conversation then turned to the status of CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), a feature that enables the creation of more complex smart contracts on Bitcoin's blockchain. Jeremy Rubin shared details on the framework's compatibility with different libraries and tools, including Sapio and Test Framework. While there are several working prototypes of CTV's major use cases, they are not yet production-ready.Rubin built Sapio to demonstrate the wide range of applications possible under CTV, given that the main critique was that it lacked versatility. The discussion also touched on the scriptSig commitments, which some participants found cumbersome, and the need to continue raising the bar for consensus development.On a separate thread, an author named AJ expressed their desire to see a toy implementation of eltoo for ANYPREVOUT that can handle fees and layered transactions. They note that it will take a while for LN to update to taproot and PTLCs, so eltoo does not seem like an immediate possibility. In addition, they do not believe that ANYPREVOUT is the best design for covenants, so they suggest exploring other options if that was the motivation. Regarding TLUV, AJ notes that the design parameters do not seem optimal, particularly with the use of x-only pubkeys and alternatives like OP_EVICT. As a result, they believe that TLUV is still on the whiteboard.</summary>
