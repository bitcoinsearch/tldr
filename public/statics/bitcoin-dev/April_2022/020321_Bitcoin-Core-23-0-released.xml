    <summary>Bitcoin Core, the cryptocurrency platform, has released version 23.0 with new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. The latest update includes updates to P2P and network changes, fee estimation changes, and the removal of the `-rescan` startup parameter. Additionally, Bitcoin Core release binaries for Linux now include experimental tracepoints that act as an interface for process-internal events and updated RPCs. The `validateaddress` RPC now returns an `error_locations` array for invalid addresses, while the `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` configuration option has been removed. The upgrade process is straightforward, involving shutting down older versions and running the installer or copying over the relevant files. Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on several operating systems, including Linux kernel OS, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. It should work on most other Unix-like systems, but it's not recommended to use it on unsupported systems. Users are encouraged to report any bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub and to subscribe to receive security and update notifications.In version 22.0, Bitcoin Core introduced several changes and updates to the existing software. A new RPC, `getdeploymentinfo`, has been created to query soft fork status at any block, rather than only at the chain tip. Soft fork status has been moved from `getblockchaininfo` to this new RPC. `banlist.dat` is no longer used as the list of banned hosts and networks on startup, only `banlist.json` will be considered. The `-persistmempool` command line option is now treated like other boolean options to mean `-persistmempool=1`, while `-maxuploadtarget` allows human-readable byte units and `-proxy=` can no longer be set as a proxy for reaching the Tor network if used together with `-noonion`. Additionally, the latest release introduces a new feature for `lockunspent` that allows UTXOs to remain locked even after node restarts or crashes by writing the lock persistently to the wallet database. The GUI changes include storing UTXOs locked via the GUI persistently in the wallet database, so they are not lost on node shutdown or crash. Overall, both versions provide several new features and performance enhancements, along with a few notable changes, making it worth considering upgrading to for users of the cryptocurrency platform.</summary>
