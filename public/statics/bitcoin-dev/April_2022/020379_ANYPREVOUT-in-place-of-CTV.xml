    <title>ANYPREVOUT in place of CTV</title>

    <summary>The post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the potential of using SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT (APO) to replace BIP119. APO can solve the problem of stable txids, which is necessary for certain use cases like channel factories. However, the current version of APO suffers from the half-spend problem. To address this issue, the post proposes a slightly tweaked version of BIP118, which can emulate CTV just fine if the "ANYONECANPAY" behavior is made optional.CTV is a proposed soft fork that aims to improve the efficiency and security of Bitcoin transactions. Although CTV advocates present vaults as the flagship use case, using APO-AS covers it, and it's not a couple dozen more virtual bytes that will matter for potential vault users. It's suggested that we can consider CTV an optimization of APO-AS covenants. The author of the post expresses interest in whether or not people would oppose the APO-AS part of BIP118, which enables CTV's features. They also suggest that BIP118 could benefit most Bitcoin users. The post includes a link to more information on BIP118 and another link to the use cases section of anyprevout.xyz.The post also addresses concerns about QC vulnerability and higher network-wide full-node validation costs of APO compared to CTV. Overall, the post presents a proposal that could potentially improve the efficiency and security of Bitcoin transactions while also addressing issues with stable txids.</summary>
