    <summary>In this conversation thread, Jorge Timón expresses concerns about relying solely on miners to resist changes and calls for consideration of user resistance in cases such as activation of a controversial soft fork. He questions the superiority of speedy trial and bip8/lot=true in cases where flawed proposals make it through activation parameters set and released but fail to achieve supermajority hashpower support. Anthony Towns disagrees with Timón's view and argues that bip8 is meant for activating good proposals and not making it easier to reject bad forks. The conversation becomes confrontational, with Timón accusing Towns of not understanding his points. Despite attempts to resolve the issues, the discussion ends with Timón deciding to stop further communication on the matter.</summary>
