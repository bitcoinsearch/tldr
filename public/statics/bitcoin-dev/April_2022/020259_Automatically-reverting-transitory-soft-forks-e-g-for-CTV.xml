    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, David A. Harding raised concerns regarding the viability of CTV (CheckTemplateVerify), a proposal for activating Taproot, in real-world usage and the burden it would create in terms of maintenance if left unused. He also questioned whether covenants were being approached in the right way as there is still no consensus around any concrete proposal. He criticized the idea of pushing CTV into Bitcoin at this stage, stating that it sets a poor precedent for changes to Bitcoin and maintaining its culture of security and careful design. Matt expressed surprise at the lack of complete rejection from the Bitcoin technical community towards this narrative.</summary>
