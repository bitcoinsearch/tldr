    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Nadav Ivgi questioned whether the DROP/1 function was necessary in a certain context. However, another participant noted that with Taproot's CLEANSTACK rule, leaving the 32 byte hash on the stack would not evaluate as true. The CLEANSTACK rule is the same for segwit and tapscript and requires that the script must not fail and result in exactly one TRUE element on the stack. Additionally, tapscript has a CastToBool() function that evaluates anything not false as TRUE. False is defined as zero or negative zero. Taproot also has the MINIMALIF rule that requires exactly one or zero as input to IF, but it is unclear if this is relevant to CTV.</summary>
