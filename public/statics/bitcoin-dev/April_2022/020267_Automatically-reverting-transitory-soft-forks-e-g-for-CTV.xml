    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, David A. Harding raised concerns about criticisms he has heard regarding the proposed CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) feature. In response to these concerns, Buck O Perley suggested that many of the use cases for CTV are focused on long-term store of value instead of medium of exchange. This would make it difficult to implement any sort of sunset for the feature in less than several decades. If sunsetting were deemed necessary, one proposal suggests coding it as its own soft-fork with pre-declared parameters included in the original activation proposal. This would simplify the process and avoid a second debate about how to go about sunsetting the rules. Links to relevant code examples were also provided.</summary>
