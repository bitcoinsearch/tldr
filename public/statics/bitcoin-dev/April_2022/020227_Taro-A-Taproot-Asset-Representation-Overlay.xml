    <summary>Ruben and Olaoluwa Osuntokun are discussing the feasibility of adding a scripting language to Taro, which is a protocol that allows for tokenization and asset issuance on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ruben argues that off-chain validation protocols cannot do any meaningful scripting due to limitations, and that using Bitcoin script without an additional scripting language inside of Taro is already sufficient. He suggests leaving out the scripting language altogether unless there is a specific and compelling use case. Olaoluwa proposes an "issuance covenant" design sketch that could be useful for certain collateralization requirements. Ruben acknowledges the potential usefulness of covenants in enforcing spending conditions on Taro assets. They also discuss the need for the location of the Taro tree inside the taproot tree to be deterministic for the verifier and propose solutions to this issue.</summary>
