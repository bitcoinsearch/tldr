    <summary>In a discussion among bitcoin developers, Anthony Towns argued that, under any circumstance, activating a bad soft fork via bip8 is never superior to speedy trial. He stated that if a resistance method works against bip8, it also works against speedy trial, and if it fails against speedy trial, it fails against bip8. However, Jorge Timón disagreed, stating that Towns was ignoring user resistance in his argument and relying too much on miners to stop bad proposals. Timón suggested that a variant of speedy trial that requires mandatory signaling could improve the process and give users a more effective means of forking away from soft fork changes they reject. Keagan also pointed out that one essential difference between speedy trial and BIP8 is that, since there is no mandatory signaling during the lock-in period with speedy trial, it is more difficult to do a counter soft fork. Luke had previously mentioned this as one of the benefits of mandatory signaling. The conversation ended with apologies and some unresolved disagreement.</summary>
