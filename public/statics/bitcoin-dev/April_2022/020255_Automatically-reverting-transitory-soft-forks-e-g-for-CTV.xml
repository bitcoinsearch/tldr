    <summary>The argument presented is that transactions that can be relayed and confirmed should not be restricted. This is to ensure that old nodes' mempools do not produce invalid blocks after an upgrade. The policy in place ensures that such transactions are bounced to make it clear what may be upgraded. Changing this detail would result in old nodes mining invalid blocks. In response to the suggestion of making spending conditions absurd, it is argued that all softforks would have to be ruled out. It is also mentioned that appropriate patches were done, reviewed and deployed in time for Taproot, but efforts to get it merged into Core were sabotaged. Even if full responsibility is accepted for the BIP9 ST without consensus, there was still a year to convince other maintainers to review and merge activation code, which did not happen. The importance of advocacy for driving debate forward and improving logic is stressed.</summary>
