    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Jorge Tim贸n and Anthony Towns discussed the scenarios in which BIP8 fails compared to speedy trial. Tim贸n had provided a hypothetical example of an "evil soft fork" making it through activation parameters set and released but not achieving supermajority hashpower support. In such a scenario, bip8+lot=true would activate the evil fork, whereas speedy trial would block it. Towns argued that bip8 is meant for activating good proposals and bad ones need to be stopped in review. Tim贸n disagreed and accused Towns of not listening to him. However, Towns invited Tim贸n to provide a counterexample to his claim.</summary>
