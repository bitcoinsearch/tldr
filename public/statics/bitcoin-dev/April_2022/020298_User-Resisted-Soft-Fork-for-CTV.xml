    <title>User Resisted Soft Fork for CTV</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Billy Tetrud and Zac debated on whether increasing the utility of the Bitcoin network through more use cases would benefit or harm it. Zac argued that more use cases would increase blockchain usage and transaction prices for everyone while Tetrud disagreed, stating that increased usage would not be bad for Bitcoin. They also discussed the maxim of Peter Todd that any change in Bitcoin must benefit all users, with Tetrud disagreeing and suggesting that changes benefiting the majority of users without negatively affecting the minority should still be implemented. The discussion then shifted to the benefits of CTV, which Tetrud believes provides substantial benefits to all users through easier and cheaper security improvements via wallet vaults, DLCs, channels, and other use cases. However, there are also security caveats that need to be addressed, and Tetrud suggested creating a table of proposed opcodes and use cases with ratings for maturity and efficiency. Tetrud also expressed a preference for restricted and well-tested covenants that do not allow for recursion to be added to Bitcoin at some point.</summary>
