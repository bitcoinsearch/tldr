    <summary>In an email exchange between David A. Harding and Matt Corallo on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, they discussed the criticisms of CTV (consensus-enforced transaction verification). The criticisms included concerns about its usage, the need to support unused CTV forever, and the burden it creates for consensus change proposals. Matt also raised a concern about whether CTV is the best approach to covenants. He argued that instead of adding something to Bitcoin just to see if it can be done, they should design the most flexible and useful covenants system. Matt also pointed out that there are multiple covenants designs posted to the list, making it difficult to choose a specific one to move forward with. David agreed and suggested using a transitory soft fork as a method for collecting real-world usage data about proposals before making permanent consensus changes. However, Matt noted that doing a fork on Bitcoin has nontrivial costs and suggested adding "technical community consensus" as a factor in the process.</summary>
