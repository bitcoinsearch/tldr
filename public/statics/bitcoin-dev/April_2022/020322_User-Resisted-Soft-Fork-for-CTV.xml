    <title>User Resisted Soft Fork for CTV</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the maxim of Peter Todd, which states that any change made to Bitcoin must benefit all users with well-defined and transparent benefits. The author believes that the only acceptable additions to the protocol are those that clearly benefit layer 2 solutions such as LN without the potential for abuse by freeloaders selling commercial services on top of "free" eternal storage on the blockchain. It is argued that benefiting all users can only be achieved by benefiting layer 2 solutions since the vast majority of users will use them. CTV could not allow Bitcoin's blockchain to be used as storage but would benefit layer 2 solutions such as lightning, sidechains, spacechain, etc. Soft forks could improve things that benefit both L1 and L2, while some emails in the mailing list could be interpreted incorrectly and create a contentious environment. Despite differences of opinion, the author acknowledges Jeremy's efforts in working on CTV, Sapio, and bitcoin covenants, and his contribution will always be appreciated.</summary>
