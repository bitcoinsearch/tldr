    <summary>In an email exchange, Jeremy Rubin and Peter Todd discuss the definition of a pinning attack in the context of blockchain technology. Rubin argues that transactions on a blockchain represent computations, citing the relevance of non-blocking algorithms to guarantee progress. Todd disagrees with this characterization, stating that it is misleading in a blockchain environment where many people have tried to portray blockchain schemes as "world computers". The two also discuss the potential for necromancy attacks, where an earlier version of a transaction is resurrected by a third party for OpenTimestamps (OTS). Rubin argues that this could save money on fees, but Todd disagrees and suggests doing one transaction with all pending commitments at a particular time instead.</summary>
