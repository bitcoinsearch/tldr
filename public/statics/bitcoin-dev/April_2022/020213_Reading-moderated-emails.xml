    <summary>If you're a Bitcoin developer, an email listserv called bitcoin-dev-moderation can be useful. However, some emails sent to this listserv get moderated. To solve this problem, a Python script can be used to download the eml file from moderated archives. One such script that is recommended is fast_mail_parser. This script allows you to print the body in base64 format and different parts of the email. To read the email in plain text, decode the relevant line by pasting the highlighted content in https://www.base64decode.org/ or using b64decode() in Python. The email was sent with ProtonMail, which is a secure email service.</summary>
