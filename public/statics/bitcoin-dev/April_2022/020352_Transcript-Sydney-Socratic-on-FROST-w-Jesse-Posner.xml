    <summary>Recently, Jesse Posner joined an online Sydney Socratic seminar to talk about his work on FROST, and the video of the seminar is available on btctranscripts.com [1]. During the seminar, Jesse discussed how Taproot can leverage distributed key generation and threshold signing to bridge the divide between a "hot" and "cold" key [3]. He also explained how FROST can simulate a threshold signature arrangement (k-of-n, k&lt;n) without requiring any additional hardware or setup [2]. The discussion revolved around how this technology can potentially improve security and privacy for Bitcoin users [1].</summary>
