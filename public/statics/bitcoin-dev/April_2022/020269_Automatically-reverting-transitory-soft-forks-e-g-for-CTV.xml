    <summary>In a recent email thread, Bitcoin developers discussed the best way to implement covenant functionality in Bitcoin's protocol. While there is no clear consensus on which design is objectively "best," the group agreed that more data about user demand and usage is needed to make informed decisions. One developer suggested using a transitory soft fork to activate different covenant designs and observe which ones are actually used by Bitcoin users. However, this proposal was met with concerns about safety risks and the lack of recursion in some of the designs. Despite these obstacles, the group hopes to find a way to obtain decisive data and prevent Bitcoin from ossifying prematurely.</summary>
