    <title>ANYPREVOUT in place of CTV</title>

    <summary>A Bitcoin developer has suggested replacing BIP119 with a tweaked version of BIP118, and asked for people's views on the subject. The SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and its precedent iterations have been discussed for over six years and present proven and implemented usecases that are demanded and more widely accepted than CTV's. If someone can emulate CTV just fine by making the "ANYONECANPAY" behaviour optional, then we can consider CTV an optimization of APO-AS covenants. CTV advocates have been presenting vaults as the flagship usecase but using APO-AS covers it. The developer believes that given the interest in, and demand for, both simple covenants and better offchain protocols, BIP118 is a soft fork candidate that could benefit more (if not most of) Bitcoin users. They also want to know if people would oppose the APO-AS part of BIP118 since it enables CTV's features, for the same reason they'd oppose BIP119. Meanwhile, others will have been able to deploy new applications leveraging ANYPREVOUT.</summary>
