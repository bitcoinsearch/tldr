    <summary>The writer expresses concern over a potential contentious soft fork activation attempt in the Bitcoin community. They urge individuals to pay attention and make informed decisions on what to run and support. The writer suggests that motivated parties may seek to break nodes off from Bitcoin and take advantage of such an attempt. They recommend relying on the status quo and trusted sources, like Bitcoin Core, unless individuals are fully informed on alternative releases. The writer invites those interested in resisting the activation attempt of CTV to join ##ursf on Libera IRC. They hope for a resolution to this issue soon so that the community can focus on more productive matters. Contact information is provided for the writer.</summary>
