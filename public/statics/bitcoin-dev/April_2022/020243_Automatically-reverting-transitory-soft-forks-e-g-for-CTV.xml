    <summary>The Bitcoin community has expressed concerns over the future use of CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) due to maintenance and security issues. To address these concerns, David A. Harding proposed an idea on the bitcoin-dev mailing list to automatically revert CTV as a consensus change with an option to renew after five years. The proposal would allow experimentation with new features without committing to them permanently. However, there are several downsides to consider, such as the risk of losing money for those who use CTV without adequate preparation and miners possibly censoring spends of the reverting opcode near its reversion date. Additionally, if CTV is not widely used, there may be a bias towards keeping it at the end of the five-year period. Despite the potential drama associated with the proposal, further discussions about CTV are likely in the future.</summary>
