    <summary>Carl Dong has recently explained the libbitcoinkernel project in Bitcoin Core through a short video. The aim of this project is to extract the consensus engine from Bitcoin Core to avoid catastrophic forks caused by disagreements between the consensus engines of nodes across the network. There have been some consensus bugs in older versions of Bitcoin Core due to the blurred boundary between what is part of consensus and what is not. This has made it difficult for alternative implementations to be built in other languages and with different RPCs without risking falling out of consensus with Bitcoin Core.The first PR in the series has been merged recently and Carl explains his thoughts on the future direction of this ambitious long-term project in the video and on the linked issue. However, unraveling Satoshi's spaghetti code and the entanglement between the consensus engine and the rest of the codebase has been a decade-long task that requires extreme care and is by no means completed.</summary>
