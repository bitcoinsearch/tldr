    <summary>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Zac Greenwood shared his support for Peter Todd's maxim that any change to Bitcoin must benefit all users and have well-defined and transparent benefits. He also expressed his belief that only additions to the protocol that benefit layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, while avoiding potential abuse by freeloaders selling commercial services on top of "free" eternal storage on the blockchain, would be acceptable. Greenwood further emphasized that benefiting "all users" can only be accomplished by strengthening layer 2 solutions since most users will use them as the only known way for Bitcoin to scale.</summary>
