    <summary>A client similar to Taproots with parameters proposed to be put in place has a Speedy trial release, which could potentially lead to a chain split. The Bitcoin Core release candidate (23.0) does not contain any new soft fork code or activation code. However, there are some individuals who have expressed opposition to activating a CTV soft fork in the near future. The activation attempt seeks 90% of miners to signal for it and if they do, the CTV soft fork can activate unless full nodes resist it. Opposition can be voiced by registering on Jeremy's site or running full node software that doesn't include CTV and CTV activation code such as Bitcoin Core, while those who want to resist the soft fork activation attempt may consider joining a UASF style effort. The uncertainty, confusion, and disruption caused by this activation attempt could make future soft forks harder to pull off, so the primary focus should be on resisting soft forks that don't have community consensus and ensuring Bitcoin does not splinter into a large number of different assets/blockchains with different combinations of soft forks active.</summary>
