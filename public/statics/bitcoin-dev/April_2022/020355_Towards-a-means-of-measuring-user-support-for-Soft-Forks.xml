    <summary>During the blocksize wars, a UTXO proof-of-stake website was created, and some people signed with thousands of bitcoins. However, it was evident that most people were not participating. Erik Aronesty listed several issues with the system, including feeding the Chainalysis beasts when hodlers move their UTXOs, signalling not being weighted by Bitcoin Days Destroyed, Coinbase.com's interests not being sufficiently aligned to poll them, and voting being an unattractive option. Despite not supporting voting, there is another way to de-Sybil via network analysis, which was historically labeled the Web of Trust. The Web of Trust can be algorithmically blinded so as not to fit strongly into the "KYC" category while still using assertions about people who know each other as a ground truth. Additionally, there is an old discussion link related to this topic.</summary>
