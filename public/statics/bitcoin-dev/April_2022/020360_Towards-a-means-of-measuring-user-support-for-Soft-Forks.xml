    <summary>The proposal being discussed is related to polling rather than voting, where the purpose is for developers to review and analyze the results of the poll as it contributes to consensus gathering. The idea is for everyone who participates in polling to broadcast it along the Bitcoin network, enabling anyone to publish a JSON file with polling aggregates at a specific block height that can be quickly checked for missing data or lies. Suggestions have been made to improve anonymity, but concerns remain around social issues such as "weighted polling" and how nonexperts may not understand the relevant issues. Without a great UX around the tooling, it is unlikely that this method will garner a lot of meaningful data.</summary>
