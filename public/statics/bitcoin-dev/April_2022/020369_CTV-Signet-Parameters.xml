    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin scripting language in Optech group, a member raised a question about the necessity of DROP/1 when leaving a 32-byte hash on the stack. Another member clarified that it would not necessarily mean everyone is using Sapio to construct transactions, but rather they may be using sapio-miniscript or a different miniscript implementation that is compatible with sapio-miniscript's CTV fragment. Alternatively, they may be hand-writing the script and still using that fragment. The member provided two links as examples that look like Sapio, but are built using minsc. Ultimately, using miniscript seems different than using Sapio, but the underlying point of the discussion still stands.</summary>
