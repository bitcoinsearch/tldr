    <summary>The email author discusses the challenges of deciding what to send to a mailing list without overloading readers with promotional content or focusing solely on contentious consensus changes. To illustrate their point, they mention Miniscript, which has been in development for several years and was recently merged into the Bitcoin Core wallet. The author links to a blog post by Salvatore Ingala, who explains his work to get Miniscript support in the Ledger hardware wallet. Ingala's work only requires around 20 lines of code, but there is additional complexity not covered by the code snippet. He also includes a short video demonstrating the potential user experience on a Ledger Nano.The author notes that the Policy/Miniscript compiler(s) currently do not support Taproot trees of scripts, so the focus is primarily on pre-Taproot Bitcoin scripts. Finally, the author mentions that a Bitcoin Core PR review club on Miniscript will be hosted on May 18th for those interested in learning more.</summary>
