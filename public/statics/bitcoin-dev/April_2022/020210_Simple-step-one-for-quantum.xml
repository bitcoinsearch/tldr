    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty expressed his opinion that quantum attacks are not a concern in the near future. He compared practical quantum-attacks to fusion, human-level AI, and nanotechnology, which are always "20 years away." While there have been reported approaches to quantum-attack resistance, many have fallen, and more will fall in the next "20 years." Despite this, Christopher Allen found the research interesting and provided a link to the best approach. Blockchain Commons cannot fully fund the research but is willing to contribute a small grant if others fund it. The link provided is https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/software.html.</summary>
