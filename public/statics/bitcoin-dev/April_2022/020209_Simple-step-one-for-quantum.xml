    <summary>The proposal suggests implementing a similar address type (secp26k1+NTRU) and associated validation as a soft fork, followed by allowing people to opt-in to quantum safe addresses. It is noted that this should still work with schnorr and other things, but it would be a lot of work to fold it in, creating some extra validation work for nodes. To address this concern, adding a fee premium for using these addresses seems reasonable. The writer does not endorse any action at all, putting the cart like six and a half miles in front of the horse, but if there are many people that support this idea, they would be happy to make an NTRU bip or something. This proposal was found on the OpenSSH release notes website.</summary>
