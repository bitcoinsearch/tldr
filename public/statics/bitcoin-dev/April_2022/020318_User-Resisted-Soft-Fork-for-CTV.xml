    <summary>In an email conversation on April 25, 2022, ZmnSCPxj mentioned that CTV can benefit layer 2 users and that he has switched from being apathetic to vaguely supportive of it. However, there are other proposals that also benefit L2 solutions, and Zac asked why ZmnSCPxj specifically supports CTV. Zac suggested that documenting the implications of each proposal side by side and point by point might be a useful next step. This would enable a larger part of the community to understand each proposal and reduce repetition and misunderstandings. Once a common understanding of the implications of each proposal is in place, their tradeoffs can be considered, facilitating creating consensus on which proposal benefits a maximum of users.</summary>
