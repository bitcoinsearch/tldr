    <title>ANYPREVOUT in place of CTV</title>

    <summary>The author is seeking opinions on whether to implement a slightly modified version of BIP118 instead of, or before, implementing BIP119. They argue that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and its predecessors have been discussed for over six years and have proven and implemented use cases that are more widely accepted than CTV's. The APO-AS covenants can emulate CTV with optional "ANYONECANPAY" behavior but may be a bit more expensive to use. The author doubts that CTV is necessary or sufficient for practical vault implementation as APO-AS covers it. The author thinks that BIP118 could benefit most Bitcoin users due to the interest in and demand for both simple covenants and better off-chain protocols. They also wonder if people would oppose the APO-AS part of BIP118 for the same reason they would oppose BIP119. If all parties currently dubious about CTV's stated use cases are proven wrong by on-chain usage of a less efficient construction to achieve the same goal, CTV can be rolled out as an optimization. In the meantime, new applications leveraging ANYPREVOUT such as Eltoo, blind statechains, etc., can be deployed.</summary>
