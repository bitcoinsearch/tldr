    <summary>In an email exchange between Anthony Towns and Jorge Timón, the topic of bip8 activation for bad soft forks was discussed. Towns claimed that bip8 activation is never superior to speedy trial for any bad soft fork and can even be worse in some cases. Timón disagreed, stating that Towns was not considering user resistance in his argument. However, Towns argued that he was indeed taking user resistance into consideration and that the only case where bip8 with lot=true is worse than speedy trial is when miners correctly identify a bad fork as such. The conversation became more heated, with Timón expressing frustration at feeling ignored and Towns suggesting that Timón examine his own behavior. The email exchange ended abruptly thereafter.</summary>
