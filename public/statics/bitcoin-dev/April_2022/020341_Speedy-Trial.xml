    <summary>The discussion on the issue of whether miners or users should lead has been ongoing, but it is agreed that users do in fact lead, and miners just need to be prepared and have the time to upgrade their software. In the case of "evil" forks, there is no need for miners to "defend" Bitcoin, as this would be a fallacy of reification. It is not possible to measure user consensus systematically without resorting to gaming the system or centralization. Wallet votes and node signals can cause centralization pressures, while eyeballs are not a reliable measure. Verbal and social wrangling and chest pounding seem to be the best system of achieving consensus at present, but the question remains whether we can do better. On another note, nodes decide which blocks are orphaned based on those that cause the whole threshold period to fail, as explained in the links provided.</summary>
