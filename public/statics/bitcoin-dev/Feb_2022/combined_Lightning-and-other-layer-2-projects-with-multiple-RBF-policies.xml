    <summary>The security of Layer 2 projects, such as the Lightning Network, is partially dependent on policy rules, which is not the case for the base blockchain/network. There have been recent discussions about changing the default Replace-by-Fee (RBF) policy used by Core, which could lead to multiple versions using different policies. This raises questions about whether the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects are vulnerable to multiple RBF policies being used.An attacker could use a different RBF policy with some nodes and 10% hash power to affect the security of different projects relying on the default RBF policy in the latest Bitcoin Core. While most users will likely run whatever default policy rules are set, regardless of their technical capabilities, users have the freedom to run different policy rules without making them effective consensus rules.Contributors to other Layer 2 projects are free to flag and discuss non-Lightning-specific security considerations, but research into Lightning security is still nascent. Therefore, it is best to utilize current designs despite the impact of policy rules on the security of Layer 2 projects.The recent improvements suggested for RBF policy have primarily focused on Lightning Network security, but experiments on custom signet networks could shed more light on issues associated with multiple RBF policies. The default policy rules implemented by Bitcoin Knots are fully configurable, allowing users to choose whatever policy they want without making those rules effective consensus rules.It should be noted that different versions of Bitcoin Core are currently being used on the network, but the trend is towards more full nodes upgrading to newer versions. Setting defaults that bolster the security of these protocols at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols should be discussed. Research in this area is encouraged to understand more issues associated with multiple RBF policies being used in Bitcoin Core.</summary>
