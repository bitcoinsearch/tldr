    <summary>The discussion revolves around the idea of increasing payment precision by going sub-satoshi on chain and extending it to ordinals by having fraction ordinals. However, it is suggested that making a concrete proposal at this stage might not be applicable in the future. The proposal's interpretation is clarified regarding the transaction ID and the transfer of ordinals from UTXOs to outputs in a transaction. The spec defines the ordinal ranges of duplicate transactions, which match Bitcoin Core's behavior of rendering unspendable UTXOs created by a transaction with the same ID. The need for this rule is explained, and further details will be added to the BIP.</summary>
