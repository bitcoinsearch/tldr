    <summary>In the context mentioned, there is a concern regarding the use of ordinal numbers in future improvements. The issue arises if and when a Monero-like system is introduced where coin amounts are hidden. To make such a system backward-compatible, zero satoshi may be used as a substitute for hidden values. Zero satoshi has the advantage of bypassing the amount checking for old clients, which can be useful for introducing new protocols and adding fractional satoshis on-chain. However, if these amounts are simply ignored, it would be difficult to connect any future protocol based on that with ordinal numbers. This is because ordinal numbers are inherently public and do not work with private or obfuscated transactions.</summary>
