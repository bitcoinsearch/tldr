    <summary>The context discusses the performance of a DLC (Discreet Log Contract) with respect to its CIT points and CTV hashes. The author explains that the CIT points can be considered as the X axis or independent axes of a contract, while the Y axis represents the dependent variable represented by the CTV hashes. For a DLC living inside a lightning channel that is updated frequently, one only needs to recompute the cheaper part of the DLC when updating the payoff curves (Y-axis) and only update the points whose Y value changes. This is less relevant for on-chain DLCs because the latency of block space is larger. The author suggests that although there may be some issues with overall performance, one cannot be too fussy about it given that users always have ten minutes to confirm the DLC.</summary>
