    <summary>In an email exchange, Jeremy Rubin and Peter Todd discussed a new type of pinning attack that is distinct from other types of pinning attacks. While Rubin argued that adding fees to transactions could be harmful in certain use-cases, Todd suggested that sponsors or fee accounts would enable the protocol to make forward progress. However, Rubin countered that while some protocols may be able to deal with exceptional cases happening occasionally, it would be harmful if an attacker could harass them by making those exceptional cases happen frequently.</summary>
