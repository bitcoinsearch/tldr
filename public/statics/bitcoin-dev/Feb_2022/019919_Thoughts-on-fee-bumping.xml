    <summary>In a recent discussion, James O'Beirne explains that the validity of a sponsor transaction is "monotonically" true at any point after its inclusion in a block. This means that if sponsors were valid at any point in the future, not only would a utxo index be needed but an index of all transactions. However, not all nodes have this ability and a map of (txid -&gt; transaction) for all time is a separate index that must be enabled via the `-txindex=1` flag. The current consensus threshold for transactions to become invalid is a 100 block reorg. In case of a reorg deeper than 100 blocks, it would permanently invalidate any transactions spending the recently-matured coinbase subsidy in any block between $new_reorg_tip and ($former_tip_height - 100). These invalidated spends would not be able to be reorganized into a new replacement chain.</summary>
