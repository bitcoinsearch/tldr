    <summary>In this conversation, Zac proposes a method of storing data on the blockchain that avoids using standard transactions which he believes are inefficient in terms of space usage. However, ZmnSCPxj argues that using a standard transaction with an `OP_RETURN` output is more efficient and already has existing constructions that make it work. While they could shave off some bytes by removing the amount field for pure published data and using an equivalent to the `OP_PUSH` opcode, adding a separate data publication field would require a hardfork. Additionally, saving a few bytes for a non-core application like data storage is not enough justification for a hardfork and any softfork would likely spend more bytes than it could save.</summary>
