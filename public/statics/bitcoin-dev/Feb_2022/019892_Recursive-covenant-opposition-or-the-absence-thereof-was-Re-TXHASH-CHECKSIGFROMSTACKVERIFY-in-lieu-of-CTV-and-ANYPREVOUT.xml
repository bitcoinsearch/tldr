    <summary>The concerns surrounding recursive covenants in Bitcoin have been discussed recently on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One user, Shinobi (@brian_trollz), has voiced concerns about unbounded recursion combined with too much generality/flexibility in what types of conditions future UTXOs can be encumbered with based on the restriction of such covenants. The concern is that it could introduce a totally different risk model in being paid with such a coin compared to any other coin not encumbered by such a condition, and also potentially introduce a shift in the scope of what a 51% attack could accomplish in terms of permanent consequences attempting to coerce coins into such covenants.The hypothetical construct that Shinobi describes involves a script that specifies a specific key in a multisig controlled by some authority figure and the conditions of the covenant would perpetually require than any spend from the covenant can only be sent to a script involving that key from said authority. This would prevent by consensus any removal of that central authorities involvement in control over that UTXO. Such a construct would present dangerous implications to the fungibility of individual UTXOs, making them permanently non-fungible with ones not encumbered by such conditions.Shinobi notes that such a walled garden could easily be constructed now with multisig and restrictions on where coins can be withdrawn to from exchanges or whatever place they initially purchased from, but the important distinction between such non-consensus system designed to enforce such restrictions and a recursive covenant to accomplish the same is that exit from that restriction is still possible under the consensus rules of the protocol.James O'Beirne writes that he doesn't oppose recursive covenants per se, but expresses uncertainty about proposals that enable more "featureful" covenants by adding more kinds of computation into bitcoin script. He is interested in limiting operations in bitcoin script to "verification" (vs. "computation") to the extent practical, and instead encouraging general computation be done off-chain. One of the things he likes about CTV is that it buys a lot of functionality without increasing the "surface area" of script's design.David A. Harding notes that the merits of allowing recursive covenants was discussed at length on this list previously, and not a single person replied to say that they were opposed to the idea. He suggests that anyone opposed to recursive covenants speak for themselves and present a credible argument for the source of that risk. He believes that citing the risk of recursive covenants without presenting a credible argument for the source of that risk can come across as (at best) stop energy and (at worst) FUD.</summary>
