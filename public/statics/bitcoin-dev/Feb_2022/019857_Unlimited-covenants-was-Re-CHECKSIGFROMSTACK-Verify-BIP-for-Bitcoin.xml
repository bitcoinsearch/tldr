    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Anthony Towns suggested that a government could enforce KYC by requiring funds to be deposited into a multisig of "2 2 CHECKMULTISIG", and refuse to sign with gov_key unless the funds are spent to a new address that follows the same rules. Matt Corallo responded that this point neuters anti-covenant arguments strongly, but he did not further elaborate on why. This idea was originally credited to Ethan Heilman in a tweet from 2019 and was later mentioned in Andrew Poelstra's "CAT and Schnorr Tricks II" post from February 2021.</summary>
