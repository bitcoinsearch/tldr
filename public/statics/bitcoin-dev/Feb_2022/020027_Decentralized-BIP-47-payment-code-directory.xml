    <summary>Recently, there has been discussion on Twitter about BIP 47 and its potential for improving privacy. However, some developers believe that it spams Bitcoin without actually improving anything. Additionally, the only implementation of BIP 47 currently in use is Paynym, a centralized payment code directory managed by Samourai wallet, which could raise concerns about privacy and security. The author proposes using TXT records and domains to address these issues. They provide a proof of concept using GNS (GNU Name Service) to create a payment code for Alice, add it as a TXT record with an expiry date, and check it. Similarly, they suggest using `gnunet-publish` to replace notification transactions. These solutions could potentially help users avoid posting their bitcoin addresses on social media to receive donations. The author also includes links to related resources, including a Q&amp;A about accepting donations correctly and a new proposal for addressing privacy concerns.</summary>
