    <summary>The Bitcoin Core has a strong preference towards peers that listen on port 8333 and currently, it does not provide incoming connections to those who do not listen on this port. Prayank informs the community about automatic outgoing connections to a peer at addr:port if the port is not 8333. He clarifies that the discussion is solely based on this matter to avoid any confusion. The details and justifications regarding the same can be found in the PR available on GitHub. Vasil Dimov signs off with his email ID and a quote by Winston Churchill on diplomacy.</summary>
