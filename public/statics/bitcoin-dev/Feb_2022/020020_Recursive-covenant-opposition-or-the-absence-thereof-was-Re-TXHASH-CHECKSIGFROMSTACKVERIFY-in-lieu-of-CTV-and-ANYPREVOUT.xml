    <summary>The cost of changing the ownership set with sidechains is discussed. A 32-byte commitment in the coinbase is required for a block to be produced, and transfers on the sidechain cannot be real without a sidechain block committed on the main chain. The article compares this to channel factories, which do not require constant data publishing. Instead, all operations are summarized in a single commitment. It is argued that optimizing for continuous operation seems like a better tradeoff as new members will only arise in proportion to the birth rate. Sidechains require permission from miners to start a new chain, while LN does not. With LN, channels and channel factories do not require any permission as they are indistinguishable from ordinary transactions. However, gossip triggers after deep confirmation, making it too late for miners to censor the channel opening.</summary>
