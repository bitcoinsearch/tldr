    <summary>A developer named 0x0ff has set up an explorer for CTV Signet, which is now up and running. The explorer can be accessed at https://explorer.ctvsignet.com. Jeremy Rubin, who had been running a CTV signet for around a year, confirmed that syncability to this signet using https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/checktemplateverify-signet-23.0-alpha works fine and urged others to use it. Rubin also expressed his willingness to send signet coins to anyone interested in running an automatic faucet for the signet. In another thread, AJ expressed concern over the lack of real third-party experimentation on Jeremy's CTV signet, suggesting that merging the code (w/o activation) for signet would likely help users versus custom builds/parameters. Rubin agreed that real experimentation would be great and suggested that more regtest RPC test samples for regtests could be a sufficient in-between.</summary>
