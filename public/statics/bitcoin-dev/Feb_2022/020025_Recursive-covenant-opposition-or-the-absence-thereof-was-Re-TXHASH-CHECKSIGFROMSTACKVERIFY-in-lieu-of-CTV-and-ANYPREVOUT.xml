    <summary>In a discussion about the Lightning Network (LN), ZmnSCPxj suggests that channel factories meet two requirements for LN to work efficiently: the layer1 UTXO can never change and new part-owners have to have new pubkeys which are not known until after the channel is opened. However, Paul objects to this suggestion, stating that channel factories do not meet requirement #2 as they cannot grow to onboard new users. ZmnSCPxj disagrees and explains that it is possible to cut-through closure of one channel factory with the opening of another channel factory with the same 5 fixed pubkeys plus an additional 100 new fixed pubkeys. ZmnSCPxj also points out that onboarding new members requires onchain action, but the onchain action is only a 1-input-1-output transaction, and with Taproot the signature needed is just 64 bytes witness. Furthermore, he highlights that even without channel factories; the onboarding rate of LN is much higher than sidechains like Liquid or Rootstock. In response to Paul's argument that sidechains would be more efficient than channel factories, ZmnSCPxj states that the onboarding rate only needs to be as fast as the rate at which people want to join Bitcoin. Additionally, there is a real degradation of security in Drivechains compared to LN, and he is not convinced that the extra capacity is worth the loss of security. Finally, he suggests that separating the onboarding rate from the payment rate is a good thing because they can then design their structures differently.</summary>
