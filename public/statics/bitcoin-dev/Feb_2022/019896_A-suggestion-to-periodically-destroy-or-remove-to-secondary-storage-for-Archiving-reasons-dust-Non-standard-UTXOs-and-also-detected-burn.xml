    <summary>There are at least 5.7 million UTXOs ≤ 1000 Sat (~7%), 8.04 million ≤ 1$ (10%), and 13.5 million ≤ 0.0001BTC (17%). The first address on the list contains more than 1.7 million dust UTXOs, with a few real UTXOs holding the bulk of 415 BTC. BitInfoCharts has added a main link for dust analysis on their site where users can view the top 100 dustiest Bitcoin addresses. Additionally, there are similar but less severe cases, with ~394k UTXOs, 170k, 92k, 10*20k, 4or5 *14k, etc. There are also at least 2.7 million UTXOs coming from addresses with a higher balance to the interval numbers calculated in the previous email. BitInfoCharts may make their own report about this soon. Shymaa suggests that people who have holdings below ≤1000 Sat should find a low fee time in say a 6 month interval and collect those UTXOs into one of at least $5 (10.86m≤4.1$) or $1 (5.248m≤1$). During four days after showing the smaller intervals, those ≤1000Sat increased by ~2K every day with total holding increased by 0.01BTC. The number of ≤10,000 Sat increases by 4-8 k per day. It is important to remember that the number of addresses is a lower bound on the number of UTXOs.There is no reason fees could not be less than 1 sat in the future if fees climb, though this optimism depends on the fungibility (money-like-quality) of Bitcoin being maintained. It is possible for 1 sat to be worth over $100.00 in the future. While some have suggested deleting or trimming low-value UTXOs, this could be considered theft and potentially destroy useful funds that people own. It may be useful to investigate using amount as a heuristic about what to keep and for how long.There are currently no rules that demand any minimal fee for anything, and given uncertainty over how fee levels could evolve in the future, it's unclear what those rules, if any, should be.</summary>
