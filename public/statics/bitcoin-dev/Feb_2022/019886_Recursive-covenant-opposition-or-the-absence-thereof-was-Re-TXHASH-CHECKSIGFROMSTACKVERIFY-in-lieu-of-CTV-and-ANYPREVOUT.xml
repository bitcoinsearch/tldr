    <summary>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin did not have a specific response to a question regarding recursive covenants, but encouraged everyone to read a blog post he found helpful in understanding the terminology and categorizations of different properties that get lumped in with recursion. He also noted that recursion is often seen as shorthand for "powerful," but that it's important to distinguish whether the issue is just recursion or a combination of other properties. David A. Harding replied to Rubin's email, suggesting that any intelligent individuals opposed to recursive covenants should speak for themselves, as he believes that citing the risk of recursive covenants without presenting a credible argument feels like stop energy or FUD. Harding also provided a link to a previous discussion on the merits of allowing recursive covenants on the mailing list.</summary>
