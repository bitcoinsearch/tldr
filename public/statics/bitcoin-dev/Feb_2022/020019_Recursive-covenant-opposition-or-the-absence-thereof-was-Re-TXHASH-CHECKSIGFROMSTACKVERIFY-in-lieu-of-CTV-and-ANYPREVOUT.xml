    <summary>The email conversation discusses the limitations of Bitcoin's scalability and suggests using channel factories, which are N-of-N structures that use offchain technology to host multiple 2-of-2 channels. While one transaction is still required for all Bitcoin users, a single transaction can back several channels. Changing the ownership set of a channel factory is more expensive than sidechains, but continuous operation does not publish data. Channel factories have properties such as N-of-N, and graceful degradation that make them attractive options. The reason why channel factories do not exist yet is because of current offchain constructions such as Poon-Dryja and Decker-Wattenhofer. However, new recursive-covenant-enabling constructs may enable functionality equivalent to SIGHASH_NOINPUT and OP_CTV, which would reduce the number of bytes published, making scaling easier.</summary>
