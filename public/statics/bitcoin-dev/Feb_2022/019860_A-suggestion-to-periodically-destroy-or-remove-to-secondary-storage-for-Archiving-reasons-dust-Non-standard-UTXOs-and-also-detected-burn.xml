    <summary>The author of this proposal is suggesting a solution to the problem of a large number of UTXOs holding small amounts of Bitcoin. They propose deleting all of these UTXOs, along with non-standard UTXOs and burned ones. The benefits of doing so would include relieving the system state of the burden of around 3.8m UTXOs, adding to the scarcity of Bitcoin even with a very small amount like 14.9 BTC, and removing the risk of using any of these kinds for attacks as happened before. The parameters for optimal values could be studied further for the first delete, periodical interval, and delete threshold. This proposal could be beneficial in the long run as the number of dust UTXOs will probably increase with time.</summary>
