    <summary>A post was made on the subject of evictions, revivals, CTV, and TLUV. The post explains that CTV enables 1 person to be evicted in O(log N) or one person to leave in O(log N). TLUV enables 1 person to leave in O(1) O(log N) transactions, but evictions take (AFAICT?) O(N) O(log N) transactions because the un-live party stays in the pool. OP_EVICT helps also make it so you can kick someone out, rather than all having to leave, which is an improvement. A weakness of CTV is that the CoinPool has to be split up into many smaller pools and re-merging them requires waiting for on-chain confirmation. OP_EVICT lets the CoinPool revival be made into the same transaction that performs the evict. It is noted that Eltoo may not be good for high-value channels since punishments incentivize correct behavior. Unfortunately, it seems the way to any kind of N &gt; 2 construction *with* penalty would require bonds. Having a Decker-Russell-Osuntokun "factory" layer that hosts multiple Poon-Dryja channels is not quite a solution.</summary>
