    <summary>In an email exchange, ZmnSCPxj and Paul discussed the possibility of onboarding new users onto the Lightning Network (LN) without requiring new layer1 bytes. Paul suggested a technique that would allow for a "rich man" to open an LN channel and gradually transfer it to new people by adding new pubkeys to the membership set without any onchain action. However, ZmnSCPxj disagreed, stating that changing the membership set requires an onchain action. The discussion then shifted towards the use of channel factories and the potential risks associated with large factories. Paul also questioned ZmnSCPxj's belief that separating the onboarding rate from the payment rate is a good thing, arguing that it can lead to a degradation in security.</summary>
