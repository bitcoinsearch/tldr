    <summary>The author is suggesting that sacrificing immediate losses for a chance at a simpler policy that encourages higher adoption of Bitcoin or more on-chain activity due to higher adoption of Bitcoin protocols like lightning is an economically rational choice. The author questions whether a few developers should decide RBF policy for miners and suggests that changes in policy could impact on-chain activity, which is dependent on many factors. The author also notes that the contribution of the lightning network to on-chain activity is less than 1% in fees, based on a chart provided in a link.</summary>
