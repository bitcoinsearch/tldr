    <summary>In the conversation, ZmnSCPxj discusses the rejection of Drivechains and how it relates to a general construct. They argue that not providing X because it can only be used for E doesn't necessarily mean not providing Z, which can be used for both G and E. The conversation then turns to objections to merging in BIP-300, with most NACKs being due to the belief that "Drivechains are bad" rather than a rejection of the general construct. ZmnSCPxj argues that those who objected to BIP-300 must take a clear stance on whether they believe Drivechains are bad or not. Finally, they discuss the idea that adding dedicated consensus features for Drivechains is a bad idea without widespread consensus, but people should be free to use it if they aren't asking for consensus changes.</summary>
