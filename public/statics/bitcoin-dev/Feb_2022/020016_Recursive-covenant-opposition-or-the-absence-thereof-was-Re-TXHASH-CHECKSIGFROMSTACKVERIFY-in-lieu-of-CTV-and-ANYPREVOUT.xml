    <summary>The discussion in the email thread revolves around the use of recursive covenants and their potential impact on Bitcoin. While drivechains are not a scaling solution, they could allow people to build user-space drivechains without negatively affecting normal Bitcoin users. However, there is concern that recursive covenants may enable other techniques that could have negative effects on Bitcoin or be considered undesirable by a significant section of the user base. The principle of least power is a good one, but it cannot be dogma. A study on the kind of things recursive covenants allows would be valuable. If there is consensus that drivechains are not bad, adding recursive covenants can be done through separate soft forks.</summary>
