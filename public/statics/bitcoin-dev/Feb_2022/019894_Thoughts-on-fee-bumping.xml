    <summary>The discussion involved a disagreement/misunderstanding about the impact of decreasing the miner's reward in an example given. The rule of increasing feerate was questioned for not always being economically rational, and it was noted that a miner with only 1.5vMB of transactions may be interested in maximizing absolute fees instead of feerate. While there could be an argument for needing a large backlog of transactions in the long term, it was said to not be in line with today's reality. In response to this, someone stated that it is not that simple because if a miner has less than 1vMB of transactions in their mempool, they would not want a 10sats/vb transaction paying 100000sats over a 100sats/vb transaction paying only 10000sats. There was confusion about why the consideration was being made since miners would just include the entire mempool in the next block regardless of feerate. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
