    <summary>In an email conversation, a person named Prayank mentioned Satoshi in regards to Bitcoin development. However, ZmnSCPxj objected to the invocation of Satoshi and stated that if he wants to participate in Bitcoin development today, he can speak for himself. ZmnSCPxj also added that if Satoshi refuses to participate in Bitcoin development today, his opinion does not matter. The email went on to discuss various arguments being presented.</summary>
