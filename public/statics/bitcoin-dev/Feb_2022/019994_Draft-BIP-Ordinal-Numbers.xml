    <summary>The proposal aims to use dust for valuable purposes, instead of reducing its creation. The idea is to split dust into its unit satoshis and use them for NFTs or colored coins. The proposal has received positive feedback, with one person suggesting that having a standard would be better than everyone doing their own thing. However, there are concerns about what happens when payment precision increases by going sub-satoshi on chain. The proposal also mentions that if a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in the UTXO set, the new transaction outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the ordinals contained in any unspent outputs of the first transaction. However, there is confusion about the exact meaning of this sentence, and it is suggested that it be reworded. Discussion also arises about the issue of stolen bitcoins and blacklisted coins, which the proposal does not address. Finally, the question is raised about using zero satoshis for NFTs but not colored coins, which could be an interesting idea in itself.</summary>
