    <summary>The discussion is centered around the validity of transactions in Bitcoin. While some argue that once a valid transaction is created, it should not become invalid later on unless the inputs are double-spent, others do not see this as a major concern. The argument against this is that in a 6 block reorg, any transaction that is moved past its expiration date becomes invalid and all its descendants become invalid too. However, the current consensus threshold for transactions to become invalid is a 100 block reorg, which many see no reason to change. It is argued that there is no practical downside to transactions that can become invalid for anyone waiting the standard 6 confirmations. The only real risk exists for people not waiting for standard finalization. If a specific practical problem case is identified, an easy solution would be to simply allow sponsorship transactions to be mined on or after the sponsored transaction is mined. Finally, a promise is made to personally build a wallet that always creates transactions on the verge of becoming invalid should anyone ever implement a feature that violates this tx validity principle.</summary>
