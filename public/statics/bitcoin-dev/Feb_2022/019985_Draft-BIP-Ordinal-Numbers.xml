    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user damian--- raised concerns about the practicality of numbering each satoshi created. They questioned how this would work for transactions where zero satoshis are created or moved, which can currently be found in the blockchain. While typical users cannot create these types of transactions, miners are capable of doing so. Additionally, the user was worried about the potential cost of implementing a system to handle the large number of ordinal numbers that would result from numbering each satoshi.Casey Rodarmor responded by explaining that newly mined satoshis are sequentially numbered using ordinal numbers, and when they are spent in a transaction, the input satoshi ordinal numbers are assigned to output satoshis using a first-in-first-out algorithm. The user who originally raised the concern responded by suggesting that the first 100,000,000 ordinal numbers could be assigned to the first Bitcoin created from mining block-reward, with the remaining ordinal numbers being assigned to change or fees. Overall, the discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list focused on the practicality of numbering each satoshi created and the potential challenges associated with such an implementation.</summary>
