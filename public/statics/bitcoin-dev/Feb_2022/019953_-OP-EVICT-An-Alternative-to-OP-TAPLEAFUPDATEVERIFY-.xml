    <summary>ZmnSCPxj clarified that the Decker-Russell-Osunstokun paper does not prevent imposing a penalty for cheating attempts in fully punitive channels. He suggested that participants could still retain per-participant versions of update+state transactions and deduct the fee from their main owned funds, similar to the per-participant commitment transactions of Poon-Dryja. The paper just focuses on the mechanism without regard to fees, assuming that the reader already knows they exist and need to be paid.</summary>
