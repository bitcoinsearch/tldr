    <summary>The discussion is about the opt-in or explicit tagging of fee accounts as a bad design. The writer argues that having an explicit key required means you have to pre-plan, which may not be feasible if one is building a vault meant to distribute funds over many years. Furthermore, it's quite often the case that someone might do a transaction that pays you that is a low fee that you want to bump but they choose to opt-out. It's better that you should always be able to fee bump. The writer then discusses the necromancing attack and its potential targets. To his knowledge, there is no actual entity that currently acts this way. In particular, he expects that many users do not make outgoing payments often enough that they would actually benefit from such a wallet feature. The attacker cannot gain, and can only pay in order to impose costs on somebody else. Finally, the writer asks if anyone has implemented a Bitcoin wallet that has such a feature and if so, can they open-source the code and show him?</summary>
