    <summary>The writer of the context believes that not all people who have been stolen from lose their right and title to what was stolen. Although Bitcoins cannot be individually identified, the writer does not care about their history as long as they receive them honestly. They believe that it is not the responsibility of an ordinal to determine if a satoshi is fungible or not. The writer also expresses their views on the possibility of someone claiming their stolen Bitcoin back. According to them, it is unlikely that a previous owner of an ordinal would have any particular reason to expect ownership after they transfer it. Additionally, the BIP states that since any ordinal can be sent to any address at any time, transferred ordinals should be considered fungible with other satoshis with no public history. The writer provides a link to the BIP for reference.</summary>
