    <summary>The fourth CTV meeting will be held on an upcoming day with a focus on tutorials. The attendees are encouraged to do some preparation before attending the meeting. The first topic of discussion will be the objective of Signet and the decision function of observations from a test network. The team will also discuss which applications should be prototyped and fleshed out while considering what level of detail is necessary. They will also consider whether they should add other experiments like APO/Sponsors to the mix as well as lightning working on this signet.The second topic of discussion will be connecting to CTV Signet Tutorial, where they will ensure that everyone who wants to be part of it can join and debug any issues. Ahead of the meeting, the attendees are requested to build a branch from https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/checktemplateverify-signet-23.0-alpha and connect to [signet] signetchallenge=512102946e8ba8eca597194e7ed90377d9bbebc5d17a9609ab3e35e706612ee882759351ae and addnode=50.18.75.225.The third topic of discussion will be receiving coins/sending coins, where there is a faucet for this signet at https://faucet.ctvsignet.com and an explorer at https://explorer.ctvsignet.com.The fourth topic of discussion will be Sapio tutorial, where attendees are requested to skim through https://learn.sapio-lang.org and download/build the sapio cli &amp; plugin examples ahead of the meeting. The team will then try to get everyone building and sending a basic application such as congestion control tree or vault on the signet. The fifth topic of discussion will be Sapio Q&amp;A after some experience playing with Sapio and more general discussion about the project and what it may accomplish.
