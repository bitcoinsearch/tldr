    <summary>Jeremy Rubin had suggested a design that introduces recursive covenants, which Rusty acknowledged as a good point. However, Rusty notes that iterative covenants are possible with OP_CTV and just as powerful, though technically finite. He gives an example of how he can constrain the next 100M spends by insisting on incrementing nLocktime, which would be effectively forever.</summary>
