    <summary>Teleport, a new software, has been developed to improve the privacy of bitcoin transactions. It uses a technique called CoinSwap, which makes it difficult for anyone analyzing the blockchain to determine where the coins have gone. Users who do not use the software will also benefit from improved privacy because their transactions will look like CoinSwap transactions. The value of privacy is high in a world where data collection is becoming increasingly prevalent. The uncertainty added to every transaction by the possibility of a CoinSwap would greatly boost the fungibility of Bitcoin and make it a better form of money.The Teleport project is decentralized and available for free but is currently only usable by developers and power-users. Although it is possible to run it on mainnet, it can only be used with small amounts, and the next big task is to make the multisig addresses look like regular single-sig addresses to provide an enormous anonymity set. The goal of the Teleport project is to develop into a practical and secure project on the bitcoin mainnet, either as a standalone bitcoin mixing app or as a library that existing wallets will implement. Donors have played a crucial role in supporting the development of the project, and further donations are welcome. With the development of Teleport, Bitcoin users can enjoy greater privacy and security while conducting transactions.</summary>
