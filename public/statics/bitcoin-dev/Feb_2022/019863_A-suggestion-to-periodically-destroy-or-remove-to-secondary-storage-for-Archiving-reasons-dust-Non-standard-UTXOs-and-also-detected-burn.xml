    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille proposed a solution to the increasing size of the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set in Bitcoin's blockchain. By deleting or moving to secondary storage all UTXOs with a value â‰¤ 0.000001 BTC (1000 Sat), which comprise over 3.1 million addresses with a total value of 14.9 BTC, the UTXO set size could be reduced. However, this proposal may be considered theft and could result in the destruction of potentially useful funds that people own. Moreover, miners have no reason to require a higher price for spending such outputs, which makes it unclear what the rules, if any, should be regarding minimal fees for anything. The discussion also touched on the fact that full nodes do not need an additional store of outputs, as transactions already contain them, and a full node requires all of them, spent or otherwise. While some full node implementations use a UTXO model, others like Libbitcoin never have.</summary>
