    <summary>In a recent post on the Bitcoin forum, Lucky Star has expressed opposition to recursive covenants in Bitcoin. According to Lucky Star, these covenants enable the government to gradually restrict all bitcoins, which would ultimately lead to the government controlling more bitcoins each day. In contrast, without covenants, other miners can fork to a free blockchain if the government tells miners each transaction to be added in the block. Bitcoin experts Greg Maxwell and Peter Todd have also explained this reason and many others on the forum. Additionally, more experts have agreed with Lucky Star's position, making it common knowledge. Lucky Star strongly recommends supporting OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, which is well-reviewed and protects the Bitcoin community from the bad effects of covenants. With OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, the community achieves the best of both worlds. The issue of recursive covenants was previously discussed on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, with no one opposing the idea. However, Dave, who responded to the discussion, suggests that anyone opposed to recursive covenants should speak for themselves and present credible arguments for the source of the risk instead of citing FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</summary>
