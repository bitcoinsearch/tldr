    <summary>In a recent email to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin brought up the topic of recursive covenants and whether they should be allowed or not. He deferred to others on the issue, but noted that the last time the topic was discussed at length on the list, no one voiced opposition to the idea. Dave suggested that anyone opposed to recursive covenants should speak up, as citing the risk of them without presenting a credible argument feels like "stop energy" or FUD. The email includes links to the previous discussion on the topic and an explanation of "stop energy."</summary>
