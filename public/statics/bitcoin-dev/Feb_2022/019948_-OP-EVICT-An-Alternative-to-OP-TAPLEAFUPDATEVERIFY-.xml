    <summary>Bitcoin developers are discussing the tradeoffs of punitive channels and their impact on large value channels. While fully punitive channels can encourage correct behavior, they can also make such channels more dangerous from the perspective of bugs causing old states to be published. Non-punitive channels like Eltoo may not be suitable for high-value channels as they do not provide enough punishment to deter cheating attempts. The discussion also covers evictions, revivals, CTV, TLUV, and OP_EVICT, a redesigned version of OP_TLUV that allows participants to evict an offline participant and continue operating with a smaller N-of-N group.The conversation about updateable schemes like CoinPool focuses on preventing signature replay and the use of `OP_TLUV` or `OP_EVICT` to reduce the number of eviction transactions while reviving the scheme. Signatures are shared at state setup, but each update should use a different pubkey for each participant to prevent signature replay. There is a debate about which option to use, with `OP_TLUV` preventing equivocation among signers and `OP_EVICT` allowing multiple evictions and revivals in a single transaction. ZmnSCPxj's previous thoughts on revivable constructs with eviction of participants are also referenced.Overall, the main focus of the Bitcoin developers is on developing efficient and secure methods of updating updateable schemes like CoinPool.</summary>
