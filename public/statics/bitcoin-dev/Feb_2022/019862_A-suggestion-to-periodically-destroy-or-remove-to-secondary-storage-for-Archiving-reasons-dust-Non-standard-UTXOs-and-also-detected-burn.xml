    <summary>The author of the letter is proposing a solution to address the issue of over 3.1 million bitcoin addresses holding less than or equal to 0.000001 BTC (1000 Sat) with a total value of 14.9BTC. The proposed solution is to delete these addresses, which would be a soft-fork and could potentially be considered theft. Dropping them entirely from the UTXO set could also destroy potentially useful funds people own. A possible alternative solution is to remove them to secondary storage for archiving with extra cost to get them back, along with non-standard UTXOs and burnt ones. This could be implemented as a standardness rule, but it makes policy deviate from economically rational behavior. There is no reason for miners to require a higher price for spending such outputs. As a consensus rule, it may be controversial since there are currently no rules that demand any minimal fee for anything, and it's unclear what those rules, if any, should be.</summary>
