    <summary>The conversation is discussing the use of Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) to solve a complicated and offchain-y issue with relative locktimes in Bitcoin Vaults. The recommended design for Vaults typically involves CSV CHECKSIG, CHECKSIG or CTV where an output can only be spent after it hits maturity but can be kicked to recovery any time before that. However, if waiting for one of these outputs to be created on chain, spending from the hot key is not possible until it confirms on chain first. To CPFP, a separate output just for CPFPing is needed or some sort of RBF-able addable input/output or sponsors.</summary>
