    <summary>In a conversation between Zac and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the possibility of saving more space in UTXO systems like Bitcoin. ZmnSCPxj suggests that the data-transaction does not need to specify any output and that the network could subtract the fee amount directly from the specified UTXO. However, Zac clarifies that either the entire UTXO must be consumed or it cannot be touched at all. Additionally, fees are never explicit in Bitcoin and are always calculated as the difference between total input amount minus the total output amount. The fee rate is then computed from the fee divided by the transaction weight. ZmnSCPxj proposes that the calculation of the fee should only marginally cheaper to use this new construct over using one or more transactions. If the balance of the selected UTXO is insufficient to pay for the data then the transaction will be invalid. They also discuss whether this approach would require a hardfork or softfork.</summary>
