    <summary>The focus of the meeting was to get CTV Signet up and running and test out some contracts. However, no conclusions were reached regarding the goals of a signet. It is uncertain how much interest people will have in Signet with CTV compared to other forks that are more readily available. During the tutorial section, participants faced difficulties due to local environments and brittle bash scripts. Nevertheless, they were able to complete the tutorial during the session and their transactions can be seen on the provided links.Future tutorials will continue to try new contracts, but the GUI will also be utilized instead of just the CLI.</summary>
