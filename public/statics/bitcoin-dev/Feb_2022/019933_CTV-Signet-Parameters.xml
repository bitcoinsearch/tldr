    <summary>A new explorer for CTV Signet has been set up and is now operational at [https://explorer.ctvsignet.com](https://explorer.ctvsignet.com/). The announcement was made by [@0x0ff](https://twitter.com/0x0ff_) on a Bitcoin development group. In a separate message on the same group, Jeremy Rubin shared his experience of running a CTV signet for a year, which has seen little use. He also provided details on how to sync with the signet using https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/checktemplateverify-signet-23.0-alpha. Rubin invited developers to test the signet and requested help in setting up an automatic faucet. AJ, another member of the group, expressed concerns about the lack of real-world testing for CTV signet, while Rubin agreed that merging the code for the signet (without activation) would likely help users compared to custom builds/parameters. Rubin suggested that more regtest RPC test samples may be sufficient for in-between testing.</summary>
