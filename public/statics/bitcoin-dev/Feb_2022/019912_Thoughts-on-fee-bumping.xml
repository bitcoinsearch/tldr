    <summary>In a 6 block reorg, any transaction that is moved beyond its expiration date becomes invalid along with all its descendants. However, the transaction sponsors design does not increase this risk, as long as sponsored txids are included in the current block or prior blocks. Sponsored txids act as virtual inputs to the sponsor transaction and do not pose a problem like transaction expiry based on wall-clock time or block height which can complicate reorgs significantly.</summary>
