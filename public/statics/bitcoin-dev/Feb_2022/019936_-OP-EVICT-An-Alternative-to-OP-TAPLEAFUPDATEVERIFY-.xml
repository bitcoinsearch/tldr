    <summary>In a discussion on lightning-dev mailing list, Erik proposed a counterproposal to ZmnSCPxj's earlier proposal. According to Erik's proposal, every evicted participant would require publishing one transaction each and each participant has to store `N!` possible orderings of participants who can be evicted. On the other hand, ZmnSCPxj suggested that if channel factories are used, then it would be best to treat each channel as a 2-of-2 that participates in an overall N-of-N. This would allow for easier eviction of participants by evicting the signers related to that specific participant. However, this approach increases the number of transactions that need to be evicted and the number of signatures that need to be exchanged during setup.</summary>
