    <summary>It is unlikely that a previous owner of an ordinal would challenge the current holder regarding their stolen Bitcoin. This is because transferring ownership of an ordinal does not give the previous owner any claim to it after transfer, similar to how noting a dollar bill's serial number does not give one a claim to it after spending it. According to the BIP, ordinals that are transferred should be considered fungible with other satoshis with no history attached to them.</summary>
