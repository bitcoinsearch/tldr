    <summary>The discussion revolves around potential changes to the Bitcoin system, including the possibility of introducing a Monero-like system that hides coin amounts. However, it is noted that such a change would make it impossible to audit the blockchain and verify inflation levels, so it is unlikely that Bitcoin will adopt this approach. Instead, there is consideration of increasing payment precision by going sub-satoshi on chain, which could be extended to ordinals through the use of fraction ordinals like 1.1 or 4.85. While a concrete proposal is not yet possible, the idea is being explored. There is also discussion around the use of duplicate transaction IDs, which was once possible but is now prevented by the BIP 34 soft fork. The BIP defines the ordinal ranges for transactions with duplicate IDs, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core. The need for this rule is being explained in more detail in the BIP.</summary>
