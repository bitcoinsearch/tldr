    <summary>In a conversation between two individuals, the possibility of implementing techniques that would have previously required their own consensus change purely in recursive covenants is discussed. The example of Drivechains is used to demonstrate this possibility. The conversation also touches on the issue of whether there are any limitations to what can be achieved with recursive covenants, with one individual expressing interest in knowing what is not possible. The idea of adding `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` and `OP_CTV` before implementing recursive covenants is suggested. Overall, the conversation suggests that separate soft forks could be used to achieve different goals.</summary>
