    <summary>In an email exchange posted on a Bitcoin forum, Prayank objects to ZmnSCPxj's invocation of Satoshi, stating that he cares about Satoshi's opinions, especially if consensus rules remain unchanged regarding subsidies. ZmnSCPxj counters by arguing that if Satoshi refuses to participate in Bitcoin development today, it doesn't matter what his opinion is. He also asserts that Satoshi is dead and that Bitcoin lives on without him. Prayank objects to this assumption, insisting that Satoshi is more than just a pseudonym and will live on forever. The email exchange ends with both parties acknowledging they are considering the various arguments being presented.</summary>
