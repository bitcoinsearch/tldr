    <summary>In an email exchange between Zac and ZmnSCPxj regarding Bitcoin's UTXO system, Zac proposed a way to save space by allowing partial spending of a UTXO without specifying an output or fee. ZmnSCPxj pointed out that this goes against the core design philosophy of the UTXO system, which requires either complete consumption of a UTXO or no touch at all, and that fees are always implicit in Bitcoin. Zac suggested that the fee rate could be specified with only one byte, and the fee calculated by both the network and sender based on payload size and preset rules. However, explicitly specifying the fee amount may be more transparent. Zac acknowledged that his proposal is unlikely to become a reality due to breaking the UTXO system's design and existing software. ZmnSCPxj also warned that reducing weight calculations to reduce data cost relative to OP_RETURN would require a hardfork.</summary>
