    <summary>In a proposal for a new key in the global context for BIP174, Partially-Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT), Jimmy suggests adding a key-value pair to indicate the network that the coins are on. Each signer should ensure that the inputs being referenced in the PSBT exist, except for a Proof-of-Reserves input. Therefore, it is crucial to know which network the coins are on, whether mainnet or testnet. The key proposed is 0x03 for network in the global key-value store, with a variable integer value. The value 0x00 would indicate Bitcoin mainnet, while 0x01 would indicate Bitcoin testnet. Other coins that want to use the PSBT should use the coin network number from SLIP-0044 with the high bit removed. This proposal could potentially be extended to other networks.</summary>
