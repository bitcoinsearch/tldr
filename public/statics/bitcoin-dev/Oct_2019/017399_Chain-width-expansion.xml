    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Braydon Fuller stated that using the block height in the coinbase is not feasible for validation purposes since it requires previous headers. It was then mentioned that the lowest digest for a blockchain represents the total chainwork and the formula to estimate total hash count was provided. Producing a fake set of 10 headers that give a higher work estimate than the main chain would require as much effort as building an alternative chain. To trace back to genesis for one of those headers, following the actual chain is necessary.</summary>
