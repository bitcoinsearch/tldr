    <summary>The email suggests changing the term "address" in wallets and URI schemes to something that better indicates that it is temporary and identifies the recipient, such as "Payment Password" or "Transaction Password". The author argues that the current use of the term "address" leads to people sending bitcoins multiple times to the same address, which is not a good approach. The author suggests that using a term like "password" could function as a pseudonym to identify a person. Feedback on the idea is welcomed, and the author is considering writing an Informational/Process BIP on the topic.</summary>
