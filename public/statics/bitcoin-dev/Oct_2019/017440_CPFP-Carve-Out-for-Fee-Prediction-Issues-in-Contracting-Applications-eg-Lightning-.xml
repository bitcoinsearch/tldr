    <summary>In an email exchange, David A. Harding pointed out that a parent transaction near the limit of 100,000 vbytes could have almost 10,000 outputs paying OP_TRUE (10 vbytes per output). This would allow relaying 100 megabytes or nearly 400 MB data size. Johan suggested special casing to only allow this for "LN commitment-like" transactions, but noted that this would be application specific changes. They are moving forward with adding a 1 block delay to all outputs to utilize the current carve-out rule. Joost's post in "[PATCH] First draft of option_simplfied_commitment" provides more information on the changes.</summary>
