    <summary>The timewarp attack is a problem that hasn't been mentioned in the Bitcoin-dev community yet. Joachim Str√∂mbergson explains the possibility of a malicious node generating a much longer chain with a superslow timestamp increase without increasing difficulty, which could produce a chain 2500 times longer than the main chain without having multiple branches. Tier Nolan suggests that this can be fixed by limiting the maximum difference between the timestamp for the first header in a period and the last header in the previous period through a basic soft fork. This solution has been included in a draft proposal called "The Great Consensus Cleanup" and would need to be effective not only for the main chain but also for any future forked chain.</summary>
