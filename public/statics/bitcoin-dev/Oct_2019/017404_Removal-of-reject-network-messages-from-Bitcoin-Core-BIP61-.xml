    <summary>On October 16, 2019 at 6:43 pm, John Newbery sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing the support for BIP 61 REJECT messages in Bitcoin Core version 0.19. Despite previous discussions about removing this support, it was ultimately decided that REJECT messages would not be removed and instead, they will be disabled by default in the upcoming release. However, users can still enable them by using the `-enablebip61` command line option.In response to this information, a question was raised regarding the possibility of using a NODE_* bit to select peers who support this feature. The NODE_* bit would be a useful tool for this purpose.</summary>
