    <summary>A proposal has been made to excise `SIGHASH` flags attached to signatures from Bitcoin. The feature was deemed a misdesign retained from the original BitCoin 0.1.0 Alpha for Windows design. Other features on par with it include `OP_CAT`, `OP_MULT`, and `OP_ADD`. A new opcode, `OP_SETPUBKEYSIGHASH`, has been proposed that retains the old feature where the sighash is selected at time-of-spending rather than time-of-payment. The opcode makes it possible to hide public keys away until they are needed, exemplified in MAST-inside-Taproot. By default, public keys will not have an attached `SIGHASH` byte, implying `SIGHASH_ALL` (and disallowing-by-default non-`SIGHASH_ALL`). Removing `SIGHASH` from signatures would automatically output tagging to allow particular `SIGHASH`.</summary>
