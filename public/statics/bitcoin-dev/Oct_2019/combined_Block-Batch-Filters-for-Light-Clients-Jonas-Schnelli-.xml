    <summary>The email discusses the creation of filters for part of mempool or the whole mempool. The current mempool filter design with a set of transactions makes it impossible to use for block filter reconstruction because there is no mapping filter elements with transactions. This means that downloading the block filter is necessary to check which transactions are affected, which does not provide advantages in terms of traffic savings.The idea of draft for mempool transaction filters is to make it possible to reconstruct correct block filters using unconfirmed tx filters and archive additional savings. The email also mentions working on Block Batch Filters implementation and having changes that will be updated in drafts as soon as all tests are complete.The author asks for the recipient's opinion on fingerprinting defense and the disadvantages of the per tx filter approach. Additionally, the author asks why using the whole/part mempool is better. After a new block is mined, the transactions confirmed from mempool need to be verified, and using the whole/part mempool can provide advantages in terms of traffic savings.</summary>
