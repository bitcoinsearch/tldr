    <title>Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil suggested that the P2P protocol change to support the reject message should be exposed as a version increment and a BIP. He referenced BIP61 which states that all implementations of the P2P protocol version 70,002 and later should support the reject message. However, David A. Harding did not think a new BIP or version number increment was necessary. He pointed out that "should support" is not the same as "must support", and that implementations with protocol versions above 70,002 are not required to support the reject message. Additionally, if an implementation does not implement a BIP, it is not bound by its conditions. This discussion also touched on the fact that Bitcoin Core no longer supports BIP61 per its documentation.</summary>
