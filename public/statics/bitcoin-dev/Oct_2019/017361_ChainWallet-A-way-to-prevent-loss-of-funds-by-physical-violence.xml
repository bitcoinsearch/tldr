    <summary>A proposal has been made by Saulo Fonseca to create a key stretching as an additional layer of protection for hodlers' wallets. However, the user cannot prove that they are using this technique or petertodd's timelock encryption, giving attackers little incentive to stop physically attacking until they have a spendable UTXO. It has been suggested that on-chain timelocks, delete-the-bits plus a rangeproof and a zero-knowledge proof, or a similar thought proposed by adam3us, could achieve the same effect. Jeremy Rubin also had an idea for such a proof. The link to adam3us's described thought can be found at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=311000.0.</summary>
