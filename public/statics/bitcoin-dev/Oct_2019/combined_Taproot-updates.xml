    <summary>Pieter, a Bitcoin developer, recently provided updates on some changes made to the bip-schnorr/taproot/tapscript drafts. These changes were made following discussions on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One of the changes includes using 32-byte public keys instead of 33-byte ones, which aims for more efficient chain usage and no gratuitous fungibility loss. Additionally, P2SH support was dropped, and the limit on the depth of Merkle trees has been increased from 32 to 128. Furthermore, the 10000 byte script limit and 201 non-push opcode limit were also dropped as they serve no purpose and only complicate the creation of Scripts. The reference implementation was updated on GitHub, and there were many clarifications and rationales added. It is worth noting that these changes aim to improve the efficiency and functionality of Bitcoin. Overall, these updates are expected to be beneficial to the Bitcoin community in the long run.</summary>
