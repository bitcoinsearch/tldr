    <summary>On Github, a request has been made for a co-author for a BIP. The link to the BIP is provided in the message, along with the mention of Marco Falke who requested the co-author. Falke's reasons for requesting a co-author are not specified. The message also includes an attachment named pEpkey.asc, which is a PGP key with a size of 3147 bytes. It is unclear how this key is related to the BIP or the request for a co-author.Overall, the message provides limited information about the situation and leaves many questions unanswered.</summary>
