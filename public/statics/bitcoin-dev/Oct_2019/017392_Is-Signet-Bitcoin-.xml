    <title>Is Signet Bitcoin?</title>

    <summary>A recent pull request to add Signet to the BIPs repository has stalled as the maintainer is unsure if Signet should even have a BIP at all. One argument for Signet's inclusion is that it is indeed Bitcoin and having a BIP would facilitate interoperability between different software in the Bitcoin space. However, others argue that Signet is not Bitcoin but rather "interoperability for how to build good testing for Bitcoin." Feedback on the issue is welcome on the pull request itself or on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
