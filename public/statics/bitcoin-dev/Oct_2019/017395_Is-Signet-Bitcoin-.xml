    <summary>There is a problem with the reliability of Testnet, which is often used for the development of Bitcoin. To address this issue and improve the development environment for Bitcoin, there has been a proposal to create a new kind of testnet that is more reliable. However, there is some debate about whether Signet should be considered a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and why Testnet is considered Bitcoin while Signet is not, as both are not completely compatible with the mainnet consensus processes. Jon is interested in hearing the logic behind these distinctions.</summary>
