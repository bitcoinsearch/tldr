    <summary>In a post on bitcoin-dev, Anthony Towns discussed the potential risks associated with anyprevout signatures in Bitcoin transactions. He noted that such signatures could make the address being signed for less safe, potentially resulting in loss of funds if additional coins are sent to the same address. However, another user pointed out that address re-use is often outside of the control of the address owner, as when an address is given to a counterparty who subsequently decides to re-use it. This could create problems in the industry and should be avoided, as all proper wallet implementations try to enforce against address re-use. Additionally, there are many use cases where P2SH addresses are designed to be re-used multiple times over time. The user argued that indexing the blockchain shows that address re-use is more common than desirable, and that preventing it without negatively impacting users' economic interests is difficult.</summary>
