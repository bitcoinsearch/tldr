    <summary>In a recent message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Emil Engler proposed changing the term "address" in bitcoin wallets and URI schemes to something that better reflects its purpose. He argues that the current use of the term "address" leads to misunderstandings, as people tend to associate it with something fixed and permanent, like a postal address or email address. As a result, many people send bitcoins to an address multiple times, which is not ideal. Engler suggests using terms like "payment password" or "transaction password" instead. He believes these terms convey the idea that the identifier is temporary and that it identifies the recipient. However, some members of the mailing list pointed out that neither the address nor pubkey are actually passwords. They suggest alternative terms like "invoice id" or "payment token." The proposal would require an Informational/Process BIP, but there is some skepticism about whether this would be effective. While the idea has generated some discussion, no formal action has been taken yet.</summary>
