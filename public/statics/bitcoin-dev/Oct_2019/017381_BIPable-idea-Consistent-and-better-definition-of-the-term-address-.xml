    <summary>The bitcoin community has been discussing the concept of a bitcoin invoice, with some members proposing it for a while. A proposal by Chris Belcher to convert the invoice address into a bitcoin address gained support from Kalle Alm, who tweeted about it. Emil Engler sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list to thank everyone for their feedback on the issue and stated that he had decided to write a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for this. Although it may not be implemented by many wallets, standardization is never wrong, and this would be the first step in the correct direction for better on-chain privacy.However, there is still a need for a good term to replace the word 'address.' Several suggestions have been made, including Invoice ID, Payment Token, Bitcoin Invoice (address), and Bitcoin Invoice (path). Emil Engler expressed a preference for the term 'Bitcoin Invoice' proposed by Chris Belcher due to the LN term invoice. The question remains as to how to find a consensus about these terms.</summary>
