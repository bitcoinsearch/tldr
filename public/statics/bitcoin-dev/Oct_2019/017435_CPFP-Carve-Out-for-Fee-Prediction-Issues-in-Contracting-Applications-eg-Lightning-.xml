    <summary>In an email thread, Johan Tor√•s Halseth suggested a new rule for mempool transactions. He proposed that the last transaction added to a package of dependent transactions in the mempool must have no more than one unconfirmed parent. However, Dave pointed out that this proposal could create a free relay attack where an attacker could send zillions of child transactions with slightly higher feerate than T until the mempool is full and then create one small transaction with a feerate just higher than T's and watch T and all its children get evicted. To prevent such risks, Bitcoin Core attempts to optimize the mempool in order to maximize miner profit and ensure miners continue to use public transaction relay. A document was added to the Bitcoin Core developer wiki, which describes these risks and mitigation strategies. This information can be useful in understanding the current state of mempool transactions and ways to improve it.</summary>
