    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeremy suggests using a script that would hash all the elements on the stack and compare to a known hash to avoid midstate attacks. However, this approach is questioned as it offers no advantage over OP_CAT. The size of the script is also limited, making OP_CAT just as effective as SHA256STREAM.
