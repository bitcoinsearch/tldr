    <summary>A proposal has been made to change the term "Bitcoin address" to something more temporary and identifying in order to discourage repeated use of the same receiving address. The term "address" is often associated with fixed and unchanging objects, leading people to believe that it can be used multiple times. The suggestion is to use terms such as "Payment Password" or "Transaction Password" instead. Emil Engler suggests that using a temporary pseudonym to identify a person would help solve this problem. Additionally, another individual suggested using "Bitcoin Invoice Address" as an intermediate name to transition towards using the term "Bitcoin Invoice". This could help wallets determine whether to make an on-chain or Lightning Network transaction. While changing a commonly-used name like "Bitcoin address" may be difficult, it could lead to significant privacy gains. Feedback on the proposal is encouraged.</summary>
