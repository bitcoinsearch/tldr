    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation recently had a discussion about the proposal to replace OP_CAT with OP_SHA256STREAM. The proposed change would allow for an unlimited amount of data concatenation using the streaming properties of a SHA256 hash function. The group discussed the pros and cons of this idea, including the tension between generic-use components that are less efficient and specific-use components that may not be useful in the future. They also noted that OP_SHA256STREAM would not be usable if SHA256 is eventually broken.During the conversation, participants also touched on the limitations of Merkle trees in Bitcoin blocks and the possibility of implementing tagged SHA256 as a new opcode. Another proposal was put forth, which involved removing SIGHASH flags from signatures and putting SIGHASH on public keys in SegWit v1, along with adding the OP_SETPUBKEYSIGHASH opcode and other changes.It is unclear what the purpose of the Lightning-dev mailing list is from the given information, but there are links provided to subscribe to the mailing list and manage subscription options. No information is provided about the content of the email or any previous emails on the mailing list.</summary>
