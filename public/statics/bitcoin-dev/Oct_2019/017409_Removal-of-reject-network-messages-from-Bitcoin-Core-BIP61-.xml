    <title>Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)</title>

    <summary>Eric Voskuil via bitcoin-dev has suggested that a version increment and a BIP should be exposed for the P2P protocol change. However, Dave argued that this is not necessary as the "should support" statement in BIP61 is not equivalent to "must support". According to RFC2119, implementations with protocol versions higher than 70,002 are not required to support the reject message. Additionally, if a BIP is not implemented, its conditions do not bind you. Bitcoin Core explicitly does not implement BIP61 anymore.</summary>
