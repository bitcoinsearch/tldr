    <title>Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)</title>

    <summary>BIP 61 REJECT messages will be removed entirely in Bitcoin Core V0.20, expected for release in mid-2020. Although v0.18 was released in May 2019, there are still several hundred reachable nodes on V0.17, V0.16, V0.15 and earlier software, so software that currently uses REJECT messages from public nodes for troubleshooting issues has plenty of time to transition to one of the methods listed by Marco Falke in the email above. Bitcoin Core may send "reject" messages as a response to "tx", "block" or "version" messages from a network peer when the message could not be accepted but this feature is toggled by the `-enablebip61` command line option and has been disabled by default since Bitcoin Core version 0.18.0. Nodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send valid ("reject") messages, so this should only ever be used when connected to a trusted node. At this time, there is no software that requires this feature. The recommended alternatives include testing or debugging of implementations of the Bitcoin P2P network protocol by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent version of Bitcoin Core, testing the validity of a block or transaction using specific RPCs, and wallets using fee estimation to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Marco Falke proposed to remove "reject" messages from Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 unless there are valid concerns about its removal.</summary>
