    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Joachim Str√∂mbergson brought up the topic of using coinbase to provide proof of the best block height. However, it was noted that this method would not be useful as it would not be possible to validate the height without previous headers. This is a common issue and highlights the difficulty in generating longer chains with slow timestamp increases while keeping the difficulty at a minimum level.It was explained that if such a chain were to be generated, it would take around 7 minutes of block time seconds for the next retarget period (after every 2016 blocks), which would cause the difficulty to adjust. In order for the difficulty to remain the same, the time between blocks must be 10 minutes. These issues reveal the complexity involved in maintaining the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
