    <summary>JW Weatherman has proposed a feature to address the issues with private key reading and writing in Bitcoin. The proposal suggests using the NATO phonetic alphabet to display or enter private keys, with lower case indicated by non-capitalization and capital letters and numbers capitalized. This international standard makes each letter easily distinguishable when spoken and written, reducing the likelihood of errors in recovery. The second part of the proposed solution is to insert checksum letters where every 5th word is a checksum for the previous 4 words. This can be calculated and verified as the private key is entered, and if an error is made, the checksum would indicate it within those 5 words. The proposal has an additional side effect of making guessing the correct words relatively easy even if an entire word is lost on multiple lines. JW demonstrated a live demo of using the NATO alphabet and checksums every 4 words, which seems to remove the stress of attempting to write unambiguous characters, making it easier to type with autocomplete when the word dictionary is not involved. This proposal hopes to be adopted by bitcoin core as it uses existing private keys, has no impact on keygen, does not require a standardized and well-known word list for every language, and is essentially just a display format that hopefully wouldn't require invasive code changes.</summary>
