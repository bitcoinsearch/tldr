    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd proposed adding an expiration time to Bitcoin addresses. Andreas Schildbach argued that this would be redundant as the payment protocol already includes an expiration time. However, Todd pointed out that the payment protocol hasn't caught on and doesn't fully overlap all use cases that addresses do, so it's worth considering adding the feature to addresses as well. Schildbach questioned this, asking if Todd could name any users of the payment protocol, to which Todd responded that he hasn't seen it used in ages.</summary>
