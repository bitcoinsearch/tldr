    <summary>The email conversation revolves around the discussion of an "outlier behavior" in the Bitcoin network and how it could be prevented. The proposed solution is to constrain this behavior by setting a maximum fee rate calculated as a filter over past block rates. However, one concern raised is that miners would be incentivized to limit the number of transactions in a block to capture the maximum fee of the ones included. As an example, if a transaction paying 1 BTC in maximal money fees is submitted, the miner would be incentivized to include only that transaction to avoid lower fee paying transactions reducing the amount of fees earned. It is suggested that this could potentially clog the network. Another proposal is to remove all transactions with a fee below 1 BTC with a single transaction, which is different from the current rules where only enough transactions are removed for the new transaction to fit. The question is whether this would prevent the outlier behavior or not. Overall, the conversation highlights ongoing discussions and concerns around improving the efficiency and fairness of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
