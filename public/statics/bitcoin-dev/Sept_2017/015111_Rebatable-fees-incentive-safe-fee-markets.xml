    <summary>In a Bitcoin forum, a user named Daniele raises a concern about the mining scheme. According to him, the current scheme incentivizes miners to limit the amount of transactions in a block to capture the maximum fee of the ones included. Daniele explains that if someone submits a transaction with a higher fee than others, the miner would be incentivized to include only that transaction to avoid losing out on fees. This could lead to network congestion if someone were to keep submitting high-fee transactions every ten minutes. The user asks if he is missing something.</summary>
