    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion mailing list expressed their opinion on address expiration. They believed that it shouldn't be part of the protocol and that sending wallets should instead offer guidance to request a fresh address from the recipient. The receiver should also have the ability to generate an invoice that the sender can act on. Additionally, the member pointed out that re-directs pose privacy issues and that the responsibility ultimately falls on the sender to ensure they are using the correct address. Another member suggested that wallets should check if the address has been used before when sending funds. If it's a fresh address, the transaction will go through without any popup alerts. If the address has history going back a certain amount of time, then a popup comes up and notifies the sender that they are sending to a non-fresh address that may no longer be controlled by the receiver anymore. They also suggested setting up an "address expiration service" where when someone tries to send to an expired address, they first consult the address expiration service which will either tell them to proceed or to send to a different address instead. The original member pointed out that reusing old addresses is a major problem for privacy and operational reasons. To combat this, they suggested adding a UI-level expiration time to the new BIP173 address format, where wallets would consider addresses as invalid as a destination for funds after the expiration time is reached. However, this proposal raises UI and terminology questions, and some thought needs to be put into terminology. They suggested using hour or month resolution, both with advantages at the UI level regardless of timezone. Another advantage of supporting hour-level precision is making it easy for services like exchanges to use addresses with relatively short validity periods, to reduce the risks of losses after a hack.</summary>
