    <summary>During a discussion on bitcoin-dev, it was noted that Segwit wallet seed words have a distinct format that is incompatible with previous wallet seed words. The seed words encode the information that the wallet is Segwit in the seed words itself, and thus there is a need to define a structure for it. Electrum has already addressed this issue by defining a structure for Segwit wallet seed words, which can be found in their documentation.</summary>
