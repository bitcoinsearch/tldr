    <summary>On September 5th, 2017, Shiva Sitamraju reached out to the Bitcoin development mailing list to express gratitude for a procedure outlined in Electrum's documentation related to seed phrases. They also questioned the value of following BIP49 and suggested proposing an alternative that followed a similar structure to Electrum. They then proposed changes to the BIP32 serialization format to differentiate segwit xpub/xprv, with new version bytes resulting in base58 prefixes and network types.Additionally, they suggested using letters z,y,z combined with pub/prv for three types of keys, rather than the two currently being used, due to the existence of two types of segwit output scripts: native and nested in p2sh. Finally, they offered the use of t,u,v for testnet.</summary>
