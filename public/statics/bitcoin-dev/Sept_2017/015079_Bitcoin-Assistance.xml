    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tim Ruffing raised concerns about some icons in the Bitcoin Core software being listed as licensed under the MIT license, which could potentially violate the CC BY-SA license. However, Gregory Maxwell replied to the email thread stating that the icons had been re-licensed by the copyright holder and provided a link to the commit where this change was made. He also suggested using the `git log -p` command in the future to easily find the commit that changed a particular string in a file.</summary>
