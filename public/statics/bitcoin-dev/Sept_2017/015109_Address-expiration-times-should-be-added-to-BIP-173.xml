    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd suggested adding an expiration time feature to Bitcoin addresses similar to what is already present in the payment protocol. Andreas Schildbach argued that this would be redundant since the payment protocol already has such a feature. In response, Peter Todd acknowledged the existence of the payment protocol but argued that it hasn't "caught on" and doesn't fully cover all use cases that Bitcoin addresses do. He believes that adding an expiration time feature to Bitcoin addresses is important. In contrast, Andreas Schildbach disagreed with the idea, stating that the payment protocol is widely used for merchant transactions and person-to-person transactions between Bitcoin Wallet users.</summary>
