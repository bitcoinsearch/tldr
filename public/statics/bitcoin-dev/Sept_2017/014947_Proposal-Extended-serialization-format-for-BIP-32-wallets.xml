    <summary>In a discussion thread on 7th September 2017, Kabuto Samourai asked Pavol Rusnak why not use block height rather than a timestamp. Pavol Rusnak replied that blockheight depends on the chain and XPUB is not tied to any particular chain/coin. Additionally, there are already cryptocurrencies that do not use blockchain but directed acyclic graph (DAG) for storing transactions, so it would not be clear what number to use as a blockheight. On the other hand, all blockchains contain timestamps in their blocks which can be used. Pavol Rusnak is the CTO of SatoshiLabs.</summary>
