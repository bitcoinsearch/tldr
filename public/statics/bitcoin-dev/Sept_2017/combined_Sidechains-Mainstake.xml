    <summary>A new sidechain proposal has been put forward which aims to make it even more difficult for a 51% mainchain miner to steal funds than in drivechains. The proposal gives the economic majority control of sidechains without going through miners as representatives, while also making proof-of-stake work. However, there are still some issues with the proposal, including what would happen if the stake winner disappears, which could slow down the sidechain temporarily. Additionally, the weak mitigation against a mainchain miner attack is further weakened, as the miner with over 50% hashpower can block the creation of sidechain mainstake UTXOs except its own and eventually steal them at no cost. A possible solution suggested was to nest mainstake outputs in p2wsh/p2sh scripts, but this may not be completely foolproof. The proposal claims that it would make a 51% mainchain miner theft more difficult than in drivechains by requiring months of broadcasting intent to steal or locking funds for an entire week-long theft. Additionally, a 26% anti-sidechain miner could not completely block all sidechain withdrawals as they could in drivechains. The proposal suggests that outside of attacks and censorship, the economic majority controls sidechains without miners acting as "representatives of the economic majority". The author acknowledges that they may have missed some significant flaws in the proposal but submits it for consideration.</summary>
