    <summary>In an email exchange between Jonas Schnelli and Pavol Rusnak, they discussed the possibility of reducing the resolution for a field in order to save space. They agreed that if it was necessary for privacy reasons, the resolution could be reduced to week-level or month-level, which would allow them to use just 16 bits for the field. Pavol suggested that TREZOR could provide a hardcoded constant for this field so no privacy would be lost, but if they wanted to enforce this on BIP level, they should decrease the resolution. Jonas also questioned whether it would make sense to have special depth bytes that directly imply it's a BIP44 master key, and therefore avoid the bip32 path serialization. However, Pavol didn't see any good reason to do this, unless they wanted to save some bytes. He believed that changing the human-readable part was the way to go, as it allowed wallets to immediately say if they understood the format without parsing the binary data contents. Overall, the email exchange revolved around finding ways to optimize space usage while maintaining privacy and ease of use for wallets.</summary>
