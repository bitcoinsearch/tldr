    <summary>The proposal suggests a new way of syncing nodes with the Bitcoin blockchain that allows for faster syncing, less disk space usage, and optional slow downloading of remaining blocks. The new protocol messages would allow requesting and sending the UTXO set, and a new services bit, NODE_NETWORK_RECENT, would indicate that a node has all blocks since the most recent snapshot. Soft checkpoints are used to prevent re-orgs from causing network partitions. The proposal also addresses security concerns, stating that soft forks are inherently backward compatible and cannot steal coins. To maintain archive nodes, it is suggested that nodes shouldn't delete blocks unless they are at least three years old, and that a setting should be implemented to specify maximum disk space. Finally, the proposal emphasizes that maintaining archive nodes is crucial to prevent a network split and ensure agreement on new network rules.</summary>
