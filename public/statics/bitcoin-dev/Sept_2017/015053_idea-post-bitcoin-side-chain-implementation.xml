    <summary>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj discusses the security issues of non-official chains and explains why most sidechain proposals use merge mining. He also suggests using the term “sharding” instead of “sidechain” for future systems that include part of the reward for parity between all chains. ZmnSCPxj acknowledges that sharding a distributed ledger while ensuring correct operation is difficult, and provides a link to Peter Todd’s article on why scaling Bitcoin with sharding is hard. ZmnSCPxj advises that when an acceptable sidechain-enabling proposal is agreed upon by the majority of Bitcoin Core developers, building a sidechain capable of sharding would be a good course of action.</summary>
