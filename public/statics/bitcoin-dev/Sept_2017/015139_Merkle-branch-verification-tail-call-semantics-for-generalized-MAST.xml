    <summary>On September 7, 2017, Mark Friedenbach via bitcoin-dev posted a message regarding tail-call execution semantics. The BIP and code links were also provided in the message. However, Friedenbach noticed that it doesn't count sigops towards the block sigop limit, which raises concerns about safety. He questions how long it would take to verify a malicious block with only inputs such that there is nearly 4 MB of sigops. Luke acknowledges the difficulty in supporting the sigop limit.</summary>
