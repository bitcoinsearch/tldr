    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj argues that it is impossible to prevent soft forks in a cryptocurrency. They provide examples of anyone-can-spend scripts that are currently disallowed from propagation by IsStandard but could still be included in a block by a miner, as IsStandard is not consensus code and can be modified. ZmnSCPxj also notes that it is possible for a majority of miners to run soft-forking code that others are not privy to, giving the example of miners potentially blacklisting Satoshi's coins. The only way to prevent soft forks is to hard fork against them, according to ZmnSCPxj. The discussion centers around creating an immutable altcoin or sidechain, which would offer investors great certainty and predictability, but there are concerns about the practicality of preventing soft forks.</summary>
