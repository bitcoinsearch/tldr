    <summary>In an email exchange, Mark Friedenbach responded to a query regarding a security breach in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) tree structure. Friedenbach stated that he wasn't sure if it was possible to conduct the attack described by the sender using the BIP-specified tree structure. The sender had requested for innocuous and malign scripts where double-SHA256(innocuous) would be equal to fast-SHA256(double-SHA256(malign) || r), fast-SHA256(r || double-SHA256(malign)), or other similar combinations, with r being a freely chosen 32-byte nonce. However, due to the double-SHA256 construction, the attack couldn't be accomplished without breaking SHA256 completely. Friedenbach explained the procedure for getting a collision between innocuous and malign scripts.</summary>
