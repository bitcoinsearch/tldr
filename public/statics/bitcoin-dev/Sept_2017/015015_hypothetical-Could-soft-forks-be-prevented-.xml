    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Simone Bronzini posed the question of whether an un-soft-forkable cryptocurrency could be created. Andrew Poelstra responded, stating that the only way to achieve this would be to create a cryptocurrency where no transactions are valid, but even this could be soft-forked to add an extension block containing transactions. He suggested that designing for maximal fungibility and transaction structures that minimize interaction with the blockchain could minimize the surface for transaction censorship, which aligns with the goal of creating an un-soft-forkable cryptocurrency. Poelstra is a member of the Mathematics Department at Blockstream.</summary>
