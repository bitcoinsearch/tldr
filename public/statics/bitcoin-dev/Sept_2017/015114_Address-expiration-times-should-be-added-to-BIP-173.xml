    <summary>A discussion took place regarding the use of payment protocol in Bitcoin addresses on bitcoin-dev mailing list. The original post suggested that Bitcoin addresses should have the feature as payment protocol hasn't caught on and doesn't cover all the use cases that addresses do anyway. Another user disagreed, stating that payment protocol is used for virtually all merchant transactions and person-to-person transactions between Bitcoin wallet users. However, the original user responded that they regularly pay with Bitcoin and haven't seen the payment protocol used in ages. They asked for some examples of payment protocol users, to which the response was 15+ million Coinbase users, ~10 million BitPay users, 8 million Bitcoin Wallet users, and others like Bitcoin Core and Electrum. It was mentioned that naked addresses are probably only used for paper wallets, but it's unclear if paper wallets can expire.</summary>
