    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list recently had several discussions on various topics. The first discussion involved Johnson Lau and Mark Friedenbach discussing Merkle branch verification and tail-call semantics for generalized MAST. They also discussed SigOp counting, which was lost due to the script's execution.In another email thread, Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extended serialization format for BIP-32 wallets. Shiva Sitamraju expressed concern over privacy implications of the birth-date field and the complete derivation path. The group agreed to use Thomas' proposal of {x,y,z} instead of adding more bytes to the already big enough version field in bip32. There were also discussions on having a different version for P2WPKH or P2WSH versus (P2WPKH or P2WSH) nested in P2SH.Another email discusses the issue of fast Merkle Trees and how to prevent attacks by requiring a 'delinearization' step that proves knowledge of information necessary to complete each part of the script. There is a proposed attack that requires finding a collision between padding-SHA256(innocuous) and fast-SHA256(double-SHA256(malign) || r2), and the group discusses possible solutions to prevent such attacks, including using a different IV for hash tree updates.The group agrees to use Thomas' proposal of {x,y,z} instead of adding more bytes to the already big enough version field in bip32. The bitcoin-dev mailing list also discussed whether to add an extended serialization format for BIP-32 wallets, with some suggesting adding an OutputType field for wallets that do not follow BIP43, while others suggest omitting the field in cases where script types are mixed.Thomas Voegtlin expresses concern that adding an extra byte field will make the value user invisible while using base58 or bech32 encoding. Pavol Rusnak suggested adding another byte field OutputType for wallets that do not follow BIP43, with values such as P2PKH output type, P2WPKH-in-P2SH output type, and native Segwit output type. Andreas Schildbach agreed with this suggestion. However, Thomas Voegtlin believes that if users do not plan to expose their users to these keys, they probably do not need a serialization format.Mark Friedenbach discussed the problem of trust in scripts given by another party and the possibility of attacks on MAST policy. The group agrees that good security for Bitcoin is not defined by constant upgrading, and efforts should be put into backporting fixes/workarounds. Altcoin maintainers were encouraged to contribute back to their upstream to help keep up with security fixes.</summary>
