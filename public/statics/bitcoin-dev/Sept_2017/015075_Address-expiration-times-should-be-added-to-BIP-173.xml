    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Peter Todd suggested hour or month resolution for an expiration time instead of seconds-level resolution. He argued that seconds-level resolution is unnecessary and may give the wrong impression. Todd proposed two options: 2^24 hours (1914 years) or 2^16 months (5458 years). Meanwhile, it was noted that Coinbase has a 10-minute timeout on their payment window which functions as a 10-minute expiry time for the address. It is presumed that Coinbase would make use of this feature if it existed.</summary>
