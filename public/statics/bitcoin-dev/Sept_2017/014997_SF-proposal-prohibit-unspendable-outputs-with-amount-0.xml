    <summary>In a recent discussion on bitcoin-dev, Peter Todd expressed his opinion that dropping zero value outputs is not worth the cost-benefit tradeoff. He believes that it is a needless loss of flexibility and suggests that something similar could be done for increased precision in the case of nanobitcoin. However, he acknowledges that requiring a minimum value may become meaningful if the value of 1e-8 btc becomes high enough to reduce a miner's ability to spam up the network. Nonetheless, at present, the argument does not hold weight as the cost in lost fee income from the spam would greatly outweigh any potential benefits.</summary>
