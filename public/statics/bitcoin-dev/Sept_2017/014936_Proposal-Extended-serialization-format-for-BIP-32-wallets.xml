    <summary>On September 7th, 2017, Pavol Rusnak proposed a new idea for changing bip32 version bytes for SegWit. He shared his proposal on bitcoin-dev and requested comments from the community. The proposal is hosted in Satoshilabs' SL repo but can be added to BIP repo as an extension to BIP32 if there is interest.However, some have pointed out that this proposal would force wallets to use the derivation path to determine the type of output script, making it only feasible within the context of BIP43. As a result, it should be considered an improvement to BIP43 rather than BIP32. Nonetheless, a solution still needs to be found for wallets that do not wish to use BIP43.</summary>
