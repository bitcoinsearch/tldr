    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Patrick Sharp proposed an idea of limiting the maximum length or size of the blockchain by introducing demurrage and trimming. However, ZmnSCPxj responded saying that the implementation of demurrage is impossible and it would be better to put such additional features in a sidechain rather than on mainchain. He suggested that OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY could be used to make an "in trust for" address, where you disallow spending of that address. In response, Patrick Sharp withdrew his proposal and suggested storing the hash of the current or previous UTXO's in the block header so that pruned nodes can verify their UTXO's are accurate without having to check the full chain, leading to more efficient use of space on the blockchain.</summary>
