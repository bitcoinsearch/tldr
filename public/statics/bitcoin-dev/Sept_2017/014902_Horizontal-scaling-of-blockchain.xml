    <summary>In an email conversation, Cserveny Tamas expressed concern regarding the exponential growth of usage and waiting times in Bitcoin transactions. He suggested that the block size would need to increase from 1MB to 4MB and eventually 40MB to avoid rapidly growing fees. However, Tom Zander believes that the real limit is set by technology and it is inevitable for successful products to continually push these limits. He cites examples like YouTube and Netflix, which were once unfathomable but are now a reality. Tom Zander maintains a blog and vlog on cryptocurrency topics.</summary>
