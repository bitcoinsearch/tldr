    <summary>Dan Libby has proposed the addition of paper wallet functionality in Bitcoin Core software. The proposal suggests a single new RPC call: genExternalAddress [type]. This API is simple to implement and use, and provides enough functionality for any moderately skilled developer to create their own paper wallet creation script using any scripting language. The APIs suggested have uses beyond paper wallets. It can also be used by third party wallets, or any number of reasons that individuals or devs might have to generate keys. Dan Libby explains that bitcoin-core is the most trusted and most secure bitcoin implementation, yet today (unless I've missed something) paper wallet generation requires use of third party software, or even a website such as bitaddress.org.</summary>
