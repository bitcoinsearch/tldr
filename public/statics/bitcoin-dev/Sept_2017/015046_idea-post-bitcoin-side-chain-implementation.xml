    <summary>Patrick Sharp, a recent graduate in computer science, proposes the creation of an official bitcoin side chain through bip-0002. He acknowledges that the idea is not original but suggests a mechanism to assign custody or transfer coins from one chain to another. His proposal involves officially supported chains identified by a number in the block header, with each address assigned to a chain via (address) mod (number of chains). Chain power values would increment every 2016 blocks if a percentage of blocks on any chain are larger than a specified amount, and decrement if every chain has gone 2016 blocks without surpassing a certain size. Benefits include dynamic scalability, incentive for miners to keep difficulties close to parity, and more distributed rewards. The main disadvantage is the doubling of the non-volatile memory footprint of bitcoin, but Patrick believes this solution may decrease the footprint per miner in the long run. He asks for feedback and suggestions on his proposal.</summary>
