    <summary>On September 5th, 2017 at 15:00:04, Kabuto Samourai via bitcoin-dev wrote a response addressing a possible miscommunication between Luke and Thomas. When exporting a root master HD seed, the encoding of {x,y,z}{pub,prv} distinctions is unnecessary as the root seed should derive all paths for all coins. Wallets may need additional code to discover which paths have been used when importing a root seed. However, when exporting/importing an account-level seed for watch-only and receive address generation, changing the serialization version bytes is appropriate and essential to avoid loss of funds. Luke suggests revisiting a proposal he made in March that handles not only simple HD seeds, but also multisig HD and similar cases.</summary>
