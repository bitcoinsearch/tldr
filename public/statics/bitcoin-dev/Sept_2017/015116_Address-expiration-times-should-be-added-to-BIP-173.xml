    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Andreas Schildbach and Peter Todd discussed the use of payment protocol in Bitcoin addresses. Schildbach claimed that virtually all merchant transactions use the payment protocol, and that person-to-person transactions between Bitcoin wallet users also frequently use it. Todd disagreed, saying he hadn't seen the payment protocol used in ages. When asked for examples of users of the payment protocol, Schildbach cited Coinbase (which Todd then clarified he had not seen it used with), BitPay, Bitcoin Wallet, Bitcoin Core, and Electrum. Todd pointed out that user-to-user payments almost always use "naked" addresses.</summary>
