    <summary>Adam Back expressed his concern regarding the potential manipulation of the community through political means such as marketing, social media, payoffs, and fear, leading to the degradation of consensus rule change. He noted that most types of soft fork are opt-in, which raises a question about the feasibility of making them impractical or infeasible for network-wide consensus rule changes. Adam Back seeks solutions to prevent tyranny of the majority that could undermine the integrity of network-wide consensus rule changes.</summary>
