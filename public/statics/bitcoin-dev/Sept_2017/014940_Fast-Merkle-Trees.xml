    <summary>In a recent email to bitcoin-dev, Russell O'Connor proposed that the fast hash for internal nodes should not use the standard SHA-256 IV. Instead, it should use some other fixed value, which should itself be the SHA-256 hash of some fixed string. However, it is noted that new hash functions should generally not be created by using custom IVs, but rather bog-standard SHA256 should be used with a fixed first block. This allows unoptimized implementations to just hash a block with the second initialization value and optimized implementations to start with the fixed midstate.</summary>
