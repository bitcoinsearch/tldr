    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around modifying BIP 2 to allow editors to merge changes without involving the authors. Luke Dashjr proposed this modification, but Bryan Bishop pointed out that even minor revisions cannot change the meaning of text and suggested exercising some caution while making changes. He recommended mentioning the edits in the changelog or indicating that primary authors have not reviewed the suggested changes. The suggestion was made that the BIP editor sign and timestamp all changes for clarity on who made the change.</summary>
