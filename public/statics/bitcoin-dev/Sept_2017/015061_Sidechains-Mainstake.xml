    <summary>The author of a new sidechain proposal claims that their proposed scheme makes it even harder for a 51% mainchain miner to steal funds than in drivechains. The proposal aims to give the economic majority control of sidechains without going through miners as representatives, while also making proof-of-stake work. However, it seems there are still some issues with the proposal. One concern is what would happen if the stake winner disappears, which could cause progress to come to a halt. Additionally, the weak mitigation against a mainchain miner attack is further weakened, as the miner with over 50% hashpower can block the creation of sidechain mainstake UTXOs except its own and eventually steal them at no cost. A possible solution suggested was to nest mainstake outputs in p2wsh/p2sh scripts, but this might not be completely foolproof either. There may be a hybrid approach that could work, but it depends on what is meant by "creation."</summary>
