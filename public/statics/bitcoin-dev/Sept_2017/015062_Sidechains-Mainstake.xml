    <title>Sidechains: Mainstake</title>

    <summary>The context discusses the impact of a stake winner disappearing and how it could slow down the sidechain temporarily. The stake winner is only valid for a specific mainchain block, and if unable to publish a sidechain header on that block, then the mainchain block contains no sidechain header. On the next mainchain block, a new stake winner is selected based on the mainchain block header hash of the mainchain block containing no sidechain header. A passive attack where a mainstaker just stakes and resets the stake when its lock time arrives, but does not publish any sidechain headers, will slow down the sidechain, but the mainstaker could have been earning sidechain fees if it were participating honestly instead, so the passive mainstaker suffers opportunity cost. The context also discusses the use of p2wsh/p2sh scripts in mitigating a 50% attack by a mainchain miner, but this approach has issues with relocking the stake. There is a hybrid that may work, however, it depends on what you mean by 'creation'. If it is just the initial creation of the utxo -- and not subsequent OP_STAKEVERIFY change outputs -- this strategy might work. It prevents the lottery from including the UTXO, and as it is not in the lottery, it cannot be a stake winner and cannot publish a sidechain block header until the lock time. The context also mentions the issue of a stake winner disappearing or a miner creating the illusion they disappeared via censorship, which would result in losing out on transaction fees.</summary>
