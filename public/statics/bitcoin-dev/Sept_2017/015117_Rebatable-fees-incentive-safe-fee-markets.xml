    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential for a miner to limit the amount of transactions in a block to capture the maximum fee. The suggestion is made that, if a user submits a transaction paying more than the current fees in mined blocks, then a miner could be incentivized to include only that transaction to avoid lower fee-paying transactions reducing the fees earned. This could potentially cause network congestion if the user repeats this process every ten minutes. However, it is noted that this behavior should be considered an outlier under assumptions of a continuous mempool model. A maximum fee rate calculated as a filter over past block rates could constrain this outlier behavior from ever happening too.</summary>
