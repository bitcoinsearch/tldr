    <summary>The conversation starts with a discussion on the security issues of non-official chains, which lack miners and user participation. It is suggested that such chains are useful for developing and testing concepts. The possibility of building an external proof-of-concept side chain of side chains to achieve official reward splitting chains with equal security is also considered, with Elements and Drivechains mentioned as potential solutions.Patrick Sharp proposes a Bitcoin side chain implementation through bip-0002, involving officially supported chains identified by a number in the block header, with each address assigned to a chain via (address) mod (number of chains). Chain power values would increment every 2016 blocks under certain conditions. Benefits include dynamic scalability, incentive for miners to keep difficulties close to parity, and more distributed rewards. However, it is noted that sidechains were originally designed to add and prototype new features to Bitcoin, not to increase the effective block size. For scaling, Lightning Network is considered a superior solution.ZmnSCPxj suggests using the term “sharding” instead of “sidechain” for future systems that include part of the reward for parity between all chains, acknowledging that sharding is a difficult problem that requires protection against double-spending. “Blind” merge mining or publishing entire sidechain block headers on the main chain is suggested to provide security similar to the main chain. Additionally, Patrick withdraws his proposal after being enlightened about lightning network, pruning, and sharding, realizing that these technologies accomplish everything he had set out to do.Overall, the conversation covers various proposals and solutions related to sidechains, sharding, and scalability of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
