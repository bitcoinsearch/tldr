    <summary>Jorge Timón proposed a solution for spamming attacks on the UTXO, where creating 0-value outputs that are spendable could remain in the UTXO indefinitely. The proposal is to require at least 1 satoshi per output, which Todd believes has minimal cost for spammers and does not justify making future upgrades more complex. Todd also believes that TXO commitments and Bram's related work will make UTXO growth a non-issue in the future. Therefore, he NACKs the proposal.</summary>
