    <summary>Andreas Schildbach and Pavol Rusnak discussed the issue of exported public key depth in Bitcoin Wallet on 07/09/17. Andreas stated that the depth is needed for m/0'/[0,1] even though it will be null for exported public key. He believes that the path should always be present if a chain is limited to a certain script type. Pavol agrees with this idea. However, there may be cases where script types are mixed on one chain, and in such cases, the field should be omitted, and the wallet needs to scan for all known types. Pavol questions why a hierarchy is created if it is not used at all.</summary>
