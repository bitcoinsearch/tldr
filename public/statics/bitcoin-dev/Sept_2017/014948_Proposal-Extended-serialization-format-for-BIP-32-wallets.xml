    <summary>The discussion is about the inclusion of a birthday field in the blockchain. Pavol Rusnak mentions that SPV wallet developers have been wanting this for years, as it helps with the initial scan so that they do not need to download every block in the chain but only those after the birthday. Kabuto Samourai asks for motivation for the inclusion of the birthday field and requests test vectors. Pavol agrees to add test vectors once they agree on the inclusion of the field. There are also minor grammar and spelling errors that can be nitpicked later at the pull request stage on bitcoin/bips.</summary>
