    <summary>The writer of this letter is suggesting the addition of paper wallet functionality in bitcoin-core software. The current method of generating paper wallets requires the use of third-party software or websites, which can pose a security risk. The writer proposes a new RPC call, genExternalAddress [type], that would allow users to generate Bitcoin addresses and private keys for external usage, such as paper wallets. This would eliminate the need for third-party tools and provide a more secure option for personal auditing of code. The proposed API is simple to implement and provides enough functionality for developers to create their own paper wallet creation scripts using any scripting language or even for advanced users to use bitcoin-cli or debug console. If consensus is reached, the writer is willing to take the initiative to implement it and submit a pull request. Further steps could be taken to improve this feature, such as an RPC call to generate an external HD wallet seed, an RPC call to generate N key/address pairs from a given seed, and GUI functionality in bitcoin-qt to facilitate easy paper wallet generation and printing for end-users, complete with nice graphics and QR codes.</summary>
