    <summary>In an email exchange between Johnson Lau and Mark Friedenbach on September 12, 2017, they discussed the use of OP_CHECKSIGADD and how it may be vulnerable to DoS attacks. Friedenbach suggested using a new witness version instead of OP_CHECKSIGADD, however, Lau noted that this could be slower. They debated design decisions for a new witness version, including tree signatures and MAST. The use of a limit was also discussed to prevent DoS attacks, with Friedenbach suggesting committing the total validation cost as the first witness stack item. He argued that the cost of implementing such changes would be worth it. Friedenbach proposed an alternative solution to Lau's proposal, which involved removing certain lines of code from interpreter.cpp. However, he stated that both proposals had different pros and cons and should not be purposefully restricted to compare head to head.</summary>
