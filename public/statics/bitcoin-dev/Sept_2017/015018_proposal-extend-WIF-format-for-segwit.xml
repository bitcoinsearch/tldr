    <summary>Thomas Voegtlin, via Bitcoin-dev mailing list, proposed using a bech32 format for private keys if it is to be used with a bech32 address. However, he was unsure if such a format had already been proposed. Meanwhile, Pieter has been working on an "extended bech32" format with a 12-character checksum instead of the usual 6 characters. This stronger protection would guarantee correcting four errors compared to the normal bech32 format which can only detect but not correct four errors. The extended bech32 format is particularly useful for private keys since there's no option to ask the receiver for a corrected version. Despite being a low-priority task, Pieter noted that significant computation work is required to find a good checksum.</summary>
