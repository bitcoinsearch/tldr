    <summary>The context refers to the lack of security in non-official chains due to a lack of miners and users' reluctance to use them. However, they are still considered a great place for developing and testing concepts. The discussion then shifts to the possibility of building an external proof-of-concept side chain of side chains to achieve official reward splitting chains with equal security. The mention of Elements and Drivechains is also made as possible solutions.</summary>
