    <summary>The proposal by Mark for Merkle tree is found to be similar to the one being used at Stampery as per the context. The whitepaper of Stampery BTA includes pseudocode for various algorithms mentioned in the proposal such as fast-SHA256, tree building process and inclusion proving routine. Though the wording is not same but the logic is identical, which can help future implementations if eventually adopted. The signature of Ad치n S치nchez de Pedro Crespo, CTO of Stampery Inc. from San Francisco - Madrid is also present in the context.</summary>
