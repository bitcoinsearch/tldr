    <summary>In a Bitcoin mailing list, Jorge Tim√≥n suggested that a single transaction could remove all transactions with fees below 1 BTC. However, Gregory Maxwell argued that this was not new because paying the same amount would have the same effect today. The only difference is that the attack would waste less capacity and cost the same amount. Maxwell sees this as an improvement since it can be a simple transaction with less weight instead of a collection of transactions that add up to almost 4 million weight. The alternative market aims to achieve a balance other than an ultrasized block; hence, there will be instances where blocks are not completely full. Maxwell wonders how economics would respond if there is a PI controller on the maximum size to recover lost space in single blocks with bogon fee transactions without affecting medium timescale total. Practical reasons such as budgeting communications and storage capacity for nodes make it impossible to assume that there is no limit.</summary>
