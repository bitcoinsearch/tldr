    <summary>The witness size can usually be determined to a few bytes before signing and this is because the size of ECDSA signatures is known. However, in most cases, the signature size is not known beforehand since it may be variable, making it difficult to estimate the maximum size. One party can be told the size of a hash preimage by the other but it takes some contriving to come up with a scheme where one party has variable-length signatures of their choosing. This makes it challenging to determine the exact size of the signature before signing a transaction.</summary>
