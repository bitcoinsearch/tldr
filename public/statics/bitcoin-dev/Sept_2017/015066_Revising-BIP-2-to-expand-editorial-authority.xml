    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, has proposed modifying BIP 2 to allow editors to merge changes without involving authors. However, even minor revisions could potentially change the meaning of text and must be carefully considered. Bryan, another member of the community, suggests that edits should be mentioned in the changelog or some other form of notification to ensure readers are aware of any changes made.</summary>
