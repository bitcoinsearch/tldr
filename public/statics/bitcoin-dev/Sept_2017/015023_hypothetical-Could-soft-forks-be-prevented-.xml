    <summary>In a message to Dan, Daniel Wilczynski suggests that built-in wipeout protection would be a better aim in the event of a softfork scenario. This would protect a majority from threatening a minority with a wipeout if they do not opt in to some soft-fork consensus change. One way to achieve this is by having automated consensus critical checkpoints, for example at 100 blocks deep. However, there may be better ways to accomplish this. The implementation of built-in wipeout protection would turn softforks into hardforks.</summary>
