    <summary>Mark Friedenbach, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, has stated that 4MB of secp256k1 signatures takes around 10 seconds to validate on his 5-year-old laptop. This is based on 125,000 signatures and excluding public keys and other space-consuming factors. He also mentioned that this time is much less compared to bad blocks that can be constructed using other vulnerabilities. Another member of the community has responded by commenting that if there were no sigops limits, the worst-case block could have closer to 1,000,000 CHECKSIG operations. However, signature checks are cached, so repeating the sequence "2DUP CHECKSIGVERIFY" does not create as many checksig operations as expected. To defeat the cache, one can repeat the sequence "2DUP CHECKSIG DROP CODESEPARATOR", which will create unique signature validation requests every 4 bytes.</summary>
