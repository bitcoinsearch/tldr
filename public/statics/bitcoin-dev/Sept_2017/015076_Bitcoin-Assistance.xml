    <summary>A discussion regarding the licensing of bitcoin's GUI SVG icons has been initiated by Cory Fields via bitcoin-dev. The discussion highlights that the default behavior of inkscape (the software used to create the icons) is to contain an XML tag with a link to creativecommons.org, which may be the reason why the icons were mistakenly thought to be under CC license. It was noted that all icons not created by the team are listed in contrib/debian/copyright and are public domain. The discussion also pointed out a mistake in the current docs which list the icons as "Expat" while they were previously listed as "CC BY-SA". Additionally, some icons listed as "MIT" could be a violation of CC BY-SA.</summary>
