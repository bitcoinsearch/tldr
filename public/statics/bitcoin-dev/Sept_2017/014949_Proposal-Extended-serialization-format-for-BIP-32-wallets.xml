    <summary>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in September 2017, Pavol Rusnak suggested that another byte field, OutputType, could be added for wallets that do not follow BIP43. The proposed field would have three output types: P2PKH, P2WPKH-in-P2SH, and native Segwit. The concern was raised that including this field at all times could result in erroneous or malicious assignment of the wrong output type for the given purpose field. Thomas Voegtlin suggested reducing the scope of this improvement to BIP43, as BIP32-generic wallets may implement something else. The post includes contact information for Pavol Rusnak.</summary>
