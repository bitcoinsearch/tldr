    <summary>In a conversation regarding the concept of an un-soft-forkable cryptocurrency, Simone Bronzini suggests that the only way to achieve this would be to create a currency where no transaction is valid. They propose a simple cryptocurrency where only the public key and amount are indicated in the transaction output, which could still potentially be soft-forked by restricting valid even amounts or public keys that are a multiple of 10. However, when asked about the possibility of upgrading functionality, such as adding a new opcode, it becomes clear that preventing new functionality is actually the primary goal of this thought experiment. It is believed that common sense and market incentives would prevent arbitrary tightening of the rules for no good reason.</summary>
