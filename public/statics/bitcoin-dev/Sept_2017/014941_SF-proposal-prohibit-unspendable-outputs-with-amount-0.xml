    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has raised questions regarding the feasibility of forbidding 0 satoshi outputs and inputs. It was pointed out that this would complicate a divisibility increase softfork, particularly with regards to Felix's confidential transactions. The blinding and unblinding transactions would have to be created with minimal output values. However, it was suggested that a change to the blinding scriptPubKey could allow for the use of 0 value outputs. The pattern used by Felix Weiss' BIP for Confidential Transactions depends on or is tidier with 0-value outputs. It was also noted that as long as unspendable outputs (OP_RETURN outputs for example) are still allowed with amount=0, there should not be an issue for anything. There was a proposal to create a BIP to require at least 1 satoshi per output to prevent spendable outputs with null amounts in them.</summary>
