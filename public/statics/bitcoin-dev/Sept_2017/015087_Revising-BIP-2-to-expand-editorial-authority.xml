    <summary>During a bitcoin-dev discussion, Luke Dashjr suggested modifying BIP 2 to allow editors to merge changes without involving the authors. However, Sjors Provoost raised concerns that even minor revisions could change the meaning of the text and suggested exercising care by mentioning edits in the changelog or giving authors a week to object before merging. One possible solution was to @mention authors in the PR and give them time to review suggested changes.</summary>
