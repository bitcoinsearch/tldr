    <summary>Bitcoin Knots version 0.15.0.knots20170914 has been released with several bug fixes, performance enhancements, and new features. The significant change made is altering the chainstate database that tracks UTXOs from a per-transaction model to a per-output model which allows faster blockchain validation and Initial Block Download (IBD). Furthermore, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the transaction is accepted in the mempool. The fee estimation feature has been significantly improved providing more accurate estimates used by the wallet and a wider range of options for advanced users of the 'estimatesmartfee' and 'estimaterawfee' RPCs. The update also includes multi-wallet endpoint support, allowing HTTP RPC requests to be sent to the ':/wallet//', while bitcoin-cli commands should be run with an '-rpcwallet' option. Support for no-fee transactions has been removed in Bitcoin Knots, and version 0.15 introduces several new RPC methods such as 'abortrescan', 'combinerawtransaction' and 'estimaterawfee'. The Mempool Persistence Across Restarts feature introduced in version 0.13.1.knots20161212 allows the mempool to be saved to a 'mempool.dat' file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores the mempool when the node is restarted.Bitcoin Core has released version 0.15.0 with various new features and changes to the RPC and other APIs. The release includes enhanced fee estimation logic and interface, with the `estimatefee` RPC deprecated in favour of `estimatesmartfee`, which returns better fee estimates. Additionally, the release includes experimental ZeroMQ publishers for wallet transactions. Bitcoin Core has made numerous improvements to transaction fees, better fee estimates, and the option of replacing transactions that have not yet been confirmed by a new transaction with a higher fee. The new release makes it possible for users to save their mempool data into a file and load it later, as well as upgrade LevelDB to reduce disk space usage. The Bitcoin Core team has been busy with over 50 merged pull requests in the past week. These include a number of bugfixes and improvements to the test suite. Developers have also made changes to the release process that will update chainTxData, log system time and mock time, and add logging to FinalizeNode(). Other updates include allowing debug logs to be excluded from specified components and changing LogAcceptCategory to use uint32_t rather than sets of strings. There were also fixes for minor typos in help messages and build instructions. Developers hope these updates will improve the reliability and functionality of Bitcoin Core.</summary>
