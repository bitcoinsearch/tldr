    <summary>The author raises concerns about the security of private keys and the difficulty of managing them, even for experts. They question the effectiveness of proposals such as BIP39 versus backing up a seed. The author suggests that private keys should be generated and used on a trusted, minimal, and offline hardware/os to prevent any unauthorized access. Backups should be encrypted and the restore process should be footgun-safe. Finally, they inquire whether there are any existing solutions that address all these issues. The author provides links to their Github pages showcasing simple wallets for Bitcoin and Zcash, as well as a dynamic blocklist for torrents and anti-spies.</summary>
