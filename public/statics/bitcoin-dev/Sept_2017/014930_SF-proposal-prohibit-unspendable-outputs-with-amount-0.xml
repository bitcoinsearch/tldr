    <summary>On Tue, Sep 5, 2017, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, Jorge Tim√≥n, raised a question regarding the allowance of spendable outputs with null amounts in them. He was curious about whether there was any reason or use case to keep allowing such outputs. To this, another member responded, stating that such outputs could be created for timelocked transactions that depend on zero value outputs. However, to protect against potential issues, a change in tx version number could be required, affecting only zero outputs in the new version. It is unclear how strictly this rule is being followed by the community.</summary>
