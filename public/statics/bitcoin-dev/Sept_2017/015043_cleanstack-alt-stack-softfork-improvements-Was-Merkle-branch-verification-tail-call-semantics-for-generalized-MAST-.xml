    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner discussed the possibility of a variable size increase in a message on Sep 22, 2017. He explained that if the increase is only a few bytes, there would be no harm in it. According to him, there are three possible solutions: allowing signatures to be zero padded, allowing spare witness stack elements, or looping the generation of signatures until the maximum size is reached. However, each solution has its own challenges. For instance, abandoning strict DER encoding may be required if signatures are zero padded. In the case of spare witness stack elements, empty stack elements must be counted as 1 byte, which makes it tricky.</summary>
