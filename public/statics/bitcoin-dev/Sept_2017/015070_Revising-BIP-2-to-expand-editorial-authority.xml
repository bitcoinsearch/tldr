    <summary>In a Bitcoin development forum, Luke Dashjr suggested modifying BIP 2 to allow editors to merge changes without involving the authors. However, Bryan Bishop warns that even minor revisions can have a strange impact on the meaning of the text, and suggests exercising caution. He proposes mentioning any edits in the changelog or notifying the primary authors before merging. Sjors suggests @mentioning authors in the PR and giving them a week to object before merging. No conclusion was officially reached in the forum thread.</summary>
