    <summary>The email thread discusses the complexities and potential pitfalls of implementing sidechains, as well as the need for careful consideration and collaboration among developers to create a secure and effective system. The discussion touches on various issues such as miner behavior, security risks, and the importance of avoiding hardforks. While there are disagreements and differing opinions on certain aspects of sidechain design, the developers seem committed to finding solutions and creating a system that can support a variety of financial systems.In the email, the writer agrees with Zmn on certain points related to sidechains, including the header of a sidechain being defined by bits of data in mainchain headers, miner-voting accomplishing the same task as any SPV Proof, and sidechains needing to be merged-mined. However, there is disagreement regarding unifying merge mining and WT^ validity voting because it may lead to SHOM regressing to mere extension blocks and taking on negative properties.The power to decide the validity of a sidechain lies with the economic majority rather than miners, but concerns about bribes leading to orphaned blocks or transactions remain. Sidechains should have a fixed value to maintain obscurity after side-to-main transfers, but this parameter is something to be debated further. Sidechains may first be deployed as federated peg, then at some sidechain height, the federation may announce a move to drivechain/sidechain-headers-on-mainchain. The move from federated to economic-majority-controlled would involve the federation moving its controlled lockboxes to OP_WITHDRAWPROOFVERIFY lockboxes. However, some developers express their lack of faith in the design, believing either the design works or it does not. The mechanism that supports sidechains supports any financial system, including centralized, non-blockchain ones. The email includes links to more detailed discussions about the topics mentioned. Overall, the exchange highlights the need for careful consideration and collaboration among developers to create a secure and effective system for implementing sidechains.</summary>
