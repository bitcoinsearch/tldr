    <summary>The author of a proposal has rewritten and simplified BIP114, which is now known as "Merklized Script." This proposal is a special case of MAST and has similar functions and scaling properties. The focus of this proposal is maintaining static analysis, unlike Friedenbach's tail-call execution semantics proposal. By using Merklized Script, users can hide unexecuted branches in their scripts and count the number of sigOps without executing the script.In addition to BIP114, five new script functions are defined with BIPs VVV, WWW, XXX, YYY, and ZZZ. These BIPs contain major features such as delegation, enabling all OP codes disabled by Satoshi, a new SIGHASH definition, covenant, and more. These features are modular, and do not need to be deployed all at once. BIP114 has its own versioning system that makes introducing new functions easy.The reference implementation for these proposals can be found in the provided link. The author also suggests using Schnorr or similar signature schemes instead of ECDSA in BIPYYY.</summary>
