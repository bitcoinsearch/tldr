    <summary>In an email conversation, Peter Todd discusses the potential issues with making a payment to a Bitcoin address. He mentions that if there is a typo or error in the address, the payment will be rejected. However, if the error results in a larger payment amount than intended, the payment will go through and the sender will need to request a refund. While amounts can be included in URIs, they are not error protected and thus subject to glitches. Todd proposes adding the amount explicitly to the address checksum, which would prevent errors but not provide information on the expected amount if there is a mistake. Another option he suggests is embedding the amount in the address itself, which would allow software to verify that the correct amount is being sent before proceeding with the transaction.</summary>
