    <title>Address expiration times should be added to BIP-173</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sjors Provoost brought up the redundancy of having an expiration time in BIP-173 addresses when the payment protocol already has one. However, he pointed out that emailing or printing a bitcoin address is much simpler than using the BIP-70 payment protocol, which involves back-and-forth communication. The payment request message already serves as an invoice and can be easily shared. Furthermore, it would be problematic to include an expiry date in a BIP-173 address within a payment request because wallets would not be able to parse it without violating the BIP70 specification.</summary>
