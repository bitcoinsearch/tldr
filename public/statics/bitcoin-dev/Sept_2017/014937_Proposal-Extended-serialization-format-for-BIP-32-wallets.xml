    <summary>A proposal has been put forth for changing bip32 version bytes for SegWit. The proposal suggests that the scheme is superior to the alternate {x,y,z}pub idea as it provides lock-in for BIP-49 going forward and opens the door for a parallel native-SegWit BIP. Potential privacy implications of revealing the derivation path for non BIP-44, 45, 49 HD nodes were discussed. Additionally, the format provides the ability to share the 'xpub' prefix across all coins if they so choose. The inclusion of the birthday field was questioned and test vectors were requested. Despite some minor grammar/spelling errors, the proposal will be considered for pull request stage on bitcoin/bips.</summary>
