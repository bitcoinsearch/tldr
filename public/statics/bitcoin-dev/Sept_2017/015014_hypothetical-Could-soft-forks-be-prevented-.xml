    <summary>The article suggests that only soft-forks that attempt to freeze funds are problematic on Ethereum. Soft forks create a new class of transactions that interacts with DAOs. In this case, transactions fail execution but no gas is charged which is different from the two classes of transactions available currently in the protocol. However, in general, Ethereum can still soft fork. A blockchain can be designed in such a way as to make soft-forks impossible or impractical due to attack vectors. Ethereum, for example, can't soft-fork; they have to always hardfork. Dan Libby is interested in the possibility of a cryptocurrency software that strives to have immutable consensus rules. He believes that hard-forks are always possible but soft-forks sort of drag people along with them. Soft-forks rely on anyone-can-spend transactions. If those were removed, it would effectively prevent soft-forks. Itâ€™s also possible to programmatically avoid/ban soft-forks.</summary>
