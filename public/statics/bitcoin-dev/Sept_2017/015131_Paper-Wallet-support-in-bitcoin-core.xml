    <title>Paper Wallet support in bitcoin-core</title>

    <summary>The email proposes the addition of paper wallet functionality in bitcoin-core software through a new RPC call genExternalAddress. However, it is suggested that client implementations should be discussed on bitcoin-core-dev or Github rather than this mailing list. Luke Dashjr disagrees with the proposal as paper wallets are insecure and unsafe. The author of the email agrees with Luke and extends concerns to BIP39 plaintext paper backups. Private keys should be generated and used on a trusted offline hardware and never leave the device over the channel used for signing I/O. Backups should be encrypted and the restore process should be footgun-safe.</summary>
