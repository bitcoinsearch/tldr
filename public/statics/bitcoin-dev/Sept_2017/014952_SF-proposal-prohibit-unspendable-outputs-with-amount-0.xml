    <summary>A discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the possibility of requiring at least 1 satoshi per output to avoid spam attacks to the unspent transaction output (utxo) has been initiated by Jorge Tim√≥n. However, some participants question the feasibility of this proposal, as it may cause complexity for future upgrades and the cost is minimal for spammers. Additionally, others believe that current and upcoming developments such as TXO commitments and Bram's related work will render UTXO growth a non-issue in the future. Peter Todd expressed his negative response to the proposal.</summary>
