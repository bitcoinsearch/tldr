    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Peter Todd discussed spending CT-shielded outputs to unshielded outputs and how to solve the issue of pool inputs being gratuitously non-reorg safe. To make up for the zero value of the CT-shielded outputs, one or more outputs from the CT pool are spent, with any change assigned to a CT-pool output. However, this creates an issue as the pool inputs are not reorg safe. The proposed solution is to support unshielded coins in shielded space too. This means that the only time users transition out of the pool is when paying to a legacy wallet. If support for this were phased in, and the pool only used long after wallets supported getting payments in it, then this would be rare and a maturity limit wouldn't be a big deal. The thread ends with the question of whether there is a better solution to the problem.</summary>
