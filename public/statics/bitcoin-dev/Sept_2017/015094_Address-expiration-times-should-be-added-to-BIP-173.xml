    <summary>In a message sent on September 28th, 2017, Andreas Schildbach suggested that the Bitcoin address should have an expiration time. Although the payment protocol already has this feature, it hasn't been widely adopted and doesn't fully cover all use cases addressed by Bitcoin addresses. Peter Todd supported the idea of bringing this feature to Bitcoin addresses as well and shared his contact information with the recipients of the email.</summary>
