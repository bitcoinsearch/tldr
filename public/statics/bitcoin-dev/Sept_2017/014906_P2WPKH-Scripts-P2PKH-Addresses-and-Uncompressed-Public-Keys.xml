    <summary>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alex Nagy asked if native P2WPKH scripts should only appear in redeem scripts. Gregory Maxwell replied that native P2WPKH and P2WSH are valid and identifiable even when encoded in TxOuts. Peter Todd then chimed in, noting that he uses native P2WPKH segwit outputs for his OpenTimestamps calendar servers as a way to save transaction size. Todd claims to be the first ever production user of P2WPKH on mainnet, and possibly the first person to create P2WPKH outputs on mainnet for any reason.</summary>
