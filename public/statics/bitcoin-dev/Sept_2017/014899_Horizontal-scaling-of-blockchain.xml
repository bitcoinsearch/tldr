    <summary>On September 1, 2017, Lucas Clemente Vella responded to a statement that the current Bitcoin chain is single threaded. He disagreed and stated that since xthin/compactblocks were introduced, the bottleneck was removed. Transactions are validated continuously in parallel rather than just when a block is found. Another person responded, stating that they believed the original poster (OP) was referring to the entire Bitcoin distributed system behaving as a single threaded computation, which is closer to what IOTA uses. However, without more specific details, it is difficult to judge the benefits. The person also questioned the advantage of distributing the task of validating transactions versus reducing the difficulty. They also mentioned that the Lightning network could potentially allow for instant validation of transactions by third parties with smaller fees overall.</summary>
