    <summary>An individual has extended the Glacier Protocol with an additional password derivation function and suggests using BIP45 Multisig HD Wallets as opposed to a multisig address due to the latter's public redeem key. The individual believes private keys should be generated and used on a trusted, minimal, and offline hardware/os. There are concerns about paper wallets being a safety hazard, insecure, and not advisable. Private key backups should be encrypted and the restore process should be footgun-safe. It's suggested that proposals like this should use bitcoin-core-dev or Github for submissions.</summary>
