    <summary>The proposed fix to the Bitcoin fee model is not considered viable because miners can easily include only transactions paying out-of-band, which would allow them to set any fee and potentially reduce claimable income from other transactions. The rebate option is also not practical as rebates would not be honored by other miners, making it less profitable than doing nothing. Additionally, paying fees via anyone-can-spend outputs would still require paying the minimum fee rate of other transactions or risk bringing down the miner's income. In short, this proposal creates a penalty for out of band payments.</summary>
