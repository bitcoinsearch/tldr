    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, the issue of pool inputs being non-reorg safe was discussed. Gregory Maxwell posed the question of whether there is a solution to this problem without creating something like a maturity limit for shielded to unshielded. The proposed solution is to support unshielded coins in shielded space too and only transition out of the pool when paying to a legacy wallet. This would ensure that everyone can "use" CT, even unshielded outputs, and reduce the reorg risk to double-spends. Peter Todd also discussed spending CT-shielded outputs to unshielded outputs and how to solve the issue of pool inputs being gratuitously non-reorg safe. To make up for the zero value of the CT-shielded outputs, one or more outputs from the CT pool are spent, with any change assigned to a CT-pool output. However, this creates an issue as the pool inputs are not reorg safe. The proposed solution is to support unshielded coins in shielded space too. The thread ended with the question of whether there is a better solution to the problem. An implementation could have the exact CT pool input be something miners add, and the CT transactions broadcast on the P2P network wouldn't actually need them. Wallets would pick the input at random. Note that the order in which outputs in the pool are spent can be deterministic and constraints can be placed on how miners could txids to make reorgs relatively safe.</summary>
