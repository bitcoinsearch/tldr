    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has centered around the use of bech32 for payment requests and its compatibility with BIP-70. Andreas Schildbach expressed that there should be no issue requesting coins to any script using the payment protocol, including those with segwit addresses. Sjors Provoost inquired about the size of the bech32 address when displayed as text and suggested that any payment request could be rendered as bech32, with only a limited set of fields included. There was also mention of resolving the overlap between BIP-70 and BIP-173. Bech32 is not strictly SegWit related, but rather a replacement for Base58. The reason it won't be used for legacy addresses is to prevent confusion.</summary>
