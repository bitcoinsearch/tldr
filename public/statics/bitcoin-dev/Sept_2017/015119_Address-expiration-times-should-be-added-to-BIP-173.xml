    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andreas Schildbach pointed out that Coinbase, with its 15+ million users, had an expired payment protocol SSL certificate for several months. This raised concerns about the security of Coinbase's platform and their level of attention to detail.

The lack of communication from Coinbase regarding this issue has left some feeling uneasy.</summary>
