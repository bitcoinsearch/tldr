    <summary>A lawyer new to the list is seeking to understand the licensing of Bitcoin core and will be presenting in a webinar with Black Duck Software on Blockchain on September 28. Black Duck Software has scanned the Bitcoin Core code for the open source licenses used in the codebase, and they have found that the codebase includes projects with inconsistent licenses. The lawyer is interested in communicating with the individuals who manage this codebase and can provide insight about the project manages contributions. The email contains a summary of the findings from the scan, which shows that the codebase includes code licensed under various licenses such as MIT License, GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later, Apache License 2.0, and more. The email also includes contact information for the lawyer and DLA Piper LLP (US). The email ends with a disclaimer to consider the environment before printing the email and a statement that any unauthorized review, use, disclosure, dissemination, distribution, or copying of the communication or its contents is strictly prohibited.</summary>
