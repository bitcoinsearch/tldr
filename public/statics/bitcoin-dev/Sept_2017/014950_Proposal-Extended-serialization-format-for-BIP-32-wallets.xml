    <summary>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pavol Rusnak of SatoshiLabs proposed a change to BIP32 version bytes for SegWit wallets. The proposal is hosted on SL's repository and can be viewed on GitHub. The proposal suggests three possible improvements, including using 13 or 16 bits to create a representation of a birthday in seconds and rounding down to the beginning of the week when the key was created. It also proposes creating special depth bytes that directly imply it's a BIP44 master key, as well as adding a version bit to allow for future extensions. Rusnak welcomes comments on the proposal.</summary>
