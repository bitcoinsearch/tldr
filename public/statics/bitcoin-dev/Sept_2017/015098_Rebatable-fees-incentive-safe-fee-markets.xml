    <summary>In a bitcoin developer mailing list, Mark Friedenbach proposed a new fix to the fee model. Unlike other proposed fixes, this new one cannot be broken by paying miners out of band. If fees are paid out of band, transactions cannot be included with other regular fee-paying transactions without the miner foregoing their income from regular fees. However, this proposal is itself broken as miners can include only transactions paying out-of-band, allowing for any fee amount and providing fee rebates. This would harm the overall ecosystem by reducing visibility of fees and making it harder to compete with centralized miners. Miners also have full control over what transactions end up spending anyone-can-spend outputs. Therefore, there is skepticism about this proposal.</summary>
