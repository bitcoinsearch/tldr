    <summary>In a forum post dated 5th September 2017, Thomas Voegtlin via bitcoin-dev provided a table of different prefixes with their corresponding descriptions. The prefixes included xprv, xpub, yprv, ypub, zprv and zpub. According to the source mentioned in the post, the prefixes were related to P2PKH or P2SH and (P2WPKH or P2WSH) nested in P2SH. Voegtlin also mentioned that he had heard an argument that xpub/xprv serialization should not be used to encode how these keys are used. Pavol "stick" Rusnak responded to this argument stating that he was fine with it, however, it is unclear what specific proposal Rusnak was referring to. Rusnak's signature indicated that he was the CTO of SatoshiLabs.</summary>
