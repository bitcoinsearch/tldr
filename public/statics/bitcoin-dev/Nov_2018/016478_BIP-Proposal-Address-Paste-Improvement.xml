    <summary>During a discussion between Andreas Schildbach and other members of the Bitcoin development community, it was suggested that copying Bitcoin addresses to the clipboard should be discouraged because of its inherent insecurity. Clipboard monitoring malware can replace any address with their own without specific permission or confirmation by the user. Jeffery Paul argued that responsibility for compromised working environments lies with the user or OS. He believes that application software should not work around specific malware threats and vectors that outweigh the needs of the majority of users who require the ability to copy/paste addresses. However, alternatives such as supporting signed BIP70 payment requests could be offered.</summary>
