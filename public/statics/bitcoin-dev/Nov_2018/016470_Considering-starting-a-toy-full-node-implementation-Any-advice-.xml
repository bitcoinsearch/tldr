    <summary>The writer is planning to develop a toy full validating node implementation solely for educational purposes. They seek suggestions regarding the reference for the protocol, advice on which part to start with, and any general tips or advice. The writer has considered using btcd as a reference since they are unfamiliar with C++. They do not intend to include a wallet or mining capabilities in their implementation.</summary>
