    <summary>One of the concerns raised in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list is regarding the use of clipboard to transfer addresses, which can be easily compromised by malware. One potential solution proposed is to come up with an address authentication procedure that is both convenient for users and widely supported. Suggestions included hashing the destination address and deriving a BIP39 style list of 12 words for visual comparison, as using color or graphics may lead to expected perception and compromise security. Other authentication methods include 2fa, visual fingerprints, and signing the destination address with the key of an already-known address and checking the signature. However, the challenge lies in finding a solution that balances convenience and security.</summary>
