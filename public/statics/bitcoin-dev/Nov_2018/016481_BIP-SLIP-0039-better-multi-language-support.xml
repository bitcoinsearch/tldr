    <summary>BIP39 allows for flexibility in wordlists for generating mnemonic sentences, but it is not advised to use a mnemonic not generated by the algorithm described in "Generating the mnemonic" section. Software must compute a checksum for the mnemonic sentence using a wordlist and issue a warning if it is invalid. The BIP39 multi-language feature is crucial for non-English speakers, especially from Asia, as English word spelling can be difficult for some. However, many wallets only support the English wordlist, and there are doubts even from the authors of the BIP regarding supporting multiple languages due to the maintenance of different wordlists. Electrum seeds, on the other hand, are language/wordlist agnostic and allow users to restore random strings. There is a need to address the language issue in BIP39, and proposals have been made to represent the mnemonic code as a representation of underlying entropy or (pre) master secret, seed, etc., which could be displayed in any language. Additionally, allowing the seed/secret to be represented in decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 2047 could also help those who have difficulty coping with words in other languages.</summary>
