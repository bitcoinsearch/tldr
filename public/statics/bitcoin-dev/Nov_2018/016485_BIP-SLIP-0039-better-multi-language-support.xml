    <summary>In a message exchange between Neill Miller and Jonathan Underwood, Neill mentions having worked with non-BIP39 Electrum mnemonics and expresses his lack of knowledge on the BIP39 support within it. Jonathan replies saying that Electrum treats BIP39 restoring in the same way and suggests trying it out. The conversation then moves onto a previous message from Jonathan where he talks about how the BIP39 spec is too open to interpretation and that not all apps follow it. In response, Jonathan mentions that Electrum handles BIP39 recovery according to the specifications, even allowing for restoration of random strings with warnings. Neill points out that Electrum mnemonics are not based on BIP39, which is why it can allow such behavior.</summary>
