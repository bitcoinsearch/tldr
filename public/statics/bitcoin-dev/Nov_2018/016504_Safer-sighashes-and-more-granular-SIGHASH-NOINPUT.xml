    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Russell O'Connor brought up the need for a replacement for OP_CODESEPARATOR in Bitcoin Script. Anthony Towns suggested that signing the position of the last executed OP_CODESEPARATOR would be sufficient to cover its semantics. However, Towns also noted that it may be better to keep the existing awkward implementation of OP_CODESEPARATOR in future versions of Script, as legacy P2SH scripts may continue to use it indefinitely. The thread also briefly touched on MAST (merkelized alternative script tree) and its potential uses.</summary>
