    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community, Anthony Towns, has raised concerns regarding the implementation of NOINPUT in the BIP 118 specification. He suggests that this implementation implies the ANYONECANPAY feature. However, he notes that this may not be true if the blanking of the `hashSequence` field is removed. Without blanking, NOINPUT would still commit to the number of inputs in a roundabout way, but hashing the number of inputs could make this more explicit. Christian, another member of the community, concurs that there may not be a good use case for keeping the number of inputs with NOINPUT.</summary>
