    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jonathan Underwood discussed how BIP39 recovery is handled by Electrum. He commented that if more apps followed the BIP39 specifications, it would make sense to have multiple languages, but since no one follows the spec or it is too open for interpretation, expecting every app to load every language is unreasonable. However, Electrum handles BIP39 recovery as specified by the BIP and allows for restoring random strings with a warning that can be ignored if desired. Neill Miller pointed out in a reply that Electrum mnemonics are not based on BIP39, which explains why it can handle recovery in this manner.</summary>
