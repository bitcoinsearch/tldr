    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Jonathan Underwood points out that while the implementation of multiple languages in BIP39 specification makes sense, it is unreasonable to expect every app to load every language due to the fact that no one follows the spec. He mentions that Electrum handles BIP39 recovery as specified and warns the user about restoring random strings. However, it should be noted that Electrum mnemonics are not based on BIP39 which allows it to handle recovery differently. Neill confirms this information.</summary>
