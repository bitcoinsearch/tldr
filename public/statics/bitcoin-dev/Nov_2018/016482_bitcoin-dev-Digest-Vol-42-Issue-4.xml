    <summary>The writer wants to change the language of seed words in BIP-39 to support inter-operability. They suggest a standalone third-party tool to convert mnemonic sentences from one language to another, so wallets don't have to support all languages, which would not make wallets more complicated or increase development costs. However, they don't think anyone would switch languages for fun. The symmetric function in SLIP-0039 is suggested as a good idea to help with migration of existing wallets. The writer believes that changing the language will not further complicate wallets, and multiple language support could provide an additional benefit of doing checksums in different languages.The lack of localized words for recovery phrases causes more money loss than supporting it, according to Jon's comments, which worries the writer. They believe that providing a way for everyone to master their crypto assets is essential, especially for those who cannot handle English. They suggest allowing representation of the seed in decimal numbers to be helpful for those without a native language wordlist. The writer emphasizes that supporting multiple languages is crucial, and only using English is not ideal.</summary>
