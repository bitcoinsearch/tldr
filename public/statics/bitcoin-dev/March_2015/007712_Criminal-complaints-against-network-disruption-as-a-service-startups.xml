    <summary>The co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, Aaron Voisine, responded to Jan Møller's email regarding the disruption caused by his nodes. Although Voisine didn't believe that the nodes were intentionally malicious, he added more checks for non-standard protocol responses to improve robustness against sybil/DOS attacks. Møller explained that the reason his nodes used a class C IP range was to determine the flow of funds between countries by figuring out which country a transaction originates from. In hindsight, they should have relayed transactions and advertised addresses from 'foreign' nodes to fix the problems breadwallet experienced. The legality of logging incoming connections and making statistical analysis on it is uncertain, but Møller believes it shouldn't be illegal as it would incriminate anyone who runs a web-server and looks into the access log. Mike Hearn argues that it's too early to think about these things and questions whether Chainalysis nodes would be violating any laws if they started following protocol specs better and became just regular nodes that happen to keep logs.</summary>
