    <summary>In an email exchange between Arne Bab and Justus Ranvier, a proposal for a bitcoin darknet (friend-to-friend) was discussed. Wladimir J. van der Laan's argument that most people are easily tricked into adding someone as a friend does not apply to friend-to-friend connections in Freenet. This is because in Retroshare, friends need to be connected, whereas in Freenet, adding friends is optional. An important aspect of friend-to-friend connections is that they provide additional value for communication with real-life friends. The Freenet system builds on top of friend-to-friend connections and allows for confidential messaging as an additional value. For more information, see "Let us talk over Freenet, so I can speak freely again" and "Freenet: The forgotten cryptopunk paradise."</summary>
