    <summary>The conversation begins with a mention of users who may not be as skilled and ignore warnings, causing trouble and generating support cases. The concern is raised that someone else's broken RNG implementation/wrapper could compromise the security of software. Then, Jim explains the benefits of wallet words system for users, including forward compatibility for recovery and transfer/recovery between wallets. Jim suggests it is up to each wallet team to clearly explain how users can transfer their bitcoins out of one wallet and into another. This would make it easier for users to keep their bitcoins safe.</summary>
