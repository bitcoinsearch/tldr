    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas and Andreas Schildbach, Thomas expresses his concern with the fact that to know if there is a wallet, one has to explore branches of the derivation tree. He argues that because of this, the software cannot give a negative answer such as "this wallet is empty" since a new derivation may have been added after the software was written. Thomas suggests that a version number is more useful since it allows the software to answer negatively without having to be online. If the software is online, it can also answer by exploring the wallet and saying "this wallet is empty". Andreas responds by asking Thomas why he thinks it's a problem that BIP43 is tied to BIP32. The two discuss their thoughts on the matter.</summary>
