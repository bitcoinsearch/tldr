    <summary>In a conversation between Wladimir J. van der Laan and Matt Whitlock on March 27, 2015, they discuss the potential for companies to host hundreds of lightweight servers backed by a single copy of the blockchain. This would not only ensure more full nodes on the network but also contribute to its decentralization. However, this could be achieved without each machine having its own copy; rather, each agency/participant could have their own copy. Matt argues that an entity running a full node somewhere could answer the challenges posed by the exercise and contribute at least one additional full node to the network.Wladimir agrees but points out that an entity might not even have to run a full node. They could just pass the query to a random other node and forward its result. In response to a suggestion about encrypting blocks with a key tied to IP address, Wladimir thinks it is a bad idea because many nodes are on dynamic IP addresses, making it impractical to re-encrypt the entire blockchain every time a node's IP address changes.</summary>
