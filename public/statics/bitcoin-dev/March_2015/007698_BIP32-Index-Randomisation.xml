    <summary>In this conversation, the topic of web wallets is discussed. The sender expresses concern that their platform, BWS, might be considered a web wallet, but notes that private keys are not stored on the server. The recipient clarifies that they meant a setup similar to blockchain.info or CoPay, where the client has the private keys but relies on the server for information about wallet contents. The possibility of having visibility of the wallet by the multisig facilitator for better user experience is also discussed, and push notifications in a decentralized way are noted as a challenging problem. The recipient suggests that following Gregory's approach may be the best solution, but acknowledges that the decision ultimately lies with the sender.</summary>
