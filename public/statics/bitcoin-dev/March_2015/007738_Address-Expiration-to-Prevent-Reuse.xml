    <summary>In an email from Gregory Maxwell on March 25th, 2015 at 12:22 PM, he discussed a potential issue with verification and duplicate elimination. He stated that this process would require O(N) storage, where N is the length of the history, due to the need to track all duplicates to reject them. Maxwell proposed a solution to this problem by limiting the duplicate check to a specific X-block segment. The value of X is hard-coded in this simple scheme as 144, which equates to "1-day addresses". Additionally, Maxwell suggested that a selectable expiration duration could be implemented.</summary>
