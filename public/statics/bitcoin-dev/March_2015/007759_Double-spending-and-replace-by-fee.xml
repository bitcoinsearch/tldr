    <summary>On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mike Hearn wrote two blog posts regarding replace by fee and double-spending mitigations. The first article argues against RBF-SE and claims it is harmful to Bitcoin. The second summarizes a couple of double spending incidents against merchants and discusses various techniques to make it harder, including risk analysis of transactions, payment channels, countersigning by a trusted third party, remote attestation, ID verification, waiting for confirmations, and punishment of double spending blocks. The material is considered useful and interesting to those interested in the topic. In addition, the post includes a link to the Go Parallel Website, which is a hub for all things parallel software development, from weekly thought leadership blogs to news, videos, case studies, tutorials, and more.</summary>
