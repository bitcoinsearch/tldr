    <summary>The best practice for the shared wallet use case should be multi-device multi-sig with a mobile key, desktop key, and third-party security oracle key. The oracle would have different security thresholds for countersigning the mobile. This allows for the same overall wallet on all devices but different security profiles on different keys. It's necessary to explain the risks and help people mitigate them when users want wallets shared between devices. Wallet seed interoperability isn't a great thing, as it increases attack surface and exposure to flaws. There are genuine principled disagreements on how some things should be done, and we cannot expect complete compatibility. What we can hope to do is minimize gratuitous incompatibility and reduce outright flawed constructions. It's unfortunate that the ecosystem is failing to standardize on phrase handling. The Go Parallel Website sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media, is your hub for all things parallel software development.</summary>
