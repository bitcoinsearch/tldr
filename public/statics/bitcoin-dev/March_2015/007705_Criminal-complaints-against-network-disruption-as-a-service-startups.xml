    <summary>There is a discussion regarding SPV clients and their announcement of intentions by uploading a filter. Although they do not set NODE_NETWORK, it is suggested that Chainalysis nodes could clear that bit flag as well. The idea of network users paying for the node resources they consume is introduced, which leads to a proposal for funding network resources using crowdfunding contracts. This proposal involves group signatures being extended in both directions to prove server and client participation in the funded group. It is noted that this system is relatively anonymous, allowing any client to use any node they funded or buy priority access. However, the proposal is considered complex, and it is hoped that nodes can eventually become like email accounts, where everyone gets one for free due to cross-subsidization and self-hosting.</summary>
