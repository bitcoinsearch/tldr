    <summary>The discussion revolves around Sybil defense and improving blockchain resiliency through proof of storage. The goal is to prove the number of distinct digital copies of the blockchain, which proves to be a difficult problem due to the heterogenous network with heterogeneous machines. The team aims to achieve a reliable mechanism to discern a local copy's existence without imposing very substantial one-time encoding costs. Having many unique IP addresses possibly accessing the same unique copy might provide some benefit, although it is a challenging cost-benefit analysis. E.g. Tor uses IPs as a cost factor but didn't factor in things like them all being the same Class C until recently.</summary>
