    <summary>The developer behind Electrum, Thomas Voegtlin, has announced the release of version 2.0 of its popular bitcoin wallet software. The new version includes several new features, including a new seed derivation method which is not compatible with BIP39, and a new address derivation (BIP32) which supports Multisig wallets using parallel BIP32 derivations and P2SH addresses ("2 of 2", "2 of 3"). The update also supports hardware wallets Trezor and Ledger, and two-factor authentication service by TrustedCoin. In total, there are more than 100 changes in the new release so users are advised to read carefully through the release notes, which can be found on Github.</summary>
