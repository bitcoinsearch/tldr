    <summary>In an email conversation from March 26, 2015, s7r expressed concern about the enforcement of using a single public key for multiple transactions. However, no one had suggested such a measure. S7r also mentioned that while it is not recommended to reuse a public key, the protocol was designed in a way that allowed for it initially. In fact, there was no user-exposed mechanism to reuse a scriptPubkey in earlier versions of the software.</summary>
