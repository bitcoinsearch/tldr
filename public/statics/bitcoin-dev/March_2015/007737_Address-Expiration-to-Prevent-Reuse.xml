    <summary>In an email conversation between Tom Harding and another individual, the topic of address expiration is discussed. The individual explains that address expiration would not require payment protocol to work, contrary to what Tom had assumed. When asked about the possibility of a sender changing the string of the payment, the individual responds that there is no encoding that can prevent this intentional hiding of payment. However, the defense against this is to not accept payments that do not follow the payee's specifications. To reject reused scriptPubKeys, one must remember past scriptPubkeys in order to test against them. This process requires O(N) storage, with N being the length of the history, to track all duplicates and reject them. The same requirement for storage is true for actual Bitcoin as well, though the constant factors make the difference somewhat less stark.</summary>
