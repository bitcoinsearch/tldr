    <summary>Zooko is in favor of using relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY instead of absolute CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. The reason behind his preference is that he has a vague worry about the possibility of "race conditions" where a transaction with an absolute CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY goes into the blockchain later than expected, resulting in a shorter delay for it to become spendable. While Zooko does not have a specific reason for his concern, he finds that using relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY alleviates this worry.</summary>
