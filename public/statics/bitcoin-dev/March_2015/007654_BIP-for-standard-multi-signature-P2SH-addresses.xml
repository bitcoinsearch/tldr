    <summary>In an email exchange on March 11, 2015, Pindar Wong suggested the introduction of a 'Bitcoin-Draft' (BD) status with an auto-expiry period. He drew a comparison to the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) "Internet Drafts" (ID), which have been successful thus far. However, another participant in the conversation noted that posting to the list serves a similar purpose and creating a draft document requires no approval beyond filling out the appropriate form. The suggestion was made to potentially establish a distinct step for creating a draft document.</summary>
