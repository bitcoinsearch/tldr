    <summary>In a discussion on the standardization of mnemonic phrases, Gregory Maxwell points out several unresolvable perspectives on the subject, due to the difficulties in cross-importing keys between wallets with different feature sets. While he agrees that it would be desirable to have compatibility between wallets, he notes that this can be difficult to achieve and that the space for weird behavior that harms users is large. He also states that while inexperienced users expect compatibility between wallets to "just work," this expectation is not currently very realistic except within limited domains. However, he does not see any harm in trying to standardize what can be standardized, so long as it is recognized that success may be limited. Ultimately, the most fundamental compatibility is guaranteed by being able to send funds to another wallet, which always works and cannot drive any software into weird or confused states.</summary>
