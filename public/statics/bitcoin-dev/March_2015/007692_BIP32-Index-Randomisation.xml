    <summary>The context suggests that the main issue is related to a web wallet server, which means the clients are not SPV and they rely on the server to check their balances and transaction history. The coordination tasks of such clients can be done by storing encrypted blobs on the server instead of providing it with insight into the transactions themselves. This approach is similar to Subspace. Even if there is a scheme in place to prevent the server from knowing the xpubkey, it still has access to all addresses and transactions because the clients are web wallets. Therefore, restricting the information known by the server would not be worth the engineering cost as it would only reduce the amount of information known by the server from everything to 95%.</summary>
