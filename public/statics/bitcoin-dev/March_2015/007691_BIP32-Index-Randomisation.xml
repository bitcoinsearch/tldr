    <summary>BWS or the Bitcore Wallet Service coordinates transaction proposals in multisignature wallets, stores BIP32 derivation indexes, accesses the blockchain and provides functions like `getBalance` and `getTxHistory` to peers, and allows agents to notify incoming funds or transaction proposals to peers. The service is designed to be extremely easy to set up and run while ensuring privacy and security. While evaluating the possibility of BWS not having extended public keys, the main drawback found was that it would have no way to verify addresses sent by the peers, which could lead to broken functions like `getBalance` or `txHistory`. However, Gregory Maxwell has proposed a schema for doing this with "not extended" pubkeys, which needs further evaluation.</summary>
