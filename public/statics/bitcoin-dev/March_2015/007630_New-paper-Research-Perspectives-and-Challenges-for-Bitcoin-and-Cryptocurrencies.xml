    <summary>In an email exchange on March 2nd, 2015, Andrew Miller expressed his goal to bridge the gap between the computer science research community and the cryptocurrency community. He acknowledged that many of the most interesting ideas and proposals for Bitcoin come from forums, wikis, IRC channels, and mailing lists, which academic researchers may not be aware of. This lack of communication can lead to overlooked ideas or reinvention of existing ones. However, Miller believes that a paper would be an effective approach to bring these two communities closer together. Tim responded positively to Miller's proposal, stating that the paper is the right approach.</summary>
