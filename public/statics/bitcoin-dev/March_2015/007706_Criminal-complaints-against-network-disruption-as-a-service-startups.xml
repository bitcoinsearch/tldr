    <summary>In a discussion thread, Mike Hearn suggests that Chainalysis nodes could clear the bit flag for providing network services. If a peer claims to provide network services but doesn't while using another node's resources, it might be considered exceeding authorized access. The author believes that bitcoind should have more fine-grained control over how it allocates connection resources between peers and clients. The message is signed with a PGP signature and includes an attached PGP key of 18381 bytes.</summary>
