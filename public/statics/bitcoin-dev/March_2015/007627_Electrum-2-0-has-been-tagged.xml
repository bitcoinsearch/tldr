    <summary>Electrum 2.0 has been tagged and released, marking the end of a long road for the development team. Congratulations were extended to ThomasV and all the other contributors. One notable change with Electrum 2.0 is the implementation of a new seed derivation method that is not compatible with BIP39. This means that a wallet created by Electrum using the 12-word seed phrase will not work if imported into another wallet that supports BIP39, and vice versa. Some see this as unfortunate, as consistency with seed phrases is important.</summary>
