    <summary>In an email dated February 14th, 2015, Peter Todd expressed his frustration with the lack of transparency in the soft-forking process for Bitcoin. He urged the Bitcoin Core team to move the consensus critical code out of Bitcoin Core and into a stand-alone libconsensus library, which they later did (https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-consensus). Todd argued that this would allow for a more democratic decision-making process during future soft-forks, rather than relying on secretive discussions among a small group of developers. The email ends with a humorous comment from Todd's recipient.</summary>
