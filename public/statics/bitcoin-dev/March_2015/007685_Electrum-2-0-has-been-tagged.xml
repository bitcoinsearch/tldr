    <summary>In a discussion, it was suggested that a common file format should be created for wallets to interpret. However, this suggestion was met with skepticism as wallets have been designed differently from each other. For instance, Bitcoin Wallet and bitcoinj do not support multiple accounts and thus cannot import wallets from MultiBit or Mycelium. Instead, it was proposed that bitcoinj-based wallets could share the bitcoinj protobuf wallet format, which would serve as the "consensus library equivalent." The ultimate goal is to have a 12-word seed serve as an encryption key for a wallet backup with all associated metadata, but it will take time for wallets to transition to this method. Until then, users will have to resort to semi-regular operations to restore from the blockchain.</summary>
