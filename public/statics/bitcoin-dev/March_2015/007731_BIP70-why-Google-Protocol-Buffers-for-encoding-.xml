    <summary>A discussion thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list delves into the idea of using the hash of the genesis block as the chain ID. One member suggests that if a community decides to accept a forking chain with new rules from block N, the original chain can maintain the original genesis block while the new community can define N as the genesis block for the new chain. The member argues that forking bitcoins and bitcoinsB with the same owners doesn't make much sense, and creating a new currency warrants defining a new chain. However, the member concludes that this example is not a good reason not to adopt a hash of the genesis block as chain ID. Another member expresses interest in the approach but raises concerns about the theoretical case of the blockchain being continued on two forked chains with two communities that prefer one chain each, which could cause clients to interpret messages on the wrong chain. The use of a central registry is also discussed as potentially harmful.</summary>
