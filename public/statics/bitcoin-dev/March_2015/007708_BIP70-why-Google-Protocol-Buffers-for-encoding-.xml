    <summary>A unique approach has been adopted to replace the network identifier with the genesis block hash. This replacement ensures that it will not work accidentally with Bitcoin Core or any other altcoins without any central registry required. Additionally, requiring a central registry could be potentially harmful. However, there is a possibility that considering the network identifier as congruent with the genesis block hash may not be sufficient in preventing clients from interpreting messages on the wrong chain, especially if the blockchain is continued on two forked chains with different communities.</summary>
