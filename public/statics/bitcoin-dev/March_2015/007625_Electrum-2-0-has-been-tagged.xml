    <summary>Electrum 2 has launched with a new seed derivation method that is not compatible with BIP39. This means that a "12 words" wallet created by Electrum will not work if imported into some other wallet that supports BIP39, and vice versa. The compatibility issue may be unfortunate for users who expect their seeds to work everywhere, but Electrum is still a popular choice for Bitcoin wallets.</summary>
