    <summary>In an email dated March 12, 2015 at 1:11 AM, Gregory Maxwell emphasized the importance of being able to transfer funds from one wallet to another. He stated that this functionality is fundamental and guarantees compatibility between different wallets. This feature has been well tested and will not cause any software to malfunction or enter a confused state. It provides users with the assurance that they are not locked into a single wallet and can always move their funds to another wallet if needed.</summary>
