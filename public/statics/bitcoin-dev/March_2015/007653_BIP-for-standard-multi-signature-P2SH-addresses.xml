    <summary>The writer suggests the creation of a 'Bitcoin-Draft' (BD) status with an auto-expiry period similar to the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) concept of 'Internet Drafts' (ID). The suggestion is met with caution, as there have been past issues with people squatting on prior draft proposals and demanding access to the same numbers. As a matter of procedure, squatted numbers will not be assigned, and discussion must come before number assignment. Proposals should not be referred to as "BIP[nn]" until they are actually a BIP. Feel free to call it bip-kerin-multisignature or any other placeholder name that won't be confused with a finished BIP for drafting.</summary>
