    <summary>The discussion is about determining the version for different Bitcoin wallets such as Electrum, myTREZOR, MultiBit HD, and GreenAddress. The group believes that brute force is an acceptable trade-off for not forcing the need to remember a version. The wallets mentioned use BIP39 with different key derivation schemes. They also disagree with the need for version "magic flags" or creation dates stored in the mnemonic, as it's a short-term hack and won't save their asses if they fail in the meaning of its meaning. Furthermore, wordlists don't require to be fixed between wallet providers according to BIP39, which does a perfect job without the need for anything else.</summary>
