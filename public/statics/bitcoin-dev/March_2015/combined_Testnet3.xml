    <summary>The post discusses an issue faced by the user while trying to migrate their .NET node to testnet for making and validating transactions. The user confirms that their messages are being sent with the correct packet magic using Wireshark, but they are not receiving any response when attempting to connect to a test node obtained from DNS seed testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org. The user is unsure why this is happening as they are using the correct testnet3 packet magic value and their code is looking for it. Interestingly, their code works fine with the mainnet packet magic value. The user is currently debugging their code and ensuring it is looking for the testnet3 packet magic but still not receiving a response from the node. They note that their code had been sitting in a loop/ping circuit and strangely began working properly without any changes made. The user is developing a .NET node for communication on the P2P network and needs to fix this issue to successfully migrate to testnet.</summary>
