    <summary>The legality of surveillance on the Bitcoin network and gathering information for later use by Chainalysis has been questioned. While some argue that analyzing publicly available data is not illegal, others warn that surveillance could lead to legal action against those conducting it. Chainalysis has defended its operations, stating that monitoring the public blockchain is an essential aspect of its work and beneficial for research and transaction verification purposes. Additionally, it has been suggested that any potential legal issues regarding surveillance are undefined and would be difficult to enforce. Nevertheless, some assert that nodes that log incoming connections and make statistical analysis could incriminate themselves if they give IP addresses away. Despite the controversy surrounding Chainalysis, it remains a popular tool for tracking transactions and providing insights into the behavior of cryptocurrency users.</summary>
