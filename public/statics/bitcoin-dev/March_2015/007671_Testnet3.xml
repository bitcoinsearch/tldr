    <summary>The author of the post is trying to migrate their .NET node to testnet and confirmed that their messages are being sent with the correct packet magic using Wireshark. However, when attempting to connect to a test node obtained from DNS seed testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org, they are not receiving a verack or version in response, only a ping before the connection is severed by the remote node. The author is unsure why this is happening as they are using the correct testnet3 packet magic value and their code is looking for it. Interestingly, their code works fine with the mainnet packet magic value. The author also notes that their code had been sitting in a loop/ping circuit and strangely began working properly without any changes made.</summary>
