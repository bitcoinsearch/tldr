    <summary>The proposal suggests that Bitcoin nodes should be allowed to establish authenticated connections with trusted peers via CurveCP. This would only broadcast transactions to these trusted peers, thereby reducing privacy for those who do not know how to use it or are unaware of the trustworthiness of their peers. It is suggested that a web of trust could be used to select trusted peers, but mistakes can easily be made. The use of CurveCP requires both sides of the connection to know each other's long-term public key, which can be packaged in a structure similar to a Freenet node reference. Users would generate their node references through an API command and copy them to the ~/.bitcoin/curvecp directory. While this may not necessarily help with privacy, it can be used for whitelisting to subject trusted nodes to fewer DoS constraints. The proposal can work independently of Tor usage, but separating transaction submission from normal node functionality would go a long way towards enhancing privacy. The transaction submitter would connect to a few nodes through Tor and drop off a transaction, then disconnect. This would not advertise itself as the hidden service and should also use a different Tor circuit as the node connections.</summary>
