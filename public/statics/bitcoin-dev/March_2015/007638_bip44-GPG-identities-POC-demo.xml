    <summary>A user named Mem Wallet wrote about managing a GPG identity for encryption and signing with zero bytes of permanent storage, to which Pavol Rusnak replied. As the author of BIP44, Pavol believed that a new BIP number should be allocated instead of using BIP44 for this purpose. He suggested creating a GPG key hierarchy per device/master seed rather than per Bitcoin account.Pavol Rusnak also mentioned that he was working on implementing a SignIdentity message for TREZOR to be used for HTTPS/SSH/etc. logins. He shared a proof of concept (PoC) on Github. His idea was to derive the BIP32 path from HTTPS/SSH URI and use it to derive the private key. This scheme might also work for GPG keys by using gpg://user@host.com for the URI.</summary>
