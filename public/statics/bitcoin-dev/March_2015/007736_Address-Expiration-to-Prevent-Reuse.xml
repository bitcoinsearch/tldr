    <summary>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and an unknown recipient, the topic of address expiration in Bitcoin transactions was discussed. Maxwell suggested that if the sender is not uncooperative, including expiration information in the transaction would work without requiring the payment protocol. However, he also noted that if the sender is uncooperative, they could change the target and send the transaction anyway. The implementation of address expiration was also questioned by the recipient, to which Maxwell did not provide a clear answer. The conversation then shifted to the topic of a block containing an invalid transaction if a prior confirmed transaction has paid the same address. This requirement would need an unprunable verification state, which the recipient did not understand and asked for clarification.</summary>
