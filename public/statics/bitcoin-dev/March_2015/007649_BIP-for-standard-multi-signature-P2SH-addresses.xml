    <summary>In an email thread from March 11, 2015, Thomas Kerin requested a BIP number for a proposal he had been working on. The email chain also discussed the issue of individuals squatting on BIP numbers and demanding access to them. As a result, it was noted that proposals should not be referred to as "BIP[nn]" until they are actually a BIP. Instead, placeholder names can be used during the drafting process. It was suggested that discussion should come before number assignments, and that many proposals are withdrawn after further discussion shows that they are without public interest or subsumed by other functionality. If there is any confusion regarding the process, individuals were encouraged to bring it to attention.</summary>
