    <summary>In a discussion about standardizing the handling of mnemonic phrases for cryptocurrency wallets, Thy Shizzle argues that it is not fair to say there has been a failure to standardize, suggesting that assuming day 0 can handle the date issue and adding one extra word into the mnemonic to signify version could be a solution. However, they acknowledge that there are more incompatibilities with seed and HD structure. Devrandom suggests using a multi-device multi-sig approach for shared wallets, with different security profiles on different keys. They also express disappointment in the ecosystem's failure to standardize phrase handling.</summary>
