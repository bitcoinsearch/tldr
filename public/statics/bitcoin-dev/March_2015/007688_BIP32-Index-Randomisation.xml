    <summary>The developers of bitcore-wallet-server (BWS), a HD multisig wallet facilitator, are seeking feedback on their usage of BIP32 paths. Currently, BWS instances hold the set of extended public keys of the wallet's peers to derive addresses, which poses a privacy issue. To address this concern, the team proposes using pseudo-random BIP32 paths with a seed only known by the peers, allowing the server to verify that addresses submitted by peers belong to the wallet but not derive future wallet addresses. The proposed workflow involves the peer requesting the current index and then creating an address using the index and pathSeed. The server then derives the address and adds it to the wallet.</summary>
