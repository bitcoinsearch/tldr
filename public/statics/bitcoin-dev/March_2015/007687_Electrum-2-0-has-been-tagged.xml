    <summary>In an email thread discussing the possibility of a universal Bitcoin wallet, Andreas Schildbach raised concerns that it would be difficult to import wallets from different providers due to their varying designs. However, another participant in the discussion suggested that a solution could be to have the importing wallet specify which sections it supports and only import those. The user would then be alerted that they cannot manage other parts and might need to manually transfer funds if they wish to switch wallets. The exporting wallet would also inform the user of the extensions and standards in use and ask for confirmation that the target wallet supports them. Additionally, the thread discussed the need for a standard synchronization or transition protocol to allow for wallets to synchronize state and transfer funds between different standards.</summary>
