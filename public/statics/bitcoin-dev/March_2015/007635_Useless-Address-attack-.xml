    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development mailing list has raised concerns about the possibility of slowing down communication over the P2P network by using dummy nodes. In response, Kevin Greene explained that Bitcoind protects against this by storing addresses learnt in buckets, selected based on the IP of the peer and the address in the message. The bucketing is done randomly to prevent attackers filling the database with their own nodes. Misbehaving nodes can be blacklisted for a period of time to prevent constant connection attempts.</summary>
