    <summary>Tom Harding, a blockchain enthusiast, suggested the use of limited-lifetime addresses that could be made reuse-proof with bounded resource requirements. An example of such an address is given as "4HB5ld0FzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v_349366" where 349366 represents the last valid block for a transaction paying this address. However, the core developers have shown reluctance towards this idea due to the possibility of a chain reorganization making a previously valid transaction invalid.</summary>
