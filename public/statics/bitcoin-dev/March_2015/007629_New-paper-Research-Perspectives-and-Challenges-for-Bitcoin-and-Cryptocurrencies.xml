    <summary>A group of researchers from Stanford, Maryland, Concordia and Princeton have written a paper about Bitcoin-related research. The paper is called “systemization” and is set to appear in the Oakland security conference later this year (IEEE Security and Privacy) but the draft has been released ahead of time. The goal of the paper is to build a bridge between the computer science research community and the cryptocurrency community. The researchers hope their paper helps some of the best ideas and research questions from the Bitcoin community bubble up and inspires researchers to build on them. The research group didn’t limit their scope to Bitcoin, but they also decided not to provide a complete survey of altcoins and other next-generation cryptocurrency designs. Instead, they tried to explain all the dimensions along which these designs differ from Bitcoin. The effort has roughly been in progress over two years with several stops and restarts along the way. Overall, the papers that are being created by researchers in distributed systems groups help convince supervisors to pay more attention to blockchain technologies. The paper has received positive feedback within the mailing list and forums/wikis/irc channels. If anyone has comments or suggestions regarding the paper, the research group will continue updating their online version for the foreseeable future.</summary>
