    <summary>The Bitcoin community is considering implementing address expiration, which would stop users from reusing their public keys. The idea behind this is to reduce the monitoring requirements associated with the increasing number of bitcoin addresses in existence. However, some in the community have expressed concern that this would undermine users' rights to reuse addresses when necessary. One such case could be a government body issuing addresses for use by a business, allowing all transactions to be tracked for that entity. If address reuse were prevented, it would render the tracking nonviable. While it is not recommended to use the same pubkey more than once, the protocol was not designed this way. Enforcing something as described in this topic could undermine users' rights to reuse their addresses.</summary>
