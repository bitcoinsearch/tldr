    <summary>Mike Hearn is discussing with an unknown person about allowing bitcoin nodes to limit the access of other users. The unknown person suggests that if this action is taken, it would include all Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients. They also suggest that the protocol could be designed in a way that provides finer-grained access controls and connection limits. Hearn believes that network users should pay for the node resources that they consume so that anyone who wants to place increased load on the network would compensate node operators for the burden. He suggests that without this kind of comprehensive solution, problems like this will continue to recur. A PGP signature and non-text attachment are included in the message.</summary>
