    <summary>In an email conversation on March 11, 2015, Ricardo Filipe expressed his optimistic view regarding the standardization of wallets in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). He hoped that Bitcoin would not fail in standards as some industries have done in the past. However, there are principled disagreements and functional differences that prevent complete compatibility among different software. The best approach is to reduce gratuitous incompatibility and flawed constructions while minimizing the choices among relatively good options. Thus, it is important to aim for standardized wallets to avoid requiring instructions and to achieve more compatibility among different software.</summary>
