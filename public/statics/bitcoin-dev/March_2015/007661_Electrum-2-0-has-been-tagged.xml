    <summary>The email conversation discusses the compatibility issues between different wallets and standards for mnemonic phrases. While some wallets follow BIP39, others roll their own seed and HD structures. The date of creation is also a point of contention, with some assuming day 0 if no date is provided. One solution proposed is to add an extra word to signify version, with each subsequent version using the next word on the list. The idea of multi-device multi-sig is suggested as the best practice for shared wallet use cases. Despite these issues, there is still hope for standardization and portability of mnemonic phrases.</summary>
