    <summary>In a 2015 email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Tom Harding, the topic of reducing the number of bitcoin addresses that need to be monitored was discussed. Harding suggested using address expiration as a way to accomplish this goal. Maxwell responded by proposing the simple solution of encoding an expiration date into the address itself and specifying that clients enforce it. However, the potential cost of this approach is a chance of invalidating a payment made at or just before expiration in case of reorganization. It's unclear whether this would increase recommended confirmations above their current levels centered around the possibility of a malicious double-spend. The email exchange raises the question of whether the benefit of the bitcoin network providing this service is sufficiently greater than the cost.</summary>
