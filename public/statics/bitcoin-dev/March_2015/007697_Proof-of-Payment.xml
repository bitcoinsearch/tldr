    <summary>The email conversation between Kalle and the sender discusses the skepticism regarding a protocol that adds much value to a saved payment request. They argue that a saved payment request is meant to be unique per transaction, and storing the signed payment request in a wallet does not add much value because if someone can steal a payment request, they can probably steal the wallet signing keys too. The suggestion is to extract the useful metadata into a separate structure and encrypt the original full payment request under the wallet key. This way, the wallet doesn't have to store the PaymentRequest encrypted. However, the sender believes that this protocol does not add much value.</summary>
