    <summary>In a discussion about the safety of Bitcoin payments, Gregory Maxwell suggests that a simpler, safer client-enforced behavior is preferable to prevent people from making payments that aren't according to the payee. He notes that someone who wants to hack their client to make such a payment will have to live with the consequences as it cannot be prevented in a strong sense. Maxwell clarifies that the motivation for address expiration is to reduce the rate of increase of the massive pile of Bitcoin addresses out there that have to be monitored forever for future payments. He believes that it could make a significant difference if something like this were used by default someday.However, he adds that address expiration is not an enhancement to the payment experience and does not stop the sender from doing something weird. Hacking a new address for the recipient would be just as strange as hacking their client, in his opinion.</summary>
