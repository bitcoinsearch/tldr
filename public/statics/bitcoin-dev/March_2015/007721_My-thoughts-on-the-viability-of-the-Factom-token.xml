    <summary>Factom is a censorship and spam resistant 3rd party, similar to Bitcoin. Factom aims to create a publishing platform that is resistant to both censorship and spam. The system is being made so that it is visible if someone tries to censor the system, with other members fighting against it. In comparison to centralized solutions, Factom sits in a sweet spot between Proof of Work and a centralized solution. Factom is good for interpreted protocols, while proofchains are good for audited protocols. Both are immutable and serve as proof of publication (POP). Factom allows users to choose how they audit data independent of the packager. Factom is attempting to create a dispassionate third party, while interpreted protocols like Counterparty filter out invalid transactions after the fact.</summary>
