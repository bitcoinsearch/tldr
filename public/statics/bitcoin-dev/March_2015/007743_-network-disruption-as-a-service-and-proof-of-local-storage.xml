    <summary>The conversation focuses on protocols that can be used to prove local possession in blockchain technology. The first protocol involves the verifier sending a seed to derive random indexes, and the prover must respond with the encrypted blocks within a certain time bound, which the verifier decrypts to check if they are part of the blockchain. An improvement is introduced where the verifier asks the prover to send a Merkle tree root of hashes of encrypted blocks with N indexes selected by a pseudo-random function seeded by a challenge value. There is a discussion about the effect of spinning disk versus SSD and whether a sequential read from a random index is a possible trade-off. This presupposes a specific ordering on the disk which might not exist. In the future, this will be moot as it will all be solid-state. Additionally, not every node needs to implement the protocol, but only nodes that want to prove full-node-ness such as the ones that want to receive bitnodes subsidy.</summary>
