    <summary>Mike Hearn, a former bitcoin developer, has criticised Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, for allegedly breaking the Bitcoin protocol. According to Hearn, Chainalysis is deploying nodes that purport to be network peers in order to gain a connection slot and then not behaving as one, thereby depriving the peers to which the operator actually intends to offer service of the ability to connect. Hearn believes that a data collection company deploying nodes that do not relay and aggressively reconnect after a ban would have a hard time arguing that they were not knowingly exceeding authorised access. Hearn concludes that it would be "shooting ourselves in the foot" to forbid Block Explorers given how useful they are.</summary>
