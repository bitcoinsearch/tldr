    <summary>A recent email exchange between Craig Raw and David A. Harding regarding the use of apostrophes versus 'h' or 'H' in Bitcoin output script descriptors has raised some interesting points. While Raw argued that using an apostrophe allows for more whitespace and easier visual parsing, Harding countered that the difference in space usage is negligible and that using 'h' or 'H' avoids potential errors in shell-quoting and is more efficient for metal backups. Additionally, Daniel Bayerdorffer of Numberall Stamp &amp; Tool Co., Inc. recommended the Bitcoin Recovery Tag as a metal backup option that uses a fixed font and supports both apostrophes and 'h'. Overall, while the debate over which character to use may seem trivial, it highlights the importance of considering user experience and practical considerations in the design of Bitcoin-related tools and protocols.</summary>
