    <summary>On Jun 29, 2021, Andrew Chow via bitcoin-dev proposed changes to the specification for BIP32 derivation. The proposal included an option to denote all direct unhardened or hardened children with a single /* or /*' final step. However, Dave suggested replacing the hardened indicator "'" with alternative indicators of h or H to make it more user-friendly and avoid complications in bourne-style shells. Dave presented two alternatives: completely eliminating "'", which may prove complicated since it is already widely used, or calculating the checksum over s/(h|H)/'/. He believes that if "h"/"H" is made the preferred aliases, implementing "'" should be a SHOULD rather than a MUST. Dave's suggestion was prompted by its annoyance in bourne-style shells, which he believes may also create unnecessary complications elsewhere.</summary>
