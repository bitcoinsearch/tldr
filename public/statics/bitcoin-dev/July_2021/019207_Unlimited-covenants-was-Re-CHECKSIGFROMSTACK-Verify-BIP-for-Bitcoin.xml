    <summary>In an email thread, Russell O'Connor discussed the topic of enabling covenants, specifically recursive covenants that require an OP_TWEAK operation. He expressed concern about the feasibility of simulating this operation with CHECKSIG(FROMSTACK). However, upon further thought, he noted that recursive covenants could still be created using a fixed scriptpubkey by sneaking the state into a few bits of the UTXO's amount. Additionally, it may be possible to stash the state into a sibling output accessed via the txid embedded in the prevoutpoint if one puts in enough effort.</summary>
