    <summary>In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy suggests that without the OP_CAT opcode, CheckSigFromStack (CSFS) cannot enable sophisticated covenants. Dave asks Jeremy to describe his concerns about sophisticated covenants and inquiries about BIP119 CTV's design principle of avoiding them. Dave also mentions his support for CSFS despite its limitations without OP_CAT. He adds that he believes there is a lack of developer interest in CSFS at the moment but encourages Jeremy to pursue it if he wishes. The email includes links to BIP119 CTV and a recent survey on Twitter regarding CSFS.</summary>
