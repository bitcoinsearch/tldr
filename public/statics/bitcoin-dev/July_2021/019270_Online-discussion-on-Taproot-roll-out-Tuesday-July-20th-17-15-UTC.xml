    <summary>On July 20th, there will be an online Zoom call at 17:15 UTC discussing Taproot roll out post activation in November. The discussion will be focused on developers and technical in nature but all are welcome to attend and watch the livestream on YouTube. Murch created a wiki page monitoring planned ecosystem support of P2TR addresses and it would be great to hear from projects and businesses that have Taproot support on their medium/long term development roadmap or considering it. The link to view the page is provided in the message. A Meetup link is also included, which will announce the Zoom link for the event. Lastly, a draft pre-reading link has been provided and will be finalized before Tuesday. The message is signed by Michael Folkson and includes his contact information.</summary>
