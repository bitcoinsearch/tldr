    <summary>Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has proposed a way to make Bitcoin "quantum safe" by signing an EC signature using an OP_CAT operation, as detailed in his blog post. The construction uses Lamport signatures that are quantum secure, and the scheme requires at least 20 contiguous bytes which can be verified using OP_SUBSTRINGEQUALVERIFY. The commitment scheme can also nest inside of a Tapscript path, adding more security to the system. Schnorr signatures are also mentioned as having a stronger non-malleability property than ECDSA. However, Lamport signatures are noted for their large size, so it remains to be seen if this proposal will be implemented.</summary>
