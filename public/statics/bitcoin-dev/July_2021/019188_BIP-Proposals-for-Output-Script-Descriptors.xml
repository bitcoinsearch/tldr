    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of 'h' or apostrophe in Bitcoin descriptors and derivation paths. The concern raised by Craig Raw is that using 'h' takes up more space and makes it difficult to read. However, Dave argues that the difference in space is barely half a percent and not a serious concern. He also mentions that using checksums in descriptors helps avoid transcription errors. In terms of metal backups, both 'h' and apostrophe have their advantages and disadvantages, but the efficiency difference is negligible. Dave cites a Bitcoin Core issue where users faced technical support issues due to using '-containing descriptors in a bourne-style shell, which he believes is a much more serious problem than using extra space in a GUI or backup medium.</summary>
