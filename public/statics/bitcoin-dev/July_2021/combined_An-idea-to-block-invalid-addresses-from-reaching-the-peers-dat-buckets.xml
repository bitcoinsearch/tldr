    <summary>Recently, someone has been spamming the Bitcoin network with an addr message pointing to invalid addresses and ports. This has caused issues with the peers.dat file and its corresponding memory structure. The custom record type used in peers.dat makes it difficult to parse and determine specifics of IP addresses listed. However, Ali Sherief suggests implementing changes to prevent this kind of attack from happening in the future. One solution is to change the AddrDb updating functionality so that it does not add nodes that are unreachable due to "connection refused" errors.These addresses can be stored in a new, separate database-like file or augmented in the peers.dat file under a new entry type. Invalid nodes can be immediately flushed from memory to avoid processing them. The check for unreachable nodes will only be made the first time the node is seen in the wild, to avoid blocking nodes that go offline. A new ZMQ message can also be created to send the node's list of ignored addresses, facilitating other nodes discovering blocked nodes.Another suggestion to improve the situation is to introduce a new file or command-line/config option called "ignorelist" or something with a list of subnets that will not be read into the AddrDB buckets in any case. This would work differently from the banlist, which is used to block peers that send invalid messages, not peers that are unreachable. Furthermore, the peers.dat file and its structure have fixed sizes, so they are not the main problem. Since the peers.dat file uses a custom record type which cannot be parsed, it is difficult to check specifics of IP addresses listed in there. Nevertheless, there is a workaround to prevent this kind of thing from happening, but it is unclear how easy or difficult it will be to implement the change. The "addrman" database is organized into 1024 buckets with "new" addresses and 256 buckets with "tried" addresses. Each bucket can hold one address, and along with the addresses, it remembers where they were originally heard about (which IP). Each group of source IPs selects a subset of just 64 buckets, salted using a host-specific secret key, and inserts newly received IPs in a position in a bucket if certain criteria are met. The attacker cannot affect IPs in buckets outside of the 64 their group maps to. This limits the impact an attacker can have.In conclusion, the spamming of the Bitcoin network with invalid addr messages has caused issues with the peers.dat file and corresponding memory structure. However, there are suggestions like changing the AddrDb updating functionality, creating a new ZMQ message, and introducing a new file or command-line/config option to prevent this kind of attack from happening in the future. These changes can help protect against spam in terms of database poisoning, although there is a processing cost to it.</summary>
