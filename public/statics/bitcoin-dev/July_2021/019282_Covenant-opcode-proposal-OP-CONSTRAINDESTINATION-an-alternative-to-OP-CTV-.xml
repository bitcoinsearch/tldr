    <summary>In a conversation between two people named Billy and James, James breaks down two possible situations regarding an opcode that limits user/group A to send the output to user/group B or limits user A to send from one address they own to another address they own. James is trying to think of a good use case for this type of opcode and he gives an example where an attacker who compromises the key for user A can't steal the money because it can only be sent to user B. However, if the attacker wants to steal the funds, they would need to compromise the keys of both user A and user B. James then questions whether this opcode is any better than a 2-of-2 multisig and whether the end result is exactly the same.</summary>
