    <summary>A new method has been proposed to prevent privacy leaks in multisig quorums using BIP32 paths, which can be found on GitHub. This scheme offers several new features including preventing unauthorized parties from accessing the BIP39 seed phrase and learning about transactions in any multisig quorum that seed participates in. Trusted-minimized third parties can hold an emergency recovery key without any knowledge of what that key protects. Several Coordinators and Signers support this scheme, and large sums of bitcoin are currently being held with it.However, a member of the Bitcoin development community, Michael Flaxman, suggests that it is unlikely that an attacker would obtain a private BIP32 seed without also learning what HD paths it is being used with, making this method less secure. It is assumed that most people store their descriptors alongside their seeds to ensure robust recovery. It is suggested that wallet authors focus on implementing support for taproot and MuSig or MuSig2 over this scheme. The use of taproot with multisignatures and threshold signatures should solve this problem as long as participants do not reuse the same keys in different contexts.The hope behind publishing this method is to encourage more interoperable hardware wallet/coordinator software support for enhanced privacy and improve user experience in Bitcoin. Feedback on this method is welcome.</summary>
