    <summary>In this conversation, the topic of optimizing Bitcoin transactions is discussed. The speaker suggests splitting up the current opcode into simpler opcodes to make it more efficient. However, there are limitations and considerations to this approach. For example, the speaker added specifying amounts to outputs in order to make script evaluation simpler and eliminate a potential DOS vector. If the functionalities were separated, it could become difficult to evaluate what addresses an input goes to without knowing what amounts an input contributes to each output. The idea of a fee-limit opcode is also proposed, which could be done on its own. However, a version of OP_CD that doesn't specify fees would have to take the fee-limit into account, and the calculation for the stand-alone fee-limit operation would be moot for that output. The speaker notes that transactions wouldn't be quite twice as large if they repeated all of the output data twice; instead, it would only make the transaction about 1/3 larger due to each output adding 9 bytes to the transaction. The speaker proposes the optimization of allowing the omission of an output value in cases where the entire output amount is contributed by that input, which would reduce the overhead of specifying output amounts to 2 bytes for most outputs. This would only make the transaction about 7% larger, and the speaker asks for opinions on this idea. Overall, the discussion revolves around finding ways to optimize Bitcoin transactions and reduce their size.</summary>
