    <summary>During a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, David A. Harding proposed to make "h"/"H" the preferred aliases instead of "'" for better user experience. However, Andrew Chow pointed out that using "h"/"H" would take up more space and make derivation paths and descriptors difficult to read. Additionally, it would be less efficient when making metal backups. David suggested alternative options like completely killing "'", but it was not feasible due to widespread use of descriptors, or calculating the checksum over s/(h|H)/', which had been discussed before but not implemented due to the need for dumb checksum checkers that don't have to parse descriptors. In conclusion, the text was updated to use "h", but alternatives were still being considered.</summary>
