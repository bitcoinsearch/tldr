    <summary>Jeremy, a member of the Bitcoin community, shares his thoughts on sophisticated covenants in response to a question. He personally does not worry about arbitrary covenants as he believes validation costs can be kept in check and individuals are free to burn their coins if they so choose. However, he wants to ensure that when covenants are enabled, people do not have to jump through too many hoops. Jeremy understands that the broader community is unconvinced about the cost benefit of arbitrary covenants and has worked to emphasize that specific additions should not entail the risk of accidentally introducing more than what was bargained for. In regards to CSFS, Jeremy is a fan of it and knows others such as Russel, Sanket, and Olaoluwa who share the same interest. Although there may be a lack of developer interest in it at the moment, Jeremy believes that upgrades can be developed and tracked in parallel. He is taking on the windmill tilting personally to spearhead the development of CSFS as an independent non-bundle. Jeremy also provides a link to his current thinking on how to proceed with deploying and developing covenant systems for Bitcoin.</summary>
