    <summary>The author made a comment on Github about the appropriateness of using anyprevout. They note that when it is used for eltoo, there are limitations to its functionality and overloading of the CLTV clause. The author suggests several options to better serve the eltoo use case, including defining a new CSV type and creating a sequenced signature. They also consider defining a new generic place for lock times in the annex. The author is partial to option 3 as it seems to be closest to making ANYPREVOUT more precisely designed to support Eltoo.</summary>
