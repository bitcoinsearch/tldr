    <summary>Andrew Chow has proposed a derivation path scheme for single key Taproot scripts based on BIP 44. The proposed scheme aims to provide HD wallets with a common scheme to recover single key Taproot outputs. This proposal is not backwards compatible by design but is based on the same method used in BIPs 44, 49, and 84. The purpose value will be set to the BIP number once assigned. The proposed approach consists of two steps to derive multiple deterministic addresses based on a BIP 32 master private key. The address derivation method recommended in BIP 341 is used to derive the output key used in the P2TR script from the derived public key. However, Andrew feels that this BIP is somewhat unnecessary, but it seems like it will be needed to drive adoption and implementation of Taproot into software and hardware wallets.The derived keys should be for the Taproot internal key, which should then be tweaked with the hash of itself as recommended by BIP 341. This BIP does not specify new version bytes for extended key serialization because descriptors have made it unnecessary. The proposed scheme is aimed at allowing HD wallets that only have a backup of the HD seed to recover single key Taproot outputs. While there are solutions that do not require fixed derivation paths for specific script types, many software wallets and hardware signers still use seed backups that lack derivation path and script information. The test vectors are yet to be determined. Reference links for BIP 32, 43, 44, 49, 84, and 341 are provided in the document. The BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license, and the text can be viewed on GitHub.Meanwhile, Pavol Rusnak, co-founder and CTO of SatoshiLabs, has proposed a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). However, details of the proposal have not been disclosed yet.</summary>
