    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community, Michael Flaxman, has proposed a method for preventing privacy leaks in multisig quorums by using BIP32 paths. However, it is unlikely that an attacker would obtain a private BIP32 seed without also learning what HD paths it is being used with. It is assumed that most people store their descriptors alongside their seeds to ensure robust recovery. The use of taproot with multisignatures and threshold signatures should solve this problem as long as participants do not reuse the same keys in different contexts. It is suggested that wallet authors focus on implementing support for taproot and MuSig or MuSig2 over this scheme.</summary>
