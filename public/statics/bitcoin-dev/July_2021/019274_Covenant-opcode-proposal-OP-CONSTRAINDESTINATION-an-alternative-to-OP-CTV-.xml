    <summary>A proposal for a new opcode called OP_CONSTRAINDESTINATION has been introduced. The purpose of this opcode is to restrict the destination address that an output's coins can be directed to, allowing step-wise covenant scripts. This involves specifying particular addresses the output is allowed to send coins to, as well as constraining the amount of the fee that the output is allowed to contribute to. The primary motivation for creating this opcode is to create more flexible wallet vaults compared to OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY.Wallet vaults created with OP_CTV must be created in specified chunks and are explicitly tied to a particular utxo sent to it. In contrast, OP_CD allows more flexibility as it only constrains the address to be sent to from the vault but does not put additional constraints on the transaction. This means that outputs can be combined into a single transaction like a normal transaction. The proposal for this opcode can be found on Github, and feedback is welcome to improve its presentation or identify any issues that may have been missed.</summary>
