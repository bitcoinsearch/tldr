    <summary>The author suggests having a 'Bitcoin Privacy week or month' to raise awareness about privacy issues in Bitcoin. They believe that privacy is as important as security and wants to encourage users to take it seriously. The author acknowledges that there are already positive contributions made towards improving privacy in Bitcoin, but believes that they are often overshadowed by influencers with more followers. The author provides a link to a speech from an Indian web series and encourages developers to help improve privacy by sharing an issue from a Bitcoin project related to privacy, a pull request, or anything else they think may help.</summary>
