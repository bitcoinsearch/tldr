    <summary>ZmnSCPxj responded to Jeremy's concerns about arbitrary covenants in the broader community and emphasized the importance of respecting the concerns of others without lobotomizing useful tools. ZmnSCPxj refuted Shinobi's post's concerns about covenants, stating that they are already present in altcoins and recursive covenants would not make any problems worse. ZmnSCPxj argued that an "inescapable" covenant is equivalent to a `while (true);` loop, making covenants Turing-complete. However, he suggested that encoding an upper bound on the number of recursions could prevent full Turing-completeness while allowing for a large number of use-cases.</summary>
