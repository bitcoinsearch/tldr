    <summary>Raymo, a developer, shared his Sabu protocol as a potential solution for Bitcoin scaling with the Bitcoin community through the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The Sabu protocol aims to increase Bitcoin circulation by enabling one million transactions per second while also providing privacy to users. Raymo received constructive feedback and critiques from the community, leading him to add an additional part to the proposal that he had previously skipped due to brevity. Greg, a member of the community, expressed excitement about Raymo's work and wished him luck.</summary>
