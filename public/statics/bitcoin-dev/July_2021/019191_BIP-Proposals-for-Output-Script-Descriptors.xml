    <summary>In an email exchange between Craig Raw and David A. Harding, the former expressed concerns regarding the use of "h"/"H" in descriptors. He argued that it takes up more space and makes derivation paths and descriptors more difficult to read. However, Harding countered these arguments by pointing out that the difference in space is only 0.7% and that there are no issues with readability or transcription errors due to the use of a fixed character width font and checksums. Additionally, he mentioned that using apostrophes actually provides more whitespace and makes the path easier to parse visually. Harding went on to explain that the real concern lies in using "-containing descriptors in a bourne-style shell, which can lead to loss of money by sending bitcoins to the descriptor for a key your hardware signing device won't sign for. He cited examples of users needing technical support for this issue and stated that it is much more serious than using a tiny bit of extra space in a GUI or on a physical backup medium. Raw ultimately agreed with Harding's points and thanked him for the detailed reply.</summary>
