    <summary>In an email thread on 7/2/21, David A. Harding requested that "h"/"H" be made the preferred aliases over "'" in bourne-style shells. He explained that using "'" is annoying and may cause unnecessary complications. Andrew replied that he had updated the text to use "h". David provided two alternatives to completely killing "'": implementing "'" as a SHOULD rather than a MUST and calculating the checksum over s/(h|H)/'/. However, Andrew pointed out that these options would be complicated due to the widespread use of descriptors. The conclusion was that the checksum should be strictly over the string itself to allow for dumb checksum checkers that don't have to parse descriptors. David signed off his email with thanks.
