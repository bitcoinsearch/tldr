    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Eric recommends against using Base58 for anything except copy-pasting. He goes on to explain that internally, public keys are DER-encoded integers. Jeffrey Paul asks for clarification on a recommendation made by devrandom at CryptoCorp, which is to sort lexicographically by the public key bytes of the leaf public keys. Jeffrey confirms that this refers to the raw bytes of the public key itself, rather than the ASCII Base58 representation of the pubkey hash. The email includes contact information for Jeffrey and a promotion for GigeNET's new data center in Ashburn.</summary>
