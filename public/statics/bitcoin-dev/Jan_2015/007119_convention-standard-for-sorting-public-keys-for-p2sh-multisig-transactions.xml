    <summary>In the context mentioned, a public key is defined as a point in the elliptic curve with an X and Y component. The serialization of the public key is described concisely on the Bitcoin Wiki's protocol specification page. It is clarified that pubkeys are represented as raw integers, embedded in Script as a push operation whose payload is the raw bytes of the big-endian representation of the integer. It is noted that DER encoding is only used for signatures and not for pubkeys.</summary>
