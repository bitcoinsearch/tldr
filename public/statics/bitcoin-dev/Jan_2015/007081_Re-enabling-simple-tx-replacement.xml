    <summary>In an email exchange on January 4, 2015, between Gregory Maxwell and an unknown recipient, Maxwell requested the raw transaction data, which was not available on the website in question. However, he later realized that the issue with the behavior of testnet was due to IsStandardTx being bypassed, resulting in non-mempooling being enforced. Maxwell suggested that this should be enforced elsewhere and noted that this is not a problem on the actual network.</summary>
