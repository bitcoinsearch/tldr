    <title>[softfork proposal] Strict DER signatures</title>

    <summary>Zooko has reviewed the links provided by the author and suggests that it seems like a good idea to use the upgrade mechanism from BIP 34. He inquires about whether bipstrictder should provide a rationale or link to accept the 0-length sig as correctly-encoded-but-invalid and whether there are still multiple ways to encode a correctly encoded but invalid signature. Zooko also recommends verifying all branches of the new IsDERSignature() from https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/0c427135151a6bed657438ffb2e670be84eb3642 are tested by the test vectors in https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/f94e806f8bfa007a3de4b45fa3c9860f2747e427 and finishing the TODOs in https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/b7986119a5d41337fea1e83804ed6223438158ec so that it actually tests the upgrade behavior. Additionally, he points out a missing comment: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/e186f6a80161f9fa45fbced82ab1d22f081b942c#commitcomment-9406643. Overall, he thanks the author for their good work and hopes his comments help.</summary>
