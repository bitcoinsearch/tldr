    <summary>The conversation dated 14th January 2015 between Jeffrey Paul and an unknown person regarding the clarification of the raw bytes of public keys has been provided. In the conversation, Jeffrey Paul asked for clarification about the raw bytes of the public key itself, not the ascii base58 representation of the pubkey hash. The unknown person was requested to give an example of two pubkeys where raw(pubkey1) &gt; raw(pubkey2) and base58(pubkey1) is greater than or equal to base58(pubkey2).</summary>
