    <summary>The post discusses how to cope with OpenSSL vulnerability on Bitcoin. OpenSSL is the primary cryptographic library used for SSL/TLS connections in Bitcoin. A patch has been developed to cope with the new OpenSSL versions, and it is available on stable branches 0.8, 0.9, and rc branch 0.10. The post provides links to fetch, build, and test these patches. Users can clone branches of their choice and perform the necessary steps to update their systems. The post also includes an announcement about the Go Parallel Website, sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media, which is a hub for all things parallel software development.</summary>
