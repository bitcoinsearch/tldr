    <summary>In a discussion about protobuf, it was mentioned that protobuf doesn't have guaranteed determinism properties. However, sub-messages are stored as byte arrays instead of typed submessages to ensure consistency across most implementations. It was also noted that Python used to be an odd one out in this regard, but it's unclear if that's still the case. The BIP 70 protocol uses protobuf because the original prototype was designed and implemented by someone who used to work at Google and was familiar with the technology.</summary>
