    <summary>On January 19, 2015, Jeff Garzik discussed the drawbacks of using text formats such as XML or JSON. These formats are less deterministic, more loosely specified, have a wide variance in parsing, and are not very hashable. Protocol buffers aren't any more hashable than XML or JSON because round trips aren't deterministic with standard protobuf libraries. To make it deterministic, you end up creating a new standard. One client had a problem with an asset representation standard and had to roll their own format.</summary>
