    <summary>Ruben de Vries, CTO of BlockTrail, has suggested the need for a standard way of sorting public keys in P2SH multisig transactions. According to him, the order of public keys affects the hash and there is no agreed-upon way of sorting them. He proposes that setting a standard would make it easier for multisig services to be compatible with each other and allow importation of keys from one service to another. Although he is not suggesting forcing the order, he believes that recommending a standard would encourage new services to follow suit. Ryan from BitPay had previously brought up this issue, and Bitcore has implemented lexicographical sorting on the hex of the public key. Ruben could not find any other library with a sorting function, let alone using it by default, so Bitcore is currently his only reference. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, responded to Ruben's proposal, suggesting that it warrants a micro-BIP to bring everyone on the same page.</summary>
