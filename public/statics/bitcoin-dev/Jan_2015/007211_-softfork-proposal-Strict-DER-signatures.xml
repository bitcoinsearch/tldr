    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed a softfork to make non-DER signatures illegal, which have been non-standard since v0.8.0. The draft BIP text can be found on GitHub. The proposal was assigned the BIP number 0066. Positive feedback was received from several implementers, including Amir Taak. One concern raised was the possibility of an nlocked spend with an invalidly encoded signature. In those cases, the signature can be mutated to get it mined and would need to already pass IsStandard rules. This issue does not cover cases where there is a chain of transactions after the nlocked transaction. However, these cases would already be at extreme risk of malleability, and avoiding them would undermine the intent of the BIP (independence from a specific encoding scheme).</summary>
