    <summary>The author of the text is contemplating if it would be possible to print a wallet's account number, in base16 or base64 format, on paper for physical storage in a home or bank safe. The idea is to have a backup option in case there is a computer hardware disaster. In this scenario, the user would type the information from paper into a small converter program that would recreate the wallet file. However, to ensure security against bank fraud and theft, the output on paper should be encrypted, and the owner should store the key somewhere else. The author suggests that developers make this functionality available to users.</summary>
