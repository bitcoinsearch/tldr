    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Mike Hearn stated that most micropayment channel ideas have a limitation of one-way payment flow. He further added that the original protocol as designed by Satoshi had no such limitation but has evolved over time due to ad-hoc DoS fixes. He mentioned that a different approach to handling DoS attacks based on resource prioritisation and scheduling will become necessary in the future and the original design could be safely brought back to life at that point. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, questioned Mike's reference to the "original design" without mentioning how it was different or better. The email also included information about the Go Parallel website which is a hub for all things parallel software development.</summary>
