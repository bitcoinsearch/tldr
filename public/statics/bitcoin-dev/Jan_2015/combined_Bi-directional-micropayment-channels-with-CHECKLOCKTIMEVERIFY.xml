    <summary>The context discusses micropayment channels and their limitation of only allowing payments to flow in one direction. Mike Hearn proposed a new protocol that improves on the use of a new nLockTime for each reverse payment by keeping the wait time independent of the number of payments and not requiring either party to predict ahead of time how many payments will occur.Hearn also mentioned the original design of Satoshi, which did not have the limitation of one-way payment flow. Jeff Garzik questioned Hearn's reference to the "original design" without mentioning how it was different or better.The proposed protocol allows for refunding an amount to the depositor by negotiating a rewind of the payment sequence to the point where the depositor had a balance greater than the desired balance. The payment chain is then forked at D_i, with a branch D_i+1, D_i+2â€¦ and a branch that only has D'_i+1. The receiver unwinds the old branch back to D_i by revealing S_i+1 to the depositor. When the two parties want to close the payment channel, one party signs a transaction and sends it to the other party to add their own signature and publish, avoiding any waiting time restrictions.However, the protocol does not deal with malicious attacks on a party's network connection, which could keep them offline until CHECKLOCKTIME has expired. Each party should consider this when choosing how long the restrictions should be in place for. Using an HMAC-style derivation is more of a convenience than anything else, but it does encode the fact that the addresses form a chain into the addresses' scripts, which is a nice property to have.In addition, the context includes an email from Nathan Cook asking for a concrete example of scriptPubKeys/transactions using an idea proposed by an unknown individual to allow bi-directional payment channels. The unknown individual suggests that current micropayment channels only allow payments in one direction and opening a second payment channel in the opposite direction requires both parties to deposit funds over the lifetime of the two channels. To remedy this issue, they propose having only one channel as a deposit saver.The context also discusses the potential for malicious miners to break the system and the need for users to weigh the risks and benefits of using Bitcoin. Hearn suggests that the ideal scenario would be absolute soundness in the rules, followed by cryptographic soundness, economic soundness, and honesty soundness. Lastly, the message promotes the website Go Parallel aimed at parallel software development.</summary>
