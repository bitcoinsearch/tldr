    <summary>In an email exchange on January 4, 2015, Gregory Maxwell expressed his appreciation for presenting a solution as code. He found it to be a useful way of communicating and wished more people would do the same. This sentiment was echoed by another individual who responded with a "+1". The use of code to present solutions allows for clear and concise communication between parties. It also helps to ensure accuracy and can aid in troubleshooting if any issues arise. Overall, the use of code in communication is a valuable tool that should be utilized more frequently.</summary>
