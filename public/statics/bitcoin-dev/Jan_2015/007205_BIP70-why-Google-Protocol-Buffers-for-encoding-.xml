    <summary>In modifying BIP70 to function with an altcoin, there was consideration of replacing protocol buffers.

The idea of serializing a blockchain identifier with messages was proposed, but arbitrarily deviating from a given design choice just for the sake of diversity would not necessarily serve the quality of the blockchain network.</summary>
