    <summary>On January 31, 2015, Martin Habov≈°tiak proposed a solution to the security problems faced by servers holding large amounts of bitcoins such as exchanges and markets. He suggested an extension of BIP70 which supports making of multisig transactions dynamically and is not fully compatible due to security reasons. The most important feature of this proposal is that the user provides his address. Martin shared the idea in a GitHub gist (https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/2ec79cf40a53fb899ac5) and requested feedback from the community. Another person responded saying that they had a similar proposal, but it involved sharing generic P2SH scripts and facilitating requesting of signatures. They expressed interest in discussing the idea further with Martin. The email thread also included information about the Go Parallel Website, sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media. It is a hub for all things parallel software development, including thought leadership blogs, news, videos, case studies, tutorials, and more. Overall, the email thread discusses proposals to solve the security problems faced by servers holding large amounts of bitcoins and includes links to resources for parallel software development.</summary>
