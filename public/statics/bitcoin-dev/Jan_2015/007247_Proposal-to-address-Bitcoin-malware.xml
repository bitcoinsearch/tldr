    <summary>In an email conversation on February 1, 2015, Natanael discussed the calculation of entropy required for bruteforcing eight decimal digits. The calculation involved using 50,000,000 tries on average and resulted in 25.6 bits of entropy. However, there was an error in the calculation as the division by two should not have been included in the entropy calculation. This mistake only adds one bit to the equation, resulting in a total of 26.6 bits of entropy needed.</summary>
