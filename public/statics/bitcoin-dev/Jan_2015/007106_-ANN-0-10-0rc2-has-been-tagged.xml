Notable changes relative to the previous version include improvements in robustness, bug fixes, and updates to seed IPs based on bitcoin.sipa.be crawler data. The release notes detail the changes made in this update, which include catching UTXO set read errors, introducing a 10-minute block download timeout, improving the robustness of DER recoding code, failing immediately on an empty signature, bumping OpenSSL to 1.0.1k, and more.
