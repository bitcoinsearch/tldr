    <summary>In an email from Nathan Cook, he asks for a concrete example of scriptPubKeys/transactions using an idea proposed by an unknown individual. Cook believes it would make the review process easier for everyone. The unknown individual suggests that current micropayment channels only allow payments in one direction and opening a second payment channel in the opposite direction requires both parties to deposit funds over the lifetime of the two channels. To remedy this issue, they propose having only one channel as a deposit saver. They also provide a link to a CLTV-using micropayment channel demo on GitHub for reference material.</summary>
