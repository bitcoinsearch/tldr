    <summary>CryptoCorp recommends sorting public key bytes of the leaf public keys by lexicographic order, which is also suggested by BitPay. Ruben de Vries has raised concerns regarding the lack of agreement on the standard way of sorting public keys in p2sh multisig transactions, which could lead to compatibility issues between different services. He suggests that a recommended standard be set for sorting public keys, without forcing it, to allow easier importation of keys from one service to another. Ryan from BitPay had earlier raised the issue and implemented lexicographical sorting on the hex of the public key in bitcore. However, Ruben could not find any other library with such a sorting function.</summary>
