    <summary>On January 21st, 2015, Gavin Andresen reviewed the DERSIG BIP and suggested some changes. He noted that the reference to the "DER standard" should be linked to http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf, which is considered the best reference for DER. Additionally, he recommended changing the wording from "this would simplify avoiding OpenSSL in consensus implementations" to "this would make it easier for non-OpenSSL implementations." Andresen also suggested being more explicit about the term "opcode failure," which was used in the proposal. Moreover, he proposed changing the phrase "since v0.8.0, and nearly no transactions" to "and very few transactions." Lastly, he advised replacing the sentence "reducing this avenue for malleability is useful on itself as well" with a simpler phrase such as "This proposal has the added benefit of reducing transaction malleability (see BIP62)."</summary>
