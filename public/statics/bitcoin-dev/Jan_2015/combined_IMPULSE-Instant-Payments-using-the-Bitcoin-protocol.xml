    <summary>On January 17th, 2015, Rune Kjær Svendsen expressed his concern about the lack of discussion around potentially privacy-hostile products and shared a link to a product called Impulse on Reddit, asking for thoughts on the matter. The product appeared to be related to online privacy, but details were scarce. In an effort to promote online privacy, Svendsen also included a link to a YouTube video that provides instructions on email encryption.In another post on the same day, Svendsen shared a PDF document titled 'Impulse - A Proposal for Reduced Bitcoin Transaction Fees and Instant Confirmations' and asked for thoughts from the community. The proposal suggests using payment channels to reduce transaction fees and provide instant confirmations. This would allow for fast and cheap transactions while still maintaining the security of the blockchain. The proposal aims to address some of the key issues facing Bitcoin, such as high transaction fees and slow confirmation times.The discussion also touches upon the security of user experience in the future, which is expected to be more secure than it is now. The future is believed to support various payment facilitators, including m-of-n oracles, which will be perfectly compatible with that. Tom Harding asks whether success will be defined by "BitPay Payment Channels Accepted Here" signs appearing in shop windows. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., is part of the conversation.Lastly, there is an advertisement for GigeNET's new data center in Ashburn, VA offering a free month of service with a new server in Ashburn. Overall, the posts and discussions highlight the need for wider adoption of Bitcoin to measure its success and address key issues facing the cryptocurrency.</summary>
