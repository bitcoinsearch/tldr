    <summary>The author of this context believes that the use of protocol buffer and x509 by BIP70 is a poor choice, as it prioritizes efficiency and flexibility over portability. To address this issue, the author parsed a BIP70 message with a web service that converts it to JSON, but this solution has a trust dependency and handles certificate verification through the web service rather than the device. Even if the Google buffer problem were solved, validating the x509 certificate chain on all platforms would still be a challenge. The author suggests that a simple BIP70 using JSON + HTTPS would have made things easier, although it would require the merchant to own the domain name of the BIP70 endpoint, which the author considers to be a typical aspect of e-commerce.</summary>
