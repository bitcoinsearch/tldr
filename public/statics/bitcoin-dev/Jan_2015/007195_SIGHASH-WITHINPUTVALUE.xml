    <summary>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Marek on January 23, 2015, Maxwell suggested a safe soft-fork approach as an alternative to a hard fork. He explained that using the new signature type would require newly created addresses for users to get coins. When Marek asked for references regarding this approach, Maxwell admitted he was not aware of any. Marek also inquired about the long time it takes to sign transactions with multiple inputs on a device with limited memory capabilities. Maxwell explained that in such cases, all previous transactions need to be streamed into the device for every signed input. As a result, there are roughly 200^2 transaction verifications for 200 inputs to sign, making the process very slow but without limiting the device for any particular size of signed transaction.</summary>
