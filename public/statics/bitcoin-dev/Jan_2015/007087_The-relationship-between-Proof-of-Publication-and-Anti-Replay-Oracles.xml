    <summary>Peter Todd proposed a "proof-of-publication" system in which opaque data is embedded in transactions using OP_RETURN, but he received criticism from Adam Back. While establishing "proof-of-publication" as a universal underlying primitive would be significant, it alone is not sufficient for indexing, validation, or exclusion. In response to critiques, it is unclear whether there will be an answer to the effectiveness of this system or if anyone other than Peter Todd believes in it.</summary>
