    <summary>In an email exchange on January 20th, 2015, Rusty Russell and Pieter discussed a coding issue. Rusty commented on null bytes at the start of R being disallowed, unless it would otherwise be interpreted as a negative number. However, Pieter corrected him, pointing out that he meant null bytes at the start of S. The error was quickly fixed, but no further details were provided about the context or purpose of the code.</summary>
