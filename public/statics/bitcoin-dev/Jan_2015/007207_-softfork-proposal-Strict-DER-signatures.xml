    <summary>In a discussion on January 25, 2015, Pieter Wuille suggested adding an upper bound for R/S lengths in both IsStandard and STRICTDER. Initially, soft-forks hitting transactions that many nodes would relay+mine created a forking risk, but with the realization that imbalanced R/S plus checksig-not would only work with 0.10rc/git changed the situation. Miners no longer appeared to be racing the bleeding edge as they did two years ago, and it had never shown up in a release. The next RC would make those non-standard and give time before the soft-fork activates for any stragglers on 0.10 prerelease code to update. The deployment of the soft-fork rules themselves would already drive people to update. In terms of being robust to implementation differences, not permitting overlarge R/S is prudent.</summary>
