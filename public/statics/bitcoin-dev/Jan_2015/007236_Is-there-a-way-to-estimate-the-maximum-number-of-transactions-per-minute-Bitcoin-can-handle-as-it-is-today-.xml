    <summary>Alipay, a Chinese payment platform, reportedly handled up to 2.85 million transactions per minute, with 54 percent of its transactions being made via mobile device. However, the claim has been met with some skepticism, given that it would be almost five times what Visa handles across the entire world. The wording "up to" indicates that this may have been a peak performance caused by external factors, rather than sustained throughout the day. The discussion then turns to the scalability of Bitcoin, with concerns raised about whether miners have enough bandwidth and CPU power to handle the amount of data generated by transactions. However, it is noted that scaling is a nice problem to have and that growing market share is difficult, so it is more important to focus on getting users than worrying about precise broadcast protocols.</summary>
