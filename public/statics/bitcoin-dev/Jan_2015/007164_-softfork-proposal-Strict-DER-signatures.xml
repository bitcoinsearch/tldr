    <summary>On January 20th, 2015, Pieter Wuille posted a paper for Bitcoin developers to review. Comments and criticisms were encouraged on the mailing list rather than on the gist. Senior Developer at Armory Technologies, Douglas Roark, provided feedback in response to the paper. First, he pointed out a typo in the first sentence of the “Deployment” section. Next, he suggested tweaking the comments in IsDERSignature()’s handling of the sighash byte for clarity. Finally, Roark questioned whether code to allow a signature with size=0 to pass in IsDERSignature() when it is not actually DER-encoded should be elsewhere in the Bitcoin code.</summary>
