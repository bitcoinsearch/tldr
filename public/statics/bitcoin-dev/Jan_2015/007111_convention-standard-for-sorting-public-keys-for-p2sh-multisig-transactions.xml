    <summary>Haskoin, a company in the cryptocurrency industry, follows the same method of sorting public keys as recommended by CryptoCorp. The method involves sorting the public keys lexicographically based on the bytes of their leaf public keys. This is the same approach used by BitPay. The recommendation was made in an email exchange on January 14, 2015, between devrandom and an unknown recipient. The use of public keys is essential in the functioning of cryptocurrencies. Public keys are used to receive payments, while private keys are used to authorize transactions. Sorting public keys based on their bytes simplifies the process of verifying transactions and ensures that transactions can be traced back to the correct parties. CryptoCorp was a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry until its closure in 2015. Its recommendations regarding public key sorting were widely followed by other companies in the industry, including Haskoin. Despite its closure, CryptoCorp's influence on the industry is still evident today through the continued implementation of its recommendations.</summary>
