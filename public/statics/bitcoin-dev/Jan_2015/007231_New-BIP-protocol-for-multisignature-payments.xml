    <summary>The author of the message is proposing an idea to solve security problems for servers holding large amounts of bitcoins such as exchanges and markets. The idea is an extension of BIP70 that supports making multisig transactions dynamically, with the user providing their address. The proposal can be found on Github. The author is looking for feedback on whether this is a good solution or if there is something better. They would like to see this or something similar implemented by wallets.</summary>
