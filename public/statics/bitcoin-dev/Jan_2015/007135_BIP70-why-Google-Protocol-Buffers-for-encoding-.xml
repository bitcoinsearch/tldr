    <summary>The email exchange between Alan Reiner and Richard Brady, dated January 19, 2015, discusses the use of protobuf in BIP70. Reiner expresses confusion around the determinism properties of protobuf, stating that he thought there was no guarantee that two identical protobuf structures would get serialized identically. In response, it is explained that while protobuf does not have deterministic serialization, BIP70 passes around serialized protobuf data that is signed directly because it can easily be a byte array with json instead. It is also noted that other formats such as JSON and XML have their own flaws.The email chain ends with an advertisement for GigeNET's new data center in Ashburn, VA, offering a free month of service with a new server. This email also includes information about the data center's high performing configurations, 100TB of bandwidth, higher redundancy, lower latency, increased capacity, and compliance. Finally, links to the Bitcoin-development mailing list are provided at the end of both emails.</summary>
