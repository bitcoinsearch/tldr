    <summary>The author expresses concern about two projects that could potentially increase the current transaction volume by up to 100 times, particularly in regards to legal bittorrent file sales and P2P Amazon (OpenBazaar). They note that currently, the likes of centralized solutions such as Bitpay and Coinbase are necessary to manage expected transactional volume until technology is ready to handle it in a true P2P fashion. A discussion ensues regarding Alipay's claim of handling up to 2.85 million transactions per minute, with the author questioning the validity of the claim and suggesting that scalability is a nice problem to have, indicating popularity. The author suggests worrying more about gaining 300 million users than the precise broadcast protocol needed to handle them.</summary>
