    <summary>Micropayment channels have a limitation where payments can only flow in one direction. The original protocol designed by Satoshi did not have this limitation, but it has evolved over time due to ad-hoc DoS fixes. While these fixes were necessary, a different approach based on resource prioritisation and scheduling may eventually be implemented, allowing for the original design to be safely brought back to life.</summary>
