    <summary>Bitcoin is currently facing a challenge in finding a suitable platform for mainstream users who are not tech-savvy, with the available solutions offering either DIY security and privacy or relying on third-party services. Traditional banks have an advantage over third-party services, whereas anyone can create a wallet/platform without any regulation or entry costs in the Bitcoin space, which poses a serious threat to the end user's security. Several services have tried to solve this problem using multisig to create a 2-factor authentication/authorization mechanism, but those solutions did not increase security. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and a scarce commodity, making insuring them a significant challenge. The author suggests that a decentralized platform can provide both security and privacy, and true 2-factor authentication/authorization schemes can improve personal security significantly. This could lead to third-party wallet services becoming obsolete and enable non-technical users to use Bitcoin securely while creating a baseline for building innovative services on top. The author believes that there is a major crossroad ahead regarding a suitable platform for the average non-technical mainstream user in Bitcoin. Two extremes currently exist: do-it-yourself security and privacy, or let a third-party service do it for you. Furthermore, the author urges those managing bitcoin.org to reconsider the criteria for what is posted on the website, suggesting that the "web wallet" section should be removed, with the exception of CoinKite, which has made advances in privacy and merits usage by people. Additionally, the author recommends only a few wallets, namely Electrum, Mycelium, Core, and hardware wallets Trezor and HW1. Finally, the author urges those working for Coinbase customer operations or Bitpay to resign from their employment, suggesting their skills are in high demand elsewhere.In response to a recent post by Joichi Ito, the Director of the MIT Media Lab, who offered his thoughts on "Why Bitcoin is and isn't like the Internet," there may be a need for an ICANN equivalent for Bitcoin. A body that can manage the nexus to the physical world, much like ICANN, could help address Bitcoin's catastrophic failure modes. As custodial bitcoins may be worth more than non-custodial ones, a solution for insured storage options is essential. Ultimately, the only way to insure Bitcoin holdings is through an insurer who holds enough Bitcoin to cover the replacement of insured funds. Large Bitcoin holders find themselves uniquely positioned to engage in super-cat insurance businesses as Bitcoin grows into a major global currency.Andreas Antonopoulos says that either Bitcoin will arrive on the global stage and make a substantial impact, or it will die. Bitcoin needs a strong backbone of insured storage options so that even early adopters who hold large amounts of Bitcoin can confidently participate in this new technology. Dr. Ito is invited to join the next month's DevCore Boston conference aimed at supporting the future development of Bitcoin, located just an hour's walk from MIT.</summary>
