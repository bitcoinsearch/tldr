    <title>Proposal to address Bitcoin malware</title>

    <summary>The conversation revolves around Bitcoin addresses and the security issues surrounding them. The reference to 'vanitygen' is made, which is a tool used to generate a vanity bitcoin address. The discussion then shifts towards viruses that manipulate Bitcoin addresses, with the assumption being that these viruses use hardcoded rogue bitcoin addresses instead of dynamically generated ones. To protect against such malware, generating an 8 digit code for a legitimate Bitcoin address could serve as a basic mitigation measure. However, it is also noted that the next level of sophistication would be for the malware to brute-force the legitimate Bitcoin address and generate a rogue Bitcoin address that produces the same 8 digit code. The time required for this brute force process is questioned, along with the possibility of some other hashing function being performed before converting to 8 digits.</summary>
