    <summary>In an email conversation on January 22, 2015, U.Mutlu discussed the lack of support for Hierarchical Deterministic aka BIP32 wallets in Bitcoin Core. This means that only one private key can be backed up per backup, which is not only useless but also dangerous. Mutlu suggested that developers create such functionality for users. Pavol Rusnak, in response to Mutlu's suggestion, advised looking into software wallets like Electrum or Multibit that do support such functionality.</summary>
