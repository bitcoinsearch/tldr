    <summary>For p2sh multisig transactions, the order of public keys affects the hash and there is no agreed-upon standard for sorting them. A standard way of sorting public keys would make it easier for services implementing multisig to be compatible with each other and for importing keys from one service to another. There is no suggestion to force the order, but rather to set a recommended standard that new services should follow. Ryan from BitPay previously brought up this issue and in bitcore, they have implemented lexicographical sorting on the hex of the public key. However, in a short search, no other library was found with a sorting function, let alone using it by default, making bitcore the only reference available currently. Ruben de Vries, CTO of BlockTrail, presented this information.</summary>
