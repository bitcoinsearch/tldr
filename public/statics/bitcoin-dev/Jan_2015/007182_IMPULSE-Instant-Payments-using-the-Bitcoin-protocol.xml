    <summary>The discussion is about the security of user experience in the future, which is expected to be significantly more secure than it is now. The future is believed to support various payment facilitators, including m-of-n oracles, and this will be perfectly compatible with that. Tom Harding asks whether success will be defined by "BitPay Payment Channels Accepted Here" signs appearing in shop windows. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., is part of the conversation. A PDF link to Impulse is shared and Rune Kj√¶r Svendsen invites thoughts from the list. Finally, there is an advertisement for GigeNET's new data center in Ashburn, VA offering a free month of service with a new server in Ashburn.</summary>
