    <summary>In a conversation between Isidor Zeuner and Ross, they discussed the modification of BIP70 to function with an altcoin. The changes were necessary to mitigate any risk that payment requests could not be accidentally applied to the wrong blockchain. Isidor suggested serializing some kind of blockchain identifier with the messages to maintain consistency in design. However, Ross proposed replacing the network identifier with the genesis block hash. This modification would not accidentally work with Bitcoin Core or vice-versa but is easily extensible to any other altcoins that want to use the specification without requiring any central registry.</summary>
