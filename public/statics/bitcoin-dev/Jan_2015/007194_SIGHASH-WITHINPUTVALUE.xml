    <summary>Adam Back proposed a way to address incentive incompatibility issue on a special singleton sidechain, which is merge mined and has a consensus rule to require some proportion of reward be sent to it via coinbase tx. This can be used to store live versions of hard fork wishlist items where people who need them early can help validate them. However, he was unsure if this would help with the full network upgrade issue. Meanwhile, Tamas Blummer suggested that nodes should not relay excessive fee transactions as this would reduce the financial risk. Alan Reiner pointed out that one major attack vector is isolating someone's node, getting them to sign away their whole wallet to fee, and then selling it to a mining pool to mine it before they could figure out why their transactions aren't making it to the network.</summary>
