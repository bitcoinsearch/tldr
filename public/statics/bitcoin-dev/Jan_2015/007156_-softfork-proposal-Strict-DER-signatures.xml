    <summary>The risk of depending on OpenSSL for consensus rules has been a concern and there have been efforts to remove this dependency as part of BIP 62, which was postponed due to unforeseen complexities. Recent events have highlighted the problem and a fundamental solution is needed. A softfork is proposed to make non-DER signatures illegal, as they have been non-standard since v0.8.0. A draft BIP text and implementation with unit tests can be found on GitHub. Comments and criticisms are welcome, but the discussion should remain on the mailing list.</summary>
