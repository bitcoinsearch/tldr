    <summary>In this context, Gavin Andresen suggests nit-picky changes to DERSIG BIP. He recommends linking "DER standard" to the best reference for DER. He suggests rephrasing "this would simplify avoiding OpenSSL in consensus implementations" to "this would make it easier for non-OpenSSL implementations." To clarify "opcode failure," Andresen advises being more explicit. Additionally, he suggests changing "since v0.8.0, and nearly no transactions" to "and very few transactions..." Lastly, he suggests rewording "reducing this avenue for malleability is useful on itself as well" to "This proposal has the added benefit of reducing transaction malleability (see BIP62)."</summary>
