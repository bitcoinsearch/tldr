    <summary>The email thread discusses the need for a BIP outlining how to determine multisig scripthash address. The current method assumes the set of keys and sorts them before deriving and sending funds to such an address. However, there is scope for further refinement by anticipating only compressed keys for scripts. This is because it is possible to cause confusion if one puts forward a compressed key at some time and an uncompressed key at another, even though there is no difference to the keys involved. There is agreement among the developers that there is a need for a BIP outlining this process, and the writer is building a list of implementations which currently support sorting. The email also contains a discussion about pubkeys and their representation as DER-encoded integers. The email author's PGP key is available in the attachment.</summary>
