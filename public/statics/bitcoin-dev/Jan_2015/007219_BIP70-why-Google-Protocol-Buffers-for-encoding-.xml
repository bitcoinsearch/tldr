    <summary>In a message dated January 28, 2015, Mike Hearn reminded users that there is no obligation to use the OS root store, instead suggesting that it may be better to take a snapshot of the Mozilla/Apple/MSFT certificate stores and load them into an app. However, Giuseppe Mazzotta warns that this approach can lead to outdated certificates as these companies update their stores at different paces. He also notes that shipping an app with its own snapshot of certificates can make the system less secure for casual users and harder to audit for administrators.</summary>
