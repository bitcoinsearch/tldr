    <summary>The proposal is to make non-DER signatures illegal in a soft fork, as they are already treated as non-standard in btcd. This is seen as a smart and sane thing to do, which greatly lowers the chances of disagreement about what is valid or invalid due to an underlying dependency. The recent events have highlighted the risk of depending on OpenSSL for consensus rules, and a fundamental solution is needed sooner rather than later. A draft BIP text, which includes motivation and specification, can be found on a GitHub link provided. Comments and criticisms are welcome, but the discussion should be kept on the mailing list.</summary>
