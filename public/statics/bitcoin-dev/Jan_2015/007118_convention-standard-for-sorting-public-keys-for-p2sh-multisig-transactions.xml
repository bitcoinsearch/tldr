    <summary>In January 2015, Ruben de Vries suggested on the Bitcoin-development mailing list that a standard way of sorting public keys should be set for p2sh multisig transactions to ensure compatibility between services. He suggested using lexicographical sorting on the hex of the public key, which had already been implemented in bitcore. Jeff Garzik agreed that a micro-BIP should be created to establish a standard and get everyone on the same page. The existing BIP45 mentions "lexicographically sorting the public keys" but does not provide specific details on how this should be done.</summary>
