    <summary>The message begins with a request for comments regarding the implications of developing bi-directional micropayment channels. The focus is on the concept of zakat, a system based on trust and somewhat circular in nature, which contrasts with the trustless bitcoin that utilizes math to keep the system going. The message provides links to further information on zakat and a traditional philanthropic historic overview in the USA from the 1900s forward. Mike Hearn shares his thoughts on the original design documented at the bottom of a wiki page and how time-locked transactions can be broadcast across the network and replaced by broadcasting a new transaction with higher sequence numbers. He discusses how miners could pick any version under the 2-of-2 channel model but disagrees with Gregory that people refuse to use protocols affected by malleability. Lastly, the message promotes the website Go Parallel aimed at parallel software development.</summary>
