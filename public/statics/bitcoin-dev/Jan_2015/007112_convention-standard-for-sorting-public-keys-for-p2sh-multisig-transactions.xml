    <summary>A discussion between devrandom and Jeffrey Paul took place on January 14, 2015. Devrandom's message explained that CryptoCorp recommends to its customers to sort lexicographically by the public key bytes of the leaf public keys in the same way as BitPay does. Jeffrey Paul sought clarification if it was the raw bytes of the public key itself, not the ASCII base58 representation of the pubkey hash. He added his contact details at eeqj.com and two phone numbers for America and worldwide.</summary>
