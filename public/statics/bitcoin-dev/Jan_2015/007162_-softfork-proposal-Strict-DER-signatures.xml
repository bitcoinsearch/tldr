    <title>[softfork proposal] Strict DER signatures</title>

    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille proposed a softfork to make non-DER signatures illegal, as a fundamental solution to the risks of depending on OpenSSL for consensus rules. This risk was seen in the recent events where OpenSSL 1.0.0p / 1.0.1k were incompatible and caused blockchain rejection. A draft BIP text along with motivation and specification can be found on a GitHub gist while the implementation with unit tests can be accessed on GitHub commit bipstrictder. Comments and criticisms on the proposal are welcomed but Pieter prefers keeping the discussion on the mailing list which is more accessible than on the gist.</summary>
