    <summary>The email thread is discussing the options available for a hard fork in Bitcoin. The sender of the email is considering a "soft-fork" alternative, but realizes that it would require senders to Trezor to use special outputs, which is not feasible. The discussion then turns to other pending projects waiting for a hard fork and the possibility of joining efforts. Alan Reiner responds with the idea that the new SIGHASH type is the only way that would allow devices like Trezor to simplify their design while still working securely on all funds contained by the wallet. The email also includes an advertisement for GigeNET's new data center in Ashburn, VA.</summary>
