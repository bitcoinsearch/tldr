    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed a softfork to make non-DER signatures illegal. This proposal comes in response to the recent events that have made clear the risks of depending on OpenSSL for consensus rules. Pieter had been trying to get rid of this dependency as part of BIP 62 but it was postponed due to unforeseen complexities. The draft BIP text and an implementation can be found on GitHub. Comments and criticisms are welcome, but Pieter would prefer keeping the discussion on the mailing list. Andrew Poelstra, a mathematics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, responded to Pieter's proposal saying that he had read it and it looks A-OK to him.</summary>
