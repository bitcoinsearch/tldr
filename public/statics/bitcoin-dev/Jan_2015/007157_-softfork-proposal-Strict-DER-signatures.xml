    <summary>Pieter Wuille has proposed a softfork to make non-DER signatures illegal. This is due to the risk of depending on OpenSSL for consensus rules which has been known for some time. The recent events have made it clear that the problem is very real and a fundamental solution is needed sooner rather than later. A draft BIP text can be found on GitHub. Additionally, there was a cut and paste bug in the last check where null bytes at the start of S were meant instead of R.</summary>
