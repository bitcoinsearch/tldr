    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Matt Whitlock raises a question about the representation of pubkeys in Script. Eric Lombrozo clarifies that internally, pubkeys are DER-encoded integers, but in Script, they are represented as raw integers. Wladimir adds that OP_CHECKSIG (and OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY) takes a DER-encoded pubkey and a DER-encoded signature on the stack. He also notes that it is not helpful to consider pubkeys or hashes as integers, as they are binary blob objects with either a fixed format (DER) or a fixed size (hashes). The conversation continues with Ruben de Vries from BlockTrail providing his contact information.</summary>
