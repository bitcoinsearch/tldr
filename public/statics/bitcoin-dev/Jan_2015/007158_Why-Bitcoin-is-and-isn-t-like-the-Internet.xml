    <summary>In response to a recent post by Joichi Ito, the Director of the MIT Media Lab, who offered his thoughts on "Why Bitcoin is and isn't like the Internet," there may be a need for an ICANN equivalent for Bitcoin. Alan Reiner, founder of Armory Technologies, expressed the need for insurance options to protect against loss events. This protection should include a disaster recovery mechanism, as noted by Andreas Antonopoulos. A body that can manage the nexus to the physical world, much like ICANN, could help address Bitcoin's catastrophic failure modes. As custodial bitcoins may be worth more than non-custodial ones, a solution for insured storage options is essential. Dr. Ito is invited to join the next month's DevCore Boston conference aimed at supporting the future development of Bitcoin, located just an hour's walk from MIT.</summary>
