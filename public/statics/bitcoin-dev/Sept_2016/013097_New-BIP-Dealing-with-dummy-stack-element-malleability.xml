    <summary>On September 2, 2016, Johnson Lau via bitcoin-dev announced the deployment of BIP9 using the same parameters for BIP141 and BIP143, with the name "segwit" and using bit 1. For Bitcoin mainnet, the BIP9 starttime is midnight TBD UTC and BIP9 timeout is also midnight TBD UTC. For Bitcoin testnet, the BIP9 starttime is midnight May 1, 2016 UTC and BIP9 timeout is midnight May 1, 2017 UTC. The reference client has produced compatible signatures from the beginning, and the NULLDUMMY rule has been enforced as relay policy by the reference client since v0.10.0. There has been no transactions violating the requirement being added to the chain since at least August 2015. It should be noted that for all scriptPubKey types in actual use, non-compliant signatures can trivially be converted into compliant ones. However, it is possible to create a scriptPubKey where that conversion is not possible. Additionally, the original author of NULLDUMMY expressed gratitude for its introduction into a soft-fork.</summary>
