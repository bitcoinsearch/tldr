    <summary>Johnson Lau, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, has proposed a restriction for segwit OP_IF argument as a policy. He is seeking more feedback from users of OP_IF to ACK or NACK his proposal. It is expected that Lightning network would use OP_IF frequently. Rusty, another member of the community, mentions that his current scripts use OP_IF and OP_NOTIF only after OP_EQUAL, except for one place where they use OP_EQUAL...OP_EQUAL...OP_ADD OP_IF. However, he notes that there will be no effect on the c-lightning implementation either way.</summary>
