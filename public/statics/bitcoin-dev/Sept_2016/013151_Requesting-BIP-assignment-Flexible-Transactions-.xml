    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom responded to Peter Todd's comment about CSV (Check Sequence Verify) using per-input sequence numbers with a comparison to HTML tags. Todd had pointed out that CSV only has a per-tx equivalent, whereas Tom argued that Todd was misunderstanding tagged systems at a basic level. However, Christian chimed in and questioned whether the comparison to XML and HTML holds up, given that the lack of closing tags makes the meaning of individual tokens ambiguous. Christian added that the use of segments in CSV gives at most two levels of nesting, which could result in ambiguities about whether a tag refers to a single input or the transaction as a whole.</summary>
