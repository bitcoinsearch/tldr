    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on September 26th 2016, Peter Todd made a comment about the Open Platform License (OPL) being more restrictive than the Bitcoin Core license. He expressed concern that this would make it difficult to ship documentation with code. However, he noted that documentation and code can have different licenses, and shipping documentation under a separate license is common practice. Peter also mentioned that his suggestion was made in response to Luke's BIP2 revival proposal, which offered a more formal solution. He suggested that Luke's proposal be considered instead. Lastly, Peter mentioned that he had dual-licensed his BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) in preparation for its acceptance. It is now available under both the original license and a Creative Commons license.</summary>
