    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on September 10, 2016, Johnson Lau suggested publishing the private key a few months after the final alert. Andrew C questioned why not just publish the key a few days after the alert instead. The reason for waiting, according to Lau, is that if someone was offline during the final alert, they may see a scam alert instead and miss the legitimate one.</summary>
