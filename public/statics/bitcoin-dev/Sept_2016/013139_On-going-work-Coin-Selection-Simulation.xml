    <summary>Murch, a researcher, has compiled his Master's thesis about Coin Selection and his presentation proposal to Scaling Bitcoin has been accepted. In his thesis, he analyzed the Coin Selection problem, created a framework to simulate wallet behavior on basis of a sequence of payments, and re-implemented multiple coin selection strategies of prominent Bitcoin wallets such as Bitcoin Core, Mycelium, Breadwallet, and Android Wallet for Bitcoin. The PDF contains a two-page description of his ongoing work, including preliminary simulation results, and three figures showing the simulated wallets' UTXO compositions at the end of the simulation. Murch has invited feedback and offers to provide further information upon request. Additionally, he requests any other sequence of incoming and outgoing payment amounts that he could run his simulation on.</summary>
