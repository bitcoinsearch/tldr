    <summary>On September 1st, 2016 at 9:40 PM, Johnson Lau proposed the deployment of a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) using "version bits" BIP9. The proposed BIP would be named "segwit" and use bit 1 with the same parameters as BIP141 and BIP143. However, a question was raised about why this fix should be bundled together with segwit and whether miners should have the opportunity to vote on them independently. It is noted that this fix has value outside of segwit.</summary>
