    <title>New BIP: Dealing with OP_IF and OP_NOTIF malleability in P2WSH</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin script validity rules are proposed to change in order to make transaction malleability related to OP_IF and OP_NOTIF impossible in pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) scripts. This would result in the argument for OP_IF and OP_NOTIF being exactly an empty vector or 0x01, or the script evaluation fails immediately. The policy has received a few concept ACKs. A BIP is prepared to deal with OP_IF and OP_NOTIF malleability in P2WSH. To ensure OP_IF and OP_NOTIF transactions created before the introduction of this BIP will still be accepted by the network, the new rules are not applied to non-segregated witness scripts. The proposed changes affect the combination of "OP_SIZE OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_IF". With this policy/softfork, you need to use "OP_SIZE OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF", or reconstruct your scripts. This is a softfork on top of BIP141. It is enforced as a relay policy by the reference client since the first release of BIP141. Users must not create P2WSH scripts that are incompatible with this BIP to avoid risks of fund loss.</summary>
