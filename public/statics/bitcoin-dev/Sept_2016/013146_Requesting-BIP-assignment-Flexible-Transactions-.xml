    <summary>In this context, the writer is responding to someone named Tom who has misunderstood tagged systems at a basic level. They compare Tom's misunderstanding to thinking that HTML can only use a bold tag once in a document. The writer then poses a question regarding the "additional" segment and whether it contains the same amount of nSequence-equivalent tokens as the number of inputs in the "inputs" segment. They also ask what would happen if someone only wants to add a per-input-token in the additional segment for a certain input, assuming it is the last one. The writer acknowledges that the fundamental difference between tagged systems like Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and HTML is the possible nesting. They suggest that this should be specified in the BIP.</summary>
