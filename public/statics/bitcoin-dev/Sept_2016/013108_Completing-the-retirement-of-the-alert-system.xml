    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, suggests that it is important to implement an update to the Bitcoin Core software soon due to the decreasing reliability of alert propagation on the P2P network. It would only require a few lines of code to ensure that the final alert is sent to peers using old protocol versions. This implementation could be left in the codebase for a few years or until other changes make those old versions incompatible for other reasons.</summary>
