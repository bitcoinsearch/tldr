    <summary>A new opcode(OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT) has been proposed for the Bitcoin scripting system to address the reissuing of bitcoin transactions when the coins they spend have been double-spent. However, it has been pointed out that this proposal could destroy the property of Bitcoin that during an "innocent" re-org, all affected transactions can always eventually get replayed, so long as the re-org depth is less than 100. The concern was raised by Russell O'Connor on Fri, Sep 23, 2016, in response to Luke Dashjr's proposal. While Dashjr suggests that a specified height more recent than 100 blocks deep causes the script to fail, which would increase delays in recovering the double-spend situation, it is unclear if this solution will be better or otherwise more acceptable.</summary>
