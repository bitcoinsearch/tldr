    <summary>The proposed BIP focuses on preventing excessive SignatureHash operation in the Bitcoin network. This is because the amount of data hashing in SignatureHash is proportional to the size of the transaction, leading to an O(n^2) growth as the number of sigops in a transaction increases. Although BIP143 introduced a new SignatureHash algorithm in segregated witness transactions, it was not able to fix pre-segregated witness transactions.To address this issue, the proposed BIP defines a new type of block-level resources limit with several optional script restrictions. The Transaction hashable size (TxHashableSize) is defined as the size of a transaction serialized without witness data (BIP144) and has scriptSig in all inputs replaced by a zero-size script. The SignatureHash equivalent operation (SigHashOp) is defined as the maximum possible number of times that a sigop would perform SignatureHash at the TxHashableSize. There are two ways to estimate the SigHashOp: Loose estimation and Tight estimation. These measures aim to prevent excessive SignatureHash operation and ensure the proper functioning of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
