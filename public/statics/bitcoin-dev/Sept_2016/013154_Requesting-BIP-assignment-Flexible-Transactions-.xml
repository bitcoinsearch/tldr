    <summary>Christian Decker, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, disagrees with the idea that creating a new document and re-signing it constitutes transaction malleability. He argues that this is simply re-creating and something that the coin owner has every right to do. In response to this, Luke points out that malleability refers to the possibility of modifying a transaction after the fact. Christian argues that he is not a fan of redefining dictionary words and prefers to stick to the universally accepted definition.The conversation shifts to discussing dependencies in current transactions and the possibility of adding new fields that non-upgraded nodes may not recognize. It is suggested that if new fields are added and a non-upgraded node rejects transactions containing them, there may be a hard-fork. To address this issue, it is proposed that transactions with unknown fields should not be rejected if they are included in a block. A link to further discussion on future extensibility can be found in the provided GitHub repository.</summary>
