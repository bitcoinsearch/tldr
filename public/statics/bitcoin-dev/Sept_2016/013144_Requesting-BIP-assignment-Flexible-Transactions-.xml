    <summary>In a conversation on Thursday, September 22nd, 2016 at 14:27:29 CEST, Peter Todd made a statement about CSV's use of per-input sequence numbers and how they differ from per-tx equivalents. Another participant in the conversation disagreed with Peter's understanding of tagged systems, stating that it is similar to believing HTML can only use a bold tag once in a document. The comment was deemed embarrassing by Peter and he suggested that the person should read more before commenting further.</summary>
