    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Andreas Schildbach suggested that the bitcoin protocol should use Protocol Buffers (protobuf). However, another user disagreed and recommended using Compact Message Format (CMF) instead. CMF is already used in Bitcoin Classic transactions and offers several advantages over protobuf. For example, it reuses var-int parsing and has additional values addition. Additionally, manually parsing a message can better report errors and detect wrong usages than auto-generated code. Finally, CMF is more compact for its messages and does not require as much tool support as protobuf. Schildbach has experience with protobuf but believes that CMF, with some support classes, could do the job better.</summary>
