    <summary>Luke-jr has made updates to BIP 2 and reworked it as a replacement for BIP 1. In addition, OPL will no longer be an acceptable license, non-image auxiliary files are permitted in the bip-XXXX subdirectory, email addresses are now required for authors, and Markdown format is not permitted for BIPs. The Post-History header may be provided as a link instead of a simple date and the Resolution header has been dropped. Furthermore, implementation is now required before BIPs can proceed to Proposed Status and BIP Comments are newly introduced. Lastly, the License preamble headers have been added. Luke-jr requests that people review the updated BIP 2 with the hopes of getting it done by Christmas.</summary>
