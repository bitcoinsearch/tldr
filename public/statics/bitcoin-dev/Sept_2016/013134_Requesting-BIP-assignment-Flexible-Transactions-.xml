    <summary>A BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) has been submitted by Tom via bitcoin-dev, however it appears to lack concrete specifications for review and implementation. The document fails to specify key details such as the serialization of "integer", how optional fields are signaled, and the cardinality of inputs and outputs. Additionally, there is no mention of length encoding for variable length elements ('bytearray'). Without this information, the proposal cannot be realistically reviewed. Furthermore, the motivation behind the proposal is unclear as it appears to remove flexibility from the existing system rather than add it. The proposed "schema" is hardcoded and never communicated, and if the goal is simply to have a more compact on the wire representation, this could be achieved without changing the serialization used for hashing or costing.</summary>
