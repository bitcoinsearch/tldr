    <title>BIP draft: OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT</title>

    <summary>The author of this post expresses concern over a proposed operation in the Bitcoin scripting system. The current system allows for all affected transactions to eventually be replayed during an "innocent" re-org, as long as the re-org depth is less than 100. However, the proposed operation described in BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) would introduce a new opcode called OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT, which could potentially destroy this property. The BIP aims to address the issue of re-issuing bitcoin transactions when the coins they spend have been conflicted or double-spent. The author questions whether this approach is a good idea and seeks feedback from the community.</summary>
