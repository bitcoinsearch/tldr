    <summary>Luke Dashjr proposed a new opcode (OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT) for Bitcoin scripting system to address reissuing bitcoin transactions when the coins they spend have been conflicted/double-spent. The BIP, however, is a bit confusing as it refers to spending outputs with a small number of confirmations, instead of spending unconfirmed outputs which OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT cannot protect. If multi-block reorgs were a regular occurrence in the ecosystem, Bitcoin would be in trouble, but since they are rare, advising wallet authors to refuse transactions for some time after such a reorg may be a better solution. Multi-block reorgs are an indication that something is wrong with the network and it would be safer to stop using Bitcoin until things settle down.</summary>
