    <summary>The discussion is about timestamps in OpenTimestamps. One person suggests considering earlier blocks, while another argues that timestamps are simply proofs of existence prior to a specific time and there can't be a "wrong order" in timestamp proofs. OpenTimestamps verifies plausible dates for many use cases, such as timestamped git commits. The example provided includes the date on the git commit, another date for the PGP signature, and a third date for the Bitcoin timestamp. Peter Todd's contact information is provided at the end of the email.</summary>
