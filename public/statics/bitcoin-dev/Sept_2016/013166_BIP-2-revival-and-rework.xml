    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, announced that the Open Publication License (OPL) will no longer be an acceptable license for BIPs. He stated that many in the community feel that prohibiting publication is unacceptable and suggested replacing OPL with one or two Creative Commons licenses. The Open Publication License was created by the Open Content Project in 1999 as a public copyright license for documents, but it was superseded by Creative Commons licenses in 2003/2007. Dashjr recommended using the "Share alike" requirement and making "Attribution" optional. He suggested offering users the choice between CCO and BY-SA licenses, next to public domain.</summary>
