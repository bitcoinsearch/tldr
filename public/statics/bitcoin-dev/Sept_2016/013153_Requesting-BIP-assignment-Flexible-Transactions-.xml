    <summary>A discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list addresses the issue of potential ambiguities in the use of segments in Bitcoin Script. The lack of closing tags in this format can lead to confusion over the meaning of individual tokens, with their relative position being used instead of nesting to indicate relationships between them. However, ordering is a requirement for most tagged formats and is specified in the case of any possible confusion. Despite this, Christian Decker raises concerns about the possibility of ambiguity and urges the provision of examples if there are indeed missing requirements in the spec.</summary>
