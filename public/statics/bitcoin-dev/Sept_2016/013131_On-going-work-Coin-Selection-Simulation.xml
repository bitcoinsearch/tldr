    <summary>The author of the email is compiling a Master's thesis about the Coin Selection problem and his presentation proposal to Scaling Bitcoin has been accepted. He has analyzed the Coin Selection problem, created a framework to simulate wallet behavior on the basis of a sequence of payments, and has re-implemented multiple coin selection strategies of prominent Bitcoin wallets such as Bitcoin Core, Mycelium, Breadwallet, and Android Wallet for Bitcoin. The author has shared a two-page description of his ongoing work in a PDF which contains preliminary simulation results and three figures showing the simulated wallets' UTXO compositions at the end of the simulation. The author invites feedback and requests anyone with another sequence of incoming and outgoing payment amounts to run his simulation on, to share it.</summary>
