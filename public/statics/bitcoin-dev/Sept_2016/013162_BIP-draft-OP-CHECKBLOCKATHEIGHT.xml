    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a developer of Bitcoin, expressed his concerns about a script feature that allows for back referencing transactions. The feature has the potential to cause a fungibility hit, meaning that every coin is no longer equal due to the risk of invalidation caused by a reorganization of the blockchain. Dashjr recommended preventing overuse and enforcing a maximum survivable reorg to ensure that users could handle exposed coins sensibly. Dashjr also suggested not allowing overly short back references, as it would be easier to handle in the mempool and avoid the issue of persistent chain forks. While the feature may help prevent double-spending, its potential risks require consideration.</summary>
