    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer email thread, Peter Todd raised concerns about the Open Patent License (OPL) and its restrictions. Tom responded saying that different licenses for documentation and code are common and there's no need to worry about being unable to ship documentation with code. However, Peter clarified that the issue lies in the OPL being significantly more restrictive than the Bitcoin Core license, not just that the licenses are different. The conversation also touched on the importance of dual-licensing documentation with a code-oriented license if it includes example code. Lastly, Tom suggested Luke's BIP2 revival as a formal solution and announced his own BIP is now dual-licensed under the Creative Commons license. Peter thanked him and said that CC-BY-SA is a good license for that purpose.</summary>
