    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Adiabat raised concern that the proposed serialization format for OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (OP_CLTV) and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (OP_CSV), known as "BIP 118", may not be compatible with Lightning Network as it relies on the sequence field of the txin. Tom, the author of the proposal, responded saying that LockByBlock and LockByTime are still to-dos because he did not have time to study BIP68 encoding in-depth. He explained that these tags will set the sequence integer in txin while loading and reverse while saving. The lack of sequence number in the saved format won't affect the in-memory format of the transaction; thus, there is no change in how CSV will work before and after on any level other than serialisation. Peter Todd also commented that CSV uses per-input sequence numbers, and the new format only has a per-tx equivalent.</summary>
