    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Tom discusses the serialization order of tokens in transactions. He notes that if the order is not fixed, it could allow for multiple interpretations of the data which would not be allowed. However, if the order is fixed, the tokens themselves become redundant when required and a flag would be appropriate to mark whether or not optional data has been omitted. Additionally, if compatibility with existing software is going to be broken, using a format that extends the merkle tree down into transaction inputs and outputs may make sense.</summary>
