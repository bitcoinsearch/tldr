    <summary>A proposal has been made to retire a key that is shared by many people, and the plan for executing this involves sending a message with a maximum sequence number minus 1 to notify all nodes of the retirement date. This allows people with systems relying on the key to upgrade or ignore the revocation message. The max - 1 sequence means that no message except the max sequence revocation message can override it. The revocation message will then be sent at the pre-announced time if no one has done so before. After a few months, the private key will be published. The alert system has a maximum sequence alert which cannot be overridden and displays only a static key compromise text message while blocking all other alerts. There may be some small one-time disruption of services due to a few production systems automatically shutting down when there is an alert, but none worse than if an alert were sent to advise about a new system upgrade. The disclosure of the private key in public will eliminate any further potential reputation attacks and diminish the risk of misunderstanding the key as some special trusted source of authority.</summary>
