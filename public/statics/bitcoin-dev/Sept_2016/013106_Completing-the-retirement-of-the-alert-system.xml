    <summary>The alert system in Bitcoin Core has been completely removed after being disabled for some time. Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin developer, stated that the system caused problems with scalability and governance, as well as being unaccountable. Additionally, there was a risk of misuse due to a lack of knowledge about the origin of messages sent through the system. Furthermore, the key for the alert system was potentially compromised, so Maxwell is planning to deactivate it entirely. He has reached out to all software containing this key, including altcoins, asking them to remove it. In the near future, he plans to send an alert message triggering a maximum sequence alert, which cannot be overridden and will display only a static key compromise text message while blocking all other alerts. While this may cause some small disruptions to production systems that automatically shut down when there is an alert, it is not worse than if an alert were sent to advise about a new system upgrade. Finally, Maxwell plans to disclose the private key in public at some point in the future, eliminating any further potential of reputation attacks and diminishing the risk of misunderstanding the key as some special trusted source of authority.</summary>
