    <summary>A concern was raised in a bitcoin-dev forum post on Wednesday 21st September 2016 regarding the compatibility of Flexible Transactions with Lightning Network. The issue is that non-cooperative channel close transactions in Lightning use OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which references the sequence field of the txin; if the txin doesn't have a sequence number, OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY cannot work. LockByBlock and LockByTime were still to be implemented at the time of writing, as there wasn't time to assess how BIP68 does the encoding. However, it's intended that these tags will set the sequence integer in the txin while loading. There will be no change in how CSV will operate before and after on any level other than serialization. Flexiible Transactions is meant to support the Lightning Network, so any issues should be solved before shipping.</summary>
