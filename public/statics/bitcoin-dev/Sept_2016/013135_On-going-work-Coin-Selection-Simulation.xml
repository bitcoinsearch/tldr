    <summary>When building a coin selection algorithm, there are three goals to consider: minimizing cost, maximizing privacy, and minimizing UTXO footprint. However, it is difficult to achieve all three goals simultaneously. A coin selection algorithm that minimizes cost may not necessarily minimize UTXO footprint, and one that maximizes privacy will do so at the expense of UTXO footprint and fees. In order to completely minimize UTXO footprint, a bit of cost and a lot of privacy will be sacrificed.On 9/21/16, Andreas Schildbach corrected the name of the Android wallet for Bitcoin, stating it should be called "Bitcoin Wallet" or "Bitcoin Wallet for Android." This was communicated through the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
