    <summary>In a message thread, Tadge raises concerns about the compatibility of Lightning with a proposed new format. Specifically, Tadge notes that non-cooperative channel close transactions in Lightning use OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which references the sequence field of the txin. If the txin does not have a sequence number, OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY cannot work. Additionally, Tadge mentions that LockByBlock and LockByTime are not described and there does not seem to be code for them in the PR (186). Tadge requests clarification on whether there is a way to make OP_CLTV and OP_CSV work with this new format.</summary>
