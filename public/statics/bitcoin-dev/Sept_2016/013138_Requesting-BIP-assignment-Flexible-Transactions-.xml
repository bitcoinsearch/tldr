    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Gregory Maxwell reviewed a proposal called FT spec. He found that the document wasn't concretely specific enough to review or implement from it since it didn't specify how certain elements like "integer" are serialized nor how the presence of optional fields is signaled, nor the cardinality of inputs or outputs. Additionally, no mention was made of the encoding length for clearly variable length elements such as "bytearray". Fortunately, the external specification (CMF) was linked at the bottom. Maxwell also questioned the motivation of the scheme which claimed to be flexible but appeared to remove flexibility from the existing system. However, the current format is also hardcoded and never communicated. The proposal aimed to improve on that by being more flexible.</summary>
