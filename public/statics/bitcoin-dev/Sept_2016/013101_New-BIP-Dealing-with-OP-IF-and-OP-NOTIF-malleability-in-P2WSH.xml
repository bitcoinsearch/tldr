    <summary>Suppose we have a marginal fee rate of 50 satoshis per byte. Reducing the size of the witness data by 1 byte is equivalent to a replace by fee that increases the fee by 50 satoshis. In both cases, miners get an extra potential of 50 satoshis in revenue. Replacing witness data with smaller witness data can pay for its own relay cost as much as RBF can, simply by requiring that the smaller witness be small enough to cover the same RBF threshold. BIP125 and mempool eviction both require the replacing transaction to have a higher fee, to compensate for the cost of relaying the replaced transaction(s).</summary>
