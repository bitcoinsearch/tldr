    <summary>The developers of bitcoin-s have announced the launch of v0.3.0, which is a set of loosely coupled cryptocurrency libraries for the JVM. The aim of this project is to provide scalable and industry-standard tools that can be used by software engineers, security engineers, devops engineers, and accountants, making their lives easier. These libraries can be used together or independently. However, Bitcoin-s is not intended to be a full node implementation. The developers focus on iterating development to reach a set of stable APIs that only change when the underlying bitcoin protocol changes. To test basic data structures in bitcoin-s like private keys, psbts, and block filters, an interactive code editor has been made available. Additionally, the website offers examples of how the neutrino node, wallet, bitcoind rpc client, and secp256k1jni (bindings for libsecp256k1) work. Those interested in further details about v0.3.0 can check out the release notes on the project's GitHub page.</summary>
