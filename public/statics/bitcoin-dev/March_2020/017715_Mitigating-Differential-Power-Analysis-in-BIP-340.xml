    <summary>In this email exchange between Pieter Wuille and LL, they discuss the issue of using secret keys for hashing in Bitcoin. Pieter suggests using XOR instead of hashing secret keys to prevent potential leakage of information through interactions between bits inside the hash operation that all come from the key itself. They also discuss the potential for DPA attacks on BIP32 child index derivation, which may be far-fetched due to the need for physical access to the device and accurate measurement of power consumption. The discussion concludes with the suggestion to revise advice on adding randomness unless an anti-covert channel scheme is used and the acknowledgement that there may be more than one way to approach this issue.</summary>
