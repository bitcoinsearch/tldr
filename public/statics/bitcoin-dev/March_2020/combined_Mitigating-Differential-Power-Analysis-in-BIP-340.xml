    <summary>The post discusses a new PR to change BIP-340, which aims to make it more secure against "differential power analysis" (DPA) attacks by adding random auxiliary data into the nonce derivation function. However, the author questions the claim that this new approach is more secure than the simpler and more efficient method currently being used. The post provides an explanation of DPA attacks and how they work, as well as two papers that may have been the origin of the idea for the new approach.In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Lloyd Fournier, they discuss the issue of using secret keys for hashing in Bitcoin. Pieter suggests using XOR instead of hashing secret keys to prevent potential leakage of information through interactions between bits inside the hash operation that all come from the key itself. They also discuss the potential for DPA attacks on BIP32 child index derivation, which may be far-fetched due to the need for physical access to the device and accurate measurement of power consumption. The discussion concludes with the suggestion to revise advice on adding randomness unless an anti-covert channel scheme is used and the acknowledgement that there may be more than one way to approach this issue.The original nonce derivation in BIP-340 was vulnerable to DPA attacks because the SHA256 compression function run on (sec_key || message) may leak information about sec_key. The new approach adds secret randomness before each sensitive operation and then strips off the secret randomness afterwards to fix this problem. However, the author argues that this new approach does not provide any extra protection over the current method. The post concludes that the current method is preferable because it is simpler and more efficient, and no less secure against DPA attacks. In summary, the post and email exchange provide insight into the debate surrounding the security of the new PR to change BIP-340, with arguments made both for and against the inclusion of random auxiliary data in the nonce derivation function. The post also provides links to relevant papers and sources for further reading.</summary>
