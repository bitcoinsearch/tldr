    <summary>The email exchange is about the proposal of Ethan to turn any child derived xprv key into a new set valid seed words that could be used by a wallet or other devices that don't understand xprv and will only allow import of new seeds words. Christopher agrees with the problem statement, but not with the proposed solution. Instead, he suggests finding standards ways to protect the entropy seed that can be then be used to create other hierarchies of keys using airgap solutions. The advantage of an entropy seed storage centered technique is that it can be converted into either BIP39 words or any number of SLIP-39 shards and back. Blockchain Commons is working on standards for airgap solutions for storing and signing from offline keys. They have published procedures for cold storage in their free book at http://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101 and in github at https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/smartcustodybook. They are currently seeking suggestions from other wallet vendors (in particular lightning and non-bitcoin secure services) on requirements.</summary>
