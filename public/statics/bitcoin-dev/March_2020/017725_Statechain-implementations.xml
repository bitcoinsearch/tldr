    <summary>In this email conversation, Ruben Somsen and Christian Decker discuss potential modifications to statechains, a concept for off-chain Bitcoin transfer. The first modification involves using a kickoff transaction with a secondary output that can be spent by anyone to fee bump the transaction with Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). The second modification involves using 2P ECDSA to redistribute keys without requiring an on-chain move to be committed. Greg Sanders raises concerns about changing pubkeys at each update. Christian suggests adopting the late fee binding in eltoo to remove the need to guess feerate days or months in advance. They also express excitement about seeing statechains become a reality.</summary>
