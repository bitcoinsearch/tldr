    <summary>The discussion on the list revolves around a scenario where there are only a few days left before a difficulty adjustment, but the mining power is dropping off at a rate that suggests this timeline might be extended to weeks, months, or even longer. The author seeks ideas on how to handle this situation to avoid such a delay. There are concerns about the impact on the network and the potential implications of such a delay. The author seems confident that the community will not let this happen and is seeking input from others on potential solutions.</summary>
