    <summary>Peter D. Gray, the founder of Coinkite, expressed his approval and recognition of a proposal titled "Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains," presented by Ethan Kosakovsky for discussion and peer review. The proposal aims to solve the issue of having too many seeds and backups, which can result from various reasons mentioned in the proposal. It suggests deriving entropy from a hierarchical deterministic (HD) keychain path to deterministically create initial entropy for generating keychain mnemonics and seeds. The proposal is a Standards Track type with a BSD-2-Clause and OPL license and was created on March 20, 2020.</summary>
