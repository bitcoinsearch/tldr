    <summary>A recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list has brought up concerns about the security of anti-nonce covert channel protocols. These protocols involve a host mixing in its own random nonce during the signing process to make it deterministic and verifiable. However, if there is no persistence of the nonce contributions provided by the host, it becomes impossible to check how the nonce was computed for past signatures. The author of the post is unsure whether this property is desirable in practice and is seeking other opinions.For further reading on the topic, two links have been provided. It is important to consider the potential security vulnerabilities of these protocols and explore ways to mitigate them. The use of cryptography in the Bitcoin network requires constant vigilance and improvement to ensure its continued security.</summary>
