    <summary>In an email thread, Tim is unable to understand Dustin's message about mitigating leak vectors. Tim has asked for clarification on the vectors being mitigated, and what Dustin is trying to achieve. He also asked for further explanation on the steps mentioned in Dustin's message. Tim posed questions about the possibility of both software and hardware being compromised, and where the external software would be run. Additionally, he asked whether unhardened derivation was being used and what a "k commitment" meant.</summary>
