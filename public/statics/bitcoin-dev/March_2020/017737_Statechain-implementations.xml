    <summary>The article discusses the mechanism to replace an old first stage transaction with a new one that has 0 relative locktime. If the replacement transaction redirects funds to a logically continuous, on-chain new state chain, then the new transaction will have precedence because of its smaller relative lock time. The replacement process involves asking the state chain to create an alternative, 0-relative-locktime, re-funding tx, which creates a new mechanism for funding. The re-funding tx has higher priority and is the same mechanism as Decker-Wattenhofer's. It eliminates the need for a cooperative peg-out that simultaneously pegs back in, creating a brand new UTXO with no history.</summary>
