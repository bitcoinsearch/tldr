    <summary>On March 20th, 2020, Ethan Kosakovsky presented a proposal for discussion and peer review to the bitcoin-dev community. However, a member of the community, Pavol Rusnak, expressed confusion after reading the proposal twice and not being able to understand what kind of problem was being addressed. Rusnak suggested that the abstract should make the problem clear and that it is bad if it does not. Rusnak identifies as the CTO of SatoshiLabs.</summary>
