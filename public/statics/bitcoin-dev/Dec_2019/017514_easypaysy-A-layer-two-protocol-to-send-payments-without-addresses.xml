    <summary>The conversation between Jose and ZmnSCPXj discusses the issue of service providers retaining control over user accounts, which creates a problem for updating accounts. Mirror servers cannot solve this issue. ZmnSCPXj suggests using MAST smart contracts to resolve the problem, but Jose points out that Sybils can still carry out targeted attacks. Instead, an n-of-n approach with pre-signed transactions is recommended. ZmnSCPXj also proposes the possibility of sub-accounts detaching from the master account in the event of an uncooperative service provider or if a user chooses to fly solo. A graftroot transform can be done to enable this, but it requires offchain data movement and its own overlay network. To prevent attacks, there should be a precommitted series of R values that ensures the signer can only use an R once.Jose notes that making the protocol easy to implement for SPV wallets is essential for wallet adoption. A separate transport layer does not align with this goal. In future iterations of the protocol, ZmnSCPXj's suggestion may become more applicable. Regarding the output index in the account ID, Jose clarifies that the easypaysy identifier refers to the first transaction that spends the funding TXO, not necessarily a one-input two-output transaction.</summary>
