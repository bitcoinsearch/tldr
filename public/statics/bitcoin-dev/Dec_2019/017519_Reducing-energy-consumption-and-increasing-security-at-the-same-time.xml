    <summary>Cheng Wang, a researcher, has proposed a new algorithm called PoLW to reduce energy consumption in proof-of-work (PoW) while maintaining security. The idea is to shift part of the external cost of mining in the physical world (mainly energy consumption) to the internal cost of the network. In PoLW, miners can give up part of the coinbase reward to get weight (&gt;1) for the block hash they produce. The total cost of generating a new block would still be equal to the maximal coinbase reward in equilibrium. Cheng analyzed two algorithms in the paper: linear PoLW and exponential PoLW. Linear PoLW could reduce energy consumption by a factor close to 1/2 in equilibrium, while exponential PoLW could reduce energy consumption by an arbitrary factor in equilibrium. However, there are concerns about potential issues with the proposal. One concern is that if a miner keeps mining easy blocks, they may launch 51% attacks using PoLW, where a miner can sacrifice the coinbase reward as much as possible to mine blocks faster. To fix this, a way to choose the chain with most work rather than most blocks could be implemented. Another potential issue is that if the coinbase tx is no longer the majority of mining reward, but the fx fee, it could limit the number of transactions for easy blocks. For example, if a miner chooses to mine blocks N times easier, they can only include transactions whose total size is less than or equal to some constant multiple of N. Cheng's work is based on solid math calculation and he is looking forward to feedback and discussions. His paper is available at https://github.com/alephium/research/raw/master/polw.pdf and was inspired by the recent paper of Itay, Alexander, and Ittay. If PoW transitions to PoLW, the external costs of mining would decrease and the internal costs will increase. However, the decrease in external costs would be less than the increase in internal costs since mining is profitable. The total cost of block generation would get higher, therefore, the security will increase. The principle of applying PoLW is to keep the absolute external cost increasing all the time, but the percentage of external cost in the total cost gets lower eventually.</summary>
