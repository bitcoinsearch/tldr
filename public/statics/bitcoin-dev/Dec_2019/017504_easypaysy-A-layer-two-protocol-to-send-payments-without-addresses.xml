    <summary>Jose Femenias has released an early preview of easypaysy, a layer-two protocol for Bitcoin that allows the creation of non-custodial accounts directly on the blockchain. The protocol enables bitcoin addresses to disappear from the user experience and facilitates payments to permanent account IDs. Account IDs are assigned by the mining process and come in several flavors like Canonical ID, Mnemonic ID, and Domain ID. Payments can be both interactive and non-interactive and are non-repudiable, and it is possible to implement pull-payments as well as chargebacks. Interested parties can access the white paper and an introductory video at https://www.easypaysy.org/ or get in touch with Jose Femenias via email at jose.femenias@gmail.com or using the project's email at easypaysy@gmail.com.</summary>
