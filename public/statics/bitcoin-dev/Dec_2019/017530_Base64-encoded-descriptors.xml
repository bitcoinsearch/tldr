    <summary>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list includes the use of descriptors as a standard for master public keys, which users can't easily copy and paste due to parentheses and commas. One solution suggested is to base64 encode the descriptors, allowing for easy text blocks without extra details for users. However, complications may arise with the descriptor checksum. To address this issue, it is proposed to attach the checksum to the end of the base64 text. Chris Belcher notes that these ideas were discussed with achow101. The use of Base64 encoding is not optimal for URL/QR code friendly purposes, and instead, alternatives like Base58 or Bech32 could be used.</summary>
