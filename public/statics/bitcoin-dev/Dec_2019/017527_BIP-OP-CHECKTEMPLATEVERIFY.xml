    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin Core contributor, has updated the main branch (ctv) to match ctv-v2 and pushed branches ctv-v1 which points at the prior versions. He also acknowledged Dmitry Petukhov for helping him fix several typos and errors. In addition, Jeremy shared some "non-technical" tax analysis covering the use of OP_CTV for batched payments, which can be found on https://utxos.org/analysis/taxes/. Moreover, the website https://utxos.org/ is generally a repository of information &amp; material on OP_CTV, its design, applications, and analysis. Contributors interested in adding content are requested to contact Jeremy. Jeremy also prepared a draft of the changes noted above, but has not yet updated the main branches for the BIP to leave time for further feedback. Links to the BIP and implementation can be found on his Github page.</summary>
