    <summary>The CashFusion research is a privacy-focused approach that allows players to bring many inputs and have multiple outputs while obfuscating transactions. The study claims that with 10^20 possibilities, there is essentially no linkage, as it extends the obfuscation even further. The example given in the study indicates that there are a considerable number of partitions, and even with a fast algorithm that could find matching partitions, around 10^20 possible valid configurations would be produced. This scheme went under the radar of many people as it came out of the Bitcoin Cash camp. The Knapsack paper in 2017 also had similar ideas. The GitHub link provided explains how cash fusion avoids amount linkages through combinatorics.</summary>
