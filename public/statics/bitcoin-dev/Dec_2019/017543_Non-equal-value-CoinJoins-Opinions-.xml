    <summary>In an email exchange on December 29, 2019, Yuval Kogman made a mistake in his calculation regarding the number of inputs and indistinguishable outputs. He wrote that n equals the sum of these two numbers, but he later corrected himself, stating that n is actually the smaller of the two. Although this correction did not affect his overall arguments, it was important to clarify the mistake.</summary>
