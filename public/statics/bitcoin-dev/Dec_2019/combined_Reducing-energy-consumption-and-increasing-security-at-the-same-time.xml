    <summary>Cheng Wang, the founder of Alephium, has proposed a new algorithm called PoLW to reduce energy consumption in Proof of Work (PoW) without sacrificing security. PoLW shifts some of the external costs of mining (primarily energy consumption) to the internal cost of the network by allowing miners to give up part of their coinbase rewards to get weight for the block hash they produce. Linear PoLW could reduce energy consumption by almost half in equilibrium, while exponential PoLW could reduce energy consumption by an arbitrary factor in equilibrium. Cheng addressed concerns raised by Runchao Han regarding double spending and transaction fees by setting a dynamic upper bound related to the actual mining difficulty of the recent mining epoch and eliminating the halving mechanism in PoLW. Though the external costs of existing systems cannot be reduced immediately, applying PoLW will keep the absolute external cost increasing all the time while lowering the percentage of external cost in the total cost eventually. The transition from PoW to PoLW would decrease the external costs of mining while increasing the internal costs, resulting in increased security. Cheng's work is based on solid math calculation and he is looking forward to feedback and discussions. His paper is available at https://github.com/alephium/research/raw/master/polw.pdf and it was inspired by a recent paper by Itay, Alexander, and Ittay.</summary>
