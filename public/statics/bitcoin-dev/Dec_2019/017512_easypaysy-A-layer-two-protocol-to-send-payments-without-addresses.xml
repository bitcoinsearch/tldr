    <summary>The Easypaysy white paper is not a final set of specifications, but a draft of ideas that can drive a working set of specifications, and qualified input is much welcome. Master accounts are included in the white paper as a feature for a future release; however, this feature is not well-defined yet. The service provider has no control over the funds, nor can he block payments, etc. The Merkle root protects against any attempt of tampering with the account data. The white paper suggests the creation of mirror servers to mitigate the risk of the authoritative server becoming unavailable. Easypaysy accounts don't need two transactions, they need funding plus a transaction for the account information itself. The UTXO can be one of many in the same transaction, so multiple accounts can be funded with a single transaction. There is really no need to specify an additional output. If the funding transaction can have many UTXOs that are individually funding TXOs of multiple Easypaysy accounts, then you need to refer to which TXO of that funding transaction is what you are using.The white paper barely touches on the implications for the Lightning Network, other than citing the possibility of receiving an LN invoice within the Payment reply document. Easypaysy is protocol-agnostic for now, so Tor is definitely a possibility. Finally, it is suggested that the contact-information protocols supported should probably be Tor hidden services instead of https.</summary>
