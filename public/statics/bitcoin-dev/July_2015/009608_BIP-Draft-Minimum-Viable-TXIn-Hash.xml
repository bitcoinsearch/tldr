    <summary>A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been shared to decrease the amount of bytes needed per transaction. The BIP is still in its early stages as there are many design options available for this type of improvement. However, it can be implemented through a soft fork. The proposed improvements show a reduction of around 12% for standard "one in two out" transactions and even more with additional input hashes. The full draft can be viewed on GitHub at the provided link.</summary>
