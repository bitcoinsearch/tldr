    <summary>On July 24, 2015, Mike Hearn made a statement noting that large companies with $30 million of funding do not run a single Bitcoin Core node, which is not related to block sizes but rather that Core does not provide the services that businesses want. He believes that the idea that the decrease in node count is due to block sizes is unfounded conjecture. People who used to run full nodes have stopped doing so, and to mitigate this, their chances of getting something out of it must be greater. Hearn suggests the possibility of earning a piece of the fee by propagating a valid transaction.</summary>
