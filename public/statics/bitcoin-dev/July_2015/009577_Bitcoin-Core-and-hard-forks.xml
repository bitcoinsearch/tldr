    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Gavin Andresen responds to Jorge Tim√≥n's concern that Bitcoin XT supporters will continue to cause conflict even if they get what they want. Gavin responds by saying "Let's plan for success!" He believes that rather than focusing on limiting the capacity of the primary time-stamping machine, we should focus on scaling the supporting information propagation system appropriately. Gavin is tired of all the negativity surrounding the debate and plans to ignore it for a while in order to work with people who have a 'let's get it done' attitude and focus on what it will take to scale up.</summary>
