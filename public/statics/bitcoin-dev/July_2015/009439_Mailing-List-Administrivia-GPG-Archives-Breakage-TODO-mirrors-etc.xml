    <summary>Warren Togami Jr. has announced that the obscure_addresses option for Mailman has been disabled as it was ineffective as a spam mitigation measure. A test message was sent to check if mailman continues to break clearsign GPG signatures for messages containing e-mail addresses. The issue still persists and has been reported on web and mbox archives. Meanwhile, an attachment named lost.c will not appear in the mbox archives, resulting in its loss to both mirrors and users who use the mbox archives as their canonical source for local seeding or MUA access.</summary>
