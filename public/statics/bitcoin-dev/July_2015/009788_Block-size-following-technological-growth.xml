    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille debated the timeframe for increasing the block size limit. Wuille had suggested a gradual increase to 2MB by 2021, but Andresen argued that this was too conservative. He proposed setting a minimum increase now, even if it is later deemed insufficient and another hard fork is required. Another issue discussed was the use of median time in determining block size limits. While it was agreed that using block.nTime would work fine for the current proposal, uniformity in decision-making for all cases was recommended and further discussion was encouraged.</summary>
