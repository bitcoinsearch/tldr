    <summary>Gavin Andresen, the former lead developer of Bitcoin, has proposed new consensus rules to mitigate potential CPU exhaustion denial-of-service attacks. The proposal would limit the maximum number of ECDSA signature verifications done per block, and limit the number of bytes hashed to compute signature hashes. Before these proposed changes can be implemented, software that assembles transactions into blocks and software that validates blocks must be updated to enforce the new consensus rules. This change is compatible with existing transaction-creation software because transactions larger than 100,000 bytes have been considered "non-standard" for years. The proposal will be deployed with BIP 100 or BIP 101.</summary>
