    <summary>Jean-Paul Kogelman, a game developer, proposes defining a minimum specification for Bitcoin Core in order to reduce the risk of breaking something due to capacity problems. The min spec could be based on entry model machines available during launch and would give users an enjoyable experience when using Bitcoin Core. This would also help measure the impact of changes to Bitcoin Core's performance. Jeremy Rubin suggests targeting the RISC-V Rocket architecture as a reference point for performance, which may be lower than desirable but would not lock people into using large-vendor chipsets with unknown or bad security properties. He also proposes that open hardware is more critical than performance metrics for the long-term health of Bitcoin, although performance remains important. Kogelman agrees that the metrics should be architecture agnostic and have conversion metrics to map it onto any specific architecture. The ability to measure the impact of a change is what's important, regardless of how the values are expressed. Additionally, he hopes that once the current requirements for Bitcoin Core are determined, they can be adjusted to include certain open hardware platforms. However, the critical wall-time requirements need to be considered first, such as block propagation times, which can be used to model bandwidth and CPU requirements. Finally, Kogelman suggests having a number of comparable concrete min-spec configurations and even more ideal would be if people in the community would have these systems up and running to do actual on-target performance benchmarks.</summary>
