    <summary>In this context, Jameson Lopp raises an interesting point about the possibility of users becoming disinterested in running nodes if the cost or contention of using the network increases to the extent that the average user is excluded from making transactions. Bryan questions this claim, positing a future where transactions are summarised with merkle hashes and asking why users would not be interested in verifying the presence of a summarising transaction in the blockchain, even if they cannot individually broadcast their own personal transaction. Bryan requests elaboration on this effect.</summary>
