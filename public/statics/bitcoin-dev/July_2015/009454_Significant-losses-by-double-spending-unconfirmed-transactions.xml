    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin developer mailing list, Matthieu Riou argued that his company, BlockCypher, was not executing a Sybil attack on the network as it is using only a small number of nodes to connect to a substantial proportion of reachable nodes. Peter Todd suggested that BlockCypher's resource use was immensely high and thus harmful to the network. Todd also questioned whether or not BlockCypher had relationships with mining pools, suggesting that the company might have contracts to have transactions mined to guarantee confirmations. Riou denied any such relationships existed. Todd accused BlockCypher of being "inherently incompatible with decentralisation," to which Riou responded that "no one should play the decentralisation police."</summary>
