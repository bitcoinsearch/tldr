    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user asked about improving the speed of bitcoin node connections for syncing purposes. Matt Corallo suggested that running servers around the world and testing based on closest-by-geoip could improve throughput due to the significant effect of latency on TCP throughput. However, Corallo also noted that nodes do not attempt to sync with close peers, which could be problematic for sybil resistance. After some experimentation, Corallo found that close proximity did result in a speedup, but it was not a particularly large difference at the time. He stated that he would continue working on the issue to see if there were further improvements to be made.</summary>
