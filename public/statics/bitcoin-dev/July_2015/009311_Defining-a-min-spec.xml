    <summary>In a thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Mistr Bigs expressed interest in knowing the system requirements for running Bitcoin Core as an end user running a full node on an aging laptop. Another user, Jean-Paul Kogelman, a game developer, proposed the idea of defining a minimum specification (min spec) for Bitcoin Core. He explained that this would help reduce the risk of breaking something due to capacity problems and make it possible to know how changes affect available budgets. While Gavin Andresen had done some calculations around this stuff, nothing had been defined as clearly as what Kogelman suggested.</summary>
