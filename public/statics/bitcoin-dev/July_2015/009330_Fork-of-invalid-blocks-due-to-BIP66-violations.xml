    <summary>In a message from 2015, Raystonn discussed the need for SPV clients to check node versions. He suggested that wallet authors should implement this feature and end-users should stay current with their chosen software. However, it is important to note that nodes can and do lie about their version, which means that SPV users must trust other people to check the rules for them. The issue of trusting nodes is particularly relevant to the BIP66 soft-fork rules, but there is no easy solution to this problem.</summary>
