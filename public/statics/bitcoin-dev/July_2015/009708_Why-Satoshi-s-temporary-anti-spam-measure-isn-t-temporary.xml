    <summary>The Bitcoin community has been discussing concerns about the lack of progress in fixing certain issues for years. One person asks what incentive highly skilled technical people have to spend their time on developing and testing code, especially since it is often uninteresting work that won't benefit them directly. The response is that the main incentive is the opportunity to eventually work on something more enjoyable. However, there is irony in that those who recognize the importance of fixing issues are hesitant to touch consensus code unless there is a critical security hole, while those who push for consensus changes tend to ignore these important issues.</summary>
