    <summary>The phrase "no offense taken" or "no offense intended" is commonly used in informal conversations to indicate that no harm was meant or taken from a potentially sensitive topic or comment. It can be seen as a way to diffuse any tension or awkwardness that may arise from these situations. However, it is important to note that the use of this phrase does not necessarily excuse any insensitive or offensive behavior. It is still important to be mindful and respectful of others' feelings and experiences. In addition, some people may find the use of "no offense intended" to be dismissive or invalidating of their emotions. It is important to listen to and acknowledge others' perspectives, even if they differ from our own. Overall, while "no offense taken" and "no offense intended" can be useful tools in navigating sensitive conversations, it is crucial to approach these situations with empathy and an open mind.</summary>
