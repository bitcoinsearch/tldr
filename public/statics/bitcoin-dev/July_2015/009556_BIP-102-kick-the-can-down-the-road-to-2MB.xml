    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, has written an email to bitcoin-dev. In this email, he clarifies that the preference of miners is not particularly relevant if there is consensus among major exchanges and merchants. He suggests that a checkpoint could be implemented in a decentralized way to ensure miners of the original chain won't be able to overtake the new chain. Todd also believes that switching to BIP102 is the only economically viable choice for miners, as it is the most widely accepted version of Bitcoin. He notes that a miner voting may still be useful to gauge how many miners are ready for the change, but it is not necessary to measure their consensus. Todd proposes that the new rule will be implemented either 1 week after 70% of miners are ready or on February 1, 2016, whichever comes first.Finally, Todd suggests that SPV wallets should strengthen their security model after the BIP66 fork. They should be able to identify potential consensus forks in the network and stop accepting incoming transactions when in doubt. To indicate a hardfork to SPV wallets, Todd proposes his "version 0 flag block" proposal, which he explains in a previous email on the topic.</summary>
