    <summary>A user named Geir Harald Hansen asked how to get Bitminter on the list of approved pools at bitcoin.org for SPV Mining/Old Bitcoin Core. David A. Harding responded by asking users to add known good/bad pools to the Comparison of mining pools page on the Bitcoin Wiki, as this information is needed to make accurate guesses about how many additional confirmations are needed while the situation persists. He also stated that he will update the Bitcoin.org alert to point to the Wiki page.</summary>
