    <summary>On June 30, 2015, Justus Ranvier responded to a query related to the potential applications of BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Monetas has come up with an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) seed-based Bitmessage address derivation method using BIP-43. They have proposed this as a BIP based on the recommendation in BIP-43 to reserve a purpose code. The link provided in the email directs to the GitHub page of Monetas where the details of BIP-43 and BIP-bm01 are given. It specifies how BIP-43 is used for Multi-Account Hierarchy Deterministic wallets and BIP-bm01 is used for deriving Bitmessage addresses from a public key. The email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation. This mailing list is dedicated to discussing technical aspects of Bitcoin development.</summary>
