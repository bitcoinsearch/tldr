    <summary>In a conversation between Eric Lombrozo and Cory Fields, Lombrozo referenced his work on something similar to the idea of user-selectable parameters for consensus rules. The idea was discussed in terms of allowing users to decide between different chains at runtime rather than forcing them to use forked software. However, Lombrozo cautioned against encouraging forking existing blockchains without mechanisms in place to gracefully merge divergent chains. While it was acknowledged that someone could create a scamcoin, they agreed that attempting to fork an existing blockchain without first securing overwhelming consensus would be a terrible idea that would result in people losing money. Ultimately, user-selectable parameters were seen as the only logical solution for those who are unhappy with Core's position as the consensus/policy gatekeeper.</summary>
