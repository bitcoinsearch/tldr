    <summary>In an email conversation between Thomas Voegtlin, a bitcoin-dev member and Justin Newton, the CEO of Netki, they discussed creating a common standard that gives everyone maximum freedom. Netki has been tagged to their Wallet Name Service but intends to offer more services than just this, therefore a neutral name for the lookup standard is preferred. The discussion included the use of Namecoin in the standard which provides a censor-resistant option as well as low cost for individuals to register names, however, it was noted that .bit records cannot be easily verified by lightweight/spv wallets without the need for a copy of the Namecoin blockchain. The two-tier lookup format was proposed where the first lookup returns a list of currencies or payment types supported by the Wallet Name while the second lookup goes to a record specific to that currency type to get the address to go to. This solution replaces the tags used in OpenAlias, but combining formats to use both the two-level lookups and tags could have value. Verisign has also delivered a standard to the IETF using DNSSEC to pass payment information, and discussions with them about merging standards with Netki have begun.They agreed to stay in contact and communication with the IETF side with the hope of ending up with something that is compatible and not wait on the IETF to move ahead themselves.</summary>
