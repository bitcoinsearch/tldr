    <summary>In a message sent on July 9, 2015 at 6:57 pm, Tom Harding discussed the issue of replacing transactions and how conflicts should be relayed in order for the replace-by-anything feature to work. He suggests that acting against the peer is not the solution. In response, Alex Morcos suggested tracking recently-rejected transaction IDs and not getting data from them, which Harding agreed was a good idea. However, he also noted that this approach may not necessarily reduce the load, as there are not many repeated transaction hashes among rejected replacement messages in his log.</summary>
