    <summary>The author of the message intends to assign themselves a BIP number for a postmortem event. They have already reached out to parties affected by the fork to gather information, but they don't plan on drafting yet. The author requests anyone aware of impacted services or infrastructure to contact them off-list. Additionally, those interested in contributing to the analysis can contact the author and they will link them to their repository when they begin drafting. The author prefers to collect more data before drawing any conclusions from it.</summary>
