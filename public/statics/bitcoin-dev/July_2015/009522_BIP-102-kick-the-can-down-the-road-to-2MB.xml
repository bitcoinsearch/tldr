    <summary>In an email thread on Bitcoin-dev, Peter Todd criticized Jeff Garzik's proposed 2MB hard fork patch, stating that if Garzik doesn't understand the issue, he should not be proposing changes and instead leave the discussion. However, Todd believes Garzik is proposing the patch to push discussion towards a solution, as trolling with bad patches can motivate people to write better ones. Garzik defended his proposal, stating that 2MB is a viable next step with the most consensus and would gain valuable field data for further development of a better block size solution. The 2MB cap would also serve as a fallback option in case the user community cannot reach consensus on a larger solution. Garzik is open to suggestions to improve BIP 102, aiming for a minimum complexity fallback that others have previously agreed is a useful compromise.</summary>
