    <summary>Adam Back, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, shared his concerns regarding the trustworthiness of data-center operators in a message on the group's mailing list. He argued that trusting data-center logic fails because operators can be bound by laws and court orders, get hacked, employ corrupt humans, and become centralization points for policy attacks. To maintain the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Back suggested reading books like Kicking the Dragon by Larken Rose and The State by Franz Oppenheimer to understand the importance of decentralization.</summary>
