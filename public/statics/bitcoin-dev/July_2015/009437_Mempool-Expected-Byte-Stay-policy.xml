    <summary>On July 15, 2015, Thomas Zander via bitcoin-dev discussed changing the rule for evicting transactions and their dependents. Currently, Rule 2 states that a transaction and its dependents will be evicted on its 2-hour anniversary regardless of whether space is required or not. Tom Harding suggested that instead of two hours, a number of blocks should be used so users and wallets can know when they should rebroadcast and consider increasing the fee. To determine the number of blocks, Zander did some calculations and found that using 12 blocks, there is a 5% chance the user would have to wait three hours. On the other hand, using 120 minutes, there is only a .23% chance that fewer than four blocks have occurred. The data is shown in tables and illustrates the difference in waiting time between using blocks versus a set amount of time.</summary>
