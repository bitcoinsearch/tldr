    <summary>The author of the article believes that building an effective Bitcoin governance is not possible, and proposes the coexistence of Core and XT in a parallel two-party system as a step towards decentralization. Each side will have different people, structures, processes, and political standings, keeping each other in check. The sides' respective power will be determined by the number of nodes running and people/businesses on board. Any significant change will need to be negotiated at the risk of another full fork. The author suggests that both sides should start thinking of themselves as opposition parties, with people and businesses ultimately deciding through a Yes/No vote on proposed changes. The idea of governing Bitcoin through voting is futile, as Bitcoin operates on consensus and attempts to impose concepts such as voting will not work. The core developers set standards instead of governing Bitcoin, and their influence depends on specific circumstances. The author suggests changing the wording to reflect the voluntary nature of this standard. Improving the voting mechanism of Bitcoin is proposed, which includes adding 8-byte votes into blocks, with miners acting as sensors that collect all the noise and chatter and cast it into a vote. The author suggests giving attention to engineering progress on Bitcoin Core rather than subjecting everyone's email inboxes to hundreds of opinions about governance and block size without patches or simulations on an engineering mailing list.In an email dated July 1st, 2015, Jeffrey Paul requested discussions on a certain list be limited to the research and development of Bitcoin Core, arguing that if this was not the purpose of the list, then it was misleadingly named. Paul suggested that if Bitcoin Core development is to be considered independent from development of Bitcoin protocol, then it needs its own separate list. The email included two non-text attachments, one being a pgp-key and the other being a digital signature.</summary>
