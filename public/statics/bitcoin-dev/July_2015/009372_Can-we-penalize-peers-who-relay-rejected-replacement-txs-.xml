    <summary>Matt Whitlock, a Bitcoin developer, reported on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that he was seeing a lot of messages in his log about replacement transactions being rejected due to their paying less in fees than the transactions they would replace. He suggested that each replacement rejection ought to penalize the peer who relayed the offending transaction and if the penalty builds up enough, then the peer could be temporarily banned. However, Alex Morcos offered a suggestion on IRC -- track recently-rejected txid's and don't getdata them. This solution is not to act against the peer.Matt Whitlock is presently running his full node with Peter Todd's full replace-by-fee patch set. Due to the ongoing spam attack, he is seeing a steady stream of these rejection messages, dozens per second at times. The link for the patch set is provided in the email. The idea proposed by Alex Morcos on IRC is to track recently-rejected txid's and don't getdata them. This can only work if conflicts are relayed, so the solution is not to act against the peer.</summary>
