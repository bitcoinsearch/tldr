    <summary>Mark Friedenbach has suggested a child pays for parent (CPFP) method which would require changes to the P2P layer to support RBF scorched earth. The transactions are processed individually and out of context, so it is relatively complex to evaluate new transactions against previously removed transactions in a buffer. Additionally, existing wallets are not efficient in preventing double-spends as there are many edge cases where transactions aren't recorded correctly. Incompatibility with coinjoin could also lead to losses. However, scorched-earth can be implemented using SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY on an opt-in basis which could be added only after taking special engineering considerations into account. Peter Todd has expressed his interest in pursuing this further.</summary>
