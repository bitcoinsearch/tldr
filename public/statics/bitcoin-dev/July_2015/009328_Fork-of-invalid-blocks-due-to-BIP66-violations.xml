    <summary>The email thread discusses potential risks for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallet users and how they can stay safe. Raystonn suggests that SPV clients should check their node versions against the minimum required for safety. However, this won't help against malicious nodes but will be useful in cases like the one that happened recently. Gregory Maxwell points out that a near majority of the hashrate on the network appears to be SPV mining and discusses the recent failure mode due to BIP66 violation. It is noted that the threshold is high because of this reason. There is also a mention of btcnuggets, a non-upgraded miner that produced an invalid block after the lock-in, and f2pool and antpool have been extending it.</summary>
