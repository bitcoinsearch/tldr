    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, the question of whether to change users' expectations regarding transaction fees arose. Jorge Timon contended that it was important to do so in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the system, while Tom Harding argued that reality may change and we should not manipulate users' expectations. Gavin Andresen weighed in by suggesting that they plan for success rather than declare failure, but this was met with disagreement from some participants who saw having a block limit as a design decision to protect against centralization. The conversation also touched on the idea of timestamping data using the blockchain and scaling solutions for Bitcoin.</summary>
