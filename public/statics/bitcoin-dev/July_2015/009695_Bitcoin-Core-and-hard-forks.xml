    <summary>In an email thread discussing the possibility of increasing Bitcoin's exchange rate, Jorge Timón suggested that doubling bitcoin's price was not as simple as pushing a button. Tom Harding replied, telling Jorge that he had been working on Github as hard as anyone else. Jorge then explained that his contributions were mainly code refactors and that commits or lines changed could not be used to measure the importance of his work. He added that review is much more important than coding. When asked why he was contributing to Bitcoin if not to make it more valuable, Jorge replied that his motivations were irrelevant if his work was good for the software. He also said that he was concerned about the long-term success of the currency rather than its market cap and that there were many reasons for contributing to Bitcoin core. Finally, he stated that currency speculation was off-topic on the list and that he was focused on improving the system.</summary>
