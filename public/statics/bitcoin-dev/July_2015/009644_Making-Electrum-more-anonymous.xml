    <summary>The issue of privacy in Bitcoin transactions is a significant problem for the cryptocurrency's fungibility. Correlation of addresses within transactions can be problematic, and the use of Bloom filters fails to offer adequate privacy. While zero-knowledge-proof may come to the rescue, currently running a full chain wallet remains the only solution for maximum privacy, which is not practical in many scenarios. However, Slurms MacKenzie via bitcoin-dev suggests that valid solutions exist to address this problem. Additionally, introducing truly-random timing variations into mixnet solutions can mitigate timing attacks, but it makes the already intolerable performance problem much worse.</summary>
