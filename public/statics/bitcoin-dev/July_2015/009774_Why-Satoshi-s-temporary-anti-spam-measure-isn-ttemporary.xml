    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Gavin Andresen responded to Bryan Bishop's statement about high transaction costs and scarcity in decentralized systems. He argued that this is a myth and there are successful decentralized systems like the internet which have proven otherwise. Andresen questioned the level of decentralization of the internet and its technology. He also explored why it succeeded over more efficient centralized systems. Andresen believes that smaller block sizes have utility, but he thinks that larger blocks will lead to more innovation and utility without artificial limits.</summary>
