    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim√≥n requested a BIP number from Greg Maxwell for discussions about deploying uncontroversial hardforks to a single place. The timewarp fix can be coded as a softfork instead of a hardfork and would require all blocks to be within one day of the median of the previous 11 blocks, which Tier Nolan said would protect against the exploit. A stricter soft fork would force the two blocks in question to have the same timestamp. Nolan thinks this is fine, since fixing it correctly requires a hard fork, especially if it's only to show a non-controversial hard fork.</summary>
