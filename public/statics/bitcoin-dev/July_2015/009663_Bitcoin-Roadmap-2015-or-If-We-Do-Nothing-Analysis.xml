    <summary>On Jul 24, 2015, Thomas Zander via bitcoin-dev and Slurms MacKenzie had a discussion about companies with $30M USD of funding not running a single Bitcoin Core node. Zander assumed that they meant not having a Bitcoin Core node that is open to incoming connections. Blockchain.info's wallet and block explorer have been tested by Peter Todd and have shown invalid data consistent with not running a full node. This led to invalid confirmations during the BIP66 fork.</summary>
