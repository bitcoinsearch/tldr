    <summary>In an email exchange, software developer Alex Morcos raised questions about the existence of a fee market in Bitcoin. While developers have been discussing the possibility of a fee market for years, users have not actually experienced it. Fees have remained low for six years and stress tests have shown that wallets do not behave properly with regards to fees. Despite this, Bitcoin Core has the power to introduce a fee market simply by avoiding progress on the block size limit. This new policy should be debated and consensus should be achieved before it is implemented without user notification.</summary>
