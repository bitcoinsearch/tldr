    <summary>In a message from 2015, Gavin Andresen discusses the potential for decreasing costs in relation to Bitcoin. He suggests that while many optimizations have already been made, there are still more opportunities to reduce costs. However, he also acknowledges that there are theoretical limitations that cannot be overcome without major algorithmic breakthroughs and accepting a finite error probability. Overall, while there is room for improvement, there are also inherent limitations that must be considered in any attempts to decrease costs associated with Bitcoin.</summary>
