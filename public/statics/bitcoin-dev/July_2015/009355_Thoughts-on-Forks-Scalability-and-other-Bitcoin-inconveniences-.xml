    <summary>Eric Lombrozo, a developer in the bitcoin space, responds to concerns about the security of bitcoin. Lombrozo points out that while Bitcoin promises trustlessness, it does not promise infinite security. He suggests that discussing Bitcoin security issues should not involve comparisons to an unachievable standard of perfection. Rather, striving for perfect security can prevent achieving good and achievable security. Justus Ranvier, founder of Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, also emphasizes the importance of good security rather than infinite security.</summary>
