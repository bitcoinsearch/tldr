    <summary>In this thread, the writer suggests that Bitcoin Core and its policies have been conflated. They propose adding the ability for users to decide their consensus parameters at runtime, an option that is already in use with ./bitcoind -testnet. The writer acknowledges that this idea would likely be met with opposition but argues that it could provide an alternative to Core's conflation with consensus rules. With this new system in place, consensus changes would become more about lobbying and coalitions rather than pull requests. The thread continues with a discussion around whether developers control the network or if there are checks-and-balances in place that allow users to voice their opinions. Some argue that Bitcoin Core has no authority to set rules for the Bitcoin economy while others assert that they do have that authority due to the reality of ~100% market share and limited github commit access. Those who disagree with the current rules are faced with either accepting them or forking the project and block chain (as seen with XT). There are no other alternatives, which has caused anger among some Bitcoin users.</summary>
