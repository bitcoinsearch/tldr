    <summary>The user is seeking guidance on whether their idea to use a Jetson TK1, a GPU-powered development board, as a power-efficient full node for Bitcoin makes sense. They plan to run bitcoind on the Jetson as a node with high performance-per-watt, since a pure-CPU implementation of bitcoind will clog the CPU. The user believes that there are heavy-compute highly-parallel functions that could be outsourced to a GPU and may want to fork and/or contribute to them. However, they want to hear opinions on the idea/configuration before coding a complete mess, as they have more background on parallel programming than on the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
