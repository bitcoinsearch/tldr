    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in July 2015, Eric Lombrozo, Jameson Lopp, cipher anthem and Jorge Timón discussed the issue of block size increases. Gavin Andresen expressed his desire to move from "IMPOSSIBLE" to "let's work together and work through the problems and scale it up". However, Jameson clarified that block size increases are not about scaling the network and that larger block sizes only increase how much load the network can bear. The scalability proposals will still require larger blocks if Bitcoin is ever to support anything close to resembling "mainstream" usage. Cipher anthem suggested focusing on projects like the lightning network which have made great progress towards addressing scalability. Jorge Timón expressed concerns about decentralization and the security model of the network being at risk due to the increasing costs in validation causing people to rely on others to validate for them. Eric Lombrozo agreed with Jorge's views and added that increasing block size only makes the problem worse.</summary>
