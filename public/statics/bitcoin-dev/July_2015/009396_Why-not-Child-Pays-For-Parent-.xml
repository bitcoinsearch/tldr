    <summary>The context discusses the issue of transaction fees in Bitcoin transactions. The author suggests that a compromise would be necessary, where transactions with insufficient fees for peer-to-peer transfer should remain unconfirmed. Many users are in a situation where they have paid enough to keep their transactions in the pool but not enough to get them out. The author proposes a child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) mechanism that only works on transactions that meet the minimum threshold for peer propagation. This would help battle the current spam flood in the system. Another contributor to the discussion agrees with the proposal and explains the current limitations of the p2p protocol. Transactions are evaluated for inclusion as a group with CPFP, but they are not yet evaluated for relaying as a unit. The current p2p protocol does not have a way to send multiple transactions in a single protocol message to signify that they should be evaluated together.</summary>
