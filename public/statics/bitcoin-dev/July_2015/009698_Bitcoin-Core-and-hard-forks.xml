    <summary>The sender of the message, who is named Jorge, seems to have a disagreement with the recipient about the role of societal adoption in the system designed by Satoshi. The recipient argues that adoption is ahead of schedule, as evidenced by the exchange rate, which is an imperfect but highly effective market. This rate is critical to the security and capacity of the network, as long as hardware, electric power, and bandwidth are priced in fiat currency.Jorge believes that the exchange rate is irrelevant and that Satoshi's timetable for transitioning to fee incentives can be replaced with something better. The recipient suggests that this stance may be due to Jorge's view that the exchange rate is not important. They then offer an English saying, "A bunch of geniuses can do a lot more damage than one fool."</summary>
