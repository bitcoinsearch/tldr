    <summary>A proposal for a hardfork bit mechanism has been put forward on Github by jl2012. The proposal suggests changing the Bitcoin block headers' version field to indicate a hardfork deployment and alleviate issues related to hardforks. Hardforks are considered risky due to requiring support of miners and the Bitcoin economy, possible unawareness of full nodes and SPV nodes following old consensus rules, and unexpected reorgs.The proposed mechanism introduces an explicit "point of no return" in the blockchain through a flag block that must be publicly verifiable with only blockchain data and programme source code. The hardfork bit must be turned off in its descendants until the next hardfork deployment. Michael Ruddy has praised the proposal, saying that it provides a fallback mechanism for economic actors who can make a decision and say "we're doing this".The proposal aims to prevent hard forks from piggy-backing on another's flag block without prior collaboration and to have a nicer message in the alerting system. Another proposal alongside this one involves using version 0 or even &gt;1MB block in the specific case of a block size limit hard fork. However, the &gt;1MB flag block would create DoS banning problems. It also means that older nodes do not have the chance to notice a fork is happening as they would with a version 0 or the hard fork bit proposal.Full nodes and SPV nodes may not be aware of a hardfork deployment, leading them to stick to an economic-minority fork and unknowingly accept devalued legacy tokens. To address this problem, a flag block is proposed that would be constructed in a way that nodes with the original consensus rules must reject. Nodes with the new consensus rules must reject a block if it is not a flag block when it is meant to be. The flag block would have the hardfork bit set to 1, include a short predetermined unique description of the hardfork anywhere in its coinbase, and follow any other rules required by the hardfork.Additionally, there is a proposal for an automatic warning system in which full nodes and SPV nodes would look into the coinbase of a flag block when found on the network. They would then alert their users or stop accepting incoming transactions if it is an unknown hardfork. The possibility of multiple hardforks sharing the same flag block is slim but can happen. To avoid potential ambiguity, the coinbase message provides additional information to non-upgrading nodes' warning system.The "version 0" idea is not compatible with the version bits voting system, so a hardfork bit BIP was proposed instead. The commit hash of the BIP for the particular hard fork could be used in the coinbase message. Another proposal alongside this one involves using version 0 or even &gt;1MB block in the specific case of a block size limit hard fork. However, the &gt;1MB flag block creates DoS banning problems, so it is not as appealing as a version 0 or this hard fork bit proposal. A version 0 flag block would not be able to contain any transactions unless the flag block version was assumed to be that of the most recent version at the time. These reasons were part of why the hard fork bit proposal was progressed towards.Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of careful consideration and collaboration when implementing hard forks in the Bitcoin network. The draft BIP proposes a change to Bitcoin block headers' version field to indicate a hardfork deployment, making hardforks less risky. It breaks backward compatibility intentionally but is compatible with the BIP XX "Version bits" mechanism. If there won't be any other hardfork proposals at the same time, the coinbase message may not be necessary.</summary>
