    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around a proposed minrelaytxfee setting in the 0.11.0 release notes, which is seen as a technique for double-spending. A user asks if there is a chart that plots estimatefee over time to see how the fee market has evolved in recent weeks and shares a link to a useful website. The thread then goes on to discuss pre- and post-Hearn-relay drop rules and their impact on double-spending attacks against zeroconf accepting merchants. A user shares their experience of successfully performing such attacks and warns others to stop relying on zeroconf. The discussion concludes with suggestions for users and warnings to be cautious of such attacks.</summary>
