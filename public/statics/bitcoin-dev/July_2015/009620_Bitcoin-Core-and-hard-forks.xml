    <summary>In this email exchange between Eric Lombrozo and Jean-Paul Kogelman, they discuss the idea of a fair fee market in mining contracts. Kogelman believes that a more fair fee market will develop if miners start offering quality of service at multiple tiers rather than relying solely on the threat of exclusion as enforcement. He suggests that interference from a block size cap will only be detrimental to this process and highlights its purpose to prevent monster blocks. Lombrozo questions Kogelman's use of the term QoS and notes that transactions are either included or not, unlike a hotel where upgrades are possible.</summary>
