    <summary>On July 23, 2015, Kalle Rosenbaum announced the availability of a Proof of Payment-enabled fork of the Mycelium Bitcoin wallet. The source code for this version can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/wallet, and the validating code for the server is hosted at https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/poppoc/. A demo site using the server code can be accessed at http://www.rosenbaum.se:8080/, and a demo video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euzZcoCilhc. Mycelium binaries are also available on the demo site.Peter Todd responded to the announcement, encouraging people to use the new fork and provide feedback. He noted that once there is actual adoption, BIP numbers will be assigned even for standards that may be dangerous or badly designed. However, the barrier for non-consensus items is the desire to avoid assigning numbers for things that never get used.</summary>
