    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev post from 2015, the use of median time instead of block.nTime for activation was proposed as a way to avoid perverse incentives about miners lying in their timestamps or the threshold being crossed and then reverted. The rule is based on the consensus of using the same rule as consensus for the threshold. While some argue that a different percentile may have been a better choice, the rule remains what it is today. The post suggests that a statistician could be useful in helping to select the most appropriate statistical algorithms, considering the consequences of learning post-fork that a "bad statistical model" was chosen.</summary>
