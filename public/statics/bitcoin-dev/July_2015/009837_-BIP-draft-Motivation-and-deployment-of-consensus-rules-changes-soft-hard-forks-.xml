    <summary>On July 31, 2015, Thomas Kerin via bitcoin-dev expressed his belief that a document should exist prior to assigning a BIP number. There was an initial document, but alterations were made after the BIP number was assigned. The author apologized for breaking the previous link and provided a new one. The code is also available on Github. A discussion related to this BIP regarding activation thresholds is taking place in a separate mailing list. The BIP assumes that the preferred choice for non-emergency uncontroversial hardforks will be defining a starting block height after which miners upgrade. Once the 95% threshold is reached, the hardfork takes effect. After the first block is buried, the check can be replaced by redefining the threshold height rather than the height when miners started voting.</summary>
