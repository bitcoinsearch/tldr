    <summary>Adam Back, in a message sent via bitcoin-dev, expressed his optimism that the Bitcoin scaling and decentralization will look better with current active work on decentralization, layer 2 scaling solutions. As part of this, he believes that a modest blocksize increase to smooth out the transition to layer 2 may be considered. The question asked was whether a 1MB increase to 2MB, as outlined in BIP 102, would be considered a "modest" increase.The context highlights Adam's prediction of a better future for Bitcoin scaling and decentralization due to current active work on decentralization and layer 2 scaling solutions. He believes that a modest block size increase is necessary to facilitate the transition to layer 2. The specific question asked concerns whether a 1MB increase to 2MB would be considered "modest" according to BIP 102.</summary>
