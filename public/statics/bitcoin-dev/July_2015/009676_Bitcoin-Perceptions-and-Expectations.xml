    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the terminology used for Bitcoin transactions. Vincent Truong suggests redefining some terms to improve perception, such as changing "confirmations" to "settlements" to align with finance terminology. 0-conf transactions are described as simply the act of making an exchange and not implying safety, while using the word "settled" in place of confirmations would click better with merchants. The term "n confirmations" is acceptable, but displaying a meaningless number could be replaced by using a percentage or "confidence." The discussion also touches on Bitcoin's speed compared to Visa, emphasizing that wallets still send notifications when transactions are first seen, not when it goes into a block. Finally, the post includes PGP encryption.</summary>
