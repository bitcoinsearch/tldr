    <summary>A developer has suggested defining a minimum specification (min spec) for Bitcoin Core, similar to those used in game development, to reduce the risk of breaking something due to capacity problems. Ideally, the metrics used should be architecture agnostic with some sort of conversion metric that can map it onto any specific architecture. The ability to measure the impact of a change is important regardless of how values are expressed and having comparable concrete min-spec configurations would be practical. One user suggested using the RISC-V Rocket architecture running on FPGA as a reference point for performance, targeting open hardware rather than large-vendor chipsets with unknown or known bad security properties. Another user welcomed the suggestion and asked for more information on system requirements needed for running Bitcoin Core.</summary>
