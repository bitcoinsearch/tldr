    <summary>After conducting a Google search, the author notes that there is no previous post from 2015 mentioning "roadmap" in the subject line. The author suggests that such a post would be useful for newcomers to the list. Two main issues are discussed: increasing the transactions per second by increasing block size and addressing the trend toward centralization. The latter issue includes two sub-issues: mining falling to a small number of businesses with the necessary infrastructure and common computing machines becoming inadequate for running full nodes. These factors will result in these machines being unable to contribute to the ecosystem in meaningful ways.</summary>
