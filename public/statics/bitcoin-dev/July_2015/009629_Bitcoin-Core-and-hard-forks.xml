    <summary>The discussion starts with a statement by Jean-Paul Kogelman, stating that implicit QoS is simpler to implement and closer to what Bitcoin started out as. Eric Lombrozo responds by explaining how third parties separate from individual miners can provide mechanism that allows QoS guarantees and shifting the complexity and risk from the wallet. He also mentions that negotiating directly with miners via smart contracts seems difficult. Peter Todd adds to the discussion saying that giving guarantees without a majority of hashing power isn't possible as mining is a random poisson process. Kogelman concludes saying it doesn't matter if it's perfect or not as it's far more workable than guessing whether or not a transaction will end up in a block at all. The conversation revolves around QoS guarantees and the possibility of implementing them within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
