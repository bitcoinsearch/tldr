    <summary>Blockchain forks can merge just like git repository forks using the reorg algorithm. This process involves transactions that didn't make it into the post-reorg chain being returned to the mempool and miners attempting to reinclude them. However, if conflicts arise with other transactions, they are dropped, resulting in "resolving merge conflicts". The main issue is when software is programmed not to merge with the new chain, which can throttle user base growth. Once this issue is resolved, merging (reorg) back onto the main chain is possible.</summary>
