    <summary>The message is a discussion about the potential of on-chain microtransaction systems, and the need for the bitcoin community to re-examine dust as an opportunity for microgiving. The author also promotes their project, abis.io, which aims to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy. The discussion then shifts to a comment made by Matthieu Riou regarding Sybil attacks on peer-to-peer networks. Todd argues that in the case of Bitcoin, the identities are not pseudonymous, and that achieving 20% via outgoing connections would use up significant network resources. Riou counters that they would only use a few well-tuned nodes, but Todd argues that what they are doing is inherently incompatible with decentralization.The conversation then turns to whether or not Riou has relationships with mining pools and if they are looking at contracts to have transactions mined to guarantee confirmations. Riou denies having such contracts and claims not to know anyone else who does.</summary>
