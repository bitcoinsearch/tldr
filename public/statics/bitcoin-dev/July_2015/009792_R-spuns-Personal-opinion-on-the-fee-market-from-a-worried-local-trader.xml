    <summary>The debate around the blocksize limit and its impact on Bitcoin's decentralization and functioning fee market continues. Tom Harding argues that the limit is necessary for decentralization, but hitting it could encourage miners to implement their own policies and get rid of special cases. He suggests that hitting the limit would not be terribly bad, as higher fees could lead to more scalable solutions, such as payment channels, being adopted by Bitcoin companies. Furthermore, he believes hitting the limit now would be beneficial so that software compatibility with a limit can be ensured. Ultimately, unless there is agreement to remove the limit completely, it will eventually be hit anyway.</summary>
