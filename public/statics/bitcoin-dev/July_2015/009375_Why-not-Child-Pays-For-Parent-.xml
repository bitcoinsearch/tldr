    <summary>The author of the text is questioning whether CPFP should be a default policy considering recent congestion and discussion regarding FSS-RBF. They also pose a question about how transaction fees should be based in the case of CPFP, specifically whether it should be based on the total transaction size or the sum of each transaction's required fee. The author attempted to test this by sending 0.0008 BTC without any fee and then that unconfirmed utxo into another transaction with 0.0001 BTC, but it still hasn't confirmed. The lack of confirmation could be attributed to several factors such as not enough hash power, small amounts, new coins, incorrect fee amount, and/or excessive congestion. The author concludes by expressing curiosity about these topics.</summary>
