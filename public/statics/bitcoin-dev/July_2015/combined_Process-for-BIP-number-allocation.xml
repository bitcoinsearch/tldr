    <summary>A suggestion was made in an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on July 23, 2015, by a member of the Bitcoin development community, to add a clause to BIP0001 stating that if a BIP editor cannot handle a BIP within a week, they should notify the author with an estimate of when it will be handled. The author was trying to get BIP numbers allocated for Proof of Payment but had not received any reaction from BIP editor Gregory Maxwell despite requesting it and CCing the bitcoin-dev list. Someone responded asking about the implementation of the proposed BIP. The email was signed with a PGP signature.Kalle Rosenbaum, a developer, announced the availability of a Proof of Payment-enabled fork of the Mycelium Bitcoin wallet on the same day. Peter Todd encouraged people to use the new fork and provide feedback. He noted that once there is actual adoption, BIP numbers will be assigned even for standards that may be dangerous or badly designed. However, the barrier for non-consensus items is the desire to avoid assigning numbers for things that never get used.The author suggests adding a clause to the "BIP Editor Responsibilities &amp; Workflow" section of BIP0001 requiring BIP editors to notify authors if they do not handle the BIP within a week and provide an estimate of when it will be handled. Kalle Rosenbaum suggested the same clause to the "BIP Editor Responsibilities &amp; Workflow" section of BIP0001. However, Gregory Maxwell did not respond to Kalle's request for a BIP number allocation for Proof of Payment. In response, Peter Todd asked for an implementation of Kalle's proposed BIP. Kalle provided links to a PoP-enabled fork of Mycelium and the server (validating code) on Github, as well as a demo site and video. The author also notes that there are several BIP proposals floating around, and the process for BIP allocation and inclusion in the bips repository is unclear. They suggest that authors should receive a response from the BIP editor when requesting a number, and if the editor disapproves of a BIP, the author should be notified within a reasonable and predictable timeframe.</summary>
