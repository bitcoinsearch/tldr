    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Ian Treibick reported an issue with the 'lockunspent' command on OS X with Satoshi 0.11.0. He reported that he was able to spend the locked unspent transaction output (UTXO) even after locking it with the command. In his post, he provided the command he used for locking the UTXO and the subsequent output of 'listlockunspent', which showed no locked UTXOs. Ian was unsure whether this was the right place to report the issue or if he should open an issue on GitHub.The sender did not provide any additional information regarding the issue. They only reported that they were experiencing the problem with their wallet and asked for advice on whether they should open an issue on GitHub. The sender also included the command they used for locking the UTXO and mentioned that the output of the lockunspent command showed 'true'.Overall, the message reports an issue with the lockunspent command on Satoshi 0.11.0 on OS X. The sender is unsure about where to report the issue and asks for advice. They provide the command they used to lock the UTXO and mention that despite locking it, they were still able to spend it from their wallet.</summary>
