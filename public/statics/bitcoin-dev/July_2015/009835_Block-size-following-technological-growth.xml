    <summary>In an email thread, Mike Hearn questions the compromise of increasing block size to 8MB instead of no limit. He poses questions as to where people draw the line in terms of block size increase and how much they are willing to sacrifice for lower fees. Hearn believes that knowing how people weigh the risks of large blocks versus the benefits of low fees can lead to a more productive discussion. Although the assumption of having a two-year stability period is unrealistic, this hypothetical situation can help determine how much of the disagreement comes from the belief that increasing block size will lower fees but won't last versus the belief that the low fees aren't worth it even if they do.</summary>
