    <summary>In a discussion about the implementation of block size increase in Bitcoin, one user disagrees with using time as a reference and proposes using height instead. They argue that using height is a simpler design and there would be no need to rely on clocks that differ across computers and locations. The user also suggests that BIP16 and BIP34 could have been changed to height-based activation from the beginning. However, another user points out that using contextual information such as block height complicates block validation, making it impossible to tell if a block is too big without having all previous blocks first. This user suggests that block time is a better option.Meanwhile, a third user proposes a minimum viable alternative plan for block size increase through BIP173. The proposal suggests a conservative increase of 2MB which proves that the network can upgrade and permits some added growth while the community gathers data on how increased block size impacts various metrics. However, the proposal requires a hard fork and another one down the road. The user suggests switching over by block height rather than time, and recommends six months as a minimum target for testing.</summary>
