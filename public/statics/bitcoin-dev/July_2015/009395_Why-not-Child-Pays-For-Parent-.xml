    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the issue of evaluating transactions for relaying as a unit. At present, transactions are evaluated for inclusion as a group with Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) but they cannot be evaluated together for relaying because the current peer-to-peer (p2p) protocol lacks a way to send multiple transactions in a single protocol message. Luke Dashjr suggests that lack of unit tests is the only thing holding up the implementation and once those are implemented, it can be merged soon. However, the problem remains in getting the parent transactions relayed despite failing relay policy on their own.</summary>
