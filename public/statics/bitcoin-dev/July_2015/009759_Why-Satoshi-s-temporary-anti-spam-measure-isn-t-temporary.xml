    <summary>The email conversation between Pieter Wuille and Thomas Zander on Bitcoin scalability issues was held on July 30, 2015. In the email, Pieter Wuille expressed his belief that the benefits of supporting more transactions far outweigh the costs and risks of 8MB blocks, but it is hard to have a rational conversation about that when simple questions like 'what is s reasonable cost to run a full node' are not being answered. However, Thomas Zander believes that the benefit of an 8 MB over a 1 MB in terms of utility is marginal. He also thinks that Bitcoin's advantage over other systems does not lie in scalability, which is in conflict with transparency, lack of need for trust in network peers, miners, and those who influence or control the system. According to Thomas Zander, Bitcoin's real advantage is its ownership and control, which is absent in centrally designed systems. He argues that if Bitcoin remains small at 1Mb, it will lose decentralization, avoid ownership of the network, and introduce control, which is contrary to the basic goal of avoiding ownership. Therefore, he believes that holding Bitcoin at 1Mb is hurting the fundamental goal of avoiding ownership rather than advancing it.</summary>
