    <summary>The writer responded to a complaint about the lack of quantitative analysis, stating that they provided it and made a sensible conclusion based on the facts. The response was not directed solely at the recipient, but rather the general attitude in the forum. While the data presented was interesting, it ultimately confirmed what is already known - that propagation speed could be the next bottleneck after the hard-coded limit. The solution may lie in a better protocol, such as incorporating Matt's optimized network or IBLTs. However, the current bottleneck remains the hard cap. The conclusion remains the same: Bitcoin must grow and solutions will be found as needed.</summary>
