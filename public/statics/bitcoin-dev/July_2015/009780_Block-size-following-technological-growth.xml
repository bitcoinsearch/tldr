    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a developer in the Bitcoin community, proposed increasing the block size limit to 2MB by the year 2021. However, some members of the community feel that this is too conservative and could result in the main blockchain becoming a settlement network only affordable for large-value transactions. Despite this concern, Gavin believes that if the system is scaled successfully, it would be possible to increase the limits later via another hard fork. He also thinks that most people who have been arguing for an increase in the block size limit should find this proposal to be a strict improvement over the current situation. Pieter, another member of the community, put together a proposal for this change which many believe could be non-controversial enough to be worth proposing as a hard fork in Bitcoin Core. Suhas Daftuar gave his approval of the proposal, pending further thoughts from others.</summary>
