    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community suggested adding a clause to BIP0001 stating that if a BIP editor cannot handle a BIP within a week, they should notify the author with an estimate of when it will be handled. The suggestion was made in an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on July 23, 2015. The author was attempting to get BIP numbers allocated for Proof of Payment, but had not received any reaction from BIP editor Gregory Maxwell despite requesting it and CCing the bitcoin-dev list.In response, someone asked about the implementation of the proposed BIP. They emphasized that running code is preferred for non-consensus BIPs, and that the number of BIPs should not be significantly higher than the number of actual standards being used. The email was signed with a PGP signature.</summary>
