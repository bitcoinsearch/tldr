    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing the idea of defining a minimum specification (min spec) for Bitcoin Core to help ensure that changes made to the software will not break capacity and to allow users to know how their available budgets are affected. One user suggests targeting the RISC-V Rocket architecture as a reference point for performance, which would allow for open hardware rather than large-vendor chipsets with unknown or known bad security properties. Another user suggests using Moxie as an alternative architecture due to its compactness, simplicity, and ease of auditing. The discussion highlights the importance of both performance and open hardware for the long-term health of Bitcoin.</summary>
