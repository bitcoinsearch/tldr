    <summary>Michael Ruddy submitted an idea for BIP65 usage, which he later found out to be large enough to be a BIP on its own. He is now submitting the informational BIP that describes two Bitcoin script constructs utilizing CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode to create a smart contract. The smart contract will allow a specific offer with flexible expiration time to be presented and accepted or withdrawn/rejected. The draft of this BIP can be found at the given Github link. Additionally, there is a small example implementation available at another Github link.</summary>
