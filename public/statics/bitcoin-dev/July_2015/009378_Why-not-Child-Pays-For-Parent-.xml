    <summary>Some miners have voluntarily deployed Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) in Bitcoin transactions. The idea was discussed earlier this month in a thread on the Linux Foundation's bitcoin-dev mailing list. The pull request to get it into the reference implementation for Bitcoin is still open due to a merge conflict. Another related topic discussed by Peter Todd is Replace-by-Fee (RBF).An example of CPFP in action can be seen in a transaction from Eligius, where the person tried to incentivize the transaction by increasing the fees of dependent transactions. This transaction remained in the mempool until Eligius won a block, after which it made it into the chain. It seems that CPFP still works, but only in an Eligius block. However, it is better than nothing.</summary>
