    <summary>A pull request has been made to remove certain phrases from Bitcoin.org, such as "zero or low fees", "fast international payments" and "instant peer-to-peer transactions". Some users believe that removing these phrases could be seen as breaking the social contract of what Bitcoin is intended to be. However, it has been argued that this documentation should reflect how the system works now, not how it used to work or how it might work in the future. The concept of free transactions does not work well with the current system, which makes advertising Bitcoin with "free transaction" misleading.</summary>
