    <summary>The discussion started with a disagreement over whether to use height or time in the Bitcoin protocol. While using height is simpler, it can be more complex to implement, whereas using time via the median time mechanism is already being used by miners for consensus and provides better predictability. However, triggering events based on time without verifying miner support can be dangerous, as it can lead to an insecure chain that can be attacked. BIP102, which proposes blocksize limit increase, is considered poorly designed due to the risks involved and the potential for attacks on other chains. The author suggests that Jeff Garzik, who proposed BIP102, may be trolling or incompetent.</summary>
