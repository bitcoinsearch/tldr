    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on July 30, 2015, Eric Lombrozo expressed his belief that the block size limit debate was not about whether or not to raise the block size limit, but rather a matter of differing priorities. Thomas Zander chimed in, stating that having different priorities is acceptable, but using time to block others' attempts to increase the block size limit shows conflicting priorities. Zander suggests that different priorities should allow individuals to trust one another to work towards their individual goals.</summary>
