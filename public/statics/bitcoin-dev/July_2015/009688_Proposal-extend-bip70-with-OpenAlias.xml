    <summary>OpenAlias standard was created to empower people to create their own aliases as simply as possible. However, using a "tiered" system adds complexity for the alias creator and it's harder to mess things up by dropping a sub-record. Additionally, retaining forward and backward compatibility is easier with a Key-Value (KV) pair system. Furthermore, applications can start off with a minimum viable product that merely gets the address and at a later stage when support is added for additional metadata, it already has the metadata and can interpret it. The simpler solution is more extensible and flexible. In this proposed example, "_oa2_keys" separates listing of TXT records under a name from the possibility of using Zone Delegation. "_oa2" is introduced as an intermediate level for delegation, and in the alias, this string is translated as "@".</summary>
