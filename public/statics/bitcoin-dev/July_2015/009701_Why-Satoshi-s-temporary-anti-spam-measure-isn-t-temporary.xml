    <summary>In an effort to combat potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, a one megabyte block size limit was implemented as a temporary measure. This was not put in place to address spam, as it is commonly believed, but rather to prevent monster blocks from overwhelming the system. The intention was not to have any economic impact on spam or any future fee market. The effectiveness of this anti-DoS measure is being monitored and the block size limit may be increased depending on how well it performs. So far, things seem to be working well.</summary>
