    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Luke Dashjr corrected a misconception in a BIP proposal regarding Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) transaction selection. The proposal assumed that miners were already utilizing CPFP, but Luke clarified that while it is not included in the reference policy, some miners do use it. Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, chimed in to mention how knowing the amount of hashing power being used for CPFP could be useful for wallet developers to estimate confirmation times.</summary>
