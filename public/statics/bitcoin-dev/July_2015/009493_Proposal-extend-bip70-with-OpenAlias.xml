    <summary>In order to use certain online services, users may need to sign up for a new identity under a DNS tree that they are not currently using. This could be through a website such as netki.com or another similar service. The process involves creating a new digital identity or "root" that is associated with the user's online activities. This can help to ensure security and privacy while using various online services.</summary>
