    <summary>The Bitcoin community emphasizes the importance of keeping Bitcoin a successful project that offers clear benefits to the world. A fee market is necessary, but users should be able to transact fast and relatively cheap compared to the competition or at least with the same costs. The more people use Bitcoin, the higher the demand on the market for BTC, and the higher the BTC/FIAT rate will be. Bitcoin is an open, global, decentralized payment network, and its value comes from its widespread use. On the other hand, if the fee market becomes too expensive for most users, they would be free to use any altcoin they want.Vali Zero, a local Bitcoin trader and computer engineer, argues that the implementation of a functioning fee market is necessary to maintain equilibrium between demand and supply. He also emphasizes that a fee market will scare off spammers, gamblers, and people transacting very low amounts of Bitcoin, leaving only those who actually need it. In the absence of a functioning fee market, he will refuse to run Bitcoin code that increases the block size and will sell all his coins and leave if Bitcoin succumbs to the "free stuff army." Raystonn, a member of the Bitcoin community, agrees that a fee market is necessary but warns that it will bleed value from Bitcoin and give it to alternative blockchains if Bitcoin's blocks are at maximum capacity. He believes that anyone thinking the fee market can be restrained to Bitcoin alone is mistaken. Ultimately, the community believes that a fee market is necessary for the long-term success of Bitcoin, but it must be implemented in a way that balances the needs of users and maintains the widespread use of Bitcoin.</summary>
