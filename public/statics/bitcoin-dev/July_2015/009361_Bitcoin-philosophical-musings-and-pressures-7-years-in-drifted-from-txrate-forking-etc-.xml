    <summary>People often fail to understand the fundamental reasons behind the creation of Bitcoin and its various underlying principles. The complexity of the system is so far outside their thinking or life processes that figuring out how to code, adopt or act upon it becomes a challenge. This is made even more challenging by the long term needs and current values at stake.The purpose of creating a system where a Botswanan can give a few bits of their impoverished wages to their friend in Mumbai without being gated, permitted, hierarchied, middlemanned, taxed, tracked, stolen and feed-upon until pointless is beyond the comprehension of some individuals who are used to centralization, profit, control, and oppression. Thus, they see txrate ramming up against an artificial wall as perfectly fine, since it enables and perpetuates their legacy ways.Regardless of how the various walls are broken down technically, the most important thing is that they are. Those who think outside the box must take time to school these legacy people so that they might someday become enlightened and join the ethos. Otherwise, working for ICBC, JPMC, HSBC, BNP, MUFG, and your favorite government may be an option, but probably not as much fun.</summary>
