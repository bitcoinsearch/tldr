    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposed implementation of a consensus change to allow confirmed transactions to use less space in blocks. The change could be rolled out as a hard fork. A cultural analogy, the "Txid Hokey Pokey," was used to explain the technical process, but some found it confusing and requested a more neutral explanation. The proposed protocol changes need further documentation, but some suggest that it might not require a soft fork. There is uncertainty about how the "compact tx" would produce a different hash than the non-compact one.</summary>
