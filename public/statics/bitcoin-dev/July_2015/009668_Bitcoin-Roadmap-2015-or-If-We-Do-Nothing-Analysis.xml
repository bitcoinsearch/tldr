    <summary>The author of the given context is making a claim that companies like blockchain.info and Coinbase, who are supposed to support the network with large blocks, are not running even a single node to sanity check against. Instead, they rely on their security and do not bother checking for proper consensus. The author points out that these companies only run BitcoinJ and blindly follow invalid chains, which does not involve proper consensus checking. Moreover, the author mentions that a bad peer from 37.187.136.15, owned by blockchain.info, is connected to his nodes, which does not relay inventory but downloads everything. Additionally, the author states that the /pushtx interface of blockchain.info returns a mixture of noise and BitcoinJ error messages when submitted with an invalid transaction. Furthermore, the author questions if people will be able to trust such companies in the future if the load goes higher and highlights that even blockchain.info doesn't behave like a full node, showing invalid data during the BIP66 fork. The author concludes by saying that it is expected of such companies to run at least one node to ensure proper consensus, which can be achieved with a mere $5 VPS.</summary>
