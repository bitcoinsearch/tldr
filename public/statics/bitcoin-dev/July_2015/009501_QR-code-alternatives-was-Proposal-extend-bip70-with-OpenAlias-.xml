    <summary>The 2D-Doc is a French standard used to protect documents like address proofs and invoices. The technical specification of the standard can be found in the link provided. Every 2D-Doc includes an ECDSA signature inside a 2D barcode, and the key is that the barcode is a Datamatrix and not a QR code. A short summary of the protected document is encoded inside the barcode, followed by an ECDSA signature of the summary. The signature is done by an official government-approved 2D-Doc emitter. The 2D-Code contains a short reference to designate which emitter signed it, and you can look up the 2D-Doc TSL supplied by the French government to get all the X509 Certificates from every emitter you are interested in, in order to check the signature. While the 2D-Doc solves a different problem than Bitcoin+BIP70, it may be interesting to know about it as hundreds of thousands have been emitted successfully while solving one of the problems faced: embedding an ECDSA signature inside a 2D barcode.</summary>
