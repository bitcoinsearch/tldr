    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a core developer named 'Cipher' is accused of being part of the "1MB or bust" group that opposes increasing the block size limit. Cipher clarifies that he does not have enough data to support any particular proposal and invites others to collect data as well. He argues that Bitcoin will eventually hit the limit and that fees will likely rise, but this is not necessarily bad. He questions when a meaningful limit should be set and suggests waiting for more information. He denies opposing anything and says he's only asking questions and pointing out fallacies in arguments.</summary>
