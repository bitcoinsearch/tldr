    <summary>Mike has expressed his desire for Bitcoin Core to have a benevolent dictator like other free software projects. This statement is just pointing out the reality that decentralization is essentially a collection of centralized processes. Someone, somewhere has to make a decision for any change to occur. The first dictator for Bitcoin was Satoshi, who established consensus rules for his version of Bitcoin which people accepted. These rules did not appear by magic or some unexplained mechanism but were set due to decisions made by him and the code was updated accordingly.</summary>
