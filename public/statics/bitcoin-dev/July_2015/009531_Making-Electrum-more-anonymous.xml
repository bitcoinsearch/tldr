    <summary>In a conversation between two individuals, the idea of combining all the addresses into a single bloom filter and sending it to the server as a solution to privacy concerns in Bitcoin transactions was discussed. However, it was noted that this is already implemented in the current Bitcoin protocol but requires a clever client to fool even advanced observers. Creating such a client would require a significant amount of programming work to achieve the ultimate solution and maximize privacy while allocating a desired quantity of bandwidth.</summary>
