    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave Scotese pointed out that he could not find any post from 2015 about roadmap in the subject line. He suggested it would be helpful to have a skeleton roadmap to guide new members of the list. Russ, another member, clarified the terminology used and explained that a roadmap is a plan of proposed changes to meet a goal, while a baseline is an analysis of what happens if nothing is done. These are two different documents, each with its purpose.</summary>
