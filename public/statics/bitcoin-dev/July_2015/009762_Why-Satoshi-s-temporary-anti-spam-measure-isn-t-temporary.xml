    <summary>The email thread from July 2015 between Gregory Maxwell and Satoshi Nakamoto is being discussed by two people who are arguing and sharing links to past conversations. However, it's important to double-check memory fits the facts when discussing content publicly. A quote from Maxwell mentioning smart contracts being used to create trustless trade with off-chain systems, as well as using all the space needed without worrying about paying fees for expensive space in Bitcoin's chain, is brought up. The discussion leads to the idea that a full domain-registry database on the blockchain wouldn't fit with Bitcoin, and Satoshi argued against piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset. The argument is against sharing blockchain space with tons of global databases and that limiting the size of the chain wouldn't protect decentralization. The whole email thread should be re-read to gain a better understanding of the discussion.</summary>
