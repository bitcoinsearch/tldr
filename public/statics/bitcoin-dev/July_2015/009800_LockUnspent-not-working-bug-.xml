    <summary>On a Bitcoin development mailing list, Ian Treibick reported an issue with the 'lockunspent' command on OS X with Satoshi 0.11.0. He mentioned that the TXID and vout belong to the wallet and that he was able to spend it even after locking it with the command. In his post, he included the command he used to lock the unspent transaction output (UTXO) and the subsequent 'listlockunspent' output, which showed no locked UTXOs. Ian asked whether this was the right place to post about the issue or if he should open an issue on GitHub.</summary>
