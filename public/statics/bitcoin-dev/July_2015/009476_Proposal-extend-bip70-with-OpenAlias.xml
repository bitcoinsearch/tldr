    <summary>The conversation involves discussing the speed and efficiency of using Tor directory caches for Bitcoin transactions. While it may be slow with cold caches, warm caches are surprisingly fast enough to be usable. The bitcoinj project has been working on ways to make things faster, such as refreshing the cache in the background or implementing directory differentials. For Electrum, the default policy is suggested to be DNSCrypt, followed by OpenAlias API pool for DNSSEC verification, and then the default resolver as a fallback option. However, the decision should ultimately allow for maximum freedom for wallet developers who may have different preferences.</summary>
