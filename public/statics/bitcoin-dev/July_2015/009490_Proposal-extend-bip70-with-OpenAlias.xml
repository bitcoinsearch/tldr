    <summary>In a communication from July 20th, 2015, Mike Hearn suggests that the proof should not be included in the payment request, as it is unnecessary for the payer to verify. He argues that DNSSEC's value lies in its ability to provide easy and canonical access to the proof. In response, a participant notes that while the final signature is still necessary, it can be an EC signature. The DNSSEC proof is used to confirm that the public key matches the alias. Payment requests referenced in this conversation include the pki_type "dnssec+btc" and pki_data, which uses the user's alias (DNS key).</summary>
