    <summary>In this message, the sender is reporting an issue with Satoshi 0.11.0 on OS X. They are unsure if they have posted in the right place and ask if it would be better to open an issue on GitHub. The sender reports that the TXID and vout belong to the wallet and provides a command for locking it. After running the lockunspent command, the output shows 'true' but when running listlockunspent, there is nothing listed. Despite this, the sender is still able to spend the locked TX from the wallet. No other information is provided.</summary>
