    <summary>In an email exchange from July 14th, 2015, Milly Bitcoin and another person discuss the issue of email account hacks leading to the possibility of someone else obtaining a certificate in the victim's name. The other person suggests using DNSSEC to sign the zones so that only the domain owner can issue certificates for a zone or corresponding email address. This would result in only one certificate authority (CA) per domain, which is what the other person desires to achieve. The previously mentioned concern about email certs is not currently operating under this scenario.</summary>
