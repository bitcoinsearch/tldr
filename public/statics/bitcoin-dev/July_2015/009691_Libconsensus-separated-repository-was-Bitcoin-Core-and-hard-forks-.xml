    <summary>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list reveals the need for a separate repository for libconsensus to ensure alternative implementations can be consensus-safe. However, there is a risk of code incompatibility with previous versions, resulting in fork risk. The move of consensus code to the consensus folder is long-awaited and important, but code review capacity is still a bottleneck. Feedback from alternative implementations like libbitcoin is valuable in finishing the API, which should expose more things than VerifyScript, including VerifyTx, VerifyHeader, and VerifyBlock. If the rest is done, moving libconsensus to a separate repository as a subtree/subrepository of Bitcoin Core would be easy. While Cory Fields, Wladimir, and Pieter Wuille have reviewed many of these changes, the lack of review remains a concern.</summary>
