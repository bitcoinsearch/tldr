    <summary>There are discussions regarding getting miner's confirmation on uncontroversial hardforks and whether to use nHeight, nMedianTime or just use nTime. A BIP number is requested to help concentrate the discussions about deployment of uncontroversial hardforks to a single place. One proposal for a timewarp fix is to require that all blocks are within 1 day of the median of the previous 11 blocks, which would add a condition at the other end. Another proposal suggests that the two blocks in question have to have the same timestamp, which would force the off by 1 and the correct value to give the same result. It is suggested that fixing the issue "right" would require a hard fork, especially if it is only to show a non-controversial hard fork.</summary>
