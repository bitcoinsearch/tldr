    <summary>A mechanism that allows Quality of Service guarantees and shifts the complexity and risk from individual miners to a separate third-party service can be achieved by bidding on behalf of miners. By using timelocked contracts, these guarantees can be enforced. Negotiating with miners via smart contracts directly seems difficult given that mining is a random process, and providing guarantees without a majority of hashing power is not possible. A size cap would also interfere with such a QoS scheme as miners would not be able to deliver guarantees if they have to start excluding transactions.</summary>
