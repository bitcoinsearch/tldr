    <summary>In an email thread, Peter Todd expressed his concern about Blockcypher's business model and claimed that the company performs a Sybil attack on the network. He argued that for Blockcypher to effectively perform its function of connecting to a large percentage of nodes on the network, it would consume connection slots for the entire network. This approach could be detrimental and less reliable in the long run if other services adopt it too. However, someone countered Toddâ€™s claim by suggesting that he had no evidence to back up his assertion. They suggested that Todd should not make claims if he was not sure about them because many people trusted him. The person also clarified that they did not work for Blockcypher nor have any investment in the company.</summary>
