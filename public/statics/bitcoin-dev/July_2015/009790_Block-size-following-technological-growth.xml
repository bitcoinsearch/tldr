    <summary>A thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed the need to move the median time discussion to a new thread as it was filling up the existing one. Jorge Timón expressed excitement over Venzen Khaosan's contribution to the code and stated that he was not currently running any nodes at any size. He further clarified that it was a regtest-like testnet, which allowed for cheap mining and simulations but also meant that anyone could create reorgs. The environment was expected to be used in a controlled manner where node creation of new blocks and timing were controlled.</summary>
