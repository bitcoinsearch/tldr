    <summary>In a message sent to the Bitcoin developer mailing list in 2015, Dave Scotese noted that the protocol as it stands will soon require more computing power than common machines can provide, rendering them unable to run full nodes and contribute to the ecosystem. Despite companies having an incentive to protect their wallets by running their own Bitcoin Core node, even major firms with $30 million of funding do not appear to do so. This goes against the general concept that companies would want to run their own node for protection.</summary>
