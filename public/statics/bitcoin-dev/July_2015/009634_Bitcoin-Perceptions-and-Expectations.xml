    <summary>Recently, there has been a pull request made to remove certain phrases from bitcoin.org. The phrases in question are "zero or low fees", "fast international payments", and "instant peer-to-peer transactions". This change may cause concern for non-technical users who are not familiar with the source code of Bitcoin. Some individuals have expressed that this change goes against the social contract of what Bitcoin is ultimately intended to be. A discussion around this topic has already started on Reddit. It remains to be seen whether this change will be implemented and what impact it will have on the perception of Bitcoin among users.</summary>
