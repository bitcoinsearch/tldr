    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jean-Paul Kogelman has suggested that a minimum specification (min-spec) be defined for Bitcoin Core. Setting a min-spec would make it easier to determine how changes may impact budgets and reduce the risk of capacity problems. Jeremy Rubin suggests that if a min-spec is developed, targeting open hardware is more important than performance metrics for the long-term health of Bitcoin, however performance is still important. Rubin proposes that the min-spec target RISC-V Rocket architecture running on FPGA as a reference point for performance, as this could help avoid locking people into using large-vendor chipsets with unknown or known bad security properties such as Intel AMT. Owen Gunden states that he too runs a full node and likes the idea, and that Gavin Andresen has done some back-of-the-envelope calculations around this stuff, but nothing so clearly defined as what Kogelman proposed.</summary>
