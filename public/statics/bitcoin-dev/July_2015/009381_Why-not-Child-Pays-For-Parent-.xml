    <summary>In an email exchange on the topic of Child Pays For Parent (CPFP), Jeff Garzik points out that sending out a new transaction with added fee does not guarantee that nodes suddenly have the first transaction, which they may have ignored or dropped before. Justus Ranvier counters with the fact that CPFP is initiated by the recipient of the parent transaction. If the child reaches a CPFP miner, then presumably the parents made it as well. Both of the transactions can be mined at the same time. Ranvier also includes links to his Open Bitcoin Privacy Project and his contact information.</summary>
