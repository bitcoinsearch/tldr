    <summary>Jeremy Rubin proposed a way to increase the number of transactions per block by repurposing a NOP in a soft fork instead of re-enabling OP_LEFT. The new opcode, OP_LEFTEQUALVERIFY, would check if the leftmost L bytes of A and B match, failing immediately if they do not or if either array is less than L bytes or if there are fewer than 3 values on the stack. A new BIP would be needed to update clients to support the new address system, but this change would only offer a once-off improvement in efficiency, making it less likely to be worth the effort. Another option for adding new opcodes is to use a different script engine like with P2SH.</summary>
