    <summary>Blockchain validation has become too expensive to properly secure the network as per the original security model. The level of validation required to comply with the security model has become completely impractical for most use cases. The only practical way for the network to function at present is by introducing trust, in validators, miners, relayers, explorer websites, online wallets, etc. This is horrible because the entire security model has gone out the window and has been replaced with something that isn't specified at all. We don't really know the boundaries of our model, as the fork a couple of days ago demonstrated. We need to either solve the validation cost/bottleneck issue or construct a new security model that takes these trust assumptions into account.</summary>
