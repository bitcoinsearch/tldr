    <summary>Bitcoin payment notification services via SMS are available for cashiers with dumb-phones or smartphones without Bitcoin apps, allowing them to receive payment notifications without an app or internet access. Independent services offer this feature, and the dynamic rate provider is expected to offer it as well. However, one concern raised is how cashiers can verify successful payment if both they and the customer need to scan a new QR code. This proposal may not be effective in making in-person Bitcoin purchases easier.</summary>
