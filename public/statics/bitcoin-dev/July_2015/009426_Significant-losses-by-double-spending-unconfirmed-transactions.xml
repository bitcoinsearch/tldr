    <summary>On July 15, 2015, a discussion took place in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding Blockcypher's "confidence factor" model. The model was described as another of those sybil attacking network monitoring things. One member, Peter, was noted to have shared negative opinions about Blockcypher and their business model on Twitter. Another member asked for evidence that they perform any form of Sybil attack on the network, to which it was clarified that Blockcypher only monitors for such an attack and does not cause it.</summary>
