They acknowledge that fees are useful against DoS and increasing the cost of attack, but they argue that continuing an artificially-low fee policy is unsustainable and constitutes a moral hazard. The author urges those who want to develop a fee market to consider it from the user's point of view, taking into account how software is written, user behavior, market disruption, and further block size increases.
