    <summary>The context discusses a process that includes a list of metrics, risk analysis of the baseline system (Bitcoin as it is now), mitigation strategies for each risk, a set of goals, and a road map for each goal to achieve changes or possible avenues. Proposed changes will be measured against the same metrics and a risk analysis to compare with the baseline. For instance, the block size debate would be discussed in the context of a road map related to the goal of increasing scaling. One of the metrics would be a decentralization metric, which includes cost as one aspect. In an email from 7/30/2015, Eric Lombrozo responds to Gavinâ€™s question about the reasonable cost to run a full node by stating that some risks are difficult to quantify. However, the bigger concern is fixing serious issues with the protocol before raising the block size limit or even removing it. Lombrozo notes that these issues continue to be ignored by most of the community, including some core developers, suggesting a difference in priorities.</summary>
