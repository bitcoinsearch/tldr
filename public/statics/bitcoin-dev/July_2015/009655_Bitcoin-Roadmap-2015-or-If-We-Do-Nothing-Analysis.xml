    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in July 2015, it was noted that even large companies with $30 million USD of funding did not run a single Bitcoin Core node that is open to incoming connections.

It was suggested that these companies likely still have nodes, but they are not accessible externally.</summary>
