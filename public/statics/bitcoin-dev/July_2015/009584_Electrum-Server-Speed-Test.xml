    <summary>The conversation in this context revolves around the Electrum server software and its ability to handle loads. The server produces external index to allow SPV clients to quickly retrieve their history. The logs produced by the electrum-server console indicate that it takes approximately 3.7 minutes per megabyte of block to process into the index on a modest-high end dedicated server. Continuing this trend with the current inter-block time of 9.8 minutes, an electrum-server instance running on such a server is able to support up to 2.64 MB block sizes before permanently falling behind the chain. The debate arises whether this data should be used to limit the block size or improve Electrum Server's database performance. One participant suggests that there are performance improvements to be made and would rather do that work than limit the block size.</summary>
