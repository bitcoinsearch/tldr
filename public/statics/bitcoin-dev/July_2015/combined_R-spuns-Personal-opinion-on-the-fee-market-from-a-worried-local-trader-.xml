    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list recently suggested that the concept of a "fee market" in Bitcoin is not binary, but exists in varying degrees over time. Currently, the fee per transaction makes up less than 0.5% of rewards paid for mining a full block, providing weak market signals for miners. The aim is to drive the use of Bitcoin as widely and cheaply as possible, cementing its network effects for future users. To illustrate this point, an analogy was made with email adoption and the impact of per-message fees and hourly sending limits on usage. Miners do not get paid by fees and will not need to be for decades to come, so asking them to include transactions for free is not asking them to give away money. The author believes that fees are necessary to keep the network decentralized and avoiding them only accelerates centralization.</summary>
