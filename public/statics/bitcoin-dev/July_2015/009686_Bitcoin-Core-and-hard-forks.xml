    <summary>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, received a warning from Alice Larson about his Twitter activity on July 27, 2015. She expressed her disdain for his "teenage nonsense" and linked to his account with a trigger warning. Todd responded with gratitude for the warning, stating that he may have suffered from seizures without it. The email exchange was attached with a digital signature in the form of an OpenPGP signature.asc file.</summary>
