    <summary>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Timón expressed his frustration with the amount of drama and negativity surrounding Mike Hearn. Timón shared a link to "Let me Google that for you" search results for "Mike Hearn dictator." The email was sent on July 23, 2015 at 10:30 AM. Russ responded to the email, stating that all the drama was getting ridiculous and implying that Timón spent too much time on Reddit.</summary>
