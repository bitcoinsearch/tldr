    <summary>On July 21, 2015, Peter Todd via bitcoin-dev wrote an email discussing the allocation of BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) numbers. The policy was to allocate them for "stupid ideas" to avoid being gatekeepers. However, this made it difficult for people who knew what they were doing to get a BIP number because Gregory Maxwell would argue against them in private and delay allocating a number if he thought they should know better. One month prior, Kalle had requested a BIP number for his PoP (Proof of Payment) standardization proposal. It is unclear from the context whether Kalle's request was denied due to Gregory Maxwell's opposition or not.</summary>
