    <summary>The conversation in this context revolves around Netki, a company working on DNSSEC integration with BIP70. Mike Hearn suggests teaming up with them and asks for their opinion on OpenAlias, an open standard. Justin from Netki responds that they are a company providing a service based on an open standard they propose. They have created Open Source Wallet Name resolvers that look up against the standard record formats and not directly against their servers. They have an open lookup standard based on both the namecoin blockchain as well as traditional DNSSEC. They offer to register or host names on behalf of customers but if the format is followed and hosted themselves, everything will work just fine. The similarities between OpenAlias and their standard are that they both use DNSSEC and have the option of storing the address directly in the DNS record. Differences include not using DNSCrypt, the option of storing a URL rather than just a wallet address in the TXT record and the use of a 2-tier lookup format. Netki mandates DNSSEC while OpenAlias makes it optional. Justin expresses interest in merging standards with OpenAlias going forward and mentions Verisign's delivery of a standard to the IETF using DNSSEC to pass payment information.</summary>
