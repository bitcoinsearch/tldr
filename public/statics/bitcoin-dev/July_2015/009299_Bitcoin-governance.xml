    <summary>In an email dated July 1st, 2015, Jeffrey Paul requested that discussions on a certain list be limited to the research and development of Bitcoin Core. He argued that if this was not the purpose of the list, then it was misleadingly named. Paul suggested that if Bitcoin Core development is to be considered independent from development of Bitcoin protocol, then it needs its own separate list. The email included two non-text attachments, one being a pgp-key and the other being a digital signature.</summary>
