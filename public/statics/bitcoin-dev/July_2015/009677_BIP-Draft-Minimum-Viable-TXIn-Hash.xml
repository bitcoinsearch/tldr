    <summary>On July 23, 2015, Jeremy Rubin proposed a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that could reduce the number of bytes needed per transaction. The BIP was intended to be a soft fork and had the potential to decrease transaction sizes by around 12% for standard "one in two out" transactions and even more for those with multiple input hashes. The proposal can be found on Github. Luke suggested that the suggested protocol changes would need to be documented more specifically, but noted that this appears to be a peer-to-peer protocol optimization that does not require a soft fork.</summary>
