    <summary>In an email exchange on July 22nd, 2015, Sriram Karra and Peter Todd discussed a proposal made by Jeff Garzik to Bitcoin's development community. Todd believed that Garzik was proposing a bad patch in order to motivate others to write better solutions. However, Karra questioned the logic of preventing better solutions from emerging by not addressing the issue publicly. The email exchange ends with Todd retracting his previous statement.</summary>
