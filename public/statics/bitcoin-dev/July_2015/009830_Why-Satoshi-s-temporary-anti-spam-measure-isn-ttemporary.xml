    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in July 2015, Gavin Andresen challenged the idea that any decentralized system is going to have high transaction costs and scarcity. He was specifically responding to an argument that suggested the bitcoin system could be replaced by a decentralized system that provides the same benefits as bitcoin but with lower or zero transaction fees. Andresen argued that physical limitations would force decentralized systems to look certain ways, which could explain why there were "$10 fees" in the original scenario. Bryan Bishop, who started the thread, replied but did not seem to share this context. The discussion also touched on internet architecture and the need for better architecture.</summary>
