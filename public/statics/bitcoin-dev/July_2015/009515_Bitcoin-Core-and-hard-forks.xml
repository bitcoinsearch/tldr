    <summary>In a recent post on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Pieter Wuille, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, shared his views on the relationship between the Bitcoin Core project and the consensus rules of Bitcoin. Wuille believes that it is the responsibility of the maintainers/developers of Bitcoin Core to create software that helps guarantee the security and operation of the Bitcoin network, including participating in discussions about consensus changes but not the responsibility to decide on them. The community should choose whether or not to run any code changes. Wuille also expressed his opinion that we should let a fee market develop sooner rather than later and that "kicking the can down the road" is an incredibly dangerous precedent. However, he acknowledged that he is not in any position to force this view and only hopes that people don't think a fear of economic change is a reason to give up consensus. Additionally, he stated that if Bitcoin requires central control over its rules by a group of developers, it is completely uninteresting to him. Consensus changes should be done using consensus, and the default in case of controversy is no change. According to Wuille, change in economics is always happening, and should be expected.</summary>
