    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, it was suggested that using an arbitrary BIP number could cause confusion when that BIP number is actually assigned later. David Barnes of Bitcoin Co. Ltd. had picked up the next available number for his proposed file, but stated that the number was unimportant to the proposal and could be changed to anything. Micha Bailey questioned whether Greg had assigned the number, as using arbitrary numbers was not recommended, especially if they were close or similar to those already assigned. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is hosted by the Linux Foundation and is used for technical discussions related to the development of the Bitcoin software.</summary>
