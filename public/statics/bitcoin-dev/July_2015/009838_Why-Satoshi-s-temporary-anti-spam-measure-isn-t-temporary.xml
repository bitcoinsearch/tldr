    <summary>Eric Lombrozo expressed his doubts about increasing block size in a safe manner, stating that he is not alone with this sentiment. He believes that if the known issues that complicate bigger blocks had been addressed in the last six years, or even in the last three years, then the network might be ready to increase the limit. However, priorities have been focused on other things such as specifying the use of X.509 overlay protocols or adding complex filtering mechanisms. Thomas Zander responded to Eric's statement, saying that having different priorities is fine, but using one's time to block attempts to increase block size shows conflicting priorities.</summary>
