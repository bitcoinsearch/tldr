    <summary>On July 4th, 2015, Raystonn requested analysis on why a larger hashrate was violating BIP66, which appeared to cause a rejection of the BIP by the network, potentially accidentally. It was noted that a near majority of the hashrate on the network seemed to be SPV mining. A non-upgraded miner named Btcnuggets produced an invalid block after the lock-in, and f2pool and antpool had been extending it. However, their extension contained no transactions due to SPV mining. It was acknowledged that a complete understanding of the situation would take some time, but this general failure mode was one that was already known and part of the reason why the threshold was set so high.</summary>
