    <summary>On July 20th, 2015, Gavin Andresen suggested that the maximum size of a transaction included in a block should be limited to mitigate potential CPU exhaustion denial-of-service attacks. However, one member of the bitcoin-dev group argued that this approach was too indirect, as it only watched for transaction size and ignored potential N^2 costs related to repeated hashing in checksig. This approach could force future applications involving larger signatures to undergo another hard fork or use a kludgy soft fork that splits data across two "transactions." As an alternative, the member suggested a more direct approach, which would be less limiting.</summary>
