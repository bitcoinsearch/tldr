    <summary>The conversation in this context revolves around the issue of block time variance and its impact on transaction confirmation. The writer suggests that relying on guessing whether or not a transaction will end up in a block is unreliable, and proposes an alternative approach to improve the process. He goes on to explain how a size cap would interfere with this Quality of Service (QoS) scheme, as miners would not be able to deliver guarantees if they have to start excluding transactions. However, another contributor to the conversation responds by stating that since mining is a random, Poisson process, giving guarantees without a majority of hashing power isn't possible. The message ends with a PGP signature for authenticity.</summary>
