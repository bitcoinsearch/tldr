    <summary>In an email conversation on April 7th, 2015, Tier Nolan discussed the importance of ensuring that proofs for each step are provable in order to verify a block's validity. Justus Ranvier responded with a Github link to a discussion about the tractability of the problem with the assumption of SPV clients being able to perform validity checks without any state outside a single transaction or block. Ranvier also provided his contact information and digital signature. Ranvier is associated with the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project.</summary>
