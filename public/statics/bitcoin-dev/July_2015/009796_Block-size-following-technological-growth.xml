    <summary>On July 30th, 2015, Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev shared a proposal for long-term scalability that he had been working on. The proposal can be found on Github and includes ideas such as a testnet that runs ahead of the main chain and Gavin's more accurate sigop checking after the hard fork. Wuille asked for comments on his proposal.Thomas Zander responded to the proposal, saying that no hard forking change that relaxes the block size limit can be guaranteed to provide enough space for every possible demand or even any particular demand unless strong centralization of the mining ecosystem is expected.</summary>
