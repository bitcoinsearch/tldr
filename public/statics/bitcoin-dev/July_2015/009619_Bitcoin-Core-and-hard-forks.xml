    <summary>In an email conversation from July 2015, Jean-Paul Kogelman argues that a fair fee market for Bitcoin can only be achieved if miners start offering quality of service (QoS) at multiple tiers. He suggests that interference from a block size cap will be detrimental to this development and will only serve to highlight its purpose of preventing monster blocks. However, there is confusion over what QoS means in the context of Bitcoin transactions, as either a transaction is included or it isn't and there are no upgrades available.</summary>
