    <summary>Pieter, a member of the Bitcoin community, has shared a proposal for long-term scalability that he has been working on. The proposal can be found on Github and includes certain elements such as a testnet with a larger size than the main chain and Gavin's more accurate sigop checking post hard fork. However, some aspects are still missing. Pieter has requested comments from the community on his proposal.</summary>
