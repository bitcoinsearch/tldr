    <summary>The discussion between bitcoin developers continues regarding the implementation of a fee market and the potential consequences for the future of Bitcoin. Some argue that as Bitcoin gains more mainstream adoption, demand for BTC will increase, leading to higher fees based on the supply and demand equilibrium created by the fee market. However, others point out that this could lead to users being priced out and seeking alternative cryptocurrencies with lower fees, ultimately bleeding value from Bitcoin. Despite this, some argue that a functioning fee market is necessary to maintain the integrity and sustainability of the network. The debate centers around finding a balance between accessibility and scalability while maintaining the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
