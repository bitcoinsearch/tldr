    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in 2015, Mark Friedenbach suggested that it is possible for bitcoin to scale through distribution with minimal trust. This could be achieved through probabilistic validation and distribution of fraud proofs.

The original email concluded with a request from Mark Friedenbach to make this happen with full support.</summary>
