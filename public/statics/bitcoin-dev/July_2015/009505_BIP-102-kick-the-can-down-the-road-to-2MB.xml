    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, criticized Jeff Garzik's BIP102 proposal, which aims to increase the block size limit to 2MB. Todd argued that the proposal is "extremely poorly designed" and suggested that Garzik may be either trolling or incompetent. In response, Jeremy Rubin, another Bitcoin developer, suggested that Todd's criticism was too harsh and that Garzik may be proposing the change to spur discussion. However, Todd maintained his stance that Garzik should leave the discussion if he did not understand the issue and that his proposal was a bad patch. Todd also revealed that allocating BIP numbers for stupid ideas is part of Bitcoin's policy to avoid gatekeeping.</summary>
