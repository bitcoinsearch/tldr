    <summary>The Electrum server can be optimized by making the utxo database (patricia tree) a binary tree and by writing the server in a faster language than Python. However, the short-term performance of the server is not a concern as it takes an average of 15 seconds to process a block on the Hetzner EX40 box used for testing. The server relies on fully indexed Bitcoin Core daemon and produces an external index to enable SPV clients to retrieve their history quickly. The electrum-server console logs produced by the Xeon with lots of memory and a 7200 RPM RAID show that it takes approximately 3.7 minutes per megabyte of block to process into the index. The current inter-block time of 9.8 minutes suggests that an electrum-server instance running on a modest-high end dedicated server can support up to 2.64 MB block sizes before permanently falling behind the chain.</summary>
