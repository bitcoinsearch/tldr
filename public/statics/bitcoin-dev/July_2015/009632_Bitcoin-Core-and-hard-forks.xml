    <summary>The discussion revolves around the possibility of including fee tiers in coinbase and how it is open to manipulation with little recourse. The idea of trying out a solution that is simple and involves the least number of parties necessary is preferred. One suggestion is to have miners set their own tiers while users select the level of quality they want, ignoring block size. Miners will adapt their tiers depending on how many transactions end up in them. If a tier is popular, they can choose to increase the cost of that tier accordingly. While some suggest using third parties separate from individual miners to do bidding on behalf of users, others argue that negotiating directly with miners via smart contracts seems difficult. It is suggested that an implicit QoS is far simpler to implement, requires less parties, and is closer to Bitcoin's original purpose as a peer-to-peer digital cash system. In response to the concern of a size cap interfering with such a QoS scheme, it is argued that giving guarantees without a majority of hashing power isn't possible since mining is a random, Poisson process. Overall, the discussion centers around finding a solution that balances simplicity, fairness, and practicality for both miners and users.</summary>
