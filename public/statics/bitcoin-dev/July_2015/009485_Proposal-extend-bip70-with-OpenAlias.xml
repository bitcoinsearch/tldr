    <summary>Justin Newton raised concerns about making Namecoin part of the standardization of DNS records holding Bitcoin addresses. He argued that .bit records cannot be easily verified by lightweight/spv wallets, as they would need a copy of the Namecoin blockchain. However, the idea was initially proposed to provide a censorship-resistant option and allow individuals to register their own names at a low cost. It also enables local network lookups. The decision requires discussion before anything is decided for sure since mobile wallets' trade-off was not properly considered. A common goal should be to standardize DNS records holding Bitcoin addresses for Netki and Electrum. While Justin Newton and Riccardo may find other types of lookups useful, such as Namecoin, it should not slow down or stall the current standardization effort. Making Namecoin part of the standard is not an option for lightweight wallets. The focus should be on working on what is common.</summary>
