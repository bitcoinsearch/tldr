    <summary>On July 23, 2015, Jean-Paul Kogelman raised concerns about how a size cap would interfere with a Quality of Service (QoS) scheme. He mentioned that miners would not be able to deliver guarantees if they have to start excluding transactions. However, he also acknowledged that mining is a random poisson process and giving guarantees without a majority of hashing power is not possible. The message was signed using PGP with SHA256 hash.</summary>
