    <summary>In an email conversation, Tier Nolan stated that the block and transaction sizes are no longer linked together. This change means that both sizes can be adjusted independently, allowing for greater flexibility in the Bitcoin network. The email was sent on July 17, 2015, and the context suggests that this change had already taken place at that time. While it is not clear what prompted this change, it is significant for those who work with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It also demonstrates the ongoing evolution of these technologies as developers seek to improve their functionality and usability.</summary>
