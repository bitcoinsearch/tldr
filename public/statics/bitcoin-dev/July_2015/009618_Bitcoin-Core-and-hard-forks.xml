    <summary>The issue of developing a fair fee market for Bitcoin is being discussed among members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One suggestion is that a more fair fee market will develop if miners start offering quality of service, preferably at multiple tiers. Additionally, it is suggested that adding better QoS tools for miners and extending the block size cap (when possible) can create a better fee market. Some members are concerned that increasing the block size at this time will exacerbate security concerns around nodes relying on other nodes to validate, particularly miners and wallets. Furthermore, they argue that allowing the fee market to evolve first will provide a better sense for fee economics and allow for better approaches to block size changes in the future. However, others believe that those who claim that fee pressure will scare away users and break the industry are underestimating human ingenuity in the face of a challenge.</summary>
