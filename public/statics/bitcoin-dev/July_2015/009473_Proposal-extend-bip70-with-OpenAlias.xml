    <summary>In the context provided, it is mentioned that DNS lookups can be done via Tor, which provides more than 1000 proxies compared to the limited number of proxies available otherwise. BitcoinJ has already integrated this feature into its code. It is suggested that proxying of DNS requests should be an optional part of the protocol, allowing wallet developers to compete on issues such as privacy and robustness.</summary>
