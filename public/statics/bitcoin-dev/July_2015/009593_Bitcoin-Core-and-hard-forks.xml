    <summary>In 2015, a debate was ongoing within the Bitcoin development community regarding how to scale the supporting information propagation system. Gavin Andresen, one of the core developers, expressed his desire to focus on planning for success and scaling up rather than limiting the capacity of the primary time-stamping machine. He suggested that the merkle root had effectively infinite capacity and that the community should be asking how to scale appropriately instead of when to limit capacity. Meanwhile, another camp of developers was firmly stuck in the “1Mb or bust” group, while others were working on projects like the lightning network which offered great scalability. Despite differing opinions, Andresen hoped to work together with those who had a “let’s get it done” attitude and focus on scaling up.</summary>
