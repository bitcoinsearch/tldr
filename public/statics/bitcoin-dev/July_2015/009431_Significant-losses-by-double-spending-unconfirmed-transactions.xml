    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille responded to a query about whether he had spoken to companies such as Blockcypher who run multiple full nodes and whether they help make the network stronger. Wuille argued that running normal full nodes only provides extra service to nodes synchronizing and lightweight clients but does not reduce the trust participants need to have in each other. He added that running many nodes doesn't necessarily help the network, saying it's much better to run and control one or a few full nodes which you actually use to validate your transactions than to run thousands of nodes in third-party data centers, which only appears more decentralised. Another participant in the discussion disagreed with Wuille, arguing that running different clients (if Blockcypher runs non-reference-bitcoinD client) makes the network less open to widespread bugs.</summary>
