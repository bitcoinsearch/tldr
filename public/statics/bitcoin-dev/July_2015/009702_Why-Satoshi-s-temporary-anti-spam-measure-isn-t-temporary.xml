    <summary>On July 28, 2015, Jean-Paul Kogelman suggested implementing a one megabyte block size limit as an anti-spam measure. However, it was pointed out that the block size limit was intended to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks rather than spam. It was not meant to have any economic impact on spam or future fee markets. The terms spam and DoS were used somewhat synonymously, but DoS is a more accurate term.</summary>
