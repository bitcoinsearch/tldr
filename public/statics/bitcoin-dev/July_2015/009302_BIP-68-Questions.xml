    <summary>The code in BIP 68 compares the input's nSequence against the transaction's nLockTime. If the transaction spending the output of another transaction is already in the blockchain, there is no need for a relative locktime since the time of the previous transaction is known. However, if the transaction is not yet in the blockchain, it cannot be created because the value to set nLockTime to is unknown. Rusty asks how this was supposed to work.</summary>
