    <summary>In an email conversation on July 30, 2015, Gavin raised concerns about the difficulty of having a rational conversation about the reasonable cost to run a full node due to the lack of response. Eric responded by stating that some risks are hard to quantify and that fixing serious issues with the protocol may be necessary before safely raising the block size limit. He claimed that these issues, which have been ignored by most of the community and even some core developers, indicate a difference in priorities rather than a disagreement on whether to raise the block size limit.</summary>
