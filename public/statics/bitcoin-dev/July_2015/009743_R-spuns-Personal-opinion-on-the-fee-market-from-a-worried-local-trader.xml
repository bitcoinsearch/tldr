    <summary>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ryan Butler questioned whether an unlimited blocksize would imply a lack of fee market. Adam Back responded, stating that the assumption is that it wouldn't work because any miner can break ranks and do so profitably. He argues that expecting otherwise is to expect oligopoly behavior which goes against the decentralization of a mining system. Back suggests that free transactions are processed today because policies vary, ensuring many types of transactions get processed. He also notes that as transaction fees start to constitute the majority of income, the idea of having a greater block size limit becomes more important. Back concludes by stating that if a miner can mine low transaction fees at a profit, they deserve to have their spot as it's just competition amongst miners and a good thing overall.</summary>
