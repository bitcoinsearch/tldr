    <summary>Despite having a huge funding of $30M USD, even big companies do not run a single Bitcoin Core node. This is not related to block sizes but rather the fact that Core does not provide the services that businesses actually need. The argument that the decrease in node count is due to block sizes is only speculation and not based on facts. The presence of many large companies who can afford it but choose not to run nodes should be a warning sign for the industry.</summary>
