    <summary>Bitcoin is a trustlessly decentralized system. However, every participant needs to validate the entire chain in order to be certain that their copy of the ledger state is correct, and miners need to validate blocks in short timeframes. It is possible for bitcoin to scale via distribution in a way that introduces minimal trust, but changes to bitcoin consensus rules are required. Right now, parallel distribution and decentralization are at odds with each other. Developers were initially skeptical of multi-core CPUs, but now there are frameworks to make it easy. Similarly, libraries or approaches that do distributed will be useful for decentralized systems.</summary>
