    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Lombrozo expressed doubts about the safety of increasing the block size limit given the present state of the Bitcoin network. Lombrozo believes that if the known issues with bigger blocks had been addressed in the past six years, or even in the last three years after many issues had been identified, then the network might be ready for larger blocks. However, other priorities such as adding complex filtering mechanisms to the p2p protocol and specifying the use of X.509 overlay protocols have taken precedence. Lombrozo admits that the filtering mechanisms are clever, but suggests that structures need to be put in place to prove the validity of returned datasets and for miners to actually validate information in order to offer some level of security. In response, Thomas Zander suggested that conflicting priorities were being displayed by those who were using their time to block attempts to increase the block size instead of trusting others to do things they care about while focusing on their own priorities.</summary>
