    <summary>A game developer has proposed the idea of defining a minimum specification (min spec) for Bitcoin Core, similar to what is done in game development. This would involve working backwards from current parameters such as network/disk I/O for block size, CPU for SigOps/block, and memory for UTXO size, in order to determine the bare minimum configuration needed to comfortably run Bitcoin Core at maximum load. The min spec could then be adjusted as new functionality is added or optimized, with any changes that positively affect the min spec being non-controversial. A benchmark test could also be developed to compare a user's setup to the min spec and estimate how long it could run on that setup. Ultimately, this approach could delay the need for miners/node operators to upgrade hardware by maximizing performance on existing machines.</summary>
