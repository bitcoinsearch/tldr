    <summary>According to Raystonn, there is a need for analysis to determine the cause of a violation of BIP66 by a larger hashrate. The network is currently rejecting this BIP, but it could be an accidental occurrence. The concern arises from the fact that such a large portion of the hashrate is forking, hence the need to understand how this happened. Additionally, measures need to be put in place to prevent such occurrences from happening again in the future.</summary>
