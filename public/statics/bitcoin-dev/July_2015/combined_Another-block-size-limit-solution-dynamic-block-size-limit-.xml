    <summary>In 2015, Максим Божко proposed the implementation of a dynamic block size limit for bitcoin. The proposal involves adjusting the block size based on recent block sizes, which would allow miners to chart the course of block sizes. However, this could lead to a reduction in the population of nodes able to keep up with the network due to the limited decentralization and more powerful equipment of miners.This idea has been discussed before, but it can be difficult to find these discussions due to the high traffic on the list. The full details of the proposal can be found in the Google document provided in the email. The proposal allows comments to be made on the proposal, giving stakeholders the opportunity to provide feedback and suggestions. The proposed dynamic block size limit could have significant implications for the Bitcoin network, including affecting the speed and cost of transactions. While some may argue that a dynamic block size limit could improve the efficiency and scalability of the network, others are concerned about the potential negative effects on decentralization and node participation. Overall, the proposal by Максим Божко regarding a dynamic block size limit for bitcoin is still being discussed and evaluated by stakeholders in the cryptocurrency community.</summary>
