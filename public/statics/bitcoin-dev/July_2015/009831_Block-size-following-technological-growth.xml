    <summary>In a message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Hearn asked how more users or nodes can bring more miners or improve mining decentralization in bitcoin. In response, an anonymous individual argues against the idea that a bigger ecosystem means more interest in taking part. They explain that just because Islam is the biggest religious ecosystem in the world, it does not mean everyone is burning to take part. Similarly, while the Yuan and Yen are the dominant currencies in large transaction settlements in Asia, people do not necessarily use them on the streets. The author goes on to argue that bitcoin is not suitable as a currency for pervasive dominance, and the ideal of pushing it into every heart and mind around the globe is no different from religious zealotry. They believe that bitcoin has its place in the world and it is only at the beginning of a gradual evolution. They provide an example of their neighbors who have not adopted the innovation of the light bulb and still use candles for light and gas for cooking. The author concludes by stating that they are not an anomaly in their region or in Asia, Africa and South America.</summary>
