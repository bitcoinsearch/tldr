    <summary>The author argues that Bitcoin offers more than just another payment technology, as it provides sound money, censorship resistance, personal control over money, and programmable money. The marginal cost of a transaction with Bitcoin can far surpass that of a PayPal or bank transfer. The author is willing to pay several multiples of the competitors' fees to continue using bitcoin. However, the high cost of transactions could lead to value bleeding out of Bitcoin to alternative blockchains offering lower fees. The author notes that all the properties of Bitcoin are also present in many of the alternative blockchains that exist, so much like anywhere else where liquidity moves within a system, value will move to the network of least friction. An attempt to impose an artificial limit on transaction rate will never create a high-value settlement network as it's easy to move value from Bitcoin to another blockchain with less friction.</summary>
