    <summary>In an email conversation on 24th July 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n, a bitcoin developer, explains that increasing the exchange rate of bitcoin is not within their control. Responding to this, the recipient of the email suggests that developers are working hard to make bitcoin more valuable and can influence its value through their work. They argue that figuring out ways to increase the value of bitcoin is exactly what they are doing.</summary>
