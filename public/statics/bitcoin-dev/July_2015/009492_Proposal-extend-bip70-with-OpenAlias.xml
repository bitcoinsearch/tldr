    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient, the topic of OpenAlias was discussed. OpenAlias is a domain name system that allows for easier cryptocurrency transactions by using a simple, human-readable domain name instead of a long string of numbers and letters. The conversation included confusion over the term "alias" and "DNS key", with the conclusion that "alias" refers to the domain name corresponding to the TXT record. There was also some skepticism expressed about whether people would want to use a domain name under a new root as their identity. However, there are those who believe in the potential success of OpenAlias. The conversation then shifted towards exploring other options such as compact cert+optimized BIP70, which could be stored in a QR code, or using pastebin to store small bits of data.The discussion ended with the suggestion that a 150-byte QR code using base43 encoding could be a viable option for storing data, but there may be legal issues surrounding services that provide this type of storage.</summary>
