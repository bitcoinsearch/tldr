    <summary>In an email exchange on July 15, 2015, a member of the bitcoin-dev community questioned the claim that a large number of standard nodes running on the network made it stronger. The response from Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, was that running normal full nodes only provides extra service to nodes synchronizing and lightweight clients, but does not actually make the network stronger in terms of reducing trust between participants. Wuille explained that it is a misconception that running many nodes helps, and that it is better to run and control one or few full nodes which are used to validate transactions, rather than running thousands of nodes in third party data centers, which only appears more decentralized.</summary>
