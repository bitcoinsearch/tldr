    <summary>The CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS) is an open standard designed to share industry best practices with the community at large. Eric is working on a post inviting everyone in the mailing list to participate, but the CCSS website and GitHub repository are already available for contributions. The belief behind CCSS is that sharing knowledge and best practices benefits everyone. The website http://blog.cryptoconsortium.org/contributing-to-the-ccss/ provides more information on the standard. Meanwhile, a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list revealed that blockchain.info's wallet and block explorer have shown invalid data on multiple occasions consistent with not running a full node.</summary>
