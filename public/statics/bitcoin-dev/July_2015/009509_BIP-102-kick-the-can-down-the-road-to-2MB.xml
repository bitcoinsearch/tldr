    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in July 2015, Ross Nicoll suggested that using block time is a better option for validating block size than using block height. He argued that validating block size requires context and that using block height would complicate block validation. Ross also noted his concern about the limited number of transactions per second currently allowed by the network, advocating for a conservative increase in block size to allow for more transaction volume. Jeff Garzik had proposed BIP173 as a minimum viable alternative plan to his preferred proposal, BIP100. BIP173 aimed to provide a backup plan if an agreement could not be reached on a more comprehensive solution. The proposal suggested a hard fork to increase the maximum block size to 2MB. While this would permit some added growth and prove that the network can upgrade, it would require another hard fork down the road. In response, Jorge Tim√≥n disagreed with Ross's suggestion, arguing that using block height was a simpler design and a universal tick with every block. He further suggested that BIP16 and BIP34 could have been changed to height-based activation already.</summary>
