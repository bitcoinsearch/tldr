    <summary>The email thread from Thomas Zander via bitcoin-dev on July 30, 2015 discusses the potential for decentralized technology to follow a similar path to multi-core CPUs. Zander compares the initial skepticism towards multi-core CPUs to the current skepticism towards decentralized technology, stating that there will eventually be frameworks to make decentralized technology easier to use. While Zander mistakenly uses the term "distributed" instead of "decentralized," he notes that libraries and approaches for distributed systems can also be useful for decentralized systems.</summary>
