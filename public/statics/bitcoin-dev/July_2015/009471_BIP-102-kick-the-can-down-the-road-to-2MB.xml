    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr expressed his opinion that hard forks should not be decided by a majority vote among miners but rather require consensus among nodes. Tier Nolan agreed with this view and suggested that new hard fork proposals that use a voting system for activation may not want to establish the precedent of relying on a vote. Another member of the mailing list wondered how many people had read a particular article related to the discussion.</summary>
