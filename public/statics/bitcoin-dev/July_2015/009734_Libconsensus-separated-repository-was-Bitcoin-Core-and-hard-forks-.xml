    <summary>In this email conversation, Eric Voskuil and Jorge Timón discuss the development of libconsensus, an independent library for Bitcoin consensus rules. Timón proposes exposing VerifyHeader in the library first, as it would be easier to implement. He also suggests adding CheckBlockHeader and ContextualCheckBlockHeader to give more flexibility to users. The discussion also covers the need for independence and isolation of the library from Bitcoin Core, and the possibility of using libsecp256k1 instead of OpenSSL. Voskuil expresses his support for the project but notes that it's not his top priority at present.</summary>
