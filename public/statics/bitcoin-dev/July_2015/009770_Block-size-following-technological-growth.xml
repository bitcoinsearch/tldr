    <summary>The author of this post discusses a proposal for long-term scalability in Bitcoin. The proposal suggests using median time instead of block.nTime for activation, but the author still prefers using height for everything. They also discuss the importance of miner confirmation for uncontroversial hardforks and suggest discussing this topic for all proposals. Furthermore, the author argues against making assumptions about technological advancements and economic growth when deciding on the blocksize. They suggest waiting for improvements to happen and then adapting the blocksize accordingly. Finally, the author expresses their preference for a more limited solution like bip102, rather than using 2MB's arbitrary number.</summary>
