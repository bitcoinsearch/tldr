    <summary>In an email exchange between Jean-Paul Kogelman and Jorge Timón, Milly Bitcoin's proposed process for Bitcoin improvement was discussed. The process includes a list of metrics, a risk analysis of the baseline system, mitigation strategies for each risk, a set of goals, and a road map for each goal that lists the changes or possible avenues to achieve that goal. Proposed changes would be measured against the same metrics and a risk analysis done so it can be compared with the baseline. The block size debate would be discussed in the context of a road map related to a goal of increasing scaling, with one of the metrics being a decentralization metric. Kogelman suggested that three things were needed: a minimum specification of hardware, a theoretical model that takes into account all of the components in Bitcoin Core and how they affect Min Spec, and a benchmark tool to measure how changes affect Min Spec (and for users to see how their hardware measures up to Min Spec). Timón agreed that metrics and data tend to help when it comes to "I will know it when I see it" and "evidences." They also discussed the importance of hardforks being uncontroversial and the need for sets of simulations to calculate some of those metrics.</summary>
