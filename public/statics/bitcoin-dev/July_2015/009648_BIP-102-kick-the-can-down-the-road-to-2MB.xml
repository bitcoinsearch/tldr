    <summary>Luke Dashjr shared his concerns on the activation date of Bitcoin's 1 MB volume, stating that it would be better to move it later, maybe to November 2016 or 2017, given that it is unlikely that actual volume will reach 1 MB by November. He also suggested that instead of doubling, a conservative increase of 15% (1.15 MB) should be followed to keep up with reasonably expected bandwidth increases. However, Thomas Zander argued that the reference to bandwidth increases was irrelevant as in most parts of the world, including Germany, the bandwidth already far exceeds the 8Mb limit. He cited the example of a 150Mbit connection in Germany which allows comfortable handling of 16 megabyte blocks. Zander did not believe Luke's argument for pushing forward the activation date held any merit.</summary>
