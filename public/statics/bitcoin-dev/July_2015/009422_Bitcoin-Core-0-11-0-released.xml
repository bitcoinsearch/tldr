    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.0 has been released, with new features and bug fixes. Users can specify how much space to allot for block and undo files with pruning being disabled by default. Experimental support for big-endian CPU architectures was added in this release, along with many changes designed to reduce the default memory usage of a node. Improvements have been made to the algorithm used for fee estimation, and an option has been added to prevent automatic transaction broadcast and rebroadcast.This release adds functionality to create a new circuit for every peer connection when the software is used with Tor, which significantly reduces the chance of picking a single exit node that is either malicious or widely banned from the P2P network. There have been several updates and improvements made to various aspects of the software, including adding a scriptPubKey field to validate address RPC call and time offset inclusion into getpeerinfo output. The internal miner's hashmeter was removed while RPC locks were pushed down. Configuration and command-line options have also been updated with new features such as an option for self-signed root certificates, consistency checks for block chain data structures, disabling wallet transaction broadcast, stream isolation for Tor, autoprune functionality, and alerts opt-out. Block and transaction handling have been modified with changes including executing all block index writes in a batch, MANDATORY flag checks prior to accepting mempool, rejecting headers that build on an invalid parent, AreSane() checks to fees from the network, and more.Important validation changes include implementing BIP62 rule 6 and BIP66. Wallet upgrades include discouraging fee sniping with nLockTime, enforcing minRelayTxFee on wallet created tx, subtracting fee from amount, changing default nTxConfirmTarget to 2, and fixing off-by-one error with nLockTime in wallet. The GUI received many updates and improvements ranging from adopting style colour for button icons, optimizing PNG files, preventing amount overflow problem with payment requests, removing movable option for toolbar, to making the command-line-args dialog better. Lastly, tests were conducted on several aspects of the software ranging from ability to run a single test manually to RPC tests and additional RPC tests.The Bitcoin Core team has released version 0.13.0 which includes significant code improvements, enhancements to network propagation performance, and reduced transaction fees. The release notes also highlight a significant reduction in the time taken to validate new transactions, along with the increased efficiency of signature validation. The development team has managed to reduce the storage space required for transactions and block data, which paves the way for future scalability initiatives. In addition, the update includes several bug fixes and other minor improvements. The release is available for download on the Bitcoin Core website. Upgrading instructions and downgrading warnings are provided detailing the use of the issue tracker at GitHub for reporting bugs and the availability of the entire distribution as a torrent.</summary>
