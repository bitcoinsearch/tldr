    <summary>In 2015, Максим Божко proposed implementing a dynamic block size limit for bitcoin. This proposal involves adjusting the block size based on recent block sizes, which would allow miners to chart the course of block sizes. However, this could lead to a reduction in the population of nodes able to keep up with the network due to the limited decentralization and more powerful equipment of miners. This idea has been discussed before, but it can be difficult to find these discussions due to the high traffic on the list. The full details of the proposal can be found in the Google document provided in the email.</summary>
