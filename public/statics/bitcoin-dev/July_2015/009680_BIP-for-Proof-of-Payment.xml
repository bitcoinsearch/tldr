    <summary>On July 24, 2015, Kalle Rosenbaum announced via bitcoin-dev that two new Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) had been assigned numbers 120 and 121. The announcement prompted celebration, as the BIPs had faced challenges during the proposal process. The email thread did not provide further information on the content of the BIPs or their implications for Bitcoin development.</summary>
