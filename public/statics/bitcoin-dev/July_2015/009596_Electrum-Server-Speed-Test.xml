    <summary>In this email exchange, Eric Voskuil is seeking clarification on the Electrum Server Speed Test. He asks if the time taken to process into the index includes the time for transport and/or block validation by bitcoind or if it is exclusively the time taken by Electrum Server to index a validated block. It is pointed out that validation in bitcoind happens before the time on the wall for electrum-server. ThomasV notes that the process is significantly faster with a solid-state disk but much more expensive to operate. It will only be expensive servers with lots of SSD space that are able to keep up with the current software. Eric clarifies that he was trying to make a point about other software being impacted in ways that aren't discussed, rather than making a specific dig about electrum-server.</summary>
