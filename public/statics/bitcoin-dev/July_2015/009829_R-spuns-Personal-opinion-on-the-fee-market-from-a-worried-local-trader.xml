    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Zander and Jorge Timón debated the incentive for miners to include free transactions. When Timón suggested that including a transaction for free would be equivalent to giving money away, Zander pointed out that miners do have a cost for including transactions but they still do it. Oleg Andreev chimed in to say that fees/profits ratio is what really matters and that fees can begin to matter quickly under pressure of separate factors like halving and growing valuation. He also added that a rise in fees paid could be another potential factor. Zander agreed with this and stated that he does not think a rise in fees is necessarily bad as rising from zero to anything is a great step forward. He argued that users starting to pay SOMETHING for a service they're enjoying and that actually has quite big operational costs would be a tiny first step towards a viable system that doesn't depend on subsidies.</summary>
