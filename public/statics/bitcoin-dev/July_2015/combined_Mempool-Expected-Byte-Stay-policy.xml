    <summary>A discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list was held regarding the evicting of a transaction and its dependents on its 2-hour anniversary, whether space required or not. The suggestion was made to use blocks instead of time so that users and wallets can know when they should rebroadcast and consider increasing the fee. However, there is a chance that fewer than 4 blocks have occurred using 120 minutes. On the other hand, using 12 blocks would give a 5% chance of having to wait for 3 hours. It was argued that the assumption that time is a better indicator is false because block mining times are not guaranteed in the future.The author of the context is facing spamming issues on their fullnode resources. To tackle this issue, they set a maximum size for the memory pool and allocated space based on a simple rule. When there's not enough space for a new transaction, the author tries to make space by evicting transactions with an expectedByteStay higher than the new transaction. A transaction and its dependents are evicted on its two-hour anniversary, whether space required or not. However, there is also a possibility of clog-ups by transactions that look like they'll confirm next block but don't due to factors other than fees. In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Thomas Zander suggested using a number of blocks instead of time to determine when transactions and their dependents should be evicted from the mempool. Tom Harding responded that using a time-based system would better allow users and wallets to know when to rebroadcast and increase fees. Zander argued that block times were just as reliable, but Harding pointed out that mining times are not guaranteed in the future and a sudden change could cause issues for the mempool. Therefore, there was disagreement about whether a block or time-based system would be best for managing the mempool.</summary>
