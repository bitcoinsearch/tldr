    <summary>In an email exchange on July 23, 2015, Bitcoin developer Jorge Tim贸n apologized for mentioning Mike Hearn in a previous email and diverting attention from the topic at hand. Tim贸n had referenced Hearn's desire for a "benevolent dictator" to lead Bitcoin Core development, but clarified that it was not relevant to the discussion of libconsensus. Additionally, Tim贸n conceded that he spends too much time on Reddit, where the initial conversation took place.</summary>
