    <summary>Eric Lombrozo expressed regret over not emphasizing the critical importance of ideas that have been discussed for years but have seen little progress. In an email dated July 28, 2015, Lombrozo noted that many of these ideas were not his own and were not new, but despite their significance, the community had given up too easily on moving forward with them. Lombrozo questioned why so little had happened to address these issues, which he believed had been known for some time. The email also included a signature file in the form of a PGP-signed message.</summary>
