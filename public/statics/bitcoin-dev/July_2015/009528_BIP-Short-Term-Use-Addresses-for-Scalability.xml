    <summary>Jeremy Rubin has proposed a modest increase in the number of transactions per block amidst a debate on block size. He shared his proposal on Github, which includes changing the maximum block size and implementing a new transaction format. The goal is to increase the number of transactions without sacrificing decentralization or security. The proposal also addresses potential concerns such as increased bandwidth usage and incentivizing full nodes. Overall, Rubin's proposal suggests a practical solution to the current issue of limited transactions per block.</summary>
