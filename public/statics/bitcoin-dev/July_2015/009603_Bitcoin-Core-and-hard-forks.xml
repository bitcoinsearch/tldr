    <summary>In a discussion between Gavin Andresen and Eric Lombrozo in 2015, Lombrozo stated that mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency will primarily be enabled through direct party-to-party contract negotiation using blockchain as a dispute resolution mechanism. He also argued that the block size is not about scaling but about supply and demand of finite resources. In response, Andresen criticized Lombrozo's statement saying it is wrong to pick one use case to bet on as the winner for mainstream usage. Furthermore, he disagrees with the false dichotomy presented by Lombrozo regarding addressing the increase of computational resources or fees as there are many other ways to decrease costs. Andresen argues that an "us or them" attitude fosters unproductive bickering and negativity. Lombrozo acknowledges that his statement is his educated best guess based on his understanding of computer science and economics.</summary>
