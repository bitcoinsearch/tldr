    <summary>The author suggests adding a clause to the "BIP Editor Responsibilities &amp; Workflow" section of BIP0001. The clause would require BIP editors to notify authors if they do not handle the BIP within one or two weeks and provide an estimate of when it will be handled. The author is trying to get BIP numbers allocated for Proof of Payment, but has not received any reaction from the BIP editor Gregory Maxwell. The author also notes that there are several BIP proposals floating around, and the process for BIP allocation and inclusion in the bips repository is unclear. They suggest that authors should receive a response from the BIP editor when requesting a number, and if the editor disapproves of a BIP, the author should be notified within a reasonable and predictable timeframe.</summary>
