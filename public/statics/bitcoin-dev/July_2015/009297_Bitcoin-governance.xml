    <summary>There is a common misconception that the core developers of Bitcoin govern the cryptocurrency. However, it is important to note that they set standards instead of governing it. This standard is voluntary and its importance in defining consensus rules is subject to speculation. The amount of influence core developers have on Bitcoin depends on specific circumstances. It is suggested that the wording be changed to reflect the voluntary nature of this standard.</summary>
