    <summary>On 30th July 2015, Jorge Timon via bitcoin-dev raised the issue of "technological de-growth" and pointed out that it is not wise to rely on pseudo-laws like Moore's or Nielsen's so-called "laws." He stated that assuming linear or exponential growth without sympathetic contraction at some time in the future would make our future selves look back and smile at the youthful exuberance. The pseudo-laws mentioned by him do not cater for contraction. Scaling UP plans should also wisely make provision for scaling DOWN, for when the need arises.He preferred a more limited solution like bip102 and suggested having simulations leading to a concrete value instead of using 2MB's arbitrary number. He had a look at the existing Size N testnet code and decided to set up a node over the weekend and post its address in that PR's conversation. He asked if anyone else already had a node running and what blocksize they were using.In the end, he thanked someone for broadening his horizon soon and provided a PGP signature.</summary>
