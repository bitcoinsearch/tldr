    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Thomas Voegtlin suggests the idea of having an intermediate "_wallet" level in order to allow zone delegation. However, he later realizes that it would be better to separate the listing of TXT records under a name from the possibility to use Zone Delegation. He suggests using the "_oa2" name for introducing the intermediate level and "_oa2_keys" for key listing. He then provides an example of how this could work using sample aliases. For Zone Delegation, he gives an example of how example.com can delegate all its Bitcoin aliases to Netki using an intermediate level with the "_oa2" name, where that string is translated as "@" in the alias.</summary>
