    <summary>In a conversation on Bitcoin-dev in July 2015, Mike Hearn argued that Bitcoin transaction fees should not exceed those of competitors like PayPal or bank transfers. However, another participant disagreed, citing Bitcoin's advantages such as sound money, censorship resistance, personal control over money, and programmable money. The participant argued that these attributes make Bitcoin much more than just a payment technology and therefore the marginal cost of a transaction could far surpass that of competitors. While some marginal use cases may drop off with higher fees, it is necessary to let them go because there is not enough room on-chain for everything anyone might want to do. Finally, the participant pointed out that the banking crisis referenced by Satoshi in his early work was about more than just high credit card and PayPal fees, and any speculative economic analysis should include this fact.</summary>
