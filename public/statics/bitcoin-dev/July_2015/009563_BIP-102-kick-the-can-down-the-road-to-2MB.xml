    <summary>In this discussion on the Bitcoin developer mailing list, several developers are debating the merits of using block height versus median time for determining maximum block size. The debate centers around the fact that nTime, which is currently used to determine maximum block size, can introduce edge cases and weird incentives due to time zones and other factors. Some argue that block height is a simpler design, while others suggest that median time would be a reasonable compromise if the goal is to make the change "human-schedule-friendly." The conversation ends with a request to move the discussion to a separate thread regarding an uncontroversial hardfork in order to set a precedent and potentially decouple some parts of the blocksize debate.</summary>
