    <summary>A bounty has been offered to anyone who can add a Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) transaction creation feature to any wallet featured on the Bitcoin homepage. The funds for the bounty are being raised by donation and will be dispersed from a specific address once the bounty is claimed. The address is currently not well-funded, but donations are welcome. Proof that the multisig address is not 1 of 1 can be found on Bitcointalk.org. The announcement for the bounty can also be found on Bitcointalk.org. The link to the Bitcoin homepage where the wallet must be featured can be found in reference 1.</summary>
