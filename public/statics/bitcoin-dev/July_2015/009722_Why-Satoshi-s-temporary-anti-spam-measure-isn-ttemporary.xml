    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Hearn, has criticized Eric Lombrozo's article on Bitcoin Magazine about settling the block size debate. Hearn argues that Satoshi's anti-spam measure was not a temporary solution and that it is incorrect to assume that users are buying space in Bitcoin blocks; rather, they are paying to move money. He also disputes Lombrozo's claim that SPV wallets are "notoriously terrible" at detecting chain forks, and suggests that remote attestation from secure hardware will solve the problem of double spends. Hearn concludes by calling for more focus on upgrading existing wallets rather than criticizing them.</summary>
