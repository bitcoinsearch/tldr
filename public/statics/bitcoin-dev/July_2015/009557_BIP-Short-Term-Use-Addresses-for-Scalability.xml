    <summary>A proposed change in Bitcoin's transaction format could potentially lead to significant memory savings for the UTXO pool. A standard transaction is 225 bytes, resulting in a savings of 8.6%, but for other sizes, such as 10 outputs, the savings could be even greater. It's important to note that this change only affects the UTXO pool's memory usage and not the blockchain's storage size. However, implementing this change would require most clients to update their code, which could take a long time and may not be worth the modest space savings of 10 bytes. An alternative solution proposed by Gavin Andresen is to introduce shorter ECDSA keys, which would save more space for public keys and signatures. This solution would likely be included in the OP_MAST and require a new address type. The original poster also asked if there were tools available to analyze the impact of this change on historical data directly.</summary>
