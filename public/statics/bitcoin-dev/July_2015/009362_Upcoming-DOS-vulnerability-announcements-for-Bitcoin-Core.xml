    <summary>On July 7th, 2015, Gregory Maxwell announced that he would be disclosing several serious denial of service vulnerabilities in Bitcoin Core, including CVE-2015-3641. He strongly recommended upgrading to version 0.10.2 as soon as possible for those running production nodes exposed to inbound connections from the internet. It was also important to upgrade older systems, especially miners, due to the impending BIP66 soft-fork reaching enforcing status.However, Gregory Maxwell delayed the announcement due to recent network turbulence and unusual attempted DOS attack activity on relayed infrastructure. Additionally, other cryptocurrency implementers requested a longer horizon for the disclosure.</summary>
