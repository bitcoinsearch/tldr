    <summary>A user on the bitcoin-dev mailing list suggested that privacy-conscious individuals should run their own Electrum server and make it accessible via .onion, only connecting it to other onion peers. This method ensures greater anonymity, as using Electrum with Tor can only leak information about which addresses belong to the same wallet. However, it was pointed out in a separate thread that running an Electrum server instance is no easy task and cannot be recommended to others as a sensible solution. Enthusiasts may want to run Bitcoin core instead.</summary>
