    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the issue of large bitcoin ecosystem companies not using full nodes for security purposes. Adam Back suggests that education is needed to make businesses aware of the importance of running their own full node. Peter Todd mentions that blockchain.info and Coinbase have not been running full nodes, causing issues with invalid confirmations on transactions. He also mentions that the Crypto Currency Security Standards document does not require running a full node for certification. However, there is unanimous agreement that full nodes should be required for higher levels of certification. Lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works and security engineering may be contributing to these problems. The discussion then moves towards the need for decentralization and more layer 2 work to improve the system's dynamic. Finally, it is noted that major centralization related failures will help improve understanding of the importance of full nodes, but there is only one shot at this due to the ease of killing PoW systems at birth.</summary>
