    <summary>The context discusses a proposed solution to improve privacy and anonymity in Electrum clients. The proposed solution involves encouraging Electrum server operators to make their servers reachable as tor hidden services, making sure server discovery works with .onion addresses, and making privacy a user-configurable setting. The proposed privacy settings include None, SSL, Tor, and Multi-Tor, with the default being SSL. The context also mentions the idea of using distinct Tor routes for each Bitcoin address, but notes that it could result in poor performance. The ideal solution would allow a client to balance privacy against performance. There is a proposal to create an anonymous routing layer between Electrum servers and clients inspired by TOR. Each server publishes an RSA public key, and each client receives a list of available servers and their pubkeys. For each wallet address, a client chooses a server and an RSA keypair, creates a list of encrypted requests, and sends them to a main server which dispatches the requests to corresponding servers without revealing the client's IP address. The servers decrypt the requests they receive, perform the request, and encrypt the result with a specific key before sending it back to the client.</summary>
