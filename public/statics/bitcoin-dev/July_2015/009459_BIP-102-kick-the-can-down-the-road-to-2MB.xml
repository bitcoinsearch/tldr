    <summary>A mailing list thread has been opened on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to provide a minimum viable alternative plan for block size increase in case an agreement is not reached on a more comprehensive solution. The BIP comes as a conservative approach to block size increase and will prove that the network can upgrade, permit some added growth and gather data on how increased block size impacts privacy, security, centralization, transaction throughput and other metrics. The proposed increase is 2MB which seems to be a least common denominator. However, it requires a hard fork and another one down the road. The BIP PR and Code PR are available on GitHub.</summary>
