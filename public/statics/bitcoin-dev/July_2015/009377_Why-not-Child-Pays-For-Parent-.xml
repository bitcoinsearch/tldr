    <summary>The discussion is centered around CPFP, which is interesting but does not fully cover the case it is trying to address. The sender of transaction A can't assure that it will reach nodes/miners if it goes out without sufficient fee. The email thread also discusses whether CPFP should be a default policy and how the transaction fee should be calculated. There is mention of a test where 0.0008 BTC was sent without any fee and then that UTXO into another transaction with 0.0001 BTC, which still hasn't confirmed. It is speculated that this could be due to various reasons such as congestion or insufficient hash power for CPFP. The email signature belongs to Richard Moore, the founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc.</summary>
