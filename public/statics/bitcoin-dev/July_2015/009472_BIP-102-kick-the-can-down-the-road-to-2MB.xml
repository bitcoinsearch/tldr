    <summary>A conversation between Jorge Timón, Tier Nolan, and Luke Dashjr regarding hardforks in Bitcoin took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Luke Dashjr stated that hardforks do not require voting, as consensus among nodes is more important than a majority among miners. Nolan agreed with this sentiment, but also noted that some new hard fork proposals use a voting system for activation and may not want to establish that precedent. Timón asked how many people read a specific link related to hardforks.</summary>
