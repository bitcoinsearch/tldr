    <summary>In a conversation dated July 30, 2015, Venzen Khaosan wrote to an unknown recipient about their existing Size N testnet code, which they had looked at on Github. Khaosan mentioned setting up a node over the weekend and posting its address in the PR's conversation. They also asked if anyone else was running a node and what blocksize they were using. The recipient responded positively and said that they were not running any node at any size. They added that the testnet was not a regular one but rather a regtest-like version that made mining and simulations cheaper. This also meant that reorgs could be trivially created, so it was expected to be used in a controlled environment where users could control which node creates a new block and when.</summary>
