    <summary>Gavin Andresen thanked Pieter Wuille for making a concrete proposal and provided some specific comments on the proposal. He stated that 2MB blocks by 2021 are too conservative, and it is likely to turn Bitcoin into a settlement network only affordable for high-value transactions. Andresen argued that the proposal does not strike the right balance between centralization of payments and mining and suggested that compromising the security of the main layer could result in unrealistic growth of space for on-chain transactions. He further added that if Bitcoin needs to support a large scale, it has already failed. Andresen also commented on using median time generally and queried why monotonically increasing matters for max block size. He suggested that the mempool would offer a slightly easier transition for validation. However, he did not think this mattered much as the p2p protocol should deal with whatever limits the system requires anyway.</summary>
