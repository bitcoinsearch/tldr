    <summary>In a discussion between Eric Lombrozo and Jean-Paul Kogelman, the latter suggests that miners should be responsible for setting different values for transaction fees to promote a healthy fee market. Kogelman explains that quality of service can be measured by satoshi per kb and miners can set different values for transactions included in blocks currently being worked on, the next block, and so on. He points out that the influence of miners on the fees will be proportional to their hashing power. Lombrozo suggests using services separate from miners that guarantee inclusion for a predetermined price and do the bidding on behalf of the user. Contracts can ensure inclusion within a certain number of blocks or offer a full refund or compensation for failure to deliver.</summary>
