    <summary>On July 29, 2015, a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list was initiated by Ryan Butler regarding the implications of an unlimited block size on the fee market. The question raised was whether every miner had the ability to set their minimum accepted fee or transaction acceptance algorithm, rendering the fee market non-existent. It was argued that this assumption would not work as it would lead to oligopoly behavior and go against the principles of a decentralized mining system. The decentralization of mining provides policy neutrality, and some miner somewhere with some hashrate will process a transaction even if other miners have decided not to do so. This is why free transactions are processed today, as policies vary, ensuring many types of transactions get processed. The argument against an unlimited block size affecting the fee market is similar to that for the decentralization of mining; it ensures that policies remain variable, allowing for different types of transactions to be processed.</summary>
