    <summary>A pull request has been created on Github to simplify the testing of different block sizes. If merged, this pull request would also make future block size changes easier. The creator of the PR hopes that more people will test and simulate various consensus maximum block sizes. This would lead to a simplification in work. It is recommended that individuals do not discuss the block size issue itself in this post or the PR. The size is simply -blocksize. One can use the branch (or a fork of it) for testing purposes. The listed dependencies include Chainparams: Translations and CTestNetParams and CRegTestParams extending directly from CChainParams. As things get merged, the list of dependencies will be updated accordingly.</summary>
