    <summary>The discussion between Jean-Paul Kogelman, Eric Lombrozo, and Peter Todd on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the implementation of Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees in Bitcoin transactions. Kogelman suggests that implicit QoS is simpler to implement and closer to the original vision of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital cash system. Lombrozo argues that using third-party services for bidding allows for QoS guarantees while shifting complexity and risk away from wallets. He proposes the use of timelocked contracts to enforce guarantees. Todd points out that giving guarantees without a majority of hashing power isn't possible since mining is a random process. The discussion also touches upon issues such as block time variance and size caps.</summary>
