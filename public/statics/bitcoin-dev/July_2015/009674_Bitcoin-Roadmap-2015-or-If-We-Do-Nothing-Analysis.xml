    <summary>The IP address markets.blockchain.info has been found to have abusive clients that are running the same version of BitcoinJ. These clients display similar behavior, with one user in #bitcoin-dev complaining about connections from this client hammering closed ports when they are kicked off. The reverse name lookup for this IP address was markets.blockchain.info, which is used by some to filter out abusive university connections. OVH and Octave Klaba are named as the owner of the IP address when a Whois search is conducted. Furthermore, "blockchain.info" appears in the HTML header of the IP address as retrieved by the Anti-Hacker Alliance. However, when trying to access blockchain.info, it returns IP addresses managed by CloudFlare.</summary>
