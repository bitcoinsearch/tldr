    <summary>In an email correspondence from July 5, 2015, Tom Harding discussed the possibility of allowing an explicit relative locktime of 0. This would assist applications in avoiding the accidental finalization of a whole transaction when they only meant to exclude a relative locktime on one input. Although Harding initially overlooked that other inputs can independently make the transaction non-final, the proposal still has potential benefits for certain use cases.</summary>
