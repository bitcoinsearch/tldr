    <summary>In a discussion about unlimited blocksize and its implications on fee market, it was pointed out that miners have control over setting their minimum accepted fee or transaction acceptance algorithm. The suggestion was made to give miners more fine-grained control over this to establish a proper fee market instead of depending on capacity which nobody has control over. It was proposed that allowing miners to set up a tiered offering that delays transactions, tying their tiers into the exchange rate to keep costs constant over time, could be a solution. The author expressed curiosity about objections to such an idea.</summary>
