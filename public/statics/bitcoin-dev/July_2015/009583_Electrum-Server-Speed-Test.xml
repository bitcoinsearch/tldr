    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email sent on July 23, 2015, Slurms MacKenzie discussed how the Electrum server software handles under load. The Electrum wallet is popular and relies on distributed servers hosted by volunteers. The server requires a fully indexed Bitcoin Core daemon running and produces sizable external indexes in order to allow SPV clients to quickly retrieve their history. MacKenzie provided data points indicating that it takes approximately 3.7 minutes per megabyte of block for an electrum-server instance, running on a modest-high end dedicated server, to process into the index. Based on this trend, the server can support up to 2.64 MB block sizes before permanently falling behind the chain. This suggests that improving Electrum Server's database performance may be necessary rather than holding back Bitcoin.</summary>
