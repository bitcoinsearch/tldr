    <title>BIP 68 (Relative Locktime) bug</title>

    <summary>BIP 68 utilizes nSequence to specify relative locktime for transactions. However, this also affects the transaction-level locktime, which can cause a problem in creating an effective nLocktime. To solve this issue, at least one input must be mined ahead of its parent by one block or one second.To fix this problem, the semantics of nSequence will be shifted so that MAX_INT - 1 specifies 0 relative locktime instead of 1. This change will maintain the semantics of previously created transactions with the same nSequence value of MAX_INT - 1. This includes all transactions created by the bitcoin core wallet starting in version 0.11.</summary>
