    <summary>On July 30th, 2015, Pieter Wuille shared a proposal for long-term scalability that he had been working on with the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal can be found on his GitHub page and includes several elements, such as Segregated Witness, block weight, a new transaction format, and more. Pieter noted that some things were not yet included in the proposal, such as a testnet whose size runs ahead of the main chain, and Gavin Andresen's more accurate sigop checking after the hard fork. Greg responded to the proposal by asking what methods miners would use to communicate their upgrade. It is unclear from this context what specifically Greg was referencing or what response he received.</summary>
