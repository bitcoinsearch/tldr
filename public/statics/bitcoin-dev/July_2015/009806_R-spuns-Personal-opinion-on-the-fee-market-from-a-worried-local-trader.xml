    <summary>In this conversation between Jorge Timón and Tom Harding, they discuss the blocksize limit and its importance for decentralization. Timón explains that hitting the limit will only cause higher fees and not lead to a failure of Bitcoin. He also states that the blocksize limit is not necessary to create a functioning fee market. However, miners do not care about fees or transactions at all and only care about subsidies. Timón believes that rising non-fast-confirmation mining fees above zero is not a bad thing and that "hitting the limit" is an opportunity to motivate miners to start caring more about transactions and fees. Harding separates out the elevated fee market concern but acknowledges that a 1MB limit is too restrictive even with "layer 2". He suggests that there should be a quantitative measure of decentralization, but Timón argues that there's no defined measurable unit for "decentralization". The best they have now are pool percentages, number of nodes, subsidy/fee ratio, etc. Timón thinks that ANY metric for centralization would be welcomed right now. Moreover, he explains that it is a certainty that fees will be necessary someday because bitcoin's seigniorage is limited to 21 M to subsidize mining, which won't last forever. Finally, Timón is confused by Harding's metaphorical reference to children working in factories.</summary>
