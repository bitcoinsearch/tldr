    <summary>The writer of the email raises larger issues while discussing the specifics of implementation. The Libbitcoin Server uses CurveZMQ, which is a type of CurveCP implementation. The links provided include information on CurveCP and CurveZMQ as well as the Bitcoin Wiki page for Libbitcoin Server. The email itself proposes an idea inspired by TOR for creating an anonymous routing layer between Electrum servers and clients using RSA encryption. Each server publishes a public key and each client receives a list of available servers and their public keys. The client then chooses a server and a RSA keypair for each wallet address. Encrypted requests are sent to the server and the main server dispatches the requests to the corresponding servers without revealing the client's IP address. The servers decrypt the requests and encrypt the result with the specific RSA keypair before sending it back to the main server and ultimately to the client.</summary>
