    <summary>In a message sent by Jorge Timón via bitcoin-dev on July 31, 2015, he questions why miners would include transactions for free, stating that doing so would be akin to giving away money. Thomas Zander responds by pointing out that miners do not rely on fees as a primary source of income, and therefore including transactions for free does not necessarily equate to giving away money. The incentive for miners to include transactions is not solely rooted in fees, but rather in the overall health and stability of the network.</summary>
