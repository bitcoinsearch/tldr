    <summary>The writer proposes an idea inspired by TOR to create an anonymous routing layer between Electrum servers and clients. The proposed system involves each server publishing an RSA public key, which the client receives along with a list of available servers. For each wallet address, the client chooses a server, S_i, and a RSA keypair, K_addr_i and k_addr_i. The client creates a list of encrypted requests containing addr_i and K_addr_i, which is encrypted with the pubkey KS_i of S_i. The client then sends the list of encrypted requests to the main server, M. M dispatches the client's requests to the corresponding servers S_i without revealing the client's IP address. Each server decrypts the requests it receives, performs the request, and encrypts the result with K_addr_i. M receives the encrypted responses from the servers and forwards them to the client. Finally, the client decrypts the encrypted response with k_addr_i. The proposed system aims to provide anonymity for Electrum clients while using RSA encryption to secure communications between clients and servers. Overall, it is an interesting proposal that could have potential applications in the field of online security.</summary>
