    <summary>In a mailing list discussion regarding Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 102, Thomas Zander argued that the reference to bandwidth increases in the proposal makes no sense as most of the world already exceeds the 8Mb limit. He cited Germany as an example where one can buy a 150Mbit connection for a flat rate and cheap monthly rate, which allows for comfortably having 16 megabyte blocks. Zander stated that while he will have better statistics available soon, currently only 4% of his initial crawl presented bandwidth above the stated 18MB/s limit in the proposal.</summary>
