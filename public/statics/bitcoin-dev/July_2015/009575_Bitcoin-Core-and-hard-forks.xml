    <summary>The email thread initiated by Jorge Timón via bitcoin-dev discusses the issue of user expectations regarding the supply and pricing of Bitcoin. Timón argues that if users expect Bitcoin to be a free resource like air, it is essential to change their expectations as soon as possible. However, his interlocutors disagree and suggest that we should accept that reality can change and promote understanding of this fact instead of manipulating the market artificially. They argue that technological capacity and centralization concerns should be the criteria for consensus block size, and there is no place for artificially altering expectations. Furthermore, they claim that Bitcoin has all the hash power and infinite capacity and that we should focus on scaling the supporting information propagation system appropriately rather than limiting the primary time-stamping machine. Finally, they assert that they haven't thought much about when to declare failure.</summary>
