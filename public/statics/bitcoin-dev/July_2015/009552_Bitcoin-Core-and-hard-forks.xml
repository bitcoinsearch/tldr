    <summary>In an email written by Mike Hearn on July 22, 2015, he discussed the issue of blockchain forks and their merging capabilities. He stated that until blockchain forks can be merged like git repo forks, the safest option is to avoid forking altogether. However, he also explained that block chain forks do merge in the same way as git forks through the reorg algorithm. Transactions that did not make it into the post-reorg chain go back into the mempool and miners attempt to reinclude them. This process is known as "merging". If these transactions conflict with other transactions, they are dropped, which is referred to as "resolving merge conflicts". Hearn noted that a user must want to merge with the new chain in order for the software to do so. If the software is programmed not to merge with the new chain, then no merge will occur. Once the user changes the software settings to allow for merging, the chain can be reorganized and merged back onto the main chain. The email also acknowledged that there were other hard fork proposals besides increasing block size.</summary>
