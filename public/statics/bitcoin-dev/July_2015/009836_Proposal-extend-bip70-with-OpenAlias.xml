    <summary>In this email conversation, Justin Newton is responding to a proposal made by Thomas regarding the delegation of wallet names in a zone. Thomas suggests that the "_oa2" portion of the domain name be "hidden" as a way to make it easier to delegate just wallet names from a zone. However, he clarifies that this portion cannot be completely hidden as it is necessary to know where it is located in order to perform requests. In his proposal, Thomas suggests denoting it with an "@" character in the alias.</summary>
