    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Thomas Zander suggested using a number of blocks instead of time to determine when transactions and their dependents should be evicted from the mempool. Tom Harding responded that using a time-based system would better allow users and wallets to know when to rebroadcast and increase fees. Zander argued that block times were just as reliable, but Harding pointed out that mining times are not guaranteed in the future and a sudden change could cause issues for the mempool. Therefore, there was disagreement about whether a block or time-based system would be best for managing the mempool.</summary>
