    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a software developer, has proposed a solution to increase the number of transactions per block without sacrificing decentralization or security. Currently, there is an ongoing debate on block size. Rubin's proposal involves changing the maximum block size and implementing a new transaction format. He shared his proposal on Github, which addresses potential concerns such as increased bandwidth usage and incentivizing full nodes.Rubin suggests repurposing a NOP in a soft fork instead of re-enabling OP_LEFT to increase the number of transactions per block. This would involve creating a new opcode called OP_LEFTEQUALVERIFY that checks if the leftmost L bytes of A and B match, failing immediately if they do not or if either array is less than L bytes or if there are fewer than 3 values on the stack. However, this change would only offer a once-off improvement in efficiency, making it less likely to be worth the effort. Another option for adding new opcodes is to use a different script engine like with P2SH.In another discussion on bitcoin-dev, Tier Nolan discussed the challenges of introducing a new Bitcoin address system, as it requires most clients to update their code and may not be worth the modest space savings of 10 bytes with the extreme decrease in security from going from 2^160 to 2^80 to brute-force. Gavin Andresen echoed similar concerns and suggested introducing shorter ECDSA keys instead, which would save more space for public keys and signatures. The Short Term Use Address (STUA) was also discussed, which provides a strict incentive to reduce transaction fees but has security concerns and requires more analysis. Another proposed change in Bitcoin's transaction format could lead to significant memory savings for the UTXO pool, but requires most clients to update their code. Overall, the discussions revolve around finding practical solutions to current issues without sacrificing decentralization or security. The proposals put forward by Rubin, Nolan, and Andresen all aim to address various concerns such as limited transactions per block, space savings, and transaction fees. However, each proposal also has its own set of challenges and risks that would need further analysis and consideration before implementation.</summary>
