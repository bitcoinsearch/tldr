    <summary>In an email thread on July 29, 2015, Mike Hearn made some comments that were criticized by other members of the Bitcoin community. One person wrote that they did not enjoy hearing "lessons" from Hearn when he distorts history to reflect his views. Hearn claimed that Satoshi envisioned a future where only miners ran nodes, which others disputed and pointed out that there were many errors made early on in Bitcoin. The importance of running a node was also discussed, with one person saying that economically significant parties need to run nodes to prevent a small group of miners from having too much power. The potential security risks of SPV wallets were also mentioned, as well as the profitability of non-validating miners.</summary>
