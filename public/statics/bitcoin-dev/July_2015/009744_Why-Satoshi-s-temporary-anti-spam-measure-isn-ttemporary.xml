    <summary>The post in question was written by a server administrator or systems engineer who has been involved with Bitcoin since 2010. In the post, the author argues against concerns that larger blocks would hurt decentralization. To support this claim, the author provides details on the costs of running two nodes: one on server-grade hardware at a datacentre and another on an Atom system at his home.According to the author's estimates, a new user could run a full node for $100 using a Raspberry Pi 2 and a 2TB external hard drive, costing only $1 per month in power. The only real constraint for such a setup would be hard drive space, as the full blockchain and indexes take up about 50GB of space currently. However, the author believes that if BIP101 is implemented, 2TB of storage should be enough until around 2020. Based on this, he concludes that for the next five years, small devices can easily run Bitcoin nodes with BIP101-size blocks, with very little operational cost.The context of this message thread is the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The original message includes a PGP signature, which is a cryptographic method used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message. The author asks whether the signature is correct or incorrect. Additionally, the email provides information about the bitcoin-dev mailing list, including a link to subscribe and access archives.Finally, the message also includes an HTML attachment, which has been scrubbed from the message and is not further elaborated upon.</summary>
