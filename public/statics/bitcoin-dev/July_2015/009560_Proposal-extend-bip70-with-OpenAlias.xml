    <summary>On bitcoin-dev mailing list, Justin Newton suggested a more efficient and robust two-tier lookup solution. However, Thomas argued that the efficiency of the solution does not come from using two-tier lookup. Instead, he suggests that using an intermediate "_wallet" level allows zone delegation. He further proposes that instead of having separate records for each currency, it would be better to have the record for the specific currency, which will allow wallets supporting only one currency to skip the currencies lookup. The proposed solution is potentially more efficient for one or two currencies but can become problematic as the number of supported currencies and addresses under a single name grows.</summary>
