    <summary>During a conversation between Aaron Voisine and an unknown person on July 9, 2015, Aaron asked if the person knew how much hashing power was using CPFP. This information would be helpful for wallet developers to determine their confirmation times when utilizing CPFP. The other person was unsure of the exact percentage but suggested that at least 4% of hashing power on the Eligius platform was using CPFP.</summary>
