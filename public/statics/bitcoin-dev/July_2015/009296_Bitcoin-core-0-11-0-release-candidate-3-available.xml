    <summary>Bitcoin Core 0.11.0rc3 executables have been uploaded to https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.11.0/test/. The source code is available in the source tarball or git under the tag 'v0.11.0rc3'. Preliminary release notes can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.11/doc/release-notes.md. There have been a few changes since rc2 including updates to mailing list address, gitian-win-signer descriptor, and hardcoded seeds. Fixes have also been made to build on FreeBSD, to prevent crashes during shutdown, and to advance pindexLastCommonBlock for blocks in chainActive. The development team has thanked everyone who participated in development, translation or in the gitian build process.</summary>
