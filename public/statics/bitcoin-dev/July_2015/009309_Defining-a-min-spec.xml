    <summary>The context involves two individuals discussing the system requirements needed for running Bitcoin Core. The first person, an end user with an aging laptop, expresses interest in knowing the requirements. The second person, a game developer, proposes defining a minimum specification (min spec) for Bitcoin Core to reduce the risk of capacity problems and breaking something due to changes affecting available budgets. The developer explains that min spec is based on entry model machines that give the user an enjoyable experience when playing games. Bells and whistles can be turned on for people with faster machines, but that's not the point of the email.</summary>
