    <summary>There is a company called Netki working on a kind of DNSSEC integration with BIP70. They plan to have an open spec and open source implementation. However, according to Riccardo, Netki's solution is incredibly limited, lacking metadata and therefore not well-suited for handling BIP70-style communication. Additionally, Netki seems to disregard lookup privacy, which is addressed in OpenAlias by means of DNSCrypt encrypted lookups. To that end, the first independent DNSCrypt implementation has been written which provides a full Python implementation that uses libsodium/nacl if available, but falls back to a 100% Python slownacl implementation.</summary>
