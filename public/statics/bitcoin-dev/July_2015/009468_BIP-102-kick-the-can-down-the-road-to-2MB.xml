    <summary>In an email conversation between Luke Dashjr and an unknown recipient on July 17th, 2015, the two discussed the idea of using a voting system for activating hard forks. Luke argued that hard forks require consensus among nodes rather than majority among miners, and no hard fork has ever had such a vote. The recipient agreed with this sentiment but added that some new hard fork proposals do use a voting system for activation. However, they may not want to establish this precedent.</summary>
