    <summary>The discussion revolves around the empirical fact of rising fees during times of highest public interest in Bitcoin and the explanation for this phenomenon. A chart from Blockchain.info shows that average fees measured in BTC have gone up without block size pressure or exchange rate effect. However, another chart from Hashingit.com, using data from the same source, shows that fees per transaction have been dropping for three years until stress tests occurred eight weeks ago. The total transaction volume has gone up 2.4x to 2.5x during this period. This evidence refutes the conjecture that a production quota is necessary for a functioning fee market. The wider adoption of Bitcoin is even more effective than a quota at pushing up fees. However, it is equally easy to argue from the same data that wider adoption has caused wallet users to become much more effective at fee selection, which means miners have continued to accept whatever fees are available, no matter how small. Only where there has been an element of scarcity have we seen miners do anything but take whatever is offered. It seems difficult to argue that there has been any sort of fee market emerge to date other than as a result of scarcity during the stress tests.</summary>
