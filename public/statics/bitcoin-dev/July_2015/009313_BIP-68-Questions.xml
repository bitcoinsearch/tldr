    <summary>Rusty Russell wrote a message to Mark, which stated that the code in BIP 68 compared the input's nSequence against the transaction's nLockTime. However, Rusty later corrected himself and mentioned that he had misread the code. Mark ELI5'd him offlist and informed him that the code works fine. Rusty concluded his message by thanking Mark and expressing his happiness about the code functioning properly.</summary>
