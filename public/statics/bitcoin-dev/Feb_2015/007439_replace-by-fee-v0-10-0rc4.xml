    <summary>The writer suggests that relying on 0-confirm transactions is a bad idea and that instant confirmation solutions should be sought elsewhere. The replace-by-fee system is intended to make 0-confirms unreliable, which will hasten the development of safer instant payment solutions. The writer argues that it's better to work on developing better solutions rather than wasting time debating whether or not to implement the patch. They suggest building a decentralized clearing network would be a more productive use of time. Ultimately, the goal is to have a working tool ready for when zeroconf completely fails.</summary>
