    <summary>Jan Vornberger is currently working on a Bitcoin point of sale terminal that utilizes a Raspberry Pi to display QR codes and provide payment requests via NFC. The device can receive transactions offline through Bluetooth. Vornberger hopes to standardize the process and has documented his experience implementing NFC and offline payments, listing various scenarios to consider during implementation.Currently, the terminal is performing scenario 6 and 7, and TBIP75 suggests changing 'bt' into 'r1' for expressing votes. A wallet should attempt all or multiple mechanisms provided in parallel and proceed with whichever completes first.The context includes an advertisement for BIRT iHub F-Type, a free enterprise-grade BIRT server from Actuate, posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The server claims to instantly enhance business reports and dashboards with interactivity, sharing, native Excel exports, app integration, and more. This technology was previously reserved for billion-dollar corporations but is now available for free download by anyone interested.Finally, the message ends with a signature.asc attachment, which is likely an OpenPGP digital signature.</summary>
