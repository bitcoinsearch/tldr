    <summary>In a mailing list conversation, Tamas Blummer explained that he was using Bitcoin Core as border router talking to its P2P interface. His reimplementation of consensus code helped him understand the protocol better, aided debugging and came in handy to create a side chain. This work was considered one of the most valuable contributions he ever made. The quality of the consensus code could improve significantly if the community treated it as a buggy and poorly defined proof-of-concept that just happens to actually run, instead of some holy scripture upon which they must never question or change. Although impressed by the secp256k1 work and other modularity efforts, critical review and untangling of main.cpp would be necessary for bitcoin to remain relevant.</summary>
