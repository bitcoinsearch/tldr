    <summary>The discussion is regarding the use of a committed bloom filter to prove absence of withholding in a blockchain system. The comment suggests that without UTXO commitments, it may be difficult to prove absence of withholding using just current block structures and an extra filter included in the block. However, with the bloom commitment and UTXO trie organised commitment, it is possible to verify the accuracy of positive hits via the merkle path and ensure that false positives are not being wrongly withheld by obtaining merkle path proof that they are not in the trie.</summary>
