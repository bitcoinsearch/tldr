    <summary>suggests that a standard for passing partially signed transactions around might make sense, potentially as a future extension to BIP70. The goal of this standard would be to allow users to have a choice of hardware signing devices, local software, and third-party cosigning services that could all interoperate out of the box to enable easy multisig security. This is particularly important in the BTC world, where multisig security subsumes the goals of 2FA.By creating such a standard, users would have more options and greater flexibility when it comes to securing their BTC holdings. The standard would need to take into account both small hardware devices and the need to push transactions around on the internet, so that users can access it regardless of their setup. Additionally, interoperability between wallets/clients and third-party services would be supported, provided that users choose to use them.Overall, Brian Erdelyi believes that a standard for passing partially signed transactions would greatly benefit the BTC community, making it easier for users to secure their holdings using multiple methods. With the right attention given to both hardware and software, this standard could be implemented effectively and provide much-needed peace of mind for BTC holders.</summary>
