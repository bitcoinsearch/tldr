    <summary>Peter Todd has released a replace-by-fee patch for the v0.10.0rc4 release, which is available on Github. This version includes a comprehensive set of unit tests and demo scripts. The preferential peering support now preferentially peers with Bitcoin XT nodes that support Andresen/Harding's double-spend relaying patch. Additionally, he will be releasing a version of replace-by-fee against Luke-Jr's Eligius patches shortly once this release has undergone some more testing. Replace-by-fee changes the behavior of most Bitcoin nodes to accept the transaction paying the highest fee, both absolutely, and in terms of fee-per-KB. With scorched-earth techniques, it gives a path to making zeroconf transactions economically secure by relying on economic incentives rather than honesty and altruism. It also avoids the development of an ecosystem that relies heavily on large miners punishing smaller ones for misbehavior. Installation is simple once you have compiled the replace-by-fee-v0.10.0rc4 branch.</summary>
