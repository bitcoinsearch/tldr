    <summary>The author of OCaml-bitcoin library, Dario Teixeira, has requested Bitcoin developers to define more precisely the type information associated with each API call in the JSON-RPC reference. He believes that defining the precise set of types used in the RPC API and annotating the RPC calls in the source-code or in the API reference documentation would make writing bindings easier and less error-prone. It would also have the added advantage of better documenting the Bitcoin Core source-code itself. Teixeira acknowledges that it would not be necessary to extend this request to the deep data structures returned by some API calls. He assures that the bindings take a pragmatic stance of only processing the parameters and return results where a strong type discipline is imperative. The author has addressed a few questions raised on IRC, such as what does it matter if JSON only has a tiny set of types, why does it matter if the types are not even distinguished in the C++ source of Bitcoin Core, etc. Dario Teixeira concludes his letter by thanking the Bitcoin developers for their attention and all the work they put into Bitcoin development. He appreciates it and believes that it is not acknowledged often enough. The links to OCaml-bitcoin library, OCaml language description, Bitcoin developer reference and the type definitions created by the author have been provided in the original message.</summary>
