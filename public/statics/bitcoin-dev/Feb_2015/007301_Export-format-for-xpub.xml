    <summary>In an email, Levin Keller proposed a bitcoin-pub-export protocol with various parameters including the "path" parameter. However, he could not come up with any use case for it. He also suggested the "subchains" parameter with specific guidelines such as comma-separated list of values and allowing only consecutive values or upper bound index to scan. Additionally, he discussed whether a wallet should be able to generate receiving addresses for multiple external chains and concluded that using just the first chain as the external one would suffice. When asked why more descriptive parameters were not used, Keller explained it was to save on data. Lastly, he shared his preference for Unix timestamps or block number for the creation date parameter.</summary>
