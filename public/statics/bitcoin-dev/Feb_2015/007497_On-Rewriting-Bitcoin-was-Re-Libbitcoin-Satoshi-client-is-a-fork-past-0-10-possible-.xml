    <summary>In an email conversation on February 19, 2015, Mike Hearn discussed the versatility of Java/JNA bindings that can be used from various programming languages including Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Haskell, Lisp, Smalltalk, and even some less common ones like Scala, Kotlin, and Ceylon. According to him, it is better to talk about bindings to specific runtimes rather than particular languages. Hearn expressed his interest in contributing to the creation and testing of JVM bindings and asked for suggestions on where such a project should be launched. He proposed launching it as a subproject of bitcoinj.</summary>
