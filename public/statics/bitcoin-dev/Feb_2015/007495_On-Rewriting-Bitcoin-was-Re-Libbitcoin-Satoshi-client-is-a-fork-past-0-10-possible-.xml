    <summary>In an email exchange on February 19, 2015, Tamas Blummer responded to Bryan Bishop's comment about language bindings in a project. Blummer clarified that the language binding would be a separate and independent project, solely using the C interface of the libconsensus library. Bishop had expressed his opinion that including all possible language bindings in a project would be unproductive. However, Blummer specified that only Java bindings were intended to be included, with other languages' bindings being separate projects.</summary>
