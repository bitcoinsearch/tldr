    <summary>The email conversation between two individuals, one seeking a deeper understanding of a paper and the other providing a reference to a document explaining the benefits of having stakeholders "endorse" blocks in the context of Bitcoin. The first individual questions the idea, suggesting it could have the opposite effect and lead to negative side effects such as making the network cheaper to attack and allowing miners to endorse their own blocks. The second individual recommends reading a document on proof of stake in Bitcoin.</summary>
