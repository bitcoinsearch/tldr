    <summary>A proposal for a new generation methodology of HD wallets has been put together by Jona. The method is a modification of BIP32, and any unclear or not explicit aspects should be assumed to follow BIP32. Jona is looking for criticism and help with writing/making the BIP more secure. A link to the proposal can be found at https://gist.github.com/dabura667/875bb2c159b219c18885. If the proposal is deemed worthy enough to be drafted into a BIP, Jona would appreciate if someone could tell him what the overall step-by-step flow would be. Jona apologizes in advance if some of his pseudo code/English is off as he is not good with words.</summary>
