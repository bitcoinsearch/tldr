    <summary>The Bitcoin Wallet includes a MAC address in the bitcoin URI to download the request without relying on internet access or HTTP, and it does not require signing. The name field may work but requires the merchant to set it and the payer to wait for it to show up, making scanning a QR code a faster option. However, the partial address scheme used by some merchants may not be secure against MITM attacks unless the sender sees a human understandable name that's cryptographically bound to the right public key. Displaying partial addresses to users is not enough for security, as they would need to manually compare key prefixes across screens, which is less convenient than scanning a QR code.</summary>
