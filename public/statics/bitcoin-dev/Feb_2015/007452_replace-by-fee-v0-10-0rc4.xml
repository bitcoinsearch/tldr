    <summary>In a mailing list discussion, Gregory Maxwell had suggested that replace-by-fee would not work without rather smart child-pays-for-parent logic. However, a mechanism for implementing scorched-earth without child-pays-for-parent is now available using SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. This mechanism is an opt-in one and has adjustable incentives based on the percentage of hashing power that actually supports replace-by-fee. A patch has been implemented that can improve the total depth of recursion when the replacement is being evaluated as an interm anti-DoS measure in the spirit of belt-and-suspenders engineering. This patch implements 90% of the logic required for the above to work.</summary>
