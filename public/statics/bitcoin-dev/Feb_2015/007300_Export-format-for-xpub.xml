    <summary>The author questions the need for specific HD schemes such as BIP32 or BIP44 and instead proposes a more general export scheme. The required parameter is the gap limit, while optional parameters include which node of the derivation chain is exported, subnodes used for external and internal purposes, and creation date. It is not important which node is imported in a read-only application, and exporting higher nodes is unnecessary as they can only derive child nodes with the private master key. A proposed export scheme includes bitcoin-pub-export:xpub[gibberish]?gaplimit=[number]&amp;path=[path in derivation tree]&amp;subchains=[numbers]&amp;creationdate=[unixtimestamp]. The author prefers unix timestamps for the creation date and suggests Andreas Schildbach's format. Discussions around gap limits and h values for wallets are also mentioned.</summary>
