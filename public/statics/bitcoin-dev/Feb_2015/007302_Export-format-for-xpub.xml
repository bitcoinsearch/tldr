    <summary>In an email conversation on March 2, 2015, Pavol Rusnak inquired about the appropriate gap limit that a wallet should use in the case of h=bip32. The response he received was that the wallet should follow the spec, which currently has limited information on gap limits within the BIP32-hierarchy. This lack of information may lead to wallets based on this hierarchy transitioning to a more comprehensive standard in the future.Rusnak's second question pertained to the h value for his myTREZOR wallets, which are BIP44 wallets that produce h=bip32 xpubs with a gap limit of 20. The response he received was that if it follows BIP32, h=bip32 is sufficient.</summary>
