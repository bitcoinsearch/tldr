    <summary>Mike Hearn, on February 2nd, 2015, looked at Andreas's work and found that it is just an xpub string with a query string added to the end. The query string includes a hierarchy type specifier as h= bip32 and a creation date of the wallet as c=123456 (in seconds since epoch), encoded into a QR code. Mike also considered whether a scheme (e.g. "bitcoin-xpub:") should be added but decided against it, as the only advantage he saw was that it could be used on Android to dispatch intents to the right app(s).</summary>
