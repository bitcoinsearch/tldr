    <summary>Thomas Kerin, Jean Pierre and Ruben de Vries have drafted a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) outlining a method for generating multi-signature transaction scripts. The proposal focuses on defining how public keys should be encoded and sorted to ensure that the redeem script and corresponding Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) address are always the same for a given set of keys and number of required signatures. By standardizing this process, wallets can be compliant with BIPXX, simplifying the derivation of scripts and their addresses by all parties. This is particularly advantageous for multisignature hierarchical-deterministic wallets, as less state is needed to set up multi-signature accounts. Only the number of required signatures and master public keys of participants need to be shared, and all wallets will generate the same addresses.The proposed sorting and encoding standard allows compliant wallets to always produce the same P2SH address for a given set of keys and required signature count, making it easier to identify transactions involving that multi-signature account. Interoperability of services can also be achieved through compliance with BIPXX, simplifying the use of multi-signature wallets across different platforms. Overall, the proposal seeks to simplify the use of multi-signature transaction scripts and their associated P2SH addresses, improving the efficiency and usability of these systems.</summary>
