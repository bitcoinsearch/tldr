    <summary>In an email conversation on February 12, 2015, Luke Dashjr inquired about the specification section of a BIP. He asked whether it supported arbitrary scripts or only the simplest CHECKMULTISIG case. In response to this, Peter Todd suggested rewriting the BIP to state that all public keys executed by all CHECKMULTISIG opcodes would be in canonical order, followed by some examples of how to apply this rule. However, he also noted that there is currently no standard way of discussing arbitrary scripts, so this rule may not be sufficient in many cases. Peter Todd further stated that he would not want to enforce this as a soft-fork or make it an IsStandard() rule.</summary>
