    <summary>The email is from Levin, the CEO of Coyno based in Berlin and a Bitcoiner since 2011. He introduces himself to the mailing list and informs that Andreas Schildbach has released an update to his wallet which now allows export functionality for the m/0' key to run read-only copies on other devices. Coyno already supports the format on its website and would like it to become standard. The Wiki article for Andreas' Wallet has been updated as well. Levin enquires about how others feel about the format and how it can become standard. He also asks if he should put in a pull request to BIP32 passed.</summary>
