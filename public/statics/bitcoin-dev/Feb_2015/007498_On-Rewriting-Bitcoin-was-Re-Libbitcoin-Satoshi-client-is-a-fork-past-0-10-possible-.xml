    <summary>Swig, a tool for generating bindings in an automated fashion, is recommended by a user for creating Java bindings. Once generated with Swig, bindings for other languages can be easily adjusted. Java/JNA bindings can also be used from Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, as well as dialects of Haskell, Lisp, Smalltalk, and lesser-known languages like Scala, Kotlin, and Ceylon. It is suggested that it makes more sense to talk about bindings to particular runtimes rather than particular languages. A user expresses interest in helping create and test JVM bindings and asks where such a project should be launched. The email ends with a link to download BIRT iHub F-Type, a free enterprise-grade BIRT server from Actuate.</summary>
