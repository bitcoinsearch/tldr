    <summary>In this email exchange, the topic of peer-to-peer communication and payment is discussed. The idea of using a previously known address for payment is suggested, but address reuse is also mentioned as a potential risk. Roy Badami suggests using stealth addressing to avoid this issue. However, interactive communication is still preferred to ensure that the payee still has access to the private key associated with the payment address. The importance of proximity is also mentioned, particularly in cases where there is no person present to represent the receiver, such as in a vending machine purchase. In these situations, BIP-70 is necessary to prevent fraudulent NFC devices or replacement of a static QR code.</summary>
