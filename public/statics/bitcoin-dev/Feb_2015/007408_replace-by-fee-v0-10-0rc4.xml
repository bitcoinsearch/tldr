    <summary>In an email conversation between Alex Mizrahi and Peter Todd on February 12, 2015, Mizrahi suggested using the getrawmempool RPC call to synchronize mempool contents. However, Todd pointed out that the RPC interface does not scale well for multi-user services. To ensure consensus between the proprietary stack and the border router, simple rules are used that assume broadcasted transactions are the one and only true transactions. Blummer from Bits of Proof agrees with Todd's suggestion to relax the assumption about the one true transaction and only broadcast double spend if it actually replaces an earlier transaction.</summary>
