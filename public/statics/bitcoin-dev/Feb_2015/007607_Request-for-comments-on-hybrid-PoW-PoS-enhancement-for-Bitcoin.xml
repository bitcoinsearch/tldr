    <summary>In an email exchange, one person informs Chris that their feedback may not have been received because it was sent to Gmail's spam folder. The sender's main feedback is that they don't see how Chris's scheme for incentivizing the running of full nodes is different from actual mining. They request a clear description of why Chris's scheme is better than mining, especially considering the difficulty of distinguishing between full node sybils.</summary>
