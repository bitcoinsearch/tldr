    <summary>Adam Back and Peter Todd are discussing the risks of consensus rewrite experiments in maintaining strict consensus between Bitcoin Core versions. They agree that it's highly complex to maintain strict consensus between versions, but rewriting the consensus protocol is exponentially worse and should be avoided. Back advises against using software with consensus protocol rewrites or variants, as it could result in the loss of funds. He compares tinkering with the digital signature algorithm to binary failure mode and unbounded funds loss. Maintaining strict consensus is a critical technical requirement for security, regardless of political or emotive issues. The goal of libconsensus is to make it easier to maintain strict consensus between versions. While the necessity of strict consensus isn't a political or emotive issue, the consequences of not maintaining it can be political.</summary>
