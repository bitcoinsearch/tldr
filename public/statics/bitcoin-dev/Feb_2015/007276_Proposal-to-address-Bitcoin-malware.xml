    <summary>In a conversation from February 2, 2015, Mike Hearn responded to Martin Habovštiak's suggestion that multisig wallets could protect against malware. Hearn stated that they were already ahead of that idea and provided a link to a website for an alpha version of a wallet that sends partially signed transactions from a computer to a smartphone. Habovštiak suggested using a third party to create a 3oo5 address made up of two cold storage keys (one on desktop/laptop and one on the smartphone) and one key using a third party. Hearn then provided links to BitGo, CryptoCorp, and GreenAddress, which all offer this model.</summary>
