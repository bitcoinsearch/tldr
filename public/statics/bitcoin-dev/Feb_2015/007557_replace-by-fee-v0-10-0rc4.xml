    <summary>On February 22, 2015, Tom Harding and Peter Todd discussed a patch that included the replace-by-fee functionality in Bitcoin. In their conversation, they talked about how to defeat the ANYONECANPAY scorched earth with the patch. Todd pointed out an obvious way to do it, but Harding suggested an alternative where one could pay ten people 1 BTC each with one transaction, then double-spend it with fees of 2BTC. The individual or two-party claw-back wouldn't have high enough fees. This would force at least three of the ten to work together if they want to scorched-earth the payer.</summary>
