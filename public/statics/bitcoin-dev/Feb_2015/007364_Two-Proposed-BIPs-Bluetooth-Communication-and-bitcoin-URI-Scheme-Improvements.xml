    <summary>In an email conversation, Andy Schroder expresses his preference for lower range in a Bluetooth application as it is not yet encrypted and a shorter range is better in case of any vulnerability. However, he notes that the connection can be slow when the whole certificate chain is included. He mentions that the signature verification takes up most of the time and that there may be around 1 second of time transferring data with the current Bluetooth connection, which could affect a point of sale application where time is crucial. He questions whether the latency gain with Bluetooth Low Energy will be a benefit and how much power will be used for just a few seconds of payment. Finally, he asks for a more appropriate place to discuss other issues at length.</summary>
