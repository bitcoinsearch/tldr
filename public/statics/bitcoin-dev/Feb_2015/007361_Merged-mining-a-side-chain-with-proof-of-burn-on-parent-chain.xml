    <summary>On February 4, 2015, Isidor Zeuner asked a question regarding the idea of adding Zerocoin to Bitcoin. He suggested that approaches which change the number of coins that can be circulated should not be encouraged for clarity with respect to modeling the value of a Bitcoin. Instead, he supported having the "sacrificed" coins appear in the mining fees in a future block. However, Zeuner was confused about the meaning of OP_DEPTH in this context. Peter Todd, who came up with the idea, clarified that he was referring to a hypothetical opcode and suggested using the upcoming OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY instead. The latter is a simple method that involves CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Todd provided his email signature at the end of the response.</summary>
