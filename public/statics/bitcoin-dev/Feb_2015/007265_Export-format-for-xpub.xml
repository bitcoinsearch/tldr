    <summary>The CEO of Coyno, Levin Keller, sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list in February 2015 regarding a new update to Andreas Schildbach's wallet which provided an export functionality for the m/0' key. Coyno supports this format on their website and would like it to become standard. Levin updated the Wiki article for Andreas' Wallet and asked for suggestions on how to make it a standard format, including if he should try to get a pull request to BIP32 passed. The process for creating a new BIP involves adapting the template and filling it out with motivation, design, rationale, and examples, then posting it to the mailing list and asking Gregory for a BIP number. Feedback will be given, and problems in the spec will be identified. Additionally, according to a few days prior, Andreas is using an xpub string with a query string added to the end, encoded into a QR code. It is suggested that an HTTP POST-based method should also be added for ease-of-use in web apps scanning QR codes.</summary>
