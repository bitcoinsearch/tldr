    <title>Bitcoin Core 0.9.4 not on bitcoin.org?</title>

    <summary>In a communication on Sunday, February 1st, 2015, Wladimir discussed the details of a tag in git called v0.9.4. This tag was built as a workaround for a change in OpenSSL that had caused issues. However, the releases are statically built against OpenSSL, so it is not necessary to upgrade if you use releases from bitcoin.org. Therefore, there was no change on the site. The tag v0.9.4 can be used by people building from source or distribution packages such as the Ubuntu PPA, which unwisely dynamically link OpenSSL. In response to a question about whether there was a release candidate before the tag, Wladimir responded that there had been no 0.9.4 release, neither a release candidate nor anything else. He emphasized that testing and such should be focused on the 0.10 release candidates.</summary>
