    <summary>The latest version of Bitcoin, 0.10.0, has been released with a minor packaging change to avoid tar complications. The tag for this final release is 'v0.10.0'. Builders using Gitian have been encouraged to start building, and a guide on how to do so can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md. There should be at least three builders and the binaries must be uploaded before any release announcement is made.</summary>
