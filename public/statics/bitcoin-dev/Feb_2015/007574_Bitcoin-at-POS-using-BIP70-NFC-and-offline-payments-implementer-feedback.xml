    <summary>In an email conversation on February 23, 2015, Andy Schroder expressed concern about the privacy loss that could occur with near field communication (NFC) technology. While agreeing that NFC is the best option for ensuring payment to the correct person, Schroder noted that some modulations of NFC are more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks than others and all can be susceptible to denial-of-service attacks via jammers. However, if the merchant system monitors signal strength and other metrics, it should be able to detect a man-in-the-middle attack and shut down the connection. Schroder believes that using NFC for key exchange to establish an encrypted link would be secure enough. A resource linked in the email provides information on vulnerabilities and principal attack schemas related to NFC technology.</summary>
