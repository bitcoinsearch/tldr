    <summary>The message posted on a mailing list discusses the challenges of multisignature notaries who want to convince people to select them without locking up their funds. The email further talks about miners providing services here and the need for collateral to provide cryptographic verifiable guarantees. The author concludes with a tl;dr that Bitcoin users are not adopting a hub-and-spoke project, so they plan to distribute a patch that will change Bitcoin's behavior to force people to adopt it. A link is provided to support online privacy through email encryption. The email also includes a PGP signature and an attachment containing application/pgp-keys.</summary>
