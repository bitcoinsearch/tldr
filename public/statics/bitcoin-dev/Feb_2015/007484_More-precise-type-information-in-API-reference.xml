    <summary>Dario Teixeira, the primary author of Bitcoin.org JSON-RPC reference, has offered to help Dave by submitting a pull request against the docs adding the necessary type information for one RPC call. Dario suggests using OCaml-bitcoin API as a guide, which could be helpful even if someone doesn't use OCaml. To add the custom types defined in the API, they would need to add a new section to the docs, called List of Types, that lists all the custom types and their descriptions, indicating the JSON type used for serialization. Before submitting a pull request, Dario exemplifies with AddMultiSigAddress and lists the required changes for parameter #2 and #3. Lastly, he mentions that if there are several incompatible kinds of P2SH address, they would need to be more precise about which one they mean.</summary>
