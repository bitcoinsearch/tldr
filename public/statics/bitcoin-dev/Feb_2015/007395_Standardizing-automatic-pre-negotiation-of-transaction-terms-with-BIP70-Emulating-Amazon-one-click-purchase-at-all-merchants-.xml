    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mike Hearn questions the utility of auto-filling shipping addresses through wallets when browsers are already equipped to fill out credit card information. He suggests that HTML5 data standards would be a better alternative for merchants to advertise information like their shipping locations in a machine-readable and crawlable way. In response, Natanael proposes a protocol that doesn't require devices to have stored payment details and suggests adding a tag in the HTML form that prompts the Bitcoin wallet about the payment details. Additionally, he suggests using BLE to link hardware wallets with new devices and allow secure auto-fill. However, Hearn questions the need to hold location information in a hardware wallet if it's private enough to warrant such protection.</summary>
