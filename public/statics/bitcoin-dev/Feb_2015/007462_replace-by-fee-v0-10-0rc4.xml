    <summary>The discussion revolves around the rarity of massive double spending in Bitcoin despite miners dropping out due to hardware obsolescence. The question asked is how many BTC must be stolen before it can be considered a massive double spending incident. The response clarifies that the term "massive" refers to the frequency of such incidents and not the numeric value of lost coins added up so far. The rarity of Finney attacks is cited as evidence that merchants generally ignore the possibility of double spending.</summary>
