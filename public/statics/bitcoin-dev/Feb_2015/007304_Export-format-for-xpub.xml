    <summary>In a discussion about the use of keys on multiple blockchains, Andreas Schildbach initially stated that it is possible. However, upon further discussion, it was clarified that keys cannot be used on multiple blockchains according to BIP32. This issue was addressed in BIP43, which fixed the problem. The conversation was recorded in an email exchange between Schildbach and Pavol Rusnak on March 2, 2015.</summary>
