    <summary>Adam Back is suggesting that rather than deprecating the current weaker 0-conf transactions, we explore ways to improve practical security of fast confirmation transactions. In a scenario where users are using a system in a way that it was not intended to be used, it is not necessarily the job of a developer to change the system to do something it wasn't designed to do, especially if the function the user wants is impossible. There is no claim as to whether this scenario accurately maps to the current topic.</summary>
