    <summary>In a discussion about language bindings, Mike Hearn clarified that while the project was primarily focused on Java bindings, other languages' bindings would be separate projects. However, it was noted that Java/JNA bindings could still be utilized from other languages such as Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Haskell, Lisp, Smalltalk, Scala, Kotlin, Ceylon, and more obscure languages. In today's world, it is more practical to discuss bindings to particular runtimes rather than specific languages.</summary>
