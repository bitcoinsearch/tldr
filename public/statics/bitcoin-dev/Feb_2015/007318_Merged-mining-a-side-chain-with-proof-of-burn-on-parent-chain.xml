    <summary>In a discussion on adding Zerocoin to Bitcoin, Isidor expresses concern about changing the number of coins that can be circulated. He likes the idea of "sacrificed" coins appearing in future mining fees, but is unsure about the meaning of OP_DEPTH in this context and how it would affect miner incentives. The original idea was presented in a mail archive post, which suggested implementing Zerocoin as a way to improve privacy and anonymity in Bitcoin transactions. However, Isidor argues for clarity in modeling the value of Bitcoin and avoiding changes to the number of coins that can be circulated.</summary>
