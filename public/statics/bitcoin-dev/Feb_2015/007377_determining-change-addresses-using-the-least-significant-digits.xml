    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of adding a randomized offset amount to payment amounts to increase privacy in bitcoin wallets. The idea is one way to obfuscate payment amounts, but there have been more sophisticated ideas such as adding multiple change outputs or distributing over multiple transactions. Mike Hearn had ideas regarding obfuscation of payment amounts, which he wrote about in a blog post. It is possible to add additional inputs and outputs to defrag wallets and increase privacy simultaneously. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, contributed to the discussion.</summary>
