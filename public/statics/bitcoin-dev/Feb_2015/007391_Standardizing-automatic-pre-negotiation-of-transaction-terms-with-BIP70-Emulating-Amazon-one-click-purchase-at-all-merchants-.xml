    <summary>The author is discussing potential extensions to BIP70, a payment protocol for Bitcoin transactions, specifically in regards to auto-filling shipping addresses. The author questions whether the wallet is the best place to implement this feature or if it would make more sense to reuse existing data from web browsers that already have this functionality for credit card forms. The author then suggests that a Star-Trek-like negotiation agent could be useful for finding the best deals by standardizing metadata. However, the author believes this project may not be best suited for BIP70 due to its current deployment and usage. Instead, the author recommends looking into HTML5 data standards that allow merchants to advertise their shipping locations in a machine-readable and crawlable format.</summary>
