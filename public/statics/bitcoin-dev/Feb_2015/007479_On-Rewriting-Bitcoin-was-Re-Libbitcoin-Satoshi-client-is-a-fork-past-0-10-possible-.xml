    <summary>In a 2015 email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Peter Todd, Blummer defended his use of Bitcoin Core as a border router talking to its P2P interface. He claimed that reimplementation of consensus code helped him understand the protocol better, aids debugging, and is useful in creating a side chain. However, Todd criticized Blummer's work and accused him of "dicking around" and advised him to acquire prior experience before claiming its usefulness.Blummer's response was to condemn Todd's behavior, citing his lack of respect and unprofessionalism. He accused Todd of bad-mouthing the work of others and dismissing people with more experience. Todd responded by advising Blummer not to write long angry rants against others' ideas without reading them first. He also warned Blummer that blackmailing people into using his ideas could make him a pariah in the long run. Todd further criticized Blummer for making jokes about pedophilia and rape on Twitter, asking him if he wants future employers to read such tweets. Finally, he advised Blummer to focus on writing solid code that gets used by real businesses rather than trying to be a rock star.</summary>
