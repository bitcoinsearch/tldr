    <summary>In an email from Eric Voskuil on 02/22/2015, he suggests that MAC addresses and resource names should be encoded using base58. He argues that this encoding method is shorter than base16, better standardized, and does not require URI encoding. However, another person responded to Eric's email, stating that Base64Url is a more efficient encoding method than Base58, and is implemented in more libraries and operating systems. They also noted that Base58 was designed for copy-typing by humans. While the discussion may seem like a minor detail, it highlights the importance of choosing the right encoding method for a given situation.</summary>
