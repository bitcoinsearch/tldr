    <summary>On February 18, 2015, Tamas Blummer launched a Lighthouse project aimed at adding Java Language Binding to lib consensus. However, Bryan has expressed his strong disagreement with the idea of voting and squeezing all possible language bindings into one project. Instead, he suggests exploring a solution similar to what the webkit people did by having gobject bindings, which allow all languages to have their own gobject bridge to take advantage of that. The downside of this solution is that it requires a gtk dependency. Nonetheless, it is worth exploring these options. Bryan's contact information can be found at http://heybryan.org/ and he can be reached at 1 512 203 0507.</summary>
