    <summary>The discussion is about whether or not to limit bitcoin capabilities based on Apple's product capabilities and their war on bitcoin. The suggestion was made that an Airbitz-like proposal could be implemented as a fallback but the overall consensus is that bitcoin shouldn't be limited in any way because of Apple. The opinion is expressed that NFC will likely be opened up to developers in iOS 9 and that Apple doesn't really care about bitcoin at all. It is mentioned that when wallets were initially banned from the app store, it was prior to the 2013 FinCEN guidance and it wasn't clear at the time whether or not bitcoin violated legal tender laws. However, when wallets were allowed back in, it was just weeks before Apple Pay launched and it seems clear that bitcoin is too small for them to be concerned about.</summary>
