    <summary>Jorge Timón, a contributor to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, suggested that the "scorched earth" terminology used to describe the 0 confirmation protocol based on game theory is politically charged and that the term "stag hunt" would be more appropriate. Timón also stated his belief that replace-by-fee (RBF) policies should not be considered an attack on Bitcoin, but rather economically rational for miners. He argued that the system cannot provide guarantees based on such a weak scheme and that non-standard policies like minimum relay fee policies can also be considered attacks on Bitcoin under the same grounds. Additionally, he expressed his hope that Bitcoin Core will have a CReplaceByFeePolicy alongside CStandardPolicy and a CNullPolicy in the future. In response to Timón's comments, Troy Benjegerdes argued that the possibility of mass trojaned hardware means that if we are going to trust the system, it must somehow allow reversal through a human-in-the-loop. He stated that most applications are quite happy running on reversible systems. He also suggested explicitly extending zero-conf double-spend transaction reversal in a way that senders and receivers have a choice to use it or not.</summary>
