    <summary>In this email conversation, Andy Schroder and Andreas discussed the payment_url parameter. The suggestion for an "additional_payment_urls" repeated parameter was dismissed in favor of changing payment_url to a repeated field. However, wallets will need to be smarter in finding the correct URL. It is suggested that wallets try all payment_url mechanisms in parallel as a recommendation in TBIP75. Regarding NFC data formats, wallets receive events dispatched by the Android OS in the same way as other sources such as web browsers, e-mails, standalone QR code scanner apps. While some wallets support BIP21 payment requests via NFC, sending the "mime type" based format over NFC may not be ideal due to backwards compatibility and the long certificate chain that needs to be transferred. The Airbitz proposal is not favored as it causes confusion in certain applications. The proposal was likely made to work with Apple's limited functionality phones. However, Bitcoin should not be based on what Apple wants. There is also the suggestion to improve the "ack" memo which Andreas did not want to change. Although he is not against improving this point, he would like to simplify the proposal by moving unrelated things elsewhere.</summary>
