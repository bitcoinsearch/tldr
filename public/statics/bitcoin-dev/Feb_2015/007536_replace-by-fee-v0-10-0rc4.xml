    <summary>Eric Lombrozo proposed a solution to distinguish between two motivations for double-spending. One is the ability to replace a fee, and the other is the ability to replace outputs. Lombrozo suggested that if the double-spend were to only add or remove inputs, it would be a genuine fee replacement. Conversely, if at least one input was kept but none of the outputs were, it would be an output replacement. A wallet could be built to always do the former by using another transaction to create an output with exactly the additional desired fee. If these two cases can be clearly distinguished, the fee replacement case can be handled by relaying both transactions and letting miners pick one or the other while the output replacement case could be handled by rewarding everything to a miner. Jeff Garzik acknowledged that many use insecure 0-conf transactions for rapid payments and making them unusable would have a negative impact on present day bitcoin payments. He agreed that instant payments need a security upgrade.</summary>
