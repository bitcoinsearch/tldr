    <summary>In an email conversation between Andreas Schildbach and Pavol Rusnak on 3rd February 2015, they discussed the parameterizing of wallets with regards to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Schildbach stated that it would not be effective as it is impossible to predict future BIPs, using BIP43 as an example. They ultimately agreed to simply put the BIP number instead. Rusnak then inquired about what gap limit a wallet should use if it encounters h=bip32, and what h value should be used for myTREZOR wallets. He specified that myTREZOR wallets are essentially BIP44 wallets that produce h=bip32 xpubs with a gap limit of 20.</summary>
