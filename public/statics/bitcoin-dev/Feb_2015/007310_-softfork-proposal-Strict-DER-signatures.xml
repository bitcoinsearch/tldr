    <summary>In this email conversation, Gavin Andresen suggests including a change for DERSIG with other changes for version 0.10. Pieter Wuille responds by acknowledging that it is late but asks for opinions on the matter. He also notes that while it is not a priority, releasing version 0.10 without the change would require additional work in future releases. He mentions that the change is only two lines and provides a link to the relevant issue on GitHub.</summary>
