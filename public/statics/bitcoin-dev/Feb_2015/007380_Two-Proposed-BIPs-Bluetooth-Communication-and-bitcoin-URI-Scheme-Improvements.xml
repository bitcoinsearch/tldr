    <summary>The Bitcoin community needs a person-to-person payment protocol for Bluetooth LE (BLE), which is effectively peer-to-peer. This is in contrast to NFC and conventional Bluetooth, where communication requires a master/slave relationship. Additionally, unlike those technologies, BLE is available for free use by developers without restrictions from Apple or other vendors. The author suggests that the community can develop a rock-solid P2P protocol that is resistant to spoofing and vandalism, using EC signing of nonces. The author proposes a slight modification to a previously proposed "commit protocol" based on RedPhone, suggesting a 6-digit decimal confirmation code instead of words for easier display on vending machines, small mobile screens, and printed receipts.</summary>
