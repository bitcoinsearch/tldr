    <summary>The Bitcoin Foundation has decided to let miners decide their next two seats, but they have not provided the software needed to participate. A patch has been made available by a user who has repurposed Luke DashJr's IsNotorious patch for miners to avoid casting votes in the election that they don't intend to cast. The code has been run in production for some time and is available at https://people.xiph.org/~greg/bcf2012.patch. However, it is not an ideal fit, and applying it might result in some trouble. It is important that people are able to participate with the system as it was clearly intended by design. Some claims from Reddit have been relied on for candidate addresses since the official voting software is mostly broken.</summary>
