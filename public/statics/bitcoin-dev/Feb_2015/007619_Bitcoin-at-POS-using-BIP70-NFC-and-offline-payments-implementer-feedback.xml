    <summary>This email thread discusses potential changes to the bitcoin URL scheme and protocol, with a focus on improving security for Bluetooth (BT) and near-field communication (NFC) transactions. The discussion covers several topics, including the use of a "bs:" or "bts:" protocol scheme instead of "bt:", the inclusion of a unique public key for each transaction, the elimination of the resource name from the URL, and the creation of a new UUID for the secure service. There is also debate about whether a DHKE protocol should be used, as well as concerns about the security of DNS and the potential compromise of public keys. Throughout the thread, several individuals offer their opinions and suggestions, with disagreements arising at times over the best course of action.</summary>
