    <summary>It is being imagined that while walking around, one's photo and MAC address are being broadcasted and hucksters are pushing payment requests for approval. However, it is pointed out that one's face is already broadcasted every time they step outside and Bluetooth MAC addresses are not useful identifiers as they are random. The problem of "payment spam" is acknowledged, but it can be overcome by requiring signed requests and blacklisting spammers. This hurdle can be tackled if and when it becomes an issue.</summary>
