    <summary>In an online discussion, a user named Natanael raised concerns about mixing unrelated things while discussing the prompt display of shipping information on e-commerce websites. Another user, MⒶrtin HⒶboⓋštiak, suggested that the website could display the relevant shipping information before the user adds any item to the cart, similar to how eBay works. However, Natanael argued that displaying the IP address isn't always reliable because users might be using VPN or Tor. Nonetheless, MⒶrtin noted that a web browser extension could still perform the task.Natanael also questioned whether users would be willing to read all the displayed options. In response, MⒶrtin suggested that a browser extension could do that without involving bitcoin wallets. Furthermore, Natanael argued that detailed information isn't necessary and that the system could prompt users with a popup slider showing how much information they are willing to share. Moreover, he suggested that the system doesn't have to share raw data and provided links to anonymous credentials options.Finally, Natanael stated that everything discussed is possible without involving Bitcoin, and that the Unix philosophy should be followed.</summary>
