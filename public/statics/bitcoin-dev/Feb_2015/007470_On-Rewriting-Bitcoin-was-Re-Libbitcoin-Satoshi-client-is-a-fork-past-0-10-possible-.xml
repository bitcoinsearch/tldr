    <summary>In a communication on February 14, 2015, Tamas Blummer stated that the consensus critical code extends to Berkley DB limits or OpenSSL laxness, making it inconceivable for a consensus library to be different from Bitcoin Core. UTXO storage is considered consensus critical but simpler to get right than the rest of the code combined. The goal is to have a libbitcoinconsensus with "the rest" and a libbitcoincompleteconsensus that ties in canonical UTXO storage. It is recommended that software should use the latter when available, but if there is a strong reason to change UTXO storage, one can remain mostly-safe with just the former.</summary>
