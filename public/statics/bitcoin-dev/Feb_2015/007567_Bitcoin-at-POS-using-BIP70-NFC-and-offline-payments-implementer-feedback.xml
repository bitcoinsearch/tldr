    <summary>The conversation starts with Jan sharing his experiences on an issue related to 4k payment requests. The issue is discussed further, and it is noted that transmitting the amount using NFC may solve the problem. Additionally, a member of the discussion suggests that changing optional to repeated in Protobuf may be a better solution than parsing two fields. In response to a question about whether the r, r1, r2 mechanism is implemented in Bitcoin Wallet, it is revealed that it is not yet implemented but rather in bitcoinj.</summary>
