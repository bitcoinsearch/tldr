    <summary>In an email exchange, Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, expressed concern about the potential negative impact on present day Bitcoin payments if something were to make 0-conf transactions unusable. Garzik argued that widely used 0-conf payments are a reality in today's Bitcoin landscape. He also noted that ceasing to maintain first seen policies alone is not a realistic option as the negative impact on today's user base would be significant. While instant payments need a security upgrade, any change would have to be carefully considered to avoid harming the system in the long term by encouraging people to deploy systems based on weak assumptions.</summary>
