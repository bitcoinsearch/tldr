    <summary>On February 19, 2015, Tamas Blummer initiated a Lighthouse project aimed at adding Java language binding to the core consensus library. The proposed language binding would allow JVM application developers to innovate without raising concerns about network forks through incompatible alternate protocol implementations. It would be written using lightweight, immutable, and self-contained data classes that use only language standard libraries, making it suitable for any service framework. The project description can be found on the Lighthouse Projects subreddit. This initiative is meant to expand the capabilities of Bitcoin Core 0.10.0's external service validation library for Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
