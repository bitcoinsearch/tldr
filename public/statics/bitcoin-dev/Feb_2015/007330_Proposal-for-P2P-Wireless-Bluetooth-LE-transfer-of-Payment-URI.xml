    <summary>The email conversation dated Feb 5, 2015, at 3:50 PM between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient discusses the potential risks of broadcasting one's photo and MAC address in a public area. While the recipient mentions the possibility of tracking individuals through facial recognition technology, Hearn points out that people's faces are already publicly visible every time they step outside. Additionally, he notes that Bluetooth MAC addresses are random and not useful as identifiers. The conversation then shifts to the issue of "payment spam" and how it could be dealt with if it becomes problematic for wallets. The email ends with a sponsored message about parallel programming on the Go Parallel Website.</summary>
