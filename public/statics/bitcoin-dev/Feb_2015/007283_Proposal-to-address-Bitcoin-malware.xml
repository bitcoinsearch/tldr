    <summary>The question is how the first signer authenticates to the second without compromising their independence. It is suggested that the second factor displays the transaction and the user confirms it matches with what they input to the first factor. The use of BIP70 is ideal but it is unclear if BA currently uses it. The model is similar to TREZOR, however, instead of myTREZOR and a dedicated hardware device, it uses a desktop app and a phone.</summary>
