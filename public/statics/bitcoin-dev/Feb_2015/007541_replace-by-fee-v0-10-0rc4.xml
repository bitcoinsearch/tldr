    <summary>Eric Lombrozo and an anonymous writer discuss the possibility of replacing outputs in bitcoin transactions. Lombrozo proposes punishing the sender if it's not unambiguously clear that a new transaction is only for fee replacement. The anonymous writer suggests allowing any txout to be replaced with an equal or greater nValue and same scriptPubKey, as well as additional txouts added, but acknowledges that this would restrict some useful actions. However, given how insecure unconfirmed transactions are, there may not be much benefit to changing the current system.</summary>
