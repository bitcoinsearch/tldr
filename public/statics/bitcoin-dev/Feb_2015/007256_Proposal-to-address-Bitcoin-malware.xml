    <summary>In the Bitcoin context, it is not possible to verify that the transaction signed by the wallet matches the request before it is sent to the blockchain. The security of the wallet must be ensured as BIP70 is based on the assumption of a secure signing core that cannot be compromised. Devices like TREZOR and 2-factor pairings of desktops and mobiles are examples of secure wallets. If an attacker can make the wallet sign a different transaction than what was expected, then the private keys can also be stolen and used directly. Therefore, BIP70 is irrelevant if the wallet is not secure.</summary>
