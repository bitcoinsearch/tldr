    <summary>In a discussion between Justus Ranvier and Isidor Zeuner on February 6th, 2015, the topic of hiding Bitcoin client output addresses was brought up. The issue arises when dynamically calculated miner fees create change amounts that have non-zero least significant digits, making it easy for an observer to classify the output addresses. One solution proposed was to add a randomized offset amount to the payment amount, which would be small in comparison to the payment amount. Another suggestion was to randomize the number of change outputs from transaction to transaction, potentially creating change outputs that mimic real spends with a low number of significant digits. Luke suggested rounding change down to effectively round up the fee instead.</summary>
