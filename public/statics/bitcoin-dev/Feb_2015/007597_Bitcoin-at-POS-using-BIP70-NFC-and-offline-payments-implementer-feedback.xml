    <summary>In an email exchange between Jan Vornberger and Andy Schroder on February 23, 2015, the two discussed issues with NFC payment transfer reliability. Schroder suggested running all payment_url mechanisms in parallel and asked about Vornberger's experience with nfcpy. Vornberger shared his own struggles with reliability and suggested limiting how quickly a new connection can be made. They also discussed compatibility issues with using the "mime type" based format over NFC due to the long certificate chain that needs to be transferred. The enable Bluetooth popup was also a concern, as many users have a general idea that it is insecure and may disable it. Schroder proposed programmatically turning on Bluetooth without user interaction as a potential solution. Additionally, they discussed potential changes to the "ack" memo field or Bluetooth message header and modifying BitPay's memo field to contain 'ack'.</summary>
