    <summary>The email conversation between two individuals, Justus Ranvier and an unknown person, talks about the possibility of predicting risk and pricing it. Justus argues that while it is possible to predict risk, the predictions cannot be reliable and trustworthy because the available data does not have the needed indicators for making predictions. He further explains that extrapolations from the past are being made instead of calculations based on recent trends and behavior globally. The unknown person notes that for some Bitcoin users, the price of risk is too high for certain types of transactions they wish to engage in. Justus suggests that using multisignature notaries is a practical solution if instant confirmation is needed for high-value transactions with untrusted customers. However, he clarifies that there isn't a universal requirement for everybody to use multisignature notaries and users can choose to use whatever they want.</summary>
