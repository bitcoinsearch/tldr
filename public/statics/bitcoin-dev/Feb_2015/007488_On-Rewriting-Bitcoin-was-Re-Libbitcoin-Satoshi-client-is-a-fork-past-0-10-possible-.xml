    <summary>Tamas Blummer, a blockchain developer, has announced the launch of Lighthouse project to integrate Java language binding to lib consensus. According to Blummer, this will create an alternative to the border router setup in a production environment. However, he admits that this is not yet sufficient since it only involves checking scripts. The announcement was made on Reddit's Lighthouse Projects page and Blummer hopes that it will lead to constructive debate and voting.</summary>
