    <summary>In a Bitcoin mailing list, Oleg Andreev shared his thoughts on the possibility of a standard way to incorporate Payment Request data into bitcoin: URI or directly into QR codes. He suggested generating a multi-output payment request on its own without relying on a server and x509 certificates. To make it secure, no additional authentication would be needed if scanned via QR code from a POS. Andreas' wallet supports this but he advised not doing it as payment requests can get larger in the future, even without signing, and exploding the capacity of a QR code is very easy. Instead, he recommended taking a look at the Bluetooth/NFC discussion happening in a different thread. Oleg wondered if it would be a good idea to extend BIP72 if there's no standard for that.</summary>
