    <summary>On February 20, 2015, Tamas Blummer responded to Adam Back's suggestion of committing a bloom filter of the addresses in the block. Blummer stated that such a bloom filter was present in the Bits of Proof block store in its last public version, so the idea was obvious but not new. He added that it supported scanning for BIP32 addresses well as the query set extends while progressing.</summary>
