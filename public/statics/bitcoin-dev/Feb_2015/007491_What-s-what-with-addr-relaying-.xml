    <summary>The author is currently working on addr relaying for their C# Bitcoin node "Lego.NET". They are wiring up their DB in Azure and encountering issues due to the varying information present in two different specification documents. One document does not mention that version message now has the 4 byte checksum and no time in the net_addrs. The other document provides this information and also states that Heartbeat is 30 minutes and disconnect is 90 minutes, which the author finds more sensible. The author seeks input from other developers about any additional variations between these two specifications they should be aware of. The context includes links to Thashiznets/Lego.NET, the Developer Reference - Bitcoin, and Satoshi Client Node Discovery - Bitcoin.</summary>
