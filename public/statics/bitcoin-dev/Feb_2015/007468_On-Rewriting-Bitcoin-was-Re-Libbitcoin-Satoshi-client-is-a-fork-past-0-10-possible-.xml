    <summary>In an email exchange on February 14th, 2015, Adam Back commented that while it is highly complex to maintain strict consensus between bitcoin versions, it doesn't justify consensus rewrite experiments. Bryan responded agreeing with this sentiment but pointed out that the maintenance costs do justify working towards formal proofs of correctness for the existing implementation. He suggested that it would be helpful for outsiders to know about ongoing progress in ensuring the correctness of Bitcoin's implementation whenever warnings are made about unjustified and dangerous consensus rewrite attempts.</summary>
