    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin mailing list, Isidor Zeuner brought up the issue of change addresses being visible to observers due to dynamically calculated miner fees. When a user sends a payment, they usually only enter the significant digits, leaving the least significant digits as zero. However, with dynamically calculated miner fees, this is often not the case for the change amount, making it easy for an observer to classify the output addresses. Zeuner suggested adding a randomized offset amount to the payment amount to address this issue. Another user recommended looking at Armory, which reportedly implements similar features.</summary>
