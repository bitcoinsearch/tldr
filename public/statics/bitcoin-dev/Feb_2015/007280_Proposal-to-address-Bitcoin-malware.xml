    <summary>Bitcoin Authenticator is a desktop and mobile app pair that pairs with your phone over wifi, cloud push, and possibly Bluetooth. This app runs on Win/Mac/Linux on desktop and Android on mobile, similar to Lighthouse. The app could be adapted to use BitGo as a third party key holder with SMS authenticator relatively easily. The bulk of the needed work was done last year as part of the bitcoinj multisig work. However, this would involve a server but not a web app. The concept of Bitcoin Authenticator is exciting, as it provides out of band transaction verification/signing or dual transaction signing without requiring a third-party. Brian Erdelyi thinks it's a bit confusing when they describe Bitcoin Authenticator as 2FA and suggests that a more accurate description would be beneficial. Overall, this app shows promise in addressing security concerns related to cryptocurrency transactions.</summary>
