    <summary>In this email conversation, Tamas Blummer responds to a statement made by Peter Todd regarding the development of a stand-alone libconsensus library. Blummer argues that the consensus critical code in Bitcoin Core is practically the same as a consensus library, with the exception of P2P service rules, wallet, and RPC server. He acknowledges the limitations of the Core code base and its unfriendliness to feature extensions due to its criticality, legacy design, and outdated technology. Blummer also states that he is not willing to work within these limits and has instead focused on innovation that uses the Core as a border router for the blockchain. He expresses gratitude for the idea of side chains, which allow for innovation that is no longer measured solely on compatibility with a given code base but also on its services to end-users. Blummer concludes by asserting that his approach is entirely rational and that he has created successful commercial products along the way.</summary>
