    <summary>In a conversation on February 23, 2015, Mike Hearn discussed modifying BitPay's memo field to contain 'ack' as Andreas' wallet would report a failure if the original was transmitted via Bluetooth. The wallet checks for 'nack' in HTTP, but for 'ack' directly via Bluetooth. It is suggested that a non-memo way of doing this check would be beneficial. The relevant code snippets for both cases are linked in the conversation, with suggestions for changes to improve functionality.</summary>
