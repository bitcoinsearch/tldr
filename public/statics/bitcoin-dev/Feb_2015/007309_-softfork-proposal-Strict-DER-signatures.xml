    <summary>On February 3, 2015, Wladimir suggested adding a patch to Bitcoin's 0.10 version to make non-standard transactions invalid. This would require an additional validation flag with switching logic. However, Pieter proposed a simpler alternative by adding the change to BIP66's DERSIG, which is only a one-line change and would softfork. Although it was late in the process, Pieter asked for opinions on implementing this change. If the change isn't made before the release of version 0.10, it will become non-standard, and a second softfork will be needed to enforce it. The change is just two lines, and #5743 contains the details.</summary>
