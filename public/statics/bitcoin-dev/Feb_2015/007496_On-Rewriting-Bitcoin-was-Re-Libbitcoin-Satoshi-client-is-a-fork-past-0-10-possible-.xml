    <summary>It has been clarified that the project only covers Java bindings and other languages' bindings would be separate projects. However, Java/JNA bindings can be utilized from various programming languages such as Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, dialects of Haskell, Lisp, Smalltalk, Scala, Kotlin, Ceylon, and more. Nowadays, it is more practical to refer to bindings to specific runtimes rather than specific languages.</summary>
