    <summary>In a discussion thread, Luke Dashjr and Peter Todd discuss the BIP process for deriving scripts and the need for a Specification section. The BIP process is designed to only cover the type of scripts generated by addmultisigaddress. More complicated scripts would require additional metadata to be shared. Dashjr agrees with Todd that there should be a convention for ordering pubkeys executed by all CHECKMULTISIG opcodes, but it should not be enforced as a soft-fork or IsStandard() rule. Rather, it should be left up to implementers to order them however they please, but wallets can opt-in to this convention for ease of recovery and interoperability reasons.</summary>
