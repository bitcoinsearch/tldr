    <summary>During a discussion between Justus Ranvier and Isidor Zeuner on February 6th, 2015, the issue of hiding Bitcoin client output addresses was brought up. The problem arises when dynamically calculated miner fees create change amounts that have non-zero least significant digits, making it easy for an observer to classify the output addresses.To address this issue, various solutions were proposed. One suggestion was to add a randomized offset amount to the payment amount, which would be small in comparison to the payment amount. Another proposal was to randomize the number of change outputs from transaction to transaction, potentially creating change outputs that mimic real spends with a low number of significant digits. A third suggestion put forward by Luke was to round change down to effectively round up the fee instead.By implementing one or a combination of these solutions, Bitcoin users could protect their privacy by making it harder for observers to identify their output addresses.</summary>
