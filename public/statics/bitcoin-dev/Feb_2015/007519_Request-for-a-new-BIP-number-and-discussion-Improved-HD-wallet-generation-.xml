    <summary>In an email exchange on February 21, 2015, 木ノ下じょな proposed a new generation methodology of HD wallets. However, Pavol Rusnak pointed out that the proposal was missing important sections, namely Abstract and Motivation. The Abstract section should explain what is being achieved, while the Motivation section should explain why it is being done. Rusnak advised against delving into technical details until these two questions are answered.</summary>
