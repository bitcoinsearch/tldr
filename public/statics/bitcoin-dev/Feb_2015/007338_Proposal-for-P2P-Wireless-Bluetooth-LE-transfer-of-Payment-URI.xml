    <summary>The BLE broadcast request is a method of sending Bitcoin via Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The name associated with the transaction is optional and may be a handle rather than an actual name. BLE has an advertised range of over 100m, which can be extended through mass surveillance. However, Bluetooth technology has poor propagation and barely goes through air, let alone walls. To get this idea to the stage of being a BIP, at least another wallet would need to implement it. The prefix matching for payments still feels flaky, and it's hard to know if you could really swipe payments out of the air in practice without trying it.</summary>
