    <summary>Levin Keller, the CEO of Coyno based in Berlin, introduced himself to a mailing list as a mathematician and a Bitcoiner since 2011. He mentioned that Andreas Schildbach released an update for his wallet which provides an export functionality for the m/0' key to run read-only copies on other devices. Levin updated the Wiki article for the wallet and expressed interest in making this format standard. Wladimir responded that it would be useful to standardize on a format, but it would require a new BIP rather than an amendment to BIP32.</summary>
