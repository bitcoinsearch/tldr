    <summary>In an email exchange on Feb 19, 2015, Bryan Bishop expressed his disagreement with voting for the lighthouse project. He clarified that he was referring to voting by pledging on the project rather than on the mailing list. Bishop also argued against squeezing all possible language bindings into a project, stating that it would be unproductive. However, Tamas Blummer suggested that the language binding would be a separate project hosted independently and only use the C interface of the libconsensus library. The email thread ended with Blummer's signature attachment.</summary>
