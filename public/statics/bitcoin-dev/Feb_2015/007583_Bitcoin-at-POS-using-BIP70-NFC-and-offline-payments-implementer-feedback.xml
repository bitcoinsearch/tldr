    <summary>In an email conversation between Andy Schroder and Jan, they discussed the idea of wallets trying all payment_url mechanisms in parallel. They also talked about some reliability issues with nfcpy that Andy was having, as well as how Jan's prototype works with BitPay and Bluetooth. They also clarified that wallets receive events dispatched by the Android OS and don't know if it is receiving the event from NFC. In terms of transmitting the whole BIP70 payment request via NFC, Jan sees it as an advantage since it wouldn't require Bluetooth to get the payment request and for sending the transaction back, but there are concerns about Bluetooth being disabled and affecting the user experience. Jan suggests requesting the permission BLUETOOTH_ADMIN as a compromise. Finally, they discuss the "ack" memo mentioned in reference [2] and whether or not to make changes to improve upon it.</summary>
