    <title>Update to Double-Spend Deprecation Window Proposal</title>

    <summary>In order to influence miners to not confirm double-spends after a certain time limit, an update has been introduced that changes the disincentive from a simple delay to a temporary chain work penalty. This is important for the growth and stabilization of adoption. The penalty is graduated in two steps based on the respend gap, which was first suggested by Hal Finney in 2011. The purpose of this change is to influence the miner of the block after a deprecated block, who in turn is concerned with the block after that. The double-spend deprecation window has been updated to reflect this change and can be found on Github. It is believed that this change is the minimum required to achieve the intended result.</summary>
