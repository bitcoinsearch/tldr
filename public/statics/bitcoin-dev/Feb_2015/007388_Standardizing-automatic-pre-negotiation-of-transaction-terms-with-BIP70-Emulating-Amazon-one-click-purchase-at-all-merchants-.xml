    <summary>A user is questioning why they need to deal with Bitcoin when websites such as eBay display shipping information before any transactions. They argue that Bitcoin is not necessary and that a website or browser extension could handle the same task without it. However, BIP70 is not just about payment, but rather communication of the terms of sale. For example, if someone were visiting an international webshop that doesn't ship to their country, they would want to know that before filling their cart. With BIP70, a wallet or browser extension can inform the user immediately if a shop is acceptable for both parties or not, saving them time. This is just one of many requirements that BIP70 addresses.</summary>
