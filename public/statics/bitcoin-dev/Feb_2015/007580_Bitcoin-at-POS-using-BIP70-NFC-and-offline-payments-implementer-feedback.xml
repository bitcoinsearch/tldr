    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn suggests to defer ECDHE for the simple bootstrap via a session key parameter. He proposes that it could be added later. He also mentions that Andreas' wallet needs to be upgraded to support encrypted connections and TBIPs. A suggestion is made by him that someone should take up the task of upgrading the wallet and implementing the changes. In response, the person who receives the email happily volunteers to do the implementation work on the app side. They propose to take a first step in which if there is an "s" parameter present, wrap the Bluetooth connections with AES.</summary>
