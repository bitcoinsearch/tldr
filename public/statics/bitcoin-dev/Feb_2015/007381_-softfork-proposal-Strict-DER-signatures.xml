    <summary>In an email exchange on January 26, 2015, Gregory Maxwell requested a BIP number. Pieter offered BIP0066 as a response. Currently, there are four implementations of BIP0066 available. The implementation for master has been merged and can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5713. The implementation for 0.10.0 has also been merged and included in 0.10.0rc4, and can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5714. For version 0.9.4, the implementation can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5762, and for version 0.8.6, it can be located at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5765. It should be noted that the 0.8 and 0.9 versions have reduced test code due to many tests relying on new test framework codes in 0.10 and later, but the implementation code is identical. Any work to improve this is welcome.</summary>
