    <summary>In an email from Tamas Blummer on February 12th, 2015, he discussed the struggles that miners would face in acting "honestly" based on statistical measures. These statistics were based on the actions of all nodes, particularly those miners who watch peer-to-peer transactions and assemble blocks.Each node makes decisions based on its own observations, similar to the current method of determining validity based on whether a block time is within the next two hours or not.The goal is for miners to exclude respends, which put the block at risk of being forked off without any compensatory payback. The design aims to make this unlikely to happen either accidentally or through an attack vector.</summary>
