    <summary>A discussion was held regarding the implementation of a patch to make non-standard transactions in BIP 66. The proposal was to add it to BIP 66's DERSIG, which would be a simple one-line change and an obvious soft fork. However, it was considered late for version 0.10 and hoped to tag rc4 soon. The discussion also included a sponsor from Intel and their Go Parallel Website, which offers resources for parallel software development.</summary>
