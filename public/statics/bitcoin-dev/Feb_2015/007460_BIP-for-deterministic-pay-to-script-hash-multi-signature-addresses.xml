    <summary>A proposed standard called BIP44/45 would allow software to comply and express their compatibility, making it easier for wallet software to be compatible with each other. The proposal was discussed in 2015 and questions were raised regarding the specifications section and whether it supports arbitrary scripts or only the simplest CHECKMULTISIG case. Peter Todd suggested a rule stating that all pubkeys executed by all CHECKMULTISIG opcodes will be in the following canonical order, followed by some explanatory examples of how to apply this simple rule. However, there is currently no standard way of discussing arbitrary scripts, so the above rule may be too restrictive in some cases. Ruben de Vries from BlockTrail B.V. provided his contact information at the end of the email.</summary>
