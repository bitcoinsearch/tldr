    <summary>In a discussion thread, Eric Voskuil responded to Andy Schroder's concern about securing the Bluetooth connection in Bitcoin point of sale terminal. Voskuil argued that SSL/TLS is unnecessary if one wants to establish privacy over a private channel and relying on the channel being private makes the entire SSL process pointless. Schroder then questioned whether NFC communication can be considered private, given that an eavesdropper can place a tiny snooping device near and read the communication. Schroder further discussed his work on Bitcoin Fluid Dispenser, which follows along the same lines as his proposed TBIP74 and TBIP75. The post documents Schroder's experience implementing NFC and offline payments and hopes to move the discussion forward around standardizing some of this stuff. The post lists scenarios to consider when using NFC and Bluetooth for Bitcoin transactions, including scanning QR codes, touching NFC pad, fetching BIP70 details via HTTP or Bluetooth, and transmitting transaction via Bitcoin network or HTTP/Bluetooth. Schroder found the latter scenario to be the nicest UX, but it has disadvantages, such as users having Bluetooth turned off, resulting in additional UI dialogs popping up, asking the user to turn on Bluetooth. Furthermore, Schroder described the NFC data formats, such as URI and MIME type, that most Bitcoin wallets with NFC support use. He also discussed his implementation of different scenarios, including his preference for using NFC URI record instead of providing the complete BIP70 payment request via NFC. Schroder also suggested changes to the 'bt' parameter in Andreas' wallet extension, proposing to change it into 'r1' as part of a more generic approach of numbering different sources for the BIP70 payment request. Finally, Schroder asked the list whether they prefer changing 'optional string payment_url' into 'repeated string payment_url' or introducing a new parameter.Jan asks a series of questions related to Bitcoin Wallet implementation, specifically regarding the "additional_payment_urls" field and the r, r1, r2 mechanism. He also inquires about any other comments or feedback regarding the "h" parameter as per TBIP75. Jan provides links to various resources for further information on these topics. The email thread ends with a promotional message for downloading BIRT iHub F-Type from Actuate. It is unclear what the context or purpose of the email thread is beyond Jan seeking input from others.</summary>
