    <summary>Bitcoin Authenticator is a desktop and mobile app that pairs with your phone over wifi, cloud push and Bluetooth. It runs on Win/Mac/Linux on desktop and Android on mobile, and could be adapted to use BitGo as a third party key holder with SMS authenticator. The bulk of the necessary work was done last year as part of the bitcoinj multisig work, which means that there would be a server involved, but not a web app.</summary>
