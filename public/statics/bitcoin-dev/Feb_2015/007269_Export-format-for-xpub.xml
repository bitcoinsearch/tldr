    <summary>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Pavol Rusnak, it was discussed that the "h=bip32" hierarchy means that both xpub/0/i and xpub/1/j chains are scanned. It was also mentioned that this hierarchy applies to BIP44 generated xpubs as well. Furthermore, it was noted that "c=123456" represents the creation date of the wallet in seconds since epoch. However, Pavol Rusnak expressed his preference for a more human-readable format like YYYYMMDD.</summary>
