    <summary>In an email conversation, MⒶrtin HⒶboⓋštiak highlighted the issue with using BIP-70 to address integrity issues in Bitcoin transactions, as it can create privacy concerns. Using encryption with forward secrecy was suggested as a solution, but establishing a verifiable identity associated with the public key is a challenge that requires a shared secret, which in turn needs to be established over a public channel. The process of bootstrapping a private session over an untrusted network using a trusted public key (PKI/WoT) is already being done over the web using TLS, but it's subject to attacks at the Certificate Authority level. WoT, on the other hand, is decentralized and not vulnerable to such attacks, but it's not yet widely adopted for some scenarios.</summary>
