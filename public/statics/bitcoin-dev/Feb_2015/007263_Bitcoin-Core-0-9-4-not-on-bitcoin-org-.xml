    <summary>On February 1, 2015, a user named xor wrote to inquire about the release of version 0.9.4 of Bitcoin.org's binaries. The user was concerned about the lack of a release candidate before the official release and questioned whether it was dangerous. In response, it was explained that the changes had been tested by several people as part of git master. Furthermore, version 0.9.4 was released to address an issue that hadn't affected previous versions of the binaries. It was also clarified that the release was a narrow bug fix backport designed to prevent the software from ceasing to work for individuals who compiled it themselves and received updates for their system. Overall, the message conveyed that the release of version 0.9.4 was not a cause for concern.</summary>
