    <summary>The discussion revolves around the efficiency of querying a single node when an address in the wallet matches the block filter, with the downside being that it relies entirely on Tor for privacy. The use of broadcasting also requires Tor for privacy in SPV clients. The conversation then moves on to receiving BIP70 payments directly and the need to query for block inclusion as an easy way to do so. A comment regarding committed bloom filters and UTXO sets is made, where the ability to verify that positive hits are correct via merkle path and false positives are not being wrongly withheld can be obtained by obtaining merkle path proof that they are not in the trie. The email concludes with a sponsored message about the BIRT iHub F-Type from Actuate and a Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
