    <summary>BLE and NFC are both used for consumer to merchant transactions, but NFC provides a better user experience on Android since users can tap their phones without running a wallet. A dedicated screen can also display the correct recipient by showing an address prefix or nickname/handle upon connecting. Airbitz wallet already uses this feature on the recipient side with a popup showing the most recent person connecting. In peer-to-peer payments, ad hoc payments are common and can be made securely if public keys are in the contact list. For customer-to-merchant transactions, payment should be made to the terminal at the store, which is the trust model currently in use. Cases that don't fall under either category are harder to authenticate and are subject to fraud. While Bluetooth payments may not be 100% secure, they add a new dimension to real-world Bitcoin usability, and developers are doing their best to provide the best possible security given the constraints of the technology.</summary>
