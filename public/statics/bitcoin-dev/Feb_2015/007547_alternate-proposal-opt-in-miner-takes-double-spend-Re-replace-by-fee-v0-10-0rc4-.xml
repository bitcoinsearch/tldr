    <summary>In a thread from 2015, Bitcoin experts Peter Todd and Adam Back discuss the security of fast confirmation transactions. Back suggests exploring ways to improve practical security before deprecating current weaker 0-conf transactions. Todd responds by claiming he developed "easy-to-use and highly effective tools" that made people less reliant on unconfirmed transactions, alluding to double-spending vulnerabilities. Back accuses Todd of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about zeroconf transactions while working for centralized companies like Coinbase and GreenAddress, which were selling centralized solutions. Todd claims his tools have had the desired effect, and he will volunteer consulting time to discuss solutions with a team involved in person-to-person trading. However, Back challenges Todd by referring to this "team" as a company and expressing concern over yet another 100% centralized LocalBitcoins snooping on transactions.</summary>
