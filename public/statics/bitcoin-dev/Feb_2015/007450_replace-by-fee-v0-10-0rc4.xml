    <summary>Justus Ranvier and Allen Piscitello had a discussion about Bitcoin's issues. Piscitello stated that Bitcoin needs to deal with the issues instead of ignoring them and relying on altruism. In response, Ranvier used an analogy stating that if there is a risk of fire burning down wooden buildings, fire extinguishers and smoke detectors should be passed out and not matches as it would make one an arsonist. Ranvier argued that controlled fires are a valid tactic used frequently in areas with periods of extreme heat. It isolates flammable matter into "islands" and causes less damage in case of an accidental fire. He further said that placing oneself in the way of the fire and expecting others to find another solution is not a wise move. If someone wants another solution, they should figure it out themselves. Ranvier also stated that it is unreasonable to knowingly expose oneself to the risk of harm and blame others for not making life easier without changing anything. If the majority decides that moving out of the way and finding another way to do things is the best option to reduce harm for everybody, then it's better to move. He concluded by saying that telling people to keep being careless when there's a fire hazard is the real crime because it would cause more harm than those who try to get the system changed.</summary>
