    <summary>Airbitz is an app that does not allow users to broadcast their photo, only an address prefix and a name/handle. The information is only broadcasted during the Receive request, and not generally while the app is running, but this may vary based on implementation. A discussion thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list raised concerns about potential privacy issues with broadcasting photos and MAC addresses in public areas. However, it was pointed out that Bluetooth MAC addresses are random and not useful identifiers, and a face would be a more unique identifier. There were also discussions about potential solutions for payment spam if it became an issue.</summary>
