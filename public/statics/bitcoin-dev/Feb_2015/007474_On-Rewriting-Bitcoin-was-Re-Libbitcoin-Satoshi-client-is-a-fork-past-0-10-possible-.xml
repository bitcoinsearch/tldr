    <summary>On February 15, 2015, Peter Todd sent an email to Tamas Blummer regarding his use of Bitcoin Core as a border router. Blummer explained that the reimplementation of consensus code helped him understand the protocol better and was useful in creating a side chain. Todd responded by telling Blummer not to assume his prior experience with other commercial projects, and to acquire some before claiming it was useless. The conversation ended with Blummer's signature attachment.</summary>
