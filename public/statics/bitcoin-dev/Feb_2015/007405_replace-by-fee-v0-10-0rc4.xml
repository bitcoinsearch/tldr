    <summary>The core of Bitcoin has an important role as a border router to proprietary software, which indexes the blockchain and mempool. The software assumes that double spends are not relayed by the core. In order for the replace-by-fee patched core to remain useful as a border router, it should only relay double spends if it replaces an earlier transaction. Otherwise, the replace logic would have to be replicated in the proprietary stack, causing the mempool to become out of sync with the border router. This information was provided by Tamas Blummer, founder of Bits of Proof.</summary>
