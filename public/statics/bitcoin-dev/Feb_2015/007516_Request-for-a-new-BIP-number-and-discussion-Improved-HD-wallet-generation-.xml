    <summary>On February 21, 2015, Jona proposed a new generation methodology for HD wallets to the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Jona's method is based on a modified version of BIP32, which requires accidental disclosure of two private keys to compute the master private key. The proposal includes a link to a GitHub gist with pseudo code and explanations. Jona is open to any criticism and help with making the BIP more secure and would appreciate if someone could tell him the overall step by step flow if it is deemed worthy enough to be drafted into a BIP.</summary>
