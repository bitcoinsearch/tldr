    <summary>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Pavol Rusnak on February 2nd, 2015, they discussed the differences between BIP32-hierarchy and BIP44 in terms of address discovery. Schildbach believed that it was more important to describe how addresses should be discovered instead of how the xpub was created/obtained. He suggested changing ?h=bip32 to something like ?t=01&amp;g=20, where t=01 means chains 0 and 1 should be scanned and g=20 means gap 20 should be used. Rusnak agreed with this suggestion and also recommended using YYYYMMDD as it was more complicated than necessary for Bitcoin's use of seconds since epoch.</summary>
