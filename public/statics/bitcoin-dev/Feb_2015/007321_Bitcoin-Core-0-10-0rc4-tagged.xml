    <summary>Wladimir has tagged v0.10rc4 and pushed his signatures to the gitian.sigs repository. Changes relative to rc3 include an increase in block download timeout base from 10 to 20 minutes, increased coverage of DERSIG edge cases and a BIP66 changeover logic. Other changes include example unit tests from BIP66, a fix for priority calculation in CreateTransaction, avoidance of storing a reference passed to SignatureChecker constructors, separate SignatureChecker for CMutableTransaction and not allowing amount changes when AmountSpinBox is read-only in Qt. Additionally, Coin Control first column label was changed, sleep-wait on genesis block during init with -reindex, empty byte arrays now pass CheckSignatureEncoding() and a fix for the CoinControl "space" bug. QT was also fixed with broken unicode chars on osx 10.10 and new options were added such as an -rpckeepalive option to disable RPC use of HTTP persistent connections. This may be the last release candidate before the 0.10 final release.</summary>
