    <summary>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Eric Voskuil, they discussed the advantages of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) over Bluetooth (BT). Eric stated that BLE uses less power than BT, with a trade-off in lower bandwidth. However, the lower bandwidth is not a significant issue for payment purposes. Andreas expressed interest in extending the BT scheme to Bluetooth LE and asked for ideas on how this could be done. Eric clarified that he had not expressed any preference for BLE and only answered questions raised about it. He also noted that while BLE brings increased battery life, its benefits are reduced with larger transfers. Andreas speculated that Bluetooth LE may not add anything for sending BIP70 messages back and forth as signed payment requests can easily be 4kB in size, and speed matters.</summary>
