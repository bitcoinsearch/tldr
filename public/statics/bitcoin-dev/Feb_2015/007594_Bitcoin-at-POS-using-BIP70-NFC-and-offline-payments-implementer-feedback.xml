    <summary>In a conversation about Bitcoin (BTC), someone asks if it requires the BT publication of the script for a P2SH address. The response confirms that it would require publication if the URI served is in a certain format, and explains that the server would need to indicate both the script and key within the script that it wants to use. This method would be more complex but still effective in saving URI space.</summary>
