    <summary>In a conversation regarding Bitcoin, there was a discussion about treating a Bitcoin address as a secp256k1 public key. However, the speaker realized they had skipped a step and should not make assumptions. The proposed solution involved the server providing the public key and the client converting it to an address form, then matching it against the URI that has been scanned. If there is not a match, the process would stop at that point.</summary>
