    <summary>In a conversation on 22 February 2015, Natanael warned about the risks associated with creating transactions that rely on zero-confirmation transactions. He explained that this leaves users unprotected and potentially at greater risk of losing their money. This warning came after a merchant at the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose sold T-shirts and accepted zero-confirmation transactions which depended on other unconfirmed transactions that never confirmed. As a result, the merchant never received payment for the T-shirts. Despite warnings to not accept transactions with zero confirmations, people are still not heeding the advice.</summary>
