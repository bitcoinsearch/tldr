    <summary>In this context, there is a discussion about making non-standard transactions invalid. The option to add a patch to version 0.10 and include validation flags with switching logic is presented as a more complex solution. However, an alternative solution is suggested which involves a simple one-line change to BIP66's DERSIG. This solution would be a softfork, but it is considered much simpler. One person expresses concern that it may be too late for version 0.10, as they had hoped to tag rc4 today. Despite this, there is no opposition to implementing the proposed solution.</summary>
