    <summary>Base43 is a variation of BaseX standard, which uses an alternative alphabet comprising 43 characters. This variation is designed to facilitate the efficient storage of binary data into QR codes. The selection of this specific alphabet was made to closely match the "Alphanumeric" input mode of QR codes while still being allowed in URIs. It is unclear whether Base58 or Base64 take up more space than Base43 on QR codes. However, it is worth noting that the primary objective of using Base43 is to optimize the storage of binary data within QR codes. There may be potential gains in terms of efficiency and storage capacity by utilizing this variation of the BaseX standard.</summary>
