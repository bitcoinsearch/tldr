    <summary>The Bitcoin Foundation has authorized miners to decide their next two seats, but they have not provided the necessary software for participation. A patch has been created by a user who has modified Luke DashJr's IsNotorious patch to enable miners to abstain from voting in the election that they do not intend to vote in. The code has been tested and is available at https://people.xiph.org/~greg/bcf2012.patch. However, applying it may result in some issues as it is not an ideal match. It is essential that individuals are able to participate in the system as it was intended by design. Due to the official voting software being mostly defective, some claims from Reddit have been used for candidate addresses.</summary>
