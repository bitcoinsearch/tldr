    <summary>On February 3, 2015, Pieter Wuille proposed a change to Bitcoin's DERSIG changes that he believed should be included in the upcoming release of version 0.10. The change was not a priority but would need to be addressed eventually and required only two lines of code. Gavin Andresen agreed with Wuille's proposal and suggested that they include it with the other DERSIG changes. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, was also copied on the email thread.</summary>
