    <summary>In a conversation between Oleg Andreev and Andreas Schildbach on February 24th, 2015, Oleg inquired about a standard way to put Payment Request data into bitcoin: URI or directly into QR code. The goal was to allow the device to generate a multi-output payment request on its own without relying on the server and x509 certificates. Andreas suggested that if all one wants to do is send to a custom script (without using P2SH), they should look at the InputParser.java and Qr.java files in the Bitcoin Wallet GitHub repository. He mentioned using "BITCOIN:-" plus the payment request in Base43 encoded form because it is optimized for QR codes. He noted that X509 signing or lots of outputs will make the QR code hard to scan.</summary>
