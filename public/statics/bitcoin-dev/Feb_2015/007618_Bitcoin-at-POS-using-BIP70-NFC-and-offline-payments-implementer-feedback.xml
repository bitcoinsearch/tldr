    <summary>In an email conversation from February 23, 2015, Jan Vornberger expressed concerns about the potential problem Bluetooth poses for user experience as it can often be disabled. Unlike NFC which is usually switched on and left on, the same cannot be said for Bluetooth despite the increasing use of audio via Bluetooth such as using a headset or streaming music to a home stereo. However, those who still switch off Bluetooth can easily press a button to turn it back on. Another suggestion was requesting permission BLUETOOTH_ADMIN which allows Bluetooth to be turned on programmatically without user interaction. However, it was noted that people who switch off Bluetooth would not install an app with this permission, and lamented the lack of optional permissions in Android.</summary>
