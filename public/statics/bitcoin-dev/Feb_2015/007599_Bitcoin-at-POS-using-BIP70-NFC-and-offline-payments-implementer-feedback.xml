    <summary>In a discussion thread dated February 24, 2015, Andy Schroder reported issues with the NFC device that he was working on. Though he had incorporated error checking in his code, the problem still persisted. He suggested limiting the speed of establishing new connections to resolve the issue. The user confirmed that he had already set a limit but was willing to increase it. When asked about the command line tool used with libnfc, the user mentioned using Debian packages 'libnfc-bin' and 'libnfc-examples' that have some binaries. The user also shared his experience with bitpay, stating that he used it for its tie-in with the traditional banking system for cash-out in fiat. The user further explained that this could be the only feasible way of accepting bitcoins commercially in Germany owing to unresolved VAT questions.</summary>
