    <summary>Chinese payment platform, Alipay, reportedly handled up to 2.85 million transactions per minute on "Single's Day," with 54% of its transactions being made via mobile device. This indicates the scalability of financial services in China. Comparatively, Bitcoin's blockchain averages about 73 transactions per minute, raising concerns over its scalability if it were to compete with worldwide financial services.To handle 100,000 transactions per minute, a block size of about 1300x larger than what is currently available would be needed. If double the number of transactions handled by Alipay were included, it would amount to roughly 60 million transactions per block. With each transaction averaging around 250 bytes, ~15 gigabytes per block would be required to be broadcast and hashed by all full nodes every 10 minutes, leading to a good 2TB of storage daily. This raises questions about whether miners have enough bandwidth and CPU power to handle this level of scalability.In a conversation on Bitcoin's scalability, Wladimir notes that the everyone-validates-everything approach is useful for settling larger transactions in an irreversible, zero-trust way, but it doesn't scale. He argues that it's absurd for the whole world to have to validate every purchase of a cup of coffee or a bus ticket by six billion others. Naively scaling up the block size may provide short-term solutions, but a future scalable payment system based on Bitcoin will likely involve off-blockchain transactions or a hierarchical or subdivided system.The writer challenges the notion that on-chain transactions are the only way to use Bitcoin and scale it, questioning the scalability of Bitcoin if it were to truly compete with worldwide financial services. Finally, they wonder if their scalability concerns are absurd and provide their Twitter handle for further discussion.Nick Simpson and Wladimir discuss limitations and concerns with scalability. The author expresses concern about two projects that could potentially increase current transaction volume by up to 100 times, particularly in regards to legal bittorrent file sales and P2P Amazon (OpenBazaar). It is noted that currently, centralized solutions such as Bitpay and Coinbase are necessary until technology can handle it in a true P2P fashion.Bitcoin transactions via mobile device have been claimed to reach 54% of total transactions, but some skepticism exists due to this being almost five times what Visa handles worldwide. The scalability of Bitcoin is then discussed, with concerns raised about whether miners have enough bandwidth and CPU power to handle the amount of data generated by transactions. However, growing market share is difficult, so it is more important to focus on getting users than worrying about precise broadcast protocols. Gavin argues against artificially limiting the number of transactions below the technical capabilities of the network, stating that this could cause competition to be lost.</summary>
