    <title>Proposal to address Bitcoin malware</title>

    <summary>The discussion in the email thread revolves around the topic of security in Bitcoin transactions. The concern is that if an attacker has access to a user's desktop computer but not the mobile device acting as an independent second factor, how can the user be certain they are not signing a transaction with the attacker's address? The benefit of having multiple signatures as a security measure depends on the independence of the secrets involved. If these secrets cannot be shown to remain independent in a compromised operating system scenario, then the complexity of the system offers no benefit. However, given the increasing targeting of Bitcoin by malware, devising methods to verify transactions before completion can be worth the effort. The challenge is to find a balance between security and ease of use for the users.</summary>
