    <summary>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient on February 23, 2015, the topic of using ECDHE for every situation was discussed. The unknown recipient had stated that even with ECDHE, it couldn't be used in every situation. However, Mike Hearn corrected this statement, noting that it's actually a fixed session key in the URI that cannot be used in every situation. No further context or information was provided beyond this exchange.</summary>
