    <summary>In an email conversation between Tamas Blummer and Peter Todd, Blummer clarifies that he is using Bitcoin Core as a border router while talking to its P2P interface. He also mentions that the reimplementation of consensus code helped him gain a deep understanding of the protocol, which aids debugging and can be used to create a side chain. Responding to this, Todd mentions that he has done a lot of work on a reimplementation of the Bitcoin scripting system and will add a FFI interface to libconsensus in the future. However, he warns that there are likely to be consensus bugs in the code and advises users to think carefully before using it. The email ends with Todd's contact information and a digital signature.</summary>
