    <summary>The conversation revolves around the use of CompactSize and VarInt in Bitcoin protocol documentation. The concern is about the consequences if var_int encoding is used in its longer than necessary forms. Wladimir clarifies that CompactSizes have redundancy in their representation, while VARINTs have a different format that isn't used anywhere in the block chain. Tamas wonders if transactions are always parsed before computing their hash and whether it is ensured. Wladimir points out that non-canonical CompactSizes are forbidden and raises doubts over the current concern regarding it. Finally, both individuals sign off from the conversation.</summary>
