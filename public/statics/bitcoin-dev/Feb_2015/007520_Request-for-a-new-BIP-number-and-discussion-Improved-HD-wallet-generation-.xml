    <summary>Jona has put together a proposal for a new generation methodology of HD wallets and sent it to Pavol Rusnak for feedback. However, Pavol Rusnak responded that the proposal is missing Abstract and Motivation sections, which are essential to understand what the proposal aims to achieve and why. Without these two questions being answered, he believes it is not worth delving into the technical details of the implementation. Jona thanked Pavol for his feedback and asked if his English needed improvement or if there were any other comments or criticisms.</summary>
