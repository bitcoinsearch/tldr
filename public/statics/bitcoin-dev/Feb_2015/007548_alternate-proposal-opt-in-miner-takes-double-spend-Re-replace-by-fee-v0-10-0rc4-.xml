    <summary>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-Development mailing list, Peter Todd discussed his efforts to eliminate double-spending on zero-confirmation transactions. However, another member accused Todd of writing FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) about zero-confirmation transactions while working for companies that were trying to sell 100% centralized solutions. Todd defended himself by saying that he wrote some easy-to-use and highly effective tools to pull off double-spends and made sure to publicize them widely. He also said that he would be volunteering one or two hours of his consulting time to discuss solutions with a team doing person-to-person trading. However, the other member accused him of wanting to create yet another 100% centralized LocalBitcoins snooping on users' transactions. In the email, Todd also shared a link to his previous post titled "Eliminating double-spends with two-party self-escrow for high-value transactions," which discusses using CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY to prevent double-spending.</summary>
