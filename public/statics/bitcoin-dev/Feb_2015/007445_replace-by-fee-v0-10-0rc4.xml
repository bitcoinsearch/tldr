    <summary>Justus Ranvier suggests that honest node operators could blacklist peers who relay replace-by-fee transactions and publish an IP address list of those peers. However, these solutions are not compatible with decentralized networks as they can lead to unfair punishment for poor connectivity that may be out of control and require a significant amount of hands-on maintenance. The inability to prevent sybil attacks also poses a challenge to these suggestions. Peter Todd responds to the email thread and explains why such solutions are incompatible with a decentralized system.</summary>
