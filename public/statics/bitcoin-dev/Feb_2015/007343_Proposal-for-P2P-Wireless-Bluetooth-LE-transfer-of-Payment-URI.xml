    <summary>The context describes a discussion on the security concerns related to Bluetooth technology in Bitcoin payments. The conversation highlights that MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks can be carried out by receiving the initial broadcast and then jamming the original signal, making it difficult to secure Bluetooth 100%. Although using a CA or other identity server could help, ad-hoc person-to-person payments would be excluded, and an active internet connection would be required to reach the CA.One alternative to securing Bluetooth is to use proximity as a substitute for identity, requiring NFC to kick-start the connection; however, at that point, QR codes might be more practical. The BIP mentioned in the context is not trying to provide bullet-proof security but instead, the best-possible security given the constraints of Bluetooth technology.Despite the security risks associated with Bluetooth, its usability is enhanced in common scenarios. The context compares the situation to lock-picking; while there are big security holes in some technologies, people still use them because going in and out is worth the risk. Bluetooth payments offer a new dimension to real-world Bitcoin usability, and it's up to us to decide whether to shut it down because it can't be made perfect or do the best we can and move forward.</summary>
