    <summary>The email concerns the implementation of Bitcoin's Taproot addresses in bitcoinj, and the need for testing against a wallet that can receive to P2TR and spend back. The author shares a transaction they did days ago which creates a P2TR output, and provides steps taken for the transaction. These steps include creating a blank descriptor wallet with private keys disabled, importing TPUB descriptor in wallet, creating a new bech32m address, and sending some bitcoin from another wallet. The author suggests adding test vectors in BIP 86 for TPRV for follow things suggested by Anthony Towns in last email.</summary>
