    <summary>The email is from Lord His Excellency James HRMH of Hougun Manor &amp; Glencoe &amp; British Empire, who advocates against procrastination and believes that solutions should be implemented as soon as possible. The email is signed off by Damian A. James Williamson, representing Willtech, go-overt.com, DUIGCO API, among other projects. The email includes the contact information for Willtech and Mr. Williamson.The email also highlights a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about Bitcoin Core potentially ceasing to function in 2038 due to assertion checking if the current time is non-negative and the whole chain halting after reaching median time 0xffffffff in 2106. The email wonders if these issues can be fixed in a soft-fork way instead of a hard fork.</summary>
