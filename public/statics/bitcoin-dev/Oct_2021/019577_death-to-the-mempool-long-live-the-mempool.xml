    <summary>In an email conversation, the issue of failure mode in L1 and L2 protocols was discussed. While direct connection to pools is possible, it's not reliable for most pre-signed txs protocols to use the Bitcoin tx relay network to propagate time-sensitive transactions securely. L2 protocols cannot rely on the current L1 network for timely confirmation, creating a strong incentive for their users/stakeholders to directly connect to mining pools. There is a suggestion for an opt-in publicly accessible "overlay" network to relay miner-incentive compatible transactions with higher DOS limits. The question of who should pay for relay arises, and a sketch is proposed where miners pay relayers to get high-paying transaction packages. Issues like proving the validity of transactions and getting actual transaction data need to be addressed.</summary>
