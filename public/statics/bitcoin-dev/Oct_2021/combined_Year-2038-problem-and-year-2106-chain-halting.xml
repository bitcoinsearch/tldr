    <title>Combined summary - Year 2038 problem and year 2106 chain halting</title>

    <summary>Bitcoin Core is facing potential issues related to timestamp overflow that may cause it to stop working in 2038 and halt the entire chain after reaching median time 0xffffffff in 2106. The Bitcoin development community has discussed the possibility of a "wraparound" timestamp issue and proposed solutions such as adding an additional rule for a 64-bit (or higher) timestamp in the coinbase transaction or using a similar scheme for nLockTime. However, changing the timestamp datatype could cause hardware incompatibility and require a hard fork, making it difficult to implement. Lord His Excellency James HRMH of Hougun Manor &amp; Glencoe &amp; British Empire advocates against procrastination and believes that solutions should be implemented as soon as possible.A recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list brought up the issue of Bitcoin Core's functionality after the year 2038 due to assertion checking if the current time is non-negative, and there is uncertainty about whether these issues can be resolved through a soft-fork solution. One proposed solution is to add a new rule where the block timestamp plus k*2^32 may not be greater than the current time plus two hours, but this would cause a hardfork in the year 2106. Another proposed solution is to store a 'k' value representing the most significant 32 bits of a 64-bit timestamp in all cases where time is used to avoid confusion around whether timestamp zero is related to 1970 or 2106 or some higher year. This is a hardfork but not one that needs to take effect for many years, and ideally requires upgrading every node that can be upgraded.To address the issue of timestamp overflow in the future, a proposed solution is to add a 'k' value representing the most significant 32 bits of a 64-bit timestamp to be stored in all cases where time is used. Skipping 'k' could cause problems related to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY or nLockTime. Another suggestion is to add the 'k' value to the coinbase transaction and combining two 32-bit values from the block header and the coinbase transaction. Additionally, adding the 'k' value to the nLockTime field in a similar way as transaction witness was added in Segwit may be necessary. While this is a hardfork, it's not one that needs to take effect for many years, and as such, anything can be done as long as it doesn't change anything now.Bitcoin's timestamp rules state that the block timestamp cannot exceed 2^32, which will cause Bitcoin to "die" on or around February 7, 2106. A proposed solution suggests changing the rules so that the block timestamp plus k*2^32 may not be greater than the current time plus two hours, where k is an integer with the same value for both calculations. This would cause a hardfork in 2106, approximately 85.5 years from now, by which time 95% of nodes are expected to have updated.In addition, Bitcoin is facing potential issues related to timestamp overflow in transactions due to the limitation of a 32-bit timestamp. The proposed solution suggests introducing a new variable 'k' representing the most significant 32 bits of a 64-bit timestamp, to be stored in all cases where time is used. However, concerns were raised that skipping 'k' could cause problems related to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY or nLockTime. Therefore, it is recommended to add the 'k' value to the coinbase transaction and combine the lower bits from the block header and higher bits from the coinbase transaction. Additionally, adding the 'k' value to the transaction nLockTime field is necessary because after reaching 0x0000000100000000, all off-chain transactions with timelocks around 0x00000000ffffffff will be additionally timelocked for the next N years. Although this proposal is a hardfork, it kicks in way into the future, and anything can be done as long as it doesn't change anything now.Furthermore, a conversation about the Bitcoin development community recently discussed the possibility of a "wraparound" timestamp issue, where if a series of blocks has a timestamp of 0xFFFFFFFF, it could potentially halt the chain for old clients. One proposed solution is to include an additional rule that requires a 64-bit (or higher) timestamp to be present in the coinbase transaction, with similar rules translated to the appropriate bit size. However, changing the timestamp datatype could cause hardware incompatibility and require a hard fork, making it difficult to implement. Despite this, there are possible solutions that could be explored if necessary.It is important to follow the rules of block timestamp to maintain the integrity of the blockchain. If a series of blocks has a timestamp of 0xFFFFFFFF at the appropriate time, old clients' chain will halt as it violates multiple rules. Post-softfork nodes increment the timestamp by 1 on each new block starting from</summary>
