    <summary>In an email thread regarding the removal of dust limit, LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH argues that there should be no restriction to the value of utxo's that keep in one's own wallet as change can be created in any value. However, if it is necessary to prevent the creation of utxo's that are considered dust, then it is simple to transfer the value of any dust utxo that would be created in a transaction to the fee. The solution in traditional currency is to round the value of the transaction either per line of goods or per total before calculating the Grand Total, but in the case of Bitcoin, the denominations available are effectively the utxo set and there is no effective way to round the transactions without accepting overpayments as valid. Furthermore, he argues that there is no discipline in complaining that the dust set of utxo's slows down the process of block validation during mining, and that the actual answer to this genuine business concern of database speed is to build a faster database. He also suggests that the Bitcoin protocol cannot speculate as to the future, but it is conceivable that the inclusion of what is today considered dust may not be ill-considered in certain plausible examples. The email includes contact information and links to various projects such as Willtech, go-overt.com, and DUIGCO API. It also notes that the email does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered.</summary>
