    <summary>A pull request has been opened for the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) repository on GitHub. The pull request is related to a discussion between Giacomo Caironi and Pieter Wuille on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Caironi had created three test cases for the SigMsg function in a python implementation of bitcoin signature messages, but he was unsure if they were correct. He had also noted that the documentation and test vectors for Taproot signature message were not as clear as those for Segwit signature message. Wuille agreed with Caironi's observations and explained that BIP 341 defines a common message function for Taproot and Segwit, which is then built up for key path spending and tapscript spending respectively. While this could have been a separate BIP, it would not have been a very clean separation. Wuille did not support changing this at the moment given the state of deployment of the BIPs, but he acknowledged that the documentation/vectors could be improved in the existing documents.Caironi had also pointed out that the test vectors for Taproot were not atomic and did not target a specific part of the code, making debugging difficult. Wuille agreed and suggested that test vectors for certain P2TR scriptPubKeys, derived from certain internal keys and script trees, could be useful for developers of signing code. Wuille welcomed Caironi's offer to write test cases for Taproot and offered to help integrate them in Bitcoin Core and the BIPs.</summary>
