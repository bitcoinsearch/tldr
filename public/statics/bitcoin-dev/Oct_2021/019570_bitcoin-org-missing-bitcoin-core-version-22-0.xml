    <summary>Pieter Wuille corrected Owen Gunden's assumption that Wladimir is no longer signing Bitcoin Core releases. Wladimir has provided attestations on the 22.0 release, and there is no separate special release key anymore. The build attestations can be used as a trust basis. Owen was looking for a signature from the release key which was still being supplied in 0.21.1. Pieter also clarified that there is no new website for the Bitcoin Core project, and it has been using https://bitcoincore.org for years.</summary>
