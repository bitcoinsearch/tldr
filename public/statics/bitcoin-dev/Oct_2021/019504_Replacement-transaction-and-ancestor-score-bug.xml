    <summary>A pull request regarding a bug in Bitcoin's RBF (Replace-by-Fee) feature has been highlighted in a thread proposing the Package Mempool Accept and Package RBF. The pull request, which can be found on GitHub, presents an issue with the strategy of accepting replacement transactions, which can cause users to accept a less economical transaction than the original. The example provided in the comments section discusses how this bug can occur when a user wants to replace transaction A with C. While BIP125#2 prevents scenario N1, it does not prevent scenario M2, where the user splits off a 1-input 1-output transaction, C*, to include the output from B, causing the system to incorrectly accept C over A. The person who discovered the pull request suggests that everyone using Bitcoin and RBF should be aware of this bug. However, they also acknowledge that not everyone may have read about the issue since it is difficult to keep track of each pull request in the Bitcoin Core repository.</summary>
