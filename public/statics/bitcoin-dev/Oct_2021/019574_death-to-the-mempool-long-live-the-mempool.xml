    <summary>The Bitcoin Protocol Discussion mailing list has been discussing the idea of eliminating the mempool, which is responsible for storing unconfirmed transactions. Instead, it has been proposed that users should submit their transactions directly to mining pools via an anonymous communication network such as Tor. While this would reduce the bandwidth requirement for running a node and keep the intentionality of transactions private until confirmed, it would also complicate solo mining and make BetterHash proposals more difficult. Additionally, it would require miners to identify themselves, which could compromise anonymity. However, it has been argued that anonymity is important to maintain the fee market and protect against potential attacks with sufficient hashpower. Ultimately, while there are benefits to eliminating the mempool, it may not be feasible without compromising security.</summary>
