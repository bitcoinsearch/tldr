    <summary>The proposed exercise for improving the reputation factor of various devs and review attention for new pull requests would work best as a secret sortition. This means that everyone must always be on their toes, encouraging more developers to participate without harming their reputation. The scheme should include public precommitments collected at ceremonial intervals, where hash1 is the sortition ticket and hash2 is the public precommitment. The random oracle could be block hashes, matched to hash1 - the sortition ticket. A red-team-concurrency difficulty parameter could control how many least-significant bits must match to be secretly selected. The difficulty parameter could be a matter of group consensus at the ceremonial intervals, based on a group decision on how much positive effect the Red Team exercise is providing. Upon assignment, the dev would have community approval to opportunistically insert a security flaw; which, when either caught, merged, or on timeout, they would reveal along with the sortition ticket that hashes to their public precommitment. Sortition Precommitment Day might be once or twice a year.</summary>
