    <summary>The individual is working on implementing bitcoinj's sending feature for taproot addresses. They are looking to test against a wallet that can receive to P2TR and spend back. Despite their efforts, they have been unable to obtain a taproot address from Bitcoin Core 22.0. They are requesting someone to send them a testnet wallet with at least one taproot address for testing purposes. The person does not care about the safety of their testnet coins, so there is no need to worry about the compromised private key.</summary>
