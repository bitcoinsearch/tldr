    <summary>Humberto Marcolino, owner of the repository https://github.com/bitcoin-education/bitcoin-java has posted about a new open-source Bitcoin library written in Java, with support for taproot single key transactions. The main motivation behind building this library was to have an educational tool and a lean bitcoin library written in Java. Humberto aims to not include features that allow communication with nodes nor any online features in it, making it ideal for developers who want to build a wallet in Java. He welcomes feedback, PRs, and issues. The website of the project is https://www.bitcoineducation.site/ where he plans to post more examples using it. Mohamed inquires about the plan for slack or IRC for collaboration.</summary>
