    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Prayank expressed confusion over two websites seemingly representing Bitcoin Core. However, Owen clarified that there is only one website which represents the full node implementation of Bitcoin Core and it can be downloaded from https://bitcoincore.org. Owen also pointed out that Wladimir, who used to sign the releases, is no longer doing so as of version 22.0. In response to concerns about security, Owen suggested building one's own release and verifying the tree hash while trusting signed annotated tags. As for Wladimir's decision to stop signing releases, he stated that it was a sensible move to decrease bus factor. This can be read in more detail in a blog post by Wladimir at https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html.</summary>
