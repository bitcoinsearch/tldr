    <summary>Matt Corallo argues against frequent soft forks with a single or minimal set of features, advocating for infrequent soft forks with batches of features instead. He believes that bundling unrelated features together leads to the inclusion of suboptimal features. This POV is widely reflected in the community and has strong precedent in other important technical bodies. Matt suggests following the will of the community without overruling any reasonable objection, but ignoring unreasoned objections to make forward progress. He states that good engineering decisions are not made by bundling flawed proposals together to enable political football and compromise.</summary>
