    <summary>Humberto Marcolino, the owner of the repository https://github.com/bitcoin-education/bitcoin-java, has developed a new open-source Bitcoin library written in Java with support for taproot single key transactions. The main motivation behind building this library was for educational purposes and to provide a leaner alternative to bitcoinj, which is too feature-heavy. The library does not include features that allow communication with nodes or any online features, making it ideal for developers who want to build a wallet in Java. Feedback, PRs, and issues are welcome and appreciated. Humberto has also created a discord server for the project where developers can collaborate. He plans to post more examples using the library on the project's website, https://www.bitcoineducation.site/. Mohamed Youssef, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, expressed interest in the library and asked if there were plans for a slack or IRC for collaboration.</summary>
