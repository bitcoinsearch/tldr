    <summary>A bug in Bitcoin's RBF (Replace-by-Fee) feature has been brought to attention through a pull request on GitHub. The issue is related to the acceptance strategy of replacement transactions, which can result in users accepting a less economical transaction than the original. The comments section provides an example where this bug can occur when a user wants to replace transaction A with C. While BIP125#2 prevents scenario N1, it does not prevent scenario M2, where the user splits off a 1-input 1-output transaction, C*, to include the output from B, causing the system to incorrectly accept C over A. The person who discovered the pull request suggests that everyone using Bitcoin and RBF should be aware of this bug. However, they also acknowledge that not everyone may have read about the issue since it is difficult to keep track of each pull request in the Bitcoin Core repository.</summary>
