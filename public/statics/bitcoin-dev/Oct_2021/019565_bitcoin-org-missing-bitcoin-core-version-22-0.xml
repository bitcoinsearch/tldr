    <summary>When a user searches for "download bitcoin core," the top result is bitcoin.org, which is out of date and doesn't have version 22.0. This issue is related to SEO, and only website owners can fix it. However, there is only one website that represents Bitcoin Core full node implementation, which is bitcoincore.org. It is crucial to ensure that the correct domain is being used, as some people have registered domains that use punycode, look similar, and spread malware. The user suggests removing download links from bitcoin.org and linking to bitcoincore.org instead. To implement this change, they can open an issue in the website repository and tag Cobra, who owns the website and domain. Additionally, users could try a derivative of Bitcoin Core called Bitcoinknots maintained by Luke Dashjr.</summary>
