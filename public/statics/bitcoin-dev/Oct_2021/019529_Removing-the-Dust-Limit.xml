    <title>Removing the Dust Limit</title>

    <summary>The email discusses the restrictions on the value of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that can be kept in one's own wallet. The wallet should avoid creating UTXOs below the current dust limit, but it cannot guarantee it. Additionally, the wallet should avoid including UTXOs that are more expensive to include than their value at the time a transaction is created. However, manual UTXO selection may consider including these UTXOs since it is "my money". The email also addresses concerns about the slow validation process during mining due to the dust set of UTXOs. However, the solution is to build a faster database instead of complaining. The Bitcoin protocol cannot speculate about the future, but there are conceivable scenarios where including what is considered dust today may not be ill-considered. The signature at the end includes contact information and links to various projects such as willtech.com.au and duigco.org DUIGCO API. The email concludes by stating that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered.</summary>
