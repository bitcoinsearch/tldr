    <summary>Upon searching for "download bitcoin core," the top result is bitcoin.org which is outdated and lacks version 22.0. This has led to confusion as there are two sites that appear to represent Bitcoin Core. To resolve this, it is suggested that the download links be removed from bitcoin.org and instead direct users to bitcoincore.org.</summary>
