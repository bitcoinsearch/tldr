    <summary>Bitcoin Core is facing a potential issue that may cause it to stop working in 2038. This is due to assertion checking if the current time is non-negative. Additionally, the entire chain will halt after reaching median time 0xffffffff in 2106. These concerns were discussed on the BitcoinTalk forum and there is uncertainty about whether these issues can be resolved through a soft-fork solution. It remains to be seen how this will affect the future of Bitcoin Core.</summary>
