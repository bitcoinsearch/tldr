    <summary>On October 15th, 2021, Anthony Towns posted on the bitcoin-dev forum discussing whether any testnet faucets would accept bech32m addresses directly. Although unsure, he mentioned that the same process works with testnet. There are indeed faucets that accept such addresses, one of which is Bitcoin Faucet, but it requires the use of a bech32 checksum instead of bech32m. For example, sending to tb1p84x2ryuyfevgnlpnxt9f39gm7r68gwtvllxqe5w2n5ru00s9aqus27cytz works fine, whereas sending to tb1p84x2ryuyfevgnlpnxt9f39gm7r68gwtvllxqe5w2n5ru00s9aquslzggwq does not work. The same applies to pages like mempool.space, where users must use bech32 instead of bech32m to send to taproot from some old faucets or browse taproot addresses from some old block explorers.</summary>
