    <summary>The removal of the mempool would not naturally resolve all current issues inherent in package relay and replace by fee (RBF) rules, according to a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The post argued that miners still need to have some policy for evicting transactions from their pool of transactions even if they maintain an "accept any transaction" endpoint. Instead of immediate eviction, the post proposed a lazy eviction algorithm based on a garbage collector, with unconfirmed transactions acting as objects that point to other objects, and primitive objects represented by UTXOs of confirmed transactions. The algorithm enables conflicting transactions to be temporarily retained in the mempool until the next GC triggers when conflicting transactions are resolved by whoever is higher-feerate.</summary>
