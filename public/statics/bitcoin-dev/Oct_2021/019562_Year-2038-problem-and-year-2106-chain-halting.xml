    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list centers on a proposal to change the definition of timestamps, which is considered a hard fork. The author argues that since this is already a hard fork, it might as well include other necessary changes such as transaction locking. However, the proposal would only take effect in 2106, meaning it has no bearing on consensus rules until then. The author suggests that despite difficulties in achieving consensus for forks, everyone should be able to update their Bitcoin at least once in the next 85 years. Another participant in the discussion points out that a hard fork requires upgrading every node or obtaining the operator's consent to lose the node.</summary>
