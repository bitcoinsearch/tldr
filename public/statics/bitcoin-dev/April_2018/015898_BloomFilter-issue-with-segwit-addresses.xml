    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Andreas Brekken brought up the issue of privacy leaks when using bloom filters to identify address clusters. Jonas Schnelli suggested an extension for BIP37 to match data elements in the witness against the filter. Jim Posen proposed adding outpoints owned by the wallet to the filter instead of elements in the input script or witness data. However, it was noted that bloom filters are not good for privacy anyway, so this may be a non-issue. Bitcoin Core is not an entity that can reject or extend a feature, so someone needs to come up with a proposal in the form of a pull request.</summary>
