    <summary>A compatibility issue between segwit and BIP37 (Bloom Filtering) has been brought to attention by Anton, a developer on the bitcoinj mailing list. The issue concerns inputs and outputs containing no data elements that would cause a match for the filter, resulting in some of the size improvements of segwit being nullified. A workaround using an OP_RETURN output with a matching public key was suggested, but it is not optimal. It is being considered if Bitcoin Core would be willing to extend the BIP37 matching rules such that data elements in the witness are also matched against.On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a discussion has been started regarding the use of outpoints in filters for standard transactions. Jim Posen suggested adding the outpoints owned by the wallet to the filter instead of elements in the input script or witness data. However, this could compound the privacy leak identified by Jonas Nick leading to very detailed clusters. Bloom filters are already known not to be good for privacy. Jonas Schnelli suggested inserting the witness data into the bloom filter as a possible solution. Any changes will need to be implemented through a proposal in the form of a pull request.Christian Decker raised concerns about privacy leaks with BIP 158 implementation, but noted that bloom filters are not good for privacy anyway. Jim Posen suggested adding outpoints owned by the wallet to the filter and watching for those instead of elements in the input script or witness data, while Jonas Schnelli suggested inserting the witness data into the bloom filter as a possible solution. It was mentioned that a pull request would need to be made for any changes to be implemented. Anton, a developer on the bitcoinj mailing list, highlighted a compatibility issue between segwit and BIP37 (Bloom Filtering). The issue pertains only to P2WPKH and transactions without change outputs. In such cases, inputs and outputs contain no data elements that would cause a match for the filter. Bitcoin Knots supports the MSG_FILTERED_WITNESS_BLOCK extension to download witness data while BIP158 is still being implemented and deployed. However, light clients currently have no way to verify the witness data is correct. It is suggested to look for specific COutPoints for matching, which should work already with standard BIP37. It is understood that the plan is to deprecate and remove BIP37 entirely once BIP158 is implemented and deployed.</summary>
