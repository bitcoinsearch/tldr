    <summary>In a recent email exchange between Karl-Johan Alm and Peter Todd via the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, the discussion concerned whether or not RBF could be used with final transactions (sequence=0xffffffff). Peter Todd stated that his full-replace-by-fee tree ignores this convention and miners can include conflicting transactions with higher fees even if they are aware of previous transactions. This means "full replace-by-fee" will become the norm, where nSequence is ignored for purposes of RBF. The convention of "nSequence=0xFFFFFFFF means opt-OUT of RBF" is only followed by full nodes running standard bitcoind, but miners are not prevented from running patched bitcoind that ignores this rule. Therefore, wallets should be designed to only trust transactions that have confirmations, making it difficult for malicious actors to exploit the replace-by-fee feature.</summary>
