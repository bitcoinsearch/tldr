    <summary>On April 13th, 2018, Jonas Schnelli responded to a suggestion made by Andreas Schildbach regarding the suboptimal manner in which Bitcoin Core matches data elements and outpoints owned by the wallet. Andreas had proposed that Bitcoin Core extend the BIP37 matching rules so that witness data elements could also be matched against. Jonas suggested that instead of creating an extension for BIP37, inserting the witness data into the bloom filter seemed to be an easy solution. He also pointed out that Bitcoin Core is not an entity that can decide on features - proposals need to be presented through pull requests. The conversation occurred on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
