    <summary>The email conversation between Karl-Johan Alm and Peter Todd discussed the possibility of using full replace-by-fee, which is allegedly used by a significant minority of miners. Alm questioned whether final transactions with sequence=0xffffffff could be RBF'd, but Todd's full-replace-by-fee tree ignores this rule. Todd also noted that his system uses preferential peering to ensure it is well connected with like-minded peers on the network. The email concludes with Todd's signature.</summary>
