    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Christian Decker has raised privacy concerns regarding the BIP 158 implementation. He suggests that the implementation could compound the privacy leak identified by Jonas Nick where address clusters were identified through bloom filters. However, he notes that bloom filters are not good for privacy anyway and so this may not be an issue. Another participant in the discussion, Jim Posen, suggests adding the outpoints owned by the wallet to the filter and watching for those instead of elements in the input script or witness data. Jonas Schnelli suggests an extension for BIP37 would make sense and inserting the witness data into the bloom filter would be an easy solution. The conversation continues on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
