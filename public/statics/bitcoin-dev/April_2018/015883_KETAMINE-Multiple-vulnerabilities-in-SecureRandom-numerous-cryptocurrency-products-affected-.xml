    <summary>The discussion in the given context is about the implementation of Web Cryptography API by Internet Explorer. The issue with Internet Explorer is that it implements the Web Cryptography API under window.msCrypto instead of window.crypto, so unless msCrypto.getRandomValues is used, high-quality entropy will not have been used by any of these libraries under Internet Explorer. This impacts jsbn only normally since all others from the time getRandomValues was available are supposed to implement both. The author of the message, Jason Davies, has provided links to several repositories including Bitcoin transactions made simple, Zcash wallets made simple and Bitcoin wallets made simple. Additionally, he also shared links to get the torrent dynamic blocklist, check the 10 M passwords list, anti-spies and private torrents, dynamic blocklist, Peersm, torrent-live, node-Tor, and GitHub pages.</summary>
