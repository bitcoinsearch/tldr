    <summary>A user has shared some ideas regarding a transaction relay protocol and is seeking feedback. The user conducted emulation and simulation tests and found that 90% of INV messages sent by public-IP nodes are idle duplicates, which consumes significant bandwidth. The proposed idea involves filtering transactions while joining the network to decrease redundancy. Each new node will agree on a filter with each of the eight nodes it connects to, and the nodes will relay only a subset of transactions. The protocol aims to maintain zero-trust, decentralization guarantees, robustness, and latency while reducing redundancy. To ensure consistency, redundancy in sending INV messages over two links will be kept. To make the system attack-resistant, the user proposes two extensions: set reconciliation and rotating the filters every N minutes.</summary>
