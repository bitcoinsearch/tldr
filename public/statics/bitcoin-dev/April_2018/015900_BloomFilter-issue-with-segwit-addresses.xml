    <summary>A discussion has been started on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the use of outpoints in filters for standard transactions. Jim Posen suggested adding the outpoints owned by the wallet to the filter and watch for those instead of elements in the input script or witness data. Christian Decker responded, stating that this would compound the privacy leak identified by Jonas Nick, which could lead to very detailed clusters. However, he also noted that bloom filters aren't good for privacy anyway. Jonas Schnelli agreed that the current method seems suboptimal and suggested inserting the witness data into the bloom filter as a possible solution. It was mentioned that a proposal (pull request) would need to be made for any changes to be implemented.</summary>
