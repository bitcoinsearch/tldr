    <summary>Tyler Hawkins has proposed a new method called Numerifides, which allows for the registration of human-readable names and arbitrary data on the Bitcoin network. This includes mapping such as username to GPG key, domain to IP address, and Lightning node Alias to URI. The proposal includes a new transaction type called "numerifides" transactions, which require locking up Bitcoin for a certain amount of time to discourage "namesquatting". Transactions also include a puzzle to allow for community consensus revocation of highly contested names or "squatted" name mappings. The transactions are Replace-By-Fee (RBF), allowing for censorship resistance and high-fee transactions. Numerifides aims to solve Zooko's triangle by being secure, decentralized, and human meaningful. Tyler Hawkins has shared the full working spec for Numerifides on GitHub and is looking for feedback and possible enhancements. It is proposed that a P2WSH defining the mapping that is gossiped about outside of the Bitcoin network could be a possible change to incentivize filling blocks with data like this.The mining process is done by incrementing a nonce in the registration data off-chain to prevent "namesquatting" like we see on Namecoin. A secondary network is created for gossiping name-&gt;data mappings, which is rooted from the numerifide transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Numerifides solves Zooko's triangle of Secure, Decentralized, and Human Meaningful. Tyler welcomes feedback and possible enhancements, and the full working spec can be found at https://github.com/tyzbit/numerifides.Overall, Tyler Hawkins' Numerifides proposal offers a new way to register human-readable names and arbitrary data on the Bitcoin network.
