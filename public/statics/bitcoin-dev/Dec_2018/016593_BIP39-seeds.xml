    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Aymeric Vitte raised a question about the probability of generating a "valid" BIP39 seed from randomly chosen words from a 2048-word dictionary. Pavol Rusnak responded with the probabilities for 12 and 24 words, which are 1:16 and 1:256, respectively. While these ratios are not ideal, they will be improved in the upcoming SLIP39 standard. The SLIP39 standard is a proposal by SatoshiLabs that aims to improve the flexibility and security of multi-signature wallets by allowing users to split their seed phrases into multiple shares.The conversation also touched upon whether the SLIP39 standard would require a BIP39 seed or if it would work with any seed format. There was no clear answer provided in the discussion, but it's worth noting that the SLIP39 proposal does mention compatibility with BIP39 as one of its goals. Additionally, some of the examples provided in the proposal use BIP39-style mnemonics.</summary>
