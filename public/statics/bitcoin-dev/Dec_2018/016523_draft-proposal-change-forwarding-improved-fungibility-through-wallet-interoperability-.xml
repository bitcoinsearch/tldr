    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, James questioned the usefulness of a proposed method based on BIP32 for improving fungibility and on-chain privacy with wallets for which this is not a primary concern. He asked for clarification on the UX and how a wallet developer might implement this feature. James also questioned why someone who is privacy-conscious would choose a non-private wallet to begin with, and why a user who is not privacy-conscious would bother enabling this option. He expressed his doubts about the usefulness of this proposal from a product standpoint and wondered why it needs to be a BIP. Yuval Kogman proposed the method in question and provided a draft of the proposal that is still incomplete with open questions about the particular format to use. The proposal aims to complement more comprehensive proposals such as BIP79. Yuval solicited inputs/criticism from the mailing list and included two viable options in the draft proposal. Yuval acknowledged SirMeow, Adam Ficsor, and Adam Gibson for reviewing earlier versions and providing valuable feedback and suggestions.</summary>
