    <summary>The author of the context discusses the difficulty in solving blocks and suggests that the difficulty should be allowed to drop linearly as solvetime goes beyond a certain limit, which would be backwards-compatible if the limit is greater than any past delay. Additionally, the author proposes a daily-rolling average DA like BCH as a potential solution for a faster DA.The author also explores the idea of "intra-block" timestamp-based difficulty adjustment, which has been taken to the limit and made symmetrical and continuous. This results in an increase in "availability" but at the expense of "consistency." The objective of this adjustment was to help small coins deal with persistent hash rate changes that result in long delays. Currently, about three coins have tested this on their testnet.Furthermore, the author questions how long it would take for block confirmation times to change and whether a hardfork would be necessary if confirmation times were averaging hours or days. Two possible options are discussed - enough economic interests aligning to amass computing power to get important bitcoin transactions into a block or a group forking the code to adjust the difficulty more rapidly.The author believes that we can learn how to fork peacefully from what was learned when BCH was born and when it split. Lastly, the author believes that gaining insight into how core developers will handle increasing demands to use faster difficulty adjustments (if they respond at all) would be helpful. Overall, while the ideas presented may not be necessary for Bitcoin, they are being researched and implemented on testnets for other coins, potentially benefiting smaller coins struggling with long delays.</summary>
