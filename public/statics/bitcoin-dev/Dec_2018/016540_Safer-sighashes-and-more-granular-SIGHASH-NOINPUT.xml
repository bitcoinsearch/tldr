    <summary>In an email exchange between Russell O'Connor and Dave, they discussed the default RBF policy. Russell expressed his belief that the policy does not require an absolute fee increase but rather an increase related to incrementalrelayfee. Dave corrected him and referenced BIP125 rule 4 which confirms that an absolute fee increase is required for the policy. The relevant code from master's validation.cpp was also provided in the email.</summary>
