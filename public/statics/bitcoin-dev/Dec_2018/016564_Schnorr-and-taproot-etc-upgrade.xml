    <summary>In an email conversation dated December 17, 2018, Johnson Lau proposed a change to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 114, which was previously suggested by Satoshi. However, he expressed concerns about the potential negative consequences of the change, such as people losing money by copying an existing script template. Another suggestion by Lau was to pop the stack after OP_CLTV and OP_CSV, which he believed would save one weight unit per OP_CSV. The decision on whether or not to implement these changes is still uncertain.</summary>
