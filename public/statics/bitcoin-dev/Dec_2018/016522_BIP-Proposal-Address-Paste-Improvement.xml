    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer email thread, the issue of transferring an address from a webpage to a wallet address input field was discussed. While some suggested QR code scanning of a Bitcoin URI or using "bitcoin:" URI intent on Android, it was noted that in many cases, addresses are presented as text to copy. Some suggested autodetecting Bitcoin addresses and converting them to "bitcoin:" links, but adoption of this feature may be slow. The conversation also touched on BIP70, BIP75, and BIP47 payment protocols, with the latter two having limited wallet support due to their complexity. One commenter questioned why this needed to be a BIP, as it was more of a UX detail rather than a protocol or procedure related to Bitcoin. They also noted that every product's use case would be different and asked for further elaboration on the need for documentation. Another commenter pointed out that there were concerns about incentivizing users to use copypaste functionality extensively, but argued that crypto hijackers use the clipboard because it is convenient, not because they can only hijack that method. A work in progress implementation in Wasabi was also mentioned.</summary>
