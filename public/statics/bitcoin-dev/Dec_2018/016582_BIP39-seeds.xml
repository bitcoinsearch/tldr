    <summary>The author of a post on an online forum is seeking information about the probability of obtaining a "valid" BIP39 seed from N randomly chosen words belonging to a 2048 word dictionary. The author expresses surprise at the results and suggests that there may be potential use cases for this information. They ask if anyone has discussed this topic before. The post includes links to various websites related to Bitcoin and Zcash wallets, as well as tools for managing transactions and privacy. Some of the links include GitHub repositories for projects such as node-Tor, torrent-live, and dynamic blocklists.</summary>
