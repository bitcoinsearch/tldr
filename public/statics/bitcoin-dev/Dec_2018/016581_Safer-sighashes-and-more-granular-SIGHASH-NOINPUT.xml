    <summary>The conversation between Rusty Russell and Johnson Lau discusses the usefulness of OP_CODESEPARATOR under taproot. CODESEPARATOR is useful only with conditional opcodes and if it's not needed, it could be disabled to make validation code simpler. However, if it is useful, it should work with NOINPUT. To do so, H(masked_script) needs to be committed to make the position of the CODESEPARATOR clear. Without it, assumptions would have to be made about the meaning of the position. Script masking does not help in cases of address reuse, but it prevents replayability when the same public key is reused in different scripts.</summary>
