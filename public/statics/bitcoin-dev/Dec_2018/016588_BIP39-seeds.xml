    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Aymeric Vitte asked whether anyone had previously explored the probability of generating a "valid" BIP39 seed from N randomly chosen words belonging to the BIP39 2048 words dictionary. He found the results surprising and was interested in sharing them. The email also included links to various projects related to Bitcoin, Zcash, and privacy protection. Eric Scrivner, a remote software engineer at Coinbase, responded to the email.</summary>
