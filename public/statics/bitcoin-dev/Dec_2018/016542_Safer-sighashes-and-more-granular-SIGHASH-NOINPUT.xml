    <title>Safer sighashes and more granular SIGHASH_NOINPUT</title>

    <summary>Pieter Wuille has proposed a combined proposal that includes the addition of three new sighash flags: SIGHASH_NOINPUT, SIGHASH_NOFEE, and SIGHASH_SCRIPTMASK. Additionally, a new opcode OP_MASK is added which acts as a NOP during execution. The sighash is computed like in BIP143, but if SIGHASH_SCRIPTMASK is present, for every OP_MASK in scriptCode the subsequent opcode/push is removed. However, some individuals have expressed confusion regarding the necessity of the SIGHASH_SCRIPTMASK flag and its role in a taproot world where the alternate script is both hidden and general. Rusty, in particular, is asking on-list because he believes he may have missed something important.</summary>
