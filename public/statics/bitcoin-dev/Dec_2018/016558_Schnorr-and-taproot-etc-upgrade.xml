    <summary>In a discussion among developers on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Anthony Towns proposed a change to the way scripts are composed. Currently, a script succeeds if there is exactly one non-zero item on the stack. However, Towns suggested that it would be better for the stack to be exactly empty in order to make the script more composable and eliminate the need for special logic to handle top-level CHECKSIG versus mid-level CHECKSIGVERIFY. The proposal was met with some discussion on the mailing list.</summary>
