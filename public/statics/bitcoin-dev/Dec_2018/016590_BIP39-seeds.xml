    <summary>A discussion on the probability of getting a "valid" BIP39 seed by using N randomly chosen words from a dictionary of 2048 words has taken place. The ratio was found to be 1:256 for 24 words and 1:16 for 12 words. This means that it is possible to find easily BIP39 seeds, even of 24 words, by scanning secret books, documents, links, and more. However, some people still dislike BIP39 as they believe it is easier to write a 32B BIP32 hex seed rather than n words that cannot be chosen. There have been issues with people losing their wallets due to this. Despite this, the upcoming SLIP39 standard is expected to improve the ratio.</summary>
