    <summary>In this email conversation, ZmnSCPxj discusses the concept of a walletless protocol. He believes that such a protocol is only necessary when relying on a third party to open an offchain smart contract. He is generally against custodiality and suggests that one should have control over their hardware wallet or "somewhat-cold" storage. Channels can be created for a hot offchain Lightning wallet without adding transactions from cold storage to the blockchain. When channels are closed, funds can go back to the cold storage. ZmnSCPxj doubts any custodial service would want to mess around with deducting funds from the user's desired payment as it would cause problems when interacting with merchants. It may also lead to losing users quickly.</summary>
