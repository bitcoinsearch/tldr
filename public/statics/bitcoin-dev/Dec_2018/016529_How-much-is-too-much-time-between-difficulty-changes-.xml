    <summary>The author of the context is questioning how long it would take for changes to be made in block confirmation times. They also ask whether a hardfork would be necessary if the block confirmation times were averaging hours or days. One possible option is that enough economic interests will align to amass computing power to get important bitcoin transactions into a block, allowing other cryptocurrencies and technologies like LN to fill in. Another option is that a group may fork the code to adjust the difficulty more rapidly, leading to bitcoin holders putting a value on bitcoin-FDA ("Faster-Difficulty-Adjustment"). The author believes that we can learn how to fork peacefully from what was learned when BCH was born and when it split. Lastly, the author believes that gaining insight into how core developers will handle increasing demands to use faster difficulty adjustments (if they respond at all) would be helpful.</summary>
