    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, David A. Harding raised a question regarding the actual degree to which malicious relay nodes are causing witness malleability in transactions and reducing overall fee-rates. Russell O'Connor had previously mentioned that signing the witness weight could eliminate the worst kind of witness malleability from a user's perspective. However, David argued that if a mutated transaction pays a feerate at least incremental-relay-fee below the original transaction, then the original transaction can be rebroadcast as an RBF replacement of the mutated transaction, unless it has been pinned. He also noted that the default RBF policy does not work that way and requires an absolute fee increase instead. There have been proposals to change the default RBF policy, but even the proposal presented by David still requires a minimal amount of absolute fee increase as a DoS defense.</summary>
