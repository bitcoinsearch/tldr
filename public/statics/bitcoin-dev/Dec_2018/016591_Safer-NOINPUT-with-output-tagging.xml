    <summary>The conversation between Johnson and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the idea of reducing the requirements for commodity wallets to integrate them into a combined onchain and offchain user interface. ZmnSCPxj suggests that if we could create walletless offchain software, any existing wallet with an API to programmatically send arbitrary amounts to arbitrary addresses can be integrated into such UI, including hardware wallets. The discussion also touches on the risks associated with manual operation of hardware wallets, and the need for a communication protocol between hardware and offchain wallets to eliminate the need for spending the setup TXO with NOINPUT. Johnson expresses concerns about relying on users to perform critical steps correctly and suggests hiding the setup address from the user's view, leaving only advanced users able to refill the channel. Overall, the conversation highlights the need for developing a secure and reliable way to integrate different types of wallets into a unified UI.</summary>
