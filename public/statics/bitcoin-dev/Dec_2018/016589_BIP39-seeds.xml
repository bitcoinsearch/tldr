    <summary>The probability of getting a valid BIP39 seed from N randomly chosen words belonging to a 2048-word dictionary has been discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The entropy used for the seed would affect how many bits the checksum represents, and for a 24 word/256-bit mnemonic, the checksum is 8 bits, with 8 valid checksums. If a random checksum is picked from the wordlist, there is a 1 in 256 chance of picking a valid one. The author of the email believes that the surprising result from this calculation might have some use cases. The email also includes links to various Bitcoin and Zcash wallets made simple, a dynamic blocklist, and anti-spies and private torrents.</summary>
