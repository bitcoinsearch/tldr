    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.17.1 has been released with various bugfixes and performance improvements, including updated translations. The release is available for download from bitcoincore.org or through BitTorrent. Users are advised to report any bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub. To upgrade from an older version, users must shut it down and install the new version. If a node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated when version 0.17.0 or newer is first run, which may take up to a few hours. Likewise, when running version 0.15.0 or newer for the first time, the chainstate database will be converted to a new format, which may take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour depending on the speed of the machine. Compatibility-wise, Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer, but should also work on most other Unix-like systems although they are not frequently tested on them.</summary>
