    <summary>Ruben Somsen, a member of the Bitcoin-dev community, has raised concerns about the compatibility of the NOINPUT feature with various proposals including Graftroot and Statechains. He questions whether NOINPUT would have any adverse effects on either of these proposals. Additionally, he asks how fungibility would be impacted if Taproot was added to Eltoo and the setup and trigger transaction were combined into one. Christian, another member of the community, responds stating that there is currently no way to combine the trigger and setup transaction which were introduced in order to delay timeouts. Combining them would cause all timeouts to start immediately. He suggests that it would be more interesting to combine update and trigger transactions but this seems impossible outside of Mimblewimble.</summary>
