    <summary>A user has suggested that Confidential Transactions (CT) could be a great idea to increase privacy for normal users and fungibility. They have requested the creation of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to implement CT in Bitcoin Core. The user has mentioned that CT has already been implemented in Grin and Monero, indicating maturity to be implemented in Bitcoin. If the CT transaction size is 3x the size of a normal transaction, the block size could be increased by 3x as well, or just keep the current block size and make CT transactions optional.</summary>
