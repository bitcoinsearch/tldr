    <summary>The Cryptocurrency Implementers' Workshop has been announced by Andrew Miller, co-hosted with Financial Crypto. The aim of this workshop is to focus on real-world experience and engineering efforts. The workshop will be a half-day long and the program will consist of two main components: Invited talks on implementation post mortems and Artifact Evaluation, and Demo Show and Tell. The technical program will have demo presentations about open-source software artifacts. The write-up should include motivation and application, novelty or differences compared to alternative or related implementations, challenges faced, and possible evaluation approaches. The submission deadline is Dec 21, and the presenter notification will be given on Jan 7. The workshop will be held on Feb 22. The suggested topics for the workshop are cryptography implementations, proof-of-work consensus protocols, proof-of-stake consensus protocols, mining hardware designs, peer-to-peer networking and broadcast relay code, full node synchronization, SPV and lightweight clients, wallets and key management, security vulnerabilities and defenses, mining pools, mining rig controllers, and staking wallets. The submissions may be anonymized at the authors' discretion, but it is not a requirement. Demos accepted to this program will not be included in any proceedings. The program committee includes J. Ayo Akinyele, Rebekah Mercer, Pieter Wuille, Benedikt BÃ¼nz, Ethan Heilman, Patrick McCorry, Justin Ehrenhofer, Jacob Eberhardt, and more. The program chairs of the workshop are Andrew Miller and Christopher Allen.</summary>
