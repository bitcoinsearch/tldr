    <summary>In an email thread from December 26, 2018, Aymeric Vitte expressed concern that even with a tool like the one being discussed, users could be misled into believing they have found the correct seed phrase and become stuck trying to find their keys using BIP44/49. However, the creator of the tool clarified that it looks up all possible combinations and only confirms the correctness of a phrase if it has been used before on the blockchain. The tool was designed to generate a BIP39 phrase that can be used with any BIP39 wallet and the idea was deemed reasonable.</summary>
