    <summary>On November 13th, Bitcoin Cash will undergo a hard fork to implement a new difficulty algorithm. This news has led to speculation that Bitcoin itself may need to hard fork in order to employ a similar algorithm. The proposed algorithm is regarded as excellent because it followed the development mailing list's guidelines for non-contentious changes. A recent post on the Bitcoin development mailing list criticized the original poster for going off-topic, as the list is intended for discussion of Bitcoin's development rather than other competing systems.</summary>
