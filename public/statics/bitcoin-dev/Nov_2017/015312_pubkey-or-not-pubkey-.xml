    <summary>The author released a project called https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-transactions, which was restarted due to the launch of Bitcoin Gold. Many people were struggling to sync their bitcoins with Bitcoin Gold and getting robbed in the process. The project is designed to be used with bitcoin-cli outside of bitcoin-qt with a non-synced/outside wallet (https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-wallets can be used). The author noted that scriptSig was not present during tests/doublechecks with cli while implementing BIP143. However, it was present one year ago. This behavior is very similar for bitcoin core as well. The author's first transactions did not include the pubkey, resulting in an immediate ban by their own node. Txs without the pubkey are rejected, and the author wonders why this is the case for basic p2pkh transactions, why pubkey is back, since when, and why it adds 34 unnecessary bytes in each input. The links provided include Bitcoin transactions made simple, Zcash wallets made simple, Bitcoin wallets made simple, a torrent dynamic blocklist, a 10 M passwords list, anti-spies and private torrents, dynamic blocklist, Peersm, torrent-live, node-Tor, and GitHub.</summary>
