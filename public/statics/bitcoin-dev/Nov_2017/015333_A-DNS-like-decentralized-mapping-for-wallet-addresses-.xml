    <summary>The writer is a newcomer and has a few questions regarding mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. They suggest that instead of long wallet addresses, there should be a DNS-like decentralized mapping service to provide users with a crypto address that is easier to remember and understand. The conversion of the human-readable address to a wallet address would occur with network confirmations. The goal is to simplify the process by eliminating the need for long strings or QR codes that require an app. The writer is looking for resources to research this idea further.</summary>
