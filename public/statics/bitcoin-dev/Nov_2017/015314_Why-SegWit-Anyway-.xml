    <title>Why SegWit Anyway?</title>

    <summary>In a post to bitcoin-dev on November 21, 2017, Adán Sánchez de Pedro Crespo discussed the benefits of Segregated Witness (SegWit) signatures. One such benefit is that SegWit signatures can be cheaper to verify than traditional signatures, which were prone to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks using forged transactions. These attacks could take several minutes to verify and were thus highly disruptive. If one is interested in learning more about these types of attacks, they may want to seek out additional resources. It is not clear from the post where one might find such resources. Additionally, the post raises a question about how SegWit prevents DoS attacks if using SegWit transactions is not enforced. This question is left unanswered, but it suggests that there may be further research to be done on the topic.</summary>
