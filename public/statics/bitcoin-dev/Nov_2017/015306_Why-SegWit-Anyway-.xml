    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin's transaction malleability issue, Johnson Lau explained that changing the definition of TxID is a hardfork change and requires everyone to upgrade in order to avoid a chain split. He suggested using "normalized TxID" (BIP140) as a softfork solution to the problem. Unlike SegWit (BIP141), BIP140 does not have the side-effect of increasing block size and doesn't incentivize controlling the size of the UTXO set. However, it does make the UTXO set permanently bigger because the database needs to store both txid and normalized txid. On the other hand, if someone were to create an alternative cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin, using a Normalized Tx ID approach would be a better choice.</summary>
