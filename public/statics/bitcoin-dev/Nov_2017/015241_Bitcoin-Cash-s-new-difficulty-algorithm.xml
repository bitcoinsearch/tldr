    <summary>In an email sent on November 2, 2017, Scott Roberts praised the code of a group that he had previously criticized for their adversarial nature. Despite his reservations, Roberts presented the code as a viable solution to a threat facing bitcoin. He expressed concern that mentioning the word "Cash" in relation to the code would turn the discussion into a political issue. Roberts urged his colleagues to avoid being distracted by competitors attempting to divert attention away from their own proposals.</summary>
