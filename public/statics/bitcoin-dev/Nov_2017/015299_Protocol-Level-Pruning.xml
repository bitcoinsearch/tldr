    <summary>Bryan Bishop shared his thoughts on the UTXO set commitment proposals in a bitcoin-dev post. He provided links to several resources, including previous discussions, bitfields, and source code proposals on delayed TXO commitments, rolling UTXO set hashes, and the usefulness of TXO commitments. However, he mentioned that it is uncertain whether the person he was addressing had already looked into these proposals. The post ends with a question about whether there is a way to categorize these discussions by topic for easier accessibility.</summary>
