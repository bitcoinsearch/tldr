    <summary>SegWit transactions spend less "weight" which allows miners to fit more transactions into a block and spend less power building the blocks. SegWit signatures can also be cheaper to verify, making DoS attacks using forged transactions including signatures that could take several minutes to verify, less of a problem. There is no incentive for miners to pick SegWit transactions over non-SegWit transactions, but SegWit does provide benefits such as reduced transaction fees, larger capacity for transactions, and increased security. A change in the definition of TxID is a hardfork change, while BIP140 uses “normalised TxID” to fix malleability issue without changing the definition of TxID. SegWit has the side effect of block size increase, and provides incentive to control the size of UTXO set. Stampery Inc.'s CTO is Adán Sánchez de Pedro Crespo.</summary>
