    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer mailing list, Devrandom proposed the introduction of a new Proof of Work (POW) system through a "pseudo-soft-fork". The proposal includes the introduction of Auxiliary POW blocks between normal blocks, with each aux-POW block pointing to the previous normal block and containing transactions like a normal block. Every normal block would also have to point to the previous aux-POW block and contain all transactions from that block. It is important to note that this change is not a soft-fork but rather a semi-hard change as non-upgraded nodes would be at risk of getting on the wrong chain during an attack. Additionally, the proposal has security implications due to increased orphan rates resulting from decreased block intervals.</summary>
