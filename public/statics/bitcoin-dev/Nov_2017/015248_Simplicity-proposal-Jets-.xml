    <summary>A user named Jose Femenias Cañuelo inquired about the Simplicity proposal and references to 'jets' on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. In response, Russell O'Connor explained that jets are briefly discussed in section 3.4 of the Simplicity whitepaper by Blockstream. Jets are recognized expressions in Simplicity that allow for direct evaluation of functions using specialized C or assembly code instead of continuing interpretation. For example, when the interpreter encounters the Simplicity expression for ECDSA verification, it might directly call into libsecp rather than continuing the ECDSA verification using interpreted Simplicity. If discounted jets aren't among the finite number of known jets, a Merkle path from the root to an explicit jet node can be provided in the commitment. Adán Sánchez de Pedro Crespo, CTO of Stampery Inc., signed off the email chain.</summary>
