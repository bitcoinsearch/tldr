    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, provided feedback on a draft proposal for a new proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. The proposal suggested introducing an auxiliary PoW block between normal blocks that would alternate with the current PoW algorithm. Todd argued that this could not be called a soft fork and instead should be referred to as a "pseudo-soft-fork" because of its different security model. He also noted that the proposal would decrease the block interval, leading to increased orphan rates and potential security implications. Todd agreed with the proposal's description of the heaviest chain rule change as a semi-hard change.</summary>
