    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sjors Provoost, suggested enabling Github issues for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Currently, each BIP has a wiki page for discussion, but leaving comments requires editing the page. Provoost believes using Github issues would make the process smoother. However, there are concerns about moving discussion away from the mailing list and confusion between pull requests and discussion issues. If accepted, a change to the current BIP commenting process would need to be proposed on Github.</summary>
