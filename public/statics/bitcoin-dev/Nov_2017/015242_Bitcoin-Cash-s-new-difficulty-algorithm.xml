    <summary>The context is a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the implementation of a new difficulty algorithm for Bitcoin Cash's hard fork on November 13, 2017. The author of the post presents the code as a solution to the impending threat to Bitcoin and acknowledges their support for Bitcoin Core. However, they express concern about the potential politicization of their technical discussion if the word "cash" was included in their post. Gregory Maxwell responds to the post, stating that it is off-topic for the mailing list and criticizing the proposal as being from an adversarial competing system.</summary>
