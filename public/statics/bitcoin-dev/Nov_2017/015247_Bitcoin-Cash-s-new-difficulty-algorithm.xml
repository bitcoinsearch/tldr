    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list received a post from Scott Roberts, recommending the implementation of a new difficulty algorithm for Bitcoin. Gregory Maxwell responded to this by stating that the mailing list was meant for Bitcoin development and not for reviewing proposals from adversarial competing systems. Maxwell also mentioned that without a code submission in the form of a pull request to the core repository on Github, this was never a technical discussion. Roberts acknowledged that he was afraid that someone would turn the technical discussion into a political football, but presented the proposal as a real and excellent solution for the impending threat to Bitcoin. The discussion ended with a reminder that the mailing list is intended for Bitcoin development, and any off-topic posts should be avoided.</summary>
