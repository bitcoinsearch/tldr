    <summary>Electrum 3.0 has recently been released, and it is no longer supported on Python2, but on Python3 and Qt5. The update includes Native segwit scripts, which are supported by a new type of seed with a version number of 0x100. To create a segwit-in-p2sh wallet, hardware wallets or bip39 seeds will be required to enter a BIP49 derivation path. The BIP32 master keys of segwit wallets are serialized using new version numbers, and the Wallet Import Format (WIF) is similarly extended for segwit scripts. A new version of the Electrum protocol, version 1.1, is required by the client. Transactions are time-locked to the height of the current block by default, but other values of locktime may be passed using the command line. The release notes have advised users to keep a non-segwit wallet in order to receive bitcoins during the transition period as BIP173 is still in draft status, and other wallets/websites may not support it. If BIP173 ends up being rejected or substantially modified, your wallet may have to be restored from seed.</summary>
