    <summary>The context states that the author has been working on a filesystem based on Mandelbrot's formula, and believes it could be used to extend the Bitcoin algorithm. They would like to discuss this idea with others. The key potential benefit is that Mandelbrot workers could assist in modifying the verification work so that it could reign in the next iteration of hash results. Additionally, the hash results could help create a fast lookup table for future variations of the blockchain.</summary>
