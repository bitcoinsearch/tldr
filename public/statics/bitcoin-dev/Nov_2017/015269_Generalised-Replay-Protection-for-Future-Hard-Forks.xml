    <summary>The proposal discussed in this context addresses the issue of 'mis-sends' that could occur due to non-upgraded wallet software in the event of a hard fork. With the implementation of this proposal, mis-sends are not possible as the address contains the identifier of the token that should be sent. However, it is possible to 'mis-receive' if the receiving wallet is not aware of a newer chain and creates an address for the old token. It is the responsibility of the receiver to write a correct invoice. This proposal allows wallets to distinguish between different tokens, leading to the potential for different implementations. Finally, it is argued that this proposal should hold in a legal case where the receiver cannot claim payment was expected in another token.</summary>
