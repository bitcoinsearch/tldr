    <summary>In a discussion among members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal was presented for a soft-fork introduction of a new POW. However, Peter Todd pointed out that it should be considered a "pseudo-soft-fork" due to its security model being different from a traditional soft fork. The proposal involves introducing auxiliary POW blocks between normal blocks, with each aux-POW block pointing to the previous normal block and containing transactions like a normal block. Each normal block must then point to the previous aux-POW block and contain all transactions from that block. The proposed heaviest chain rule change is considered a semi-hard change, as non-upgraded nodes may end up on the wrong chain in case of an attack. Paul Sztorc agreed with Peter's comments and gave his support. The discussion also touched on increased orphan rates due to decreased block intervals.</summary>
