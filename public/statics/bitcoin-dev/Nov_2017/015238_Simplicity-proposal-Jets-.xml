    <summary>The Simplicity proposal references 'jets' but there is a lack of information on this feature. The plan is that discounted jets will be labeled as such in the commitment, and if a Merkle path can be provided from the root to an explicit jet that isn't among the finite number of known discounted jets, it will also be considered a jet. However, there are no specific links or explanations available for this feature at the moment.</summary>
