    <summary>In an email thread, Bryan Bishop responded to a message from Marc who expressed interest in an idea that seemed too simple and likely already discussed. Bryan provided several links to previous proposals for UTXO set commitment, which include TXO bitfields, delayed TXO commitments, rolling UTXO set hashes, and more. He also noted that there are many other resources available, including source code proposals. Bryan's contact information was included in his email signature.</summary>
