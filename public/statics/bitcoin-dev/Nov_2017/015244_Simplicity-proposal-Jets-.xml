    <summary>In response to a query about jets in Simplicity proposal, the idea behind jets is briefly discussed in section 3.4 of the proposal document available at https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf. The aim is to identify certain popular Simplicity expressions and allow the interpreter to skip over them and directly evaluate the function using specialized C or assembly code. For instance, when the interpreter encounters the ECDSA verification expression, it can directly call into libsecp instead of continuing with interpreted Simplicity. The individual seeking information on jets had requested for a brief explanation and/or a link pointing to this feature. In response, the above-mentioned document provides the necessary information. The proposal suggests that discounted jets will be explicitly labeled as jets in the commitment, and a Merkle path from the root to an explicit jet node can also be provided.</summary>
