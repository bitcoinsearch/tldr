    <summary>In a recent thread on bitcoin-dev, Gregory Maxwell shared his experience that virtually no one sets any parameter other than the minimum while using pruning in Bitcoin. However, Peter Todd responded by stating that he runs all his pruned nodes with the prune parameter set to about a month worth of blocks, which is a few GB. He also mentioned that he should increase this parameter even more now that segwit has increased the blocksize. Todd's signature was attached to the message.</summary>
