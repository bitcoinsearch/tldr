    <summary>In a post on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell announced the release of Bulletproofs, a new zero-knowledge proof system that shrinks the size of cryptographic proofs and makes them safer. Bulletproofs can be used to increase the privacy and confidentiality of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, while also making them more scalable. The technology was developed by researchers at University College London (UCL), Blockstream and Stanford University, and is based on previous work by UCL's Jonathan Bootle. The pre-print of the research paper is available online.</summary>
