    <title>Why SegWit Anyway?</title>

    <summary>A Bitcoin developer, Praveen Baratam, reached out to the bitcoin-dev mailing list with a question about SegWit. He was confused about why signatures were separated from the rest of the transaction data in this system. Another developer responded, clarifying that this is actually a misunderstanding and that SegWit excludes the signatures from the TXID instead. The serialization of SegWit on the p2p network encodes the witness field inside the transactions, immediately prior to the nlocktime field.</summary>
