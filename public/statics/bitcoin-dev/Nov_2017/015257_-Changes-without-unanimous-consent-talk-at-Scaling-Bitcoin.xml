    <summary>A talk in the Consensus stream of Scaling Bitcoin took place in which ajtowns presented some analysis regarding split-related consensus changes. The paper and slides for the talk are available on GitHub at https://github.com/ajtowns/sc-btc-2017/releases. Additionally, ajtowns proposed code-less solutions for generic replay protection similar to BIP 115, as well as a way to provide a better level of price discovery for proposals that could potentially cause splits.</summary>
