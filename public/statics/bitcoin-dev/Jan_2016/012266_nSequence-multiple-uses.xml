    <summary>Andrew is seeking clarification about the multiple uses of nSequence, a parameter in Bitcoin transactions. He notes that it can be used for locktime and opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF) signaling, but there is currently no way to distinguish between these uses. This could lead to unintended behavior, as spending a time-locked output also results in opting into RBF. Andrew asks if there are plans to change nSequence so that different features of a transaction can be distinguished. He suggests using version bits as a possible solution.</summary>
