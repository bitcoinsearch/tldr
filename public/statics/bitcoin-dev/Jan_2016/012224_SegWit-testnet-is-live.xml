    <summary>BitGo, a digital asset security platform, has announced its successful implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions for Bitcoin. The company is now waiting for the activation of SegWit on the Bitcoin network before rolling out support to its customers. Other companies, including BlockCypher and Breadwallet, have also committed to supporting SegWit transactions in the near future. SegWit is expected to provide several benefits to the Bitcoin network, including increased capacity and improved transaction malleability. Several wallets, including mSIGNA, GreenAddress, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin, have already committed to supporting SegWit, with more expected to be added to the list soon.</summary>
