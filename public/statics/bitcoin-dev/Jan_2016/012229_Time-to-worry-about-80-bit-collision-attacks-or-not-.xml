    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer email thread, Gavin Andresen defended the choice of SHA256D over RipeMD160 for an update to the digital currency's software. Another developer had previously argued that "security first" should be the priority when choosing a hashing function, but Andresen said there was a tradeoff between crypto strength and code complexity, and that "the strength of the crypto is all that matters" was not security-first. One developer argued that code complexity shouldn't be a concern in this debate, adding that the discussion should instead focus on the security versus space tradeoff. However, he also admitted he was in doubt about which method to choose. Although Andresen said his feeling was to play safe, he added neither his nor the other developer's anecdote were logical arguments and should therefore be ignored for any conclusions in the SHA256D vs RipeMD160 debate.</summary>
