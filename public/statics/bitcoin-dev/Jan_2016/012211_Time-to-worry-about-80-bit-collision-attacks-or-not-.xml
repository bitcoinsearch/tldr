    <summary>Pieter Wuille has raised concerns regarding a potential vulnerability in the construction of a 2-of-2 multisig escrow in a contract. The attack involves an 80-bit search for two keys, B and C, that satisfy the equation H(A and B) = H(B and C), where A is a public key revealed by one party and B is provided by the other party. In the current lightning-network "deployable lightning" design at channel establishment, pubkeys are revealed in the opening packet which could make it vulnerable to this kind of attack. Rusty suggests pre-committing by exchanging hashes of pubkeys first, but notes that contracts on bitcoin are already difficult to get right.</summary>
