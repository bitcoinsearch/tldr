    <summary>The Bitcoin development community has been discussing upgrade procedures for segregated witnesses to address the problem of relaying more block data in the future, which will require another soft-fork upgrade. One proposed solution was suggested by Peter Todd, who recommended adding a new service bit such as NODE_SEGWIT and/or bumping the protocol version so that outgoing peers only connect to peers with segwit support. However, this fix does not fully address the problem and would require another soft-fork upgrade in the future.To address this issue, Todd proposed making the witness data more extensible. He suggested removing the restriction that the coinbase witness contain exactly one 32-byte value and hashing the contents of the coinbase witness as a merkle tree and committing them in place of the current nonce commitment. These proposals were discussed in a PR on the segwit branch.Another proposal came from Pieter Wuille, who suggested a second number push in the coinbase scriptSig to point to a 32-byte hash H. The offset excludes the witness data and is more flexible and compact than the current system. However, concerns were raised about adding arbitrary data, as it could be used for non-Bitcoin purposes. To address this, it was suggested that the data in the coinbase witness stack have a fixed number of entries, depending on the block version number, with Version 5 blocks having only one entry. This could allow for soft-forks to add new entries in the stack.The developers also discussed Pieter Wuille's segwit branch, which has a fHaveWitness flag for each connection set when a HAVEWITNESS message comes from the peer. BIP144 suggests changing this to a service bit, and a pull request has been made on GitHub to change this to a NODE_WITNESS service bit. Overall, the Bitcoin development community is actively working on solutions to improve the efficiency and scalability of the blockchain network.</summary>
