    <summary>The bitter resentment over the need for consensus on non-consensus features in codebase forks is a problem, according to Btc Drak. He argues that forks with non-consensus features are acceptable and even desirable, as they allow for more freedom in upper layers. Eric Lombrozo agrees, stating that a better process is needed to distinguish between different layers for bitcoin modification proposals. He suggests that many fork proposals conflate different features, only some of which would actually be consensus layer changes. Lombrozo urges everyone to seriously consider accepting his BIP123 proposal, which addresses this issue and includes all currently proposed and accepted BIPs.</summary>
