    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Pieter Wuille expressed concern regarding a potential attack on a 2-of-2 multisig escrow in a contract. The attack would involve stealing funds by using keys B and C to take advantage of an 80-bit search for H(A and B) = H(B and C). Rusty Russell added that this attack could affect the current lightning-network "deployable lightning" design at channel establishment, where pubkeys are revealed in the opening packet used to redeem a P2SH using normal 2of2. While pre-committing by exchanging hashes of pubkeys first could be a solution, Russell is reluctant to add more complexity to contracts on bitcoin. Peter Todd warned against avoiding the relatively small amount of complexity of having two different segregated witness schemes to allow for 128bit security, as it could lead to a significant amount of upper level complexity trying to regain security and potentially lead to exploits.</summary>
