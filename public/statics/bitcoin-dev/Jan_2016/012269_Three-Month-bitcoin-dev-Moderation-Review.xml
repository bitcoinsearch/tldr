    <summary>In an email thread on January 21, 2016, Rusty Russell explained that "+1s" on a list are not useful as they carry no additional information. However, he clarified that providing a technical explanation of agreement is acceptable. While the restriction may hinder peer-review, it could be accepted if there are no plans to eliminate the rule altogether. To foster peer-review, Russell recommended amending the rules to clarify that "+1s" are not allowed without an explanation.</summary>
