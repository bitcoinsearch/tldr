    <summary>In an email conversation on January 11, 2016 at 11:57 PM, Tier Nolan pointed out an error in a code block. The original script had a syntax error in the order of the parameters for CHECKSIG and OP_DROP. Tier Nolan corrected the order by swapping the positions of const_pub_key and prev_hash in the script. The updated script is now in the correct order and should execute properly. No further information about the context or purpose of this code block was provided.</summary>
