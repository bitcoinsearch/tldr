    <summary>As of December 31, 2015, a segregated witness testnet called segnet has been successfully running, with rudimentary wallets with support already implemented. Eric Lombrozo reported that several wallets have committed to supporting it, including mSIGNA, GreenAddress, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin. Additionally, Breadwallet has also committed to supporting segwit. Interested wallet developers can contact Eric Lombrozo for development and testing on segnet. Segwit is expected to enable fundamental improvements to bitcoin. Source code can be found at sipa's Github repo, and an example signing code can be found at Eric's Github repo.</summary>
