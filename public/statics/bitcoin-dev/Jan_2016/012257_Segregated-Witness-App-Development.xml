    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach suggested that discussion about SegWit should be kept on topic for #bitcoin-dev, in order to avoid fragmentation of communication channels and associated infrastructure. Bryan agreed, stating that while it may be necessary to create a new channel if SegWit discussion becomes overwhelming, it would be preferable to keep the discussion within the existing venue.</summary>
