    <summary>Andrew had missed an important detail when going through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) related to time-locked outputs and opting into Replace-by-Fee (RBF). In response, David A. Harding corrected Andrew's understanding by explaining that nSequence needs to be set to less than MAX-1 for opting into RBF and not just less than MAX. An nSequence of exactly MAX-1 enables locktime enforcement but does not opt in to RBF. David then provided a link to BIP125 for further information on the topic.</summary>
