    <title>Three Month bitcoin-dev Moderation Review</title>

    <summary>In an email sent to bitcoin-dev, Rusty Russell questioned the moderation rules that included "+1s" being discouraged. He assumed this meant statements like "I agree with doing X". Russell argued that any sane procedure for deciding something involved asking those involved if they were for or against it, and if there were many proposals for solving a technical problem, a vote was necessary. He felt it was strange that voting was not allowed, especially since the Bitcoin community was in a state of constant dissent. Russell believed that without voting, decision-making would be pushed to IRC, which only a select few had access to, creating an "inner circle" that appeared to dictate decisions. In addition to his concerns, Russell thanked the moderators for their hard work.</summary>
