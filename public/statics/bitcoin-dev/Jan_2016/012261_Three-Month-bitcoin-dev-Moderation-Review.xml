    <title>Three Month bitcoin-dev Moderation Review</title>

    <summary>The email list for bitcoin-dev is intended to be information-rich and the core competency of those who provide this list are moderation and technology, not managing a process through which "involved people [indicate] whether they're for or against it." While this function can be offered by anyone who wants to run a system for collecting and displaying those indications, "approval voting" is not information-rich enough according to Rusty Russell. He suggests that the downloadable version from https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev-moderation/ for each month contain the text of the moderated emails as they contain the subjects. Additionally, xor--- via bitcoin-dev believes that the prohibition of "+1s" is likely to push actual decision-making to IRC making it less accessible to people due to the high traffic. This would form an "inner circle" and make decisions seem even more as if they're being dictated. Xor--- requests that people should be allowed to say whether they agree with something or don't. In the end, xor--- thanks the good latency of moderation and offers his services as a techie.</summary>
