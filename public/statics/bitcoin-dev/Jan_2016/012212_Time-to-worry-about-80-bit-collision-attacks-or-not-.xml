    <summary>The use of P2SH in Bitcoin is vulnerable if there is an attack on RIPEMD160. This was not considered during the design of P2SH, but has been recognized as a concern. A discussion on this topic took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on January 7, 2016. One of the concerns raised was about constructing a 2-of-2 multisig escrow in a contract where one party could steal funds from the other by exploiting a vulnerability in the hash function used. This attack would also affect the current lightning-network "deployable lightning" design at channel establishment. The proposed solution to this problem was to pre-commit by exchanging hashes of pubkeys first, but adding more hoops to contracts on Bitcoin is difficult and risky. The discussion highlights the importance of considering potential vulnerabilities when designing systems that rely on hash functions for security.</summary>
