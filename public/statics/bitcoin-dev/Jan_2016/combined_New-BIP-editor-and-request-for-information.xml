    <summary>Luke Dashjr has been requested to take over as the BIP editor responsible for assigning BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) numbers. Before he begins his work, he wants to ensure that there is no overlapping and has requested anyone who has been assigned a BIP number or any other relevant information to reply within 24 hours if possible. Luke has provided some specific details regarding the missing and soft-assigned BIPs. BIP 46 is missing from the repository but was self-soft-assigned by Tier Nolan, and it seems logical to keep it at BIP 46. BIPs 80 and 81 are currently part of an open pull request, and it's unclear whether they were formally assigned or not. BIP 82 is officially assigned and pending, but it's outside the scope of BIPs since it does not deal with Bitcoin. BIP 100 is missing from the repository, and Luke is uncertain if it was ever properly assigned. Considering that the 10x block has mostly been used for similar proposals, and BIP 100 is well-established as "BIP 100", it seems logical to make this its official assignment. BIP 104 is missing from the repository, and Luke is unsure about its status. It appears to be available, but there is no actual specification in the PDF.BIP 109 was soft-assigned, but it doesn't fit with the rest of 10x, and Luke is inclined to give it a new number outside that range unless there are objections. BIP 122 is missing from the repository, and it was self-soft-assigned by Chris Priest for "ScaleNet." There are concerns whether testnets are appropriate for standardization, but it seems reasonable to assign it a BIP number if Chris wishes to further pursue the idea and add an actual specification to the draft.Luke encourages Justus to move BIP 82 to the SLIP standard, but he will honour this assignment unless he is informed otherwise. Luke has requested anyone aware of any other BIP assignments, except for BIPs 82 and 109, and those appearing in the https://github.com/bitcoin/bips repository at present, to reply to his message indicating the status of such BIPs and their assigned numbers.In an email exchange regarding Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 46, Luke Dashjr noted that it was missing from the repository but had apparently been self-assigned by Tier Nolan in a previous email. Dashjr suggested that if the proposal had been assigned officially or if Nolan was still interested in pursuing it, it would make sense to just keep it at BIP 46. However, Nolan responded saying that he was never officially assigned any number for the proposal and subsequent changes made the BIP obsolete. Dashjr then recommended marking the number as nonassignable to prevent confusion with archive searches, assuming that new BIP numbers would be greater than 100 anyway. Finally, Dashjr acknowledged that he should not have used a number in the original git branch before being assigned it officially.</summary>
