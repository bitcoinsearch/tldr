    <summary>In a recent conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell raised the question of what moderation should look like going forward. This prompted another member, xor, to point out that the original announcement of moderation had discouraged the use of "+1s," which refers to simple statements like "I agree with doing X" that carry no additional information. According to xor, any procedure for deciding something should involve asking involved parties whether they're for or against it, but interrupting the entire list for a +1 is not worth it. Rusty clarified that if someone says "I prefer proposal X over Y because..." or "I dislike X because..." or "I need X because...", that carries more weight and is different from simply saying "+1."</summary>
