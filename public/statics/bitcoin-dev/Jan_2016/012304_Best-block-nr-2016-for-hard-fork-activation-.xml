    <summary>The writer is seeking clarification about the effects of hard (or soft) forks, specifically related to the timing of implementing new rules and how it affects non-updated clients. They suggest four options for when to apply new rules, all relating to the 2016 blocks recalibration window. The writer considers the potential consequences of each option, particularly in case of a contentious 75-25 hard fork, where option 4 would be best for the conservative chain. They also consider scenarios where it may be beneficial for the remaining 1% chain to never reach 2016 blocks again. The writer questions whether all possible scenarios have been considered and suggests defining the best choice as mandatory for any hard fork proposal, possibly through BIP9. The writer acknowledges that the first few blocks mined after implementing new rules may not follow the new guidelines.</summary>
