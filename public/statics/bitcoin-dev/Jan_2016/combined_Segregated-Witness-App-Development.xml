    <summary>Eric Lombrozo has created a new IRC channel called #segwit-dev through the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The objective of this channel is to discuss integrating and supporting segregated witness transactions in wallets, as well as suggesting improvements to the spec. Eric has invited all members of the bitcoin-dev community who share this objective to join the channel and participate in the discussions.However, some members have expressed concerns about fragmenting communication channels and associated infrastructure. They suggest that discussions about SegWit should take place on the existing #bitcoin-dev channel instead. Mark Friedenbach proposed that SegWit discussion should be kept on topic for #bitcoin-dev to avoid fragmentation, and Bryan agreed with him. Bryan added that it may be necessary to create a new channel if SegWit discussion becomes overwhelming, but it would be preferable to keep the discussion within the existing venue.Despite these reservations, Eric's invitation still stands and the #segwit-dev channel remains open for anyone interested in discussing SegWit integration and support. Suggestions and comments for improving the spec are also welcome.</summary>
