    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Joe2015 responded to Nick ODell's query about fee collection from transactions in the block. Joe suggested mapping the new-rules coinbase transaction, which collects the block reward and fees, into an old-rules legacy coinbase transaction, which collects the block reward only. However, he emphasized that care must be taken to ensure the mapping is not reversible. Joe has redesigned the implementation of the above suggestion, which can be found in two GitHub links provided by him. The new version maps the Merkle root onto a 'legacy' coinbase transaction, which solves the problem with fees.</summary>
