    <summary>In response to a comment by Gavin Andresen on the BIP process, Peter Todd shared his experience of raising an issue with segregated witnesses. He expressed concern that it could make validationless mining easier and more profitable. Initially, Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell did not believe Todd's concern to be important in private communication. However, it was still discussed on IRC, with valuable input from Pieter, Greg, and others. Todd plans to write the code to implement his fix and submit a pull-req against the segwit branch. Todd disagrees with Andresen's statement that the BIP process is "Here's the spec, take it or leave it; We don't what what you think."</summary>
