    <title>Three Month bitcoin-dev Moderation Review</title>

    <summary>The email is a three-month review of moderation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, and participants are encouraged to discuss how moderation should change. The email thanks everyone for their restraint in inflammatory or disruptive emails and for being tolerant of moderation mistakes. Two changes were made to the moderation plan: the "needs mod" bit is no longer cleared after first posts, and trivially answerable emails or proposals are answered in the reject message itself. A link is provided to see almost all rejected messages. Participants are asked to consider what moderation should look like going forward, including if moderation should stop altogether, if it should be more/less harsh, if a different method/criteria should be used, if moderators should be added/removed, and any other improvements.</summary>
