    <summary>As of December 31, 2015, a successful segregated witness testnet called segnet is being run and rudimentary wallets with support have already been implemented. Source code for segnet can be found at sipa's github repo and example signing code at CodeShark's repo. Several wallets including mSIGNA, GreenAddress, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin have committed to supporting it, with more expected to join soon. Wallet developers interested in developing and testing on segnet are encouraged to contact Eric. The fundamental improvements to bitcoin that segwit will enable are highly anticipated and on schedule.</summary>
