    <summary>Earlier today, the -wizards IRC channel was used to share two repositories related to Lightning Network. These repositories are https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd and https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion. However, it is important to note that the source code of these repositories has not been reviewed for quality, security, or functionality. As a result, there is no information available regarding their status.In addition to these two repositories, several other git repositories with related work can be found at https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning and https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork. It is unclear whether these repositories have undergone any review process for quality, security, or functionality.The context was shared by Bryan who can be contacted through his website http://heybryan.org/ or by phone at 1 512 203 0507. It is important to exercise caution while using any of the aforementioned repositories without proper review and validation.</summary>
