    <summary>Earlier today, the -wizards IRC channel was used to share two repositories, namely https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd and https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion. However, the source code of these repositories has not been reviewed for quality, security, or functionality. Hence, there is no information available regarding their status. Additionally, several other git repositories with related work can be found at https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning and https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork. The context was shared by Bryan who can be contacted at http://heybryan.org/ or 1 512 203 0507.</summary>
