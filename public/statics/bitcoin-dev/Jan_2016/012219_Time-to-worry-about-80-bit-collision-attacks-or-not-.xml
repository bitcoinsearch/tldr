    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread in 2016, Gavin Andresen proposed to eliminate the risk of a potential attack by having only one witness program version. However, Pieter Wuille disagreed with this suggestion and argued that it would be unwise to reduce the security target for witness scripts to 80 bits. Wuille stated that Bitcoin has a 128-bit security target for everything else, and he believes that this should be maintained. He also emphasized that the proposal is not a decision but rather a discussion, and everyone is free to participate in it. Andresen expressed disappointment with the "take it or leave it" attitude and the lack of consideration for other opinions. Nonetheless, the proposal remains under discussion, and there is hope that the community will adopt it based on its technical merit.</summary>
