    <summary>In an email conversation between Eric Voskuil and Jorge Timón, it was discussed that a public blockchain interface will exist in the second phase of development. Timón plans to create a C++ interface that fits better with Bitcoin Core internals, as well as refining the storage interface in the third phase by defining C interfaces using structs of function pointers instead of classes. The objective is to decouple the consensus code from chain.o and coins.o so they don't get built as part of the consensus building package, which is used for building both libbitcoinconsensus and Bitcoin Core. Timón believes that implementing both versions of libbitcoinconsensus was acceptable, even though Luke Dashjr advocated for the storage-dependent version. Voskuil wouldn't offer libbitcoinconsensus integration if it required incorporating the store and instead suggested working towards shipping independent component libraries (i.e. consensus and store).</summary>
