    <summary>Luke-jr has announced that he has created an initial draft of a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for updating getblocktemplate for segregated witness. The draft can be found on GitHub at the link provided by Luke-jr. He is requesting for others to review and comment on the changes made, especially with regard to the sigoplimits handling. However, he notes that libblkmaker's reference implementation is incompatible with the "last output" rule in this BIP at this time. Luke-jr expresses his gratitude in advance for any feedback received.</summary>
