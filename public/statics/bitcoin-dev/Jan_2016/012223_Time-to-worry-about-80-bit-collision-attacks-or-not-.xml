    <summary>In an email exchange on January 8, 2016, Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen asked if there was a similar attack scheme possible if the network had switched to Schnorr 2-of-2 signatures. However, he quickly corrected himself and acknowledged that Anthony's scheme would still work with Schnorr. The context of this exchange is not specified, but it likely relates to potential security concerns related to the Bitcoin network.</summary>
