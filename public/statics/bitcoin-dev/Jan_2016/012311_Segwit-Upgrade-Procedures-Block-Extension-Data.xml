    <summary>On the Bitcoin developers mailing list, Pieter Wuille's segwit branch is discussed. While this branch doesn't have a fix for the current problem, it is suggested to add a new service bit such as NODE_SEGWIT and/or bump up the protocol version and connect only to peers with segwit support. The segwit branch has a fHaveWitness flag for each connection which is set when a HAVEWITNESS message comes from the peer, and HAVEWITNESS is sent as part of handshaking. However, BIP144 suggests changing this to a service bit. A pull request to change this to a NODE_WITNESS service bit has been made on GitHub.</summary>
