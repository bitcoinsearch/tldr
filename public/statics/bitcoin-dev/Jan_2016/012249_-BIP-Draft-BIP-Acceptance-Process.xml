    <summary>A proposal to improve the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process was discussed in an email exchange between two individuals, Andy Chase and Luke. While Luke agrees that a new proposal is necessary, he does not support the current approach to the problem. Instead, he suggests a specification based on BIP 123 that determines when a proposal is accepted by the community through discernment rather than decision-making. He proposes a committee to review the BIP and determine if acceptance conditions have been met. Luke argues that committees should not be authorized groups that represent client authors, miners, merchants, and users; instead, they should be fluid and re-validated for each BIP evaluation. He also notes that setting up committees with a minimum of 1% stake per segment seems time-consuming and impractical. Additionally, he questions how miners would express their positions and who would choose the BIP Process Manager. Finally, Luke cautions against allowing the author to set any conditions for activation and believes that until the BIP is active, its rules do not apply.</summary>
