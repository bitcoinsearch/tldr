    <summary>In the release notes for 0.12, it is mentioned that the dependency on OpenSSL has been replaced with libsecp256k1 for signature validation. However, the question arises as to what other purposes libsecp256k1 serves and why it needs to be retained as a dependency. This information was sought by Andrew, the person posing the question. It is not clear from the given context whether a response was provided or not.</summary>
