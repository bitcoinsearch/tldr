    <summary>Bitcoin developer Eric Lombrozo believes that a better process is needed to distinguish different layers for bitcoin modification proposals in order to avoid the problem related to forks. He suggests that many fork proposals conflate different features, only some of which would actually be consensus layer changes. The pushback from Core developers led Mike Hearn to break off from Core and create XT as the applications he was developing required BIP64 to work. Eric had submitted a BIP -  BIP123 - that addresses this issue earlier. He had updated it to include all the currently proposed and accepted BIPs and had submitted a PR. Eric urged everyone to seriously consider getting this BIP accepted as a top priority before we get more projects all trying their hand at stuff and not understanding these critical distinctions.Btc Drak argues that forks with non-consensus features are acceptable and even desirable, as they allow for more freedom in upper layers. However, someone pointed out that Eric's proposal doesn't solve the issue related to Mike creating his own fork, which was down to a strong differing of technical opinions between Mike and a dozen other developers as well as node security concerns (which were proved correct). The classification of BIPs is fine, but Eric's proposition would have stopped Mike from creating his own distribution. A process is needed that distinguishes these different layers and allows more freedom in the upper layers while requiring agreement at the consensus layer.</summary>
