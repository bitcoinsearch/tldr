    <summary>The release notes for version 0.12 of Bitcoin mention the switch from OpenSSL to libsecp256k1 for signature validation. However, OpenSSL is still being used for various purposes such as random number generation and AES256 encryption of private keys. There are outdated PRs to remove the OpenSSL dependency for these purposes. It is suggested that OpenSSL be kept as a dependency for SSL/X.509 in BIP70 payment protocol. The plan is to make OpenSSL a dependency only if the GUI is enabled in the future, with most of the work already done but requiring careful testing and integration.</summary>
