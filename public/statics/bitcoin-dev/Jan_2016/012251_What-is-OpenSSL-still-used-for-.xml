    <summary>A discussion on the use of libsecp256k1 and OpenSSL in Bitcoin has been brought up on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. It is noted that libsecp256k1 is only used for elliptic curve operations required by Bitcoin, while OpenSSL is used for all other cryptography. The use of OpenSSL's PRNG can be seen in the random.h file in the Bitcoin source code. The question is asked regarding what else OpenSSL is being used for if signature validation has moved to libsecp256k1 in the 0.12 release notes.</summary>
