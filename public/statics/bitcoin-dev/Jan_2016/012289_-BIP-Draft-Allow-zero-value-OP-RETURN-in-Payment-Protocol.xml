    <summary>In this conversation, Luke Dashjr and Toby Padilla discuss the use of OP_RETURN values in Bitcoin transactions. Toby argues that PaymentRequests limit the use of OP_RETURN values because they must be greater than zero, essentially creating a pre-OP_RETURN environment. Luke counters that coins should be burned instead of allowing zero value OP_RETURNs, but Toby believes there is a better alternative. With BIP70, the key for redeeming inputs can be in the user's wallet, allowing for transaction construction on another machine without needing a key. However, currently, there is no way to do transaction construction on another machine with zero value OP_RETURNs. Despite their disagreement, both parties understand that a key is always necessary for redeeming inputs in Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
