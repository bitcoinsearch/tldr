    <summary>In an email exchange on January 26, 2016, Toby Padilla and Luke Dashjr discussed the potential use cases for OP_RETURN in bitcoin transactions. While Padilla argued that not every use of OP_RETURN should be classified as spam, Dashjr disagreed, stating that he could not think of any non-spam use cases. Dashjr also suggested that burning the value would not stop spammers from using OP_RETURN, but Padilla argued that lost value would serve as a cost to the spammer and deflate the value of bitcoins overall.</summary>
