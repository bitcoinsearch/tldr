    <summary>The email thread from January 29, 2016, discusses the impact of a fork occurring during the difficulty period. The BIP9 only checks for new activations during difficulty retargettings as an optimization to only check 1/2016 of the blocks. However, it is not assumed that this will be the case for all implementations. BIP99 recommends a 95% activation threshold for uncontroversial rule changes and no miner signaling at all for controversial hardforks. The proposal includes a manageable list of simple fixes like the timewarp fix forward-ported from Freicoin 0.8. There has not been much interest in growing the short list of easy-to-implement changes. BIP99 has not received any opposition as a hardfork proposal, but it is not considered a priority to work on at this moment. It may be classified as a BIP without code, and the hardfork proposal itself should have been a separate one.</summary>
