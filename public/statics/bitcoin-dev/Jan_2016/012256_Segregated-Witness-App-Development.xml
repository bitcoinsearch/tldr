    <summary>A new IRC channel called #segwit-dev has been created by Eric Lombrozo via bitcoin-dev mailing list. This channel is dedicated to integrating and supporting segregated witness transactions in wallets, and for comments or suggestions for improvement to the spec. The invitation to join this channel was extended to all the members of the bitcoin-dev community who share its objective. However, some members expressed their reservations about fragmenting the communication channels and associated infrastructure such as logs, bots, etc. They suggested that such discussions should take place on the #bitcoin-dev channel instead.</summary>
