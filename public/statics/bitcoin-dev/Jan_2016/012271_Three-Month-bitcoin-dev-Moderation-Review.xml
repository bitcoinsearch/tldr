    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the usefulness of comments in a technical conversation. Peter Todd suggests that technical comments should contribute uniquely to the discussion and not simply repeat what has already been said. To add to this, another member suggests that comments should either have technical discussion or additional relevant data. They propose using a "+1" with an explanation that provides unique insights to the discussion. The example given is a +1 with relevant data from Jane Doe, CTO of CoinBitChainBasely.com, which highlights how their company could have prevented customer support tickets.</summary>
