    <summary>In a discussion regarding block pruning in Bitcoin, Wladimir J. van der Laan suggested advertising the feature in the new release notes, which was added by Marco Falke in commit fa31133. The RC2 changelog now includes instructions on enabling block pruning by setting prune= on the command line or in bitcoin.conf, with N representing the number of MiB allotted for raw block and undo data. A user expressed confusion over the need to specify a value for N, as they believed pruning should be a boolean on/off flag that automatically computes the natural size of the dataset based on the final amount of unspent coins. They requested further explanation in the release notes, including why N must be given, a "safe" value for N, and whether there is an "auto" setting for N.</summary>
