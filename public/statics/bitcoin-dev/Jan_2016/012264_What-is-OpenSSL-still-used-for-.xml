    <summary>The message is a response to Andrew's question about why OpenSSL is still being used as a dependency in Bitcoin 0.12. The author mentions that while OpenSSL has been dropped from the consensus layer for ECC signature validation, it is still being used for other purposes. Specifically, it is being used for getting random numbers to randomize the ECC signing context, AES256 encryption of private keys for wallets, and SSL/X.509 for BIP70 payment protocol for GUI. It is suggested that OpenSSL dependency could be removed for the first two purposes. However, it makes sense to keep OpenSSL for the BIP70 payment protocol. The author provides links to relevant pull requests related to entropy and AES. The message ends with a PGP signature.</summary>
