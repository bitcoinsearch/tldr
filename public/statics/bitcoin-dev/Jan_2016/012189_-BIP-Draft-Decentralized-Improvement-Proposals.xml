    <title>[BIP Draft] Decentralized Improvement Proposals</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Luke Dashjr and Tomas debated the efficiency of the specification for version bits. Tomas raised concerns about the unclear assignment of version bits in the specification, suggesting that any implementation proposing a change should be encouraged to choose a free version bit to use. Luke agreed that clarification was necessary in the BIP, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, and suggested that the BIP editor assign version bits like BIP numbers themselves. However, he also noted that since the number of deployed forks is low, it may not be necessary to have a more robust system. Rusty, another member of the discussion, offered to fill that role if needed.</summary>
