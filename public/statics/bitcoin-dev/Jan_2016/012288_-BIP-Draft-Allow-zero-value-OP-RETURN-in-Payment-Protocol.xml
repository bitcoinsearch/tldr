    <summary>The conversation between Luke Dashjr and Toby Padilla on the Github thread discusses the possibility of supporting OP_RETURN in PaymentRequests. However, Luke Dashjr explains that none of the reasons for using OP_RETURN apply to PaymentRequests, which allow for transactions similar to non-PaymentRequest based transactions but with greater OP_RETURN value limitations. Additionally, because OP_RETURN serves a specific purpose, it cannot be used in PaymentRequest transactions. Toby Padilla argues that supporting OP_RETURN in PaymentRequests is still a good idea because people may use worse methods to encode data on the blockchain. In response, Luke Dashjr points out that constructing an OP_RETURN transaction without a key is not possible, and he does not understand Toby Padilla's argument.</summary>
