    <summary>In a forum discussion on January 5th, 2016, Nick ODell inquired about how fees were being collected from transactions in the block. Joe responded by suggesting that the easiest method to accomplish this was to map the new-rules coinbase transaction, which collects both the block reward and fees, into an old-rules legacy coinbase transaction, which only collects the block reward. He also noted that care must be taken to ensure the mapping is not reversible. Joe plans to update his implementation accordingly.</summary>
