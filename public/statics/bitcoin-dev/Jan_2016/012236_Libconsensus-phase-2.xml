    <summary>In a recent email, Jorge Timón discussed his work on libconsensus and provided an update on the status of the project. He explained that he had changed the goal of phase 2 in his libconsensus encapsulation planning from "expose VerifyHeader() in the existing libconsensus library" to "build all the consensus critical code within the existing libconsensus library, even if we don't expose anything else". This decision was based on his belief that this would make the project more feasible for a single Bitcoin Core release cycle and more of a priority. Timón also discussed the upcoming phases of the project, with phase 3 focused on finishing long pending discussions about whether libconsensus should be C++14 or plain C and phase 4 focused on renaming files to the target dir and moving the remaining unused code out of libconsensus. Phase 5 will involve making Bitcoin Core use libbitcoinconsensus only by its generic C API. In addition, Timón talked about how exposing VerifyScript() through a C API helped cement dependencies that are not part of the incomplete but existing libbitcoinconsensus library. He also mentioned that his plan is to move all the files listed in a certain Github pull request one by one, and encouraged anyone who is eager to start moving some files to contact him.</summary>
