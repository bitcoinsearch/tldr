    <summary>The discussion is about a proposal related to broadcasting the exact height starting at which the server serves. The author suggests that it would be better not to rely on the address broadcasting mechanism for fast information exchange. One of the problems with this approach is that DNS seeds cannot convey this information. However, an extension of the DNS seeding protocol can be done where nodes matching the requirement will only be returned by querying .dnsseed.whatever.com and the DNS server. This solution may complicate existing seeds a bit, but protocol-wise it is still possible. Adding more dimensions can make it complicated quickly.</summary>
