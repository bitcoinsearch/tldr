    <summary>The email thread is a discussion related to a specific use case of the percentage slider for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that extends 21. The idea is that with a percentage slider like Humble Bundle, it would be more explicit what part went where. However, Wladimir suggests that a new BIP needs to be written to extend BIP 21, and any syntax will do. The email also includes an advertisement for New Relic, which is a SaaS-based application performance monitoring service. They are offering a cool shirt if you try their service, which delivers powerful full stack analytics to optimize and monitor your browser, app, &amp; servers with just a few lines of code.</summary>
