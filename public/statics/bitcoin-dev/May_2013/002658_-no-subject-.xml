    <summary>A discussion about Bitcoin rule changes took place with Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, the founder, CEO and customer support rep of Least Authority. The discussion centered around the idea that some rule changes may be necessary for Bitcoin to evolve, while others would not be suitable. For example, there is a proposal to lift the block size limit, but it is unclear if this change will be made. There was also debate about the best venue for suggesting rule changes, with Zooko suggesting forking bitcoin.git on Github as the best option. Alternative Bitcoin clones were deemed less effective for this purpose. Overall, it was recognized that some rule changes may be necessary in the future, but they should be carefully considered before being implemented.</summary>
