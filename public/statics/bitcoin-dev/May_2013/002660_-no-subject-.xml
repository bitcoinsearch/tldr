    <summary>In a message dated 25 May 2013, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn asked for clarification on "rule changes" in Bitcoin. He questioned what constituted a rule change and noted that there was a move to lift the block size limit, but he couldn't find mention of it in the bitcoin-development list archives. He wanted to know the most productive way to suggest changes that might be suitable for merging into trunk sometime in the future or the next hardfork. Wilcox-O'Hearn suggested forking bitcoin.git on github as a possible solution. He also proposed having "rule change" fixes and "bug fix" releases go out separately. Wilcox-O'Hearn is the Founder, CEO, and Customer Support Rep of LeastAuthority.com.</summary>
