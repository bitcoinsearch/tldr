    <summary>On May 25, 2013, Melvin Carvalho suggested separating "rule change" fixes and "bug fix" releases for Bitcoin, a consensus system. Clients with different rules cannot run on the same blockchain or network. However, if it's about client default policies, previous behavior should be configurable. For those who want just bug fixes and rule changes without new features and policy default changes, they can use the 0.4.x-0.7.x backports. These short-term solutions are not maintained forever, so it's advisable to get the desired behavior from the current release. If that isn't possible, users should report a bug explaining what the older version could do that the new one cannot.</summary>
