    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin transactions, Jeff Garzik explains that the miner's reward for processing transactions is the initial currency distribution of 25 BTC plus the sum of all per-transaction fees. He also mentions that when a transaction's input value exceeds its output value, the remainder becomes the transaction fee. A destroy-by-miner fee transaction is a normal bitcoin transaction sent by any user. The miner fee is implicitly paid to whomever mines the transaction into a block. However, the Bitcoin protocol prevents zero-output, give-it-all-to-the-miner transactions. Later in the discussion, Adam suggests that it may be possible to have an implicit reward of 25BTC and reward transaction .001 BTC to oneself, and 24.999 BTC with existing bitcoin format and validation semantics which would be close enough to give-to-miner. Additionally, Adam proposes that the output sum &gt; 0BTC limitation could be changed to &gt;=.</summary>
