    <summary>Melvin Carvalho suggested that an out of band algo/hash could work if there was a one to one relationship between the described object and UUID. He also mentioned that in some cases, the gensis block may not uniquely identify a coin. However, Jeff Garzik countered this by saying that it seems unlikely for two different genesis blocks to have the same hash.
