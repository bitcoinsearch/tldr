    <summary>The author disagrees with the statement that Bitcoin package maintainers are doing a "pretty good job" for Linux users. The author argues that Ubuntu users who are on the distro quantal are stuck on version 0.6.2, which has not received updates since 2012. Similarly, Debian Squeeze users are on version 0.3.24 and are missing every fix since then. Additionally, nearly every distro links bitcoin against libdb5.1, meaning wallets run once with those packages will never be usable for an "official" Bitcoin build ever again. Lastly, the author acknowledges that package maintainers may not necessarily be at fault for using outdated versions of libraries.</summary>
