    <summary>In an email exchange between Mark Friedenbach and Jeff Garzik on May 20, 2013, Friedenbach recommended using Version 4 UUIDs, with random bits extracted from the double-SHA256 hash of the genesis block of the chain, to remain compliant with RFC 4122. He suggested that this method could greatly assist in adopting the payment protocol to colored coins. Garzik noted that Friedenbach's proposal seemed closer to Version 5 than Version 4, but it was not truly applicable to either since useful content may be deduced from UUID. He proposed a bitcoin-specific Version 6.Friedenbach provided some example chain identifiers, including mainnet, testnet3, and namecoin. However, he cautioned that humans would want a side-by-side mapping to make it readable and usable. Useful multi-chain software would require a readable shortname string anyway, which Friedenbach's proposal aimed to avoid.</summary>
