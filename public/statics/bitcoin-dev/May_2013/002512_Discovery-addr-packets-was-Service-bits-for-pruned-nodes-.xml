    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik on May 6, 2013, Todd suggested that Garzik work with The Guardian Project to implement Tor on Android for phone usage. Todd also expressed his belief that a library for server applications is necessary for hidden services, as opposed to using a proxy server approach. Garzik agreed with the idea of implementing an internal Tor hidden service node, stating that it would be more secure than a proxy server approach in certain scenarios. Garzik is affiliated with exMULTI, Inc. while Todd's professional affiliation is not mentioned.</summary>
