    <summary>In this email conversation, Melvin Carvalho suggests that an out of band algo/hash could work if there was a one to one relationship between the described object and the UUID. However, he notes that in this case, the genesis block may not uniquely identify a coin. Jeff Garzik questions this statement, stating that it is extremely unlikely for two different genesis blocks to have the same hash. No further details or information are provided in this brief exchange.</summary>
