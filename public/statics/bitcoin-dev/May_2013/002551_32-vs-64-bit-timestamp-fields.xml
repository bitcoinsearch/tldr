    <summary>The email exchange between John Dillon and Peter Todd discusses the interpretation of timestamps on blockchain blocks. Todd advises that interpreting the timestamp for timestamping purposes is more complicated than it appears at first and suggests changing the meaning of the header timestamp to be relative time passed since the last block. Dillon misunderstood Todd's point which led to a correction about the use of the term 'probabilistic'. While absolute time is necessary in some cases, simple relative ordering is sufficient for many things. The email ends with Todd's signature.</summary>
