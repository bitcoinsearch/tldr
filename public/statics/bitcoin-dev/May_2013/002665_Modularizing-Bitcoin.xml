    <summary>In an email exchange on May 16, 2013, Addy Yeow inquired about the number of client nodes on the Bitcoin network. Luke Dashjr confirmed that the number provided by Yeow - approximately 57,000 nodes running protocol &gt;= 70001 with a timestamp no older than 24 hours - was accurate for listening nodes. Dashjr also pointed out that his own system's count was similar and provided a link to his website, which shows various charts related to the Bitcoin network's security. However, he noted that this count does not include connect-only nodes, such as mobile devices or firewall/NAT'd nodes, nor non-p2p nodes like Electrum.</summary>
