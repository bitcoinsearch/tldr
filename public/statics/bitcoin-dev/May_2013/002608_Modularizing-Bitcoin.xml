    <summary>In an email conversation from 2013 between Addy Yeow and the Bitcoin Grant Foundation, Yeow discussed the potential benefits of modularizing the Bitcoin system. He stated that such a move could make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count, which was fairly low at the time. Yeow also asked if there was a rough estimate of the current node count, which the foundation did not provide in their response. The email includes a disclaimer that the foundation's estimates put the number of nodes at around 8,000.</summary>
