    <summary>On May 8th, 2013, Peter Todd responded to a message from Pieter about changing the meaning of the header timestamp in blockchain technology. Todd initially misunderstood Pieter's suggestion, but then proposed a new idea for a well-defined 64-bit timestamp for each block, with only the lowest 32 bits included in the header. This would work as long as there was never a gap of more than 136 years between two blocks. The full 64-bit timestamp could be derived from the header by adding the lowest 32-bit value that still met certain rules.</summary>
