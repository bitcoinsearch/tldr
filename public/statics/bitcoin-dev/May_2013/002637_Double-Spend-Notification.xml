    <summary>On May 20th, 2013, Gavin Andresen expressed his support for double-spend propagation across the network. Gregory Maxwell agreed with him and asked if there was anyone who did not support it. Another user stated that any attempt at a double spend should be made public, but what miners should do with that information is still up for debate. The suggestion was made to hold onto and attempt to confirm the first transaction, only letting it go if a conflicting transaction is mined elsewhere. Despite differing opinions, the conversation remained civil and open to discussion.</summary>
