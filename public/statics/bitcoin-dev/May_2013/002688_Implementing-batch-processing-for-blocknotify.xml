    <summary>In a conversation between Wladimir and Chris on June 1, 2013, Wladimir suggested that using ZMQ would be an excellent fit for high-speed notifications. He also mentioned a pull request to integrate ZMQ directly into Bitcoind, which would eliminate the need for -blocknotify flag. Chris had not seen the PR before but stated that he had integrated ZMQ himself for block notifications in bitcoin and other altcoins. He expressed his interest in seeing something official and offered to try out the patch in the pull request.</summary>
