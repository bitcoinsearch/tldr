    <summary>The Bitcoin Grant has proposed a financial incentive for the continued modularization of the bitcoin system, which could include a special compiled bitcoind simulator that runs many virtual instances of a node on the same system. The simulator would cache crypto computation results to speed up processing transactions and blocks between virtual nodes, while sharing the same block data in memory when possible. This would require significant additional work to simulate the network and possibly computational limits. Transactions on the existing block chain could be replayed into randomly chosen virtual nodes to ensure any code changes would not cause problems with historic transactions. This could provide greater and quicker confidence that code changes are safe. The primary goal is to separate the wallet from the node to make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count, which is currently fairly low.</summary>
