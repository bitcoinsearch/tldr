    <summary>Robert Backhaus, a developer of FreeBSD build system 'port', is planning to get the system committed once version 0.8.2 is released. The Makefile simply applies user requests for GUI/QR/UPNP, with the major change being the use of an external port for leveldb. The files directory contains five patches, including two that add boost-crypto to LIBS and one that patches the build to use the external leveldb. Two minor fixes are also included. Branches are available for pullreqs on those minor fixes. Interested parties can find the files at https://redports.org/browser/robbak/net-p2p/bitcoin. Any comments are welcome.</summary>
