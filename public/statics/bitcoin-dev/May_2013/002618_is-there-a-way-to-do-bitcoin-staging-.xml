    <summary>The writer is looking for a way to experiment with new Bitcoin features, such as committed coins, without imposing a testing burden on the main network. They suggest creating an alt-coin, called bitcoin-staging, where the coins are the same as Bitcoin and mining power goes to Bitcoin main, but with no native mining. Users could exchange bitcoins to bitcoin-staging and back 1:1 cryptographically, allowing for real-world testing of new features without risking coins on the main network. The writer believes this approach could be more productive and less risky to the main network than forking Bitcoin's parameters or diluting its value. This system could also be used to test and validate interesting patches before merging them into the main network.</summary>
