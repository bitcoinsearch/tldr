    <summary>In this email conversation, Melvin Carvalho suggests that it may be a good idea to release 'rule change' fixes and 'bug fix' releases separately. However, Luke-Jr points out that Bitcoin is a consensus system and clients with different rules cannot run on the same blockchain/network. Melvin responds by stating that default policies can have a significant impact on user behavior and cites research showing that 80% of users tend to accept defaults. Rule changes and changing defaults should be weighed carefully, with bug fixes being fairly unanimous. Luke-Jr advises using backports if only bug fixes and rule changes are desired, but stresses that these are short-term solutions and users should try to get the desired behavior from the current release. If unable to do so, users should report a bug explaining what the older version was capable of that the new one isn't.</summary>
