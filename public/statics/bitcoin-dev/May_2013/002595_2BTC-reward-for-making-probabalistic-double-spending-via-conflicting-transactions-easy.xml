    <summary>In a forum post dated May 15, 2013, Bitcoin developer Peter Todd offered 2 BTC to anyone who could create a command line tool that would allow for the creation of two versions of a transaction, one sending coins to a recipient and the other sending all coins back to the sender. The tool was required to broadcast both transactions simultaneously to different nodes on the network. Todd suggested that using blockchain.info's raw transaction POST API and a local Bitcoin node might be a clever approach. Todd also invited attendees at a conference to attempt to double-spend against his Android wallet, offering to buy Bitcoins off them at Mt. Gox rates plus 10%, and allowing them to keep the loot. One commenter expressed concern over the promotion of such tools, likening it to promoting mail theft. Todd had previously discussed replace-by-fee and the potential security issues with zero-conf transactions in the same forum thread.</summary>
