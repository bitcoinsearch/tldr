    <summary>The message proposes a potential system for generalized P2P flood-fill messaging. The author suggests prioritizing traffic and using a priority scheme for retransmission. Priority is determined by utilizing Peter's Coinbase TxOut Hashcash, or PowPos, which allows messages to be relayed based on a per KB cost. To amortize the initial cost of transmitting the PowPos proof, PayWords are suggested, which should be stored on disk like the UTXO set. The flood fill message needs a header with the sacrifice proof, either a full PowPos, or a PayWord linked to a PowPos, followed by a type disambiguator and data payload. The author briefly mentions trust-free mixing but notes that negotiating transaction fees could be tricky without revealing inputs. Anti-DoS protection on the P2P flood-fill network for non-transaction messages is mentioned as well, and the author suggests ranking nodes based on genuine Bitcoin or sacrifice activity they are broadcasting.However, there are concerns about reuse of PowPos by peers who control all of a user's peers using the protocol. It is important to consider this potential issue while implementing the proposed system.</summary>
