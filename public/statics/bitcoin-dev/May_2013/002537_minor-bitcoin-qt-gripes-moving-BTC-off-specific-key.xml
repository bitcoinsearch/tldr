    <summary>At ZKS, pseudonyms were used to segregate online linkability for different purposes such as medical, casual browsing, social media, private, work, and true name. However, people still make mistakes with individual keys and accidentally link all their coin sources together. Clients do not have any privacy algorithm to minimize cross-linking of coin sources. It would be useful to help people achieve that by allowing them to control which address the payment is from, creating multiple wallets for different unlinked purposes. Misbehavers could be blocked based on pseudonym in ZKS. Bitcoind's naive RPC client is not a good fit for many features, and it's better to provide a feature-rich Python RPC client. Per-key fiddling in the GUI should be avoided, and instead, entire-wallet export and import should be used. Coin control belongs in transferring BTC off a specific address rather than spending the entire wallet onto a new address, which creates more network traffic, bigger packets, higher fees, and damages privacy.</summary>
