    <summary>In a 2013 email exchange, Ricardo Filipe proposed a solution for storing Bitcoin's historic data by allowing users to choose which parts of the blockchain they want to store. However, Jeff Garzik strongly disagreed with this idea, stating that it would result in only a few copies of the data being stored and that if one part of the distributed hash table (DHT) was attacked, it could potentially break the entire blockchain. Garzik suggested using a different DHT implementation instead of BitTorrent to mitigate any potential publicized attacks.</summary>
