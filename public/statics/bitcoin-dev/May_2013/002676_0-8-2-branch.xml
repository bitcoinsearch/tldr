    <summary>The suggestion has been made to create a 0.8.2 branch at commit 09e437b for those who wish to track that level of defect without following all the growing post-release developments in HEAD. This would include critical fixes such as d315eb0 that may be necessary for release builds. The purpose of this branch would be to provide a stable point of reference for those not interested in the latest developments but still in need of important fixes.</summary>
