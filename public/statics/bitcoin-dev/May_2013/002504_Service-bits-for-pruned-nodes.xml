    <summary>In a discussion thread from May 6th, 2013 on the Bitcoin developer mailing list, Mike Hearn suggested that anyone was welcome to optimize P2P address broadcasts or develop better bootstrap mechanisms. Pieter Wuille agreed with the idea and added that DNS seeding was no longer being used as a mechanism for seeding into the P2P network, but rather as a means of choosing all peers. He proposed a system where users would get seeds from a DNS or other mechanism, connect to one or a few of the results, do a 'getaddr', fill their peer IP database with it, and disconnect from the DNS seeded peer. This would require ways to optimize current peer exchange, but Pieter welcomed any suggestions towards achieving this goal.</summary>
