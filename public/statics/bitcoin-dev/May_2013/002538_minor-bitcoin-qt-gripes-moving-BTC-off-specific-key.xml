    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin security, Craig provides a command line method for unlocking a wallet without displaying the password on the console screen. He suggests using the JSON API to unlock the wallet for 60 seconds and keep the password off the console and history file. The only issue is that it will show up in the process tree as an argument of the command for a short period of time. Craig advises against using this method on multi-user systems or if there is concern about spyware monitoring for passwords. Lastly, he notes that this method may not work without Cygwin on Windows. Adam Back then raises three minor security issues, one of which is the need to unlock the wallet without displaying the password on the console screen.</summary>
