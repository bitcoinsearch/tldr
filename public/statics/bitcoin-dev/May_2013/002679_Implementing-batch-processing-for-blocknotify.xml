    <summary>In this context, a user named Rune Kj√¶r Svendsen wrote to ask for a solution on how to keep up with new blocks using the -blocknotify option with bitcoind. However, their application was not fast enough to finish before a new block came in and the app was executed again. In response, Michael suggested changing the -blocknotify script to quickly append necessary information to a queue and immediately exit. This way, a separate script can run at all times monitoring the queue for work and performing the labor-intensive calculations.</summary>
