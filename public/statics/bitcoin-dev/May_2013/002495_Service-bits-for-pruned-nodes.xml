    <summary>In an email exchange from 2013, Mike Hearn suggests extending the DNS seeding protocol to allow for queries that return only nodes matching specific requirements. However, another individual warns that the rounding off of values may be necessary to prevent DNS caching from being defeated. The suggestion is made to make clients check for the largest rounded off value first before drilling down if required. The conversation acknowledges that this extension could complicate existing seeds and adds a level of hackiness to the protocol. A separate comment is made about making the blockheaders-over-dns project production-worthy before facing potential backlash from ISPs.</summary>
