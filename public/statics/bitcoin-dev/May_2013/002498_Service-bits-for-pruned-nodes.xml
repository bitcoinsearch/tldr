    <summary>The writer of the context is suggesting that optimizing P2P peer discovery should be prioritized over optimizing centralized services, specifically DNS seeds. Although DNS seeds are necessary for obtaining the initial set of peers, they are not ideal as they may lead to dependence on a complex and sophisticated system. The writer suggests alternative means of peer discovery such as search engines, IPv4 scanning, and anycast peers. These methods are not immediately implementable but should be considered as possible solutions. The current peer discovery methods include DNS seeds, a fixed list, and IRC discovery, which is no longer functional.</summary>
