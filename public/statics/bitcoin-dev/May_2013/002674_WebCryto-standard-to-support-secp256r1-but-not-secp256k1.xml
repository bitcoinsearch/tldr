    <summary>Melvin Carvalho inquired about the possibility of adding Bitcoin's Koblitz curve to the proposed native crypto browser support, which is expected to arrive next year. The Web Crypto API currently includes three NIST recommended curves: P-256, P-384, and P-521. To get more information on this matter, Melvin reached out to the chair of the crypto group and was advised to email public-webcrypto-comments at w3.org and mention his use-cases. The goal of the proposed native crypto browser support is to expose the crypto code that already exists rather than having browser vendors write new code. However, there is an open issue regarding whether an "experimental" registry for identifiers for new curves not included in the core spec will be maintained. The chair of the crypto group suggested that if browsers don't currently support it, they may want to support it in the future given Bitcoin's growth. Melvin requested anyone with a use case for ecdsa in the browser to let him know or to write to the public list.</summary>
