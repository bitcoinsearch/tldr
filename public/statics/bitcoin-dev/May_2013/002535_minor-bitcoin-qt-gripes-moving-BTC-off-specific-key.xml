    <summary>On May 7, 2013, Gavin Andresen and Adam Back discussed possible improvements to Bitcoin's functionality. Gavin Andresen expressed his agreement with the idea of adding a "sweep private key" feature. Meanwhile, Adam Back pointed out three minor security/other issues that needed attention. In particular, he suggested having a way to unlock the wallet without displaying the password in console screen, a button to import a private key, and a UX way to transfer BTC off a specific address. Gavin Andresen agreed that the sweep feature should be added and even suggested the possibility of doing it periodically (though it would require remembering the key). However, he also noted that importing private keys into the wallet wouldn't be added as a user-friendly option since it could be dangerous and potentially confusing. Regarding the first issue raised by Adam Back, Wladimir suggested adding a list of commands whose arguments are censored in the console screen and command line history. He suggested that `importprivkey`, `walletpassphrase`, and `walletpassphrasechange` should likely be in that list.</summary>
