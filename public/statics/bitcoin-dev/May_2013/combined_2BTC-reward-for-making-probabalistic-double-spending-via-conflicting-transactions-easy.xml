    <summary>Bitcoin developer Peter Todd recently proposed a solution to tackle the replace-by-fee and security issues related to zero-conf transactions. He offered 2BTC to anyone who can come up with a tool that allows users to create two versions of the same transaction and broadcast them simultaneously to different nodes on the network. Todd suggested using blockchain.info's raw transaction POST API along with the local Bitcoin node might be a clever approach. Furthermore, if someone is attending a conference, he suggests demonstrating the attack against an Android wallet. In return, the attacker can keep the loot and he will buy Bitcoins at Mt. Gox rates + %10. In May 2013, Todd had offered 2 BTC in a forum post to anyone who could create a command line tool that would allow for the creation of two versions of a transaction, one sending coins to a recipient and the other sending all coins back to the sender. The tool was required to broadcast both transactions simultaneously to different nodes on the network. One commenter expressed concern over the promotion of such tools, likening it to promoting mail theft. Todd had previously discussed replace-by-fee and the potential security issues with zero-conf transactions in the same forum thread.Todd is offering 2BTC to anyone who can create a command-line tool that can create two versions of a transaction sending coins to a desired recipient and another version sending all the coins back to the user, both with the same inputs. A good starting point for the work would be Gavin's spendfrom utility in the contrib/spendfrom directory in the Bitcoin-QT repository. Peter insists that it is better for the community if an attack is demonstrated first, followed by releasing the code some time later. Additionally, an email thread discusses a method to create two versions of a Bitcoin transaction, one sending coins to a desired recipient and the other sending all the coins back to the sender. The sender intends to pay 2BTC for a command line tool that can create these two transactions and broadcast them simultaneously to different nodes on the network. A possible approach is suggested by using blockchain.info's raw transaction POST API and the local Bitcoin node. In response to this, Alan suggests a way to accomplish the same task with Armory, which involves switching to "Expert" usermode to use the coin-control feature and unsigned transactions. The email also includes a promotional message about AlienVault Unified Security Management platform.</summary>
