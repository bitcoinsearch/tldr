    <summary>In May 2013, Gavin Andresen expressed his strong support for double-spend propagation across the network. He asked if anyone on the list was not in favor of this, assuming that it did not allow arbitrary traffic multiplication, which could be easily solved. The context suggests that there may have been a discussion or debate regarding this topic among individuals on the list. However, no further information is provided to give insight into what sparked this conversation.</summary>
