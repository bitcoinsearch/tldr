    <summary>The conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd was focused on the implementation of non-repudiation in Bitcoin protocol. While Todd argued that adding non-repudiation should be done at the Bitcoin protocol level, Maxwell pointed out that SSL could be used to ensure secure peer communication with encryption and discovery of peers' IP addresses. Todd agreed that SSL could be implemented by an average developer under Google Summer of Code project. However, he suggested that per-node keys should be created on startup by default to avoid deanonymizing use over tor. They also discussed the implementation of fraud proofs and per-node identity keypair as the first step towards non-repudiation.</summary>
