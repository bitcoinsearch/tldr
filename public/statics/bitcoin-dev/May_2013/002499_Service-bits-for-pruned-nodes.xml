    <summary>In an email dated May 4, 2013, John Dillon and Jeff Garzik discussed the need for multiple means of peer discovery. While DNS seeds, a fixed list, and IRC discovery are currently used as bootstrap methods, they are not effective for overall peer discovery. Peer exchange between P2P nodes is the primary method for obtaining free peers, but bootstrapping into this requires alternate methods. IRC code was deleted due to server issues.</summary>
