    <summary>The email conversation dated May 22, 2013, between Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik discussed the possibility of multiple currencies using the same blockchain. They agreed that encouraging such a use case would be beneficial for altcoins that fit within the scope of Bitcoin or another existing altchain. However, they also agreed that they did not want to support cases like a fork that leaves the genesis block intact and leaves the subsidy at 50.0 BTC forever. Jeff Garzik is a former employee of exMULTI, Inc., and his email address is jgarzik@exmulti.com.</summary>
