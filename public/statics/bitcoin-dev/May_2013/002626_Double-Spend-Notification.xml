    <summary>In May 2013, Robert Backhaus sent an email suggesting that the decision had been made to make 0-conf double spends trivial so that no one would ever trust them. However, Pieter Wuille, who received the email, replied stating that he knew of no such decision having been made. The suggested solution was that if a later transaction appeared with a larger fee than the previous one, it would be considered the valid one and the first one dropped, as long as the first one had not been confirmed. This would make undoing a mistaken transaction possible.</summary>
