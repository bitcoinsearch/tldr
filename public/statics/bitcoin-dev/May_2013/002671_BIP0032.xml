    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-development mailing list explains in a reply that sharing the master public extended key with an auditor would allow them to see all transactions from and to the wallet, in all accounts, but not a single secret key. The original poster had tried to implement this concept based on documentation and code from sipa's repo on GitHub, but was waiting for further implementation before proceeding. The email also includes an advertisement for New Relic's application performance monitoring service.</summary>
