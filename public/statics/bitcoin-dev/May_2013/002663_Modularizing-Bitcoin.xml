    <summary>Bitcoin Grant organization is offering 500 bitcoins or $500,000 for the development of a smarter and more efficient system. One of the main goals of the development is to separate the wallet from the node in order to strengthen the system. The wallet would only hold private keys and create transactions while passing transactions directly to a relay node based on the bloom filter. The block node will maintain the block chain and validate and relay new blocks. Modularization would make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count which is currently low. The organization seeks grant proposals and welcomes feedback and suggestions. However, the scope of the project is highly intensive and technical in nature.</summary>
