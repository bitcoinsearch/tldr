    <summary>According to the proposed native crypto browser support, there are three NIST recommended curves with different bit lengths that can be used - P-256, P-384 and P-521. However, it has been suggested that bitcoin's curve (Koblitz curve) should also be included. The Koblitz curve is currently used by bitcoin and more information about it can be found on the Bitcointalk forum.</summary>
