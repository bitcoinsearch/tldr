    <summary>In an email to himself, Michael discusses the private derivation in the BIP and concludes that it is intentional. He states that while (m/i/j/k)*G = (M/i/j/k), (m/i'/j/k)*G does not equal (M/i/j/k) and results in an error. However, ((m/i')*G)/j/k = (m/i'/j/k)*G. Michael believes that the private derivation is motivated by the desire to avoid revealing known values like K, c, and k_i since they could lead to other values being discovered as well. He expresses concern that many people may fall into this trap.</summary>
