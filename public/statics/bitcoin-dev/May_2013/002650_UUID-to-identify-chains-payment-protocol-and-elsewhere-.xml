    <summary>In a conversation between Jeff Garzik and Melvin Carvalho on May 22, 2013, they discussed the possibility of multiple coin ecosystems sharing the same genesis block. Melvin suggested that an out-of-band algo/hash could work if there was a one-to-one relationship between the object and UUID; however, Jeff stated that this scenario had really bad side effects and went against the whole point of the bitcoin consensus algorithm. He further added that encouraging this behavior with code was not desirable.However, it is worth noting that in some cases, multiple currencies can use the same blockchain beyond just the singular genesis block. In fact, this is a use case that is encouraged as there is no need for people to create an entirely new blockchain if their altcoin fits within the scope of Bitcoin or another existing altchain.</summary>
