    <summary>An email has been sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, starting with a test of the emergency broadcast system. The main content of the email is about an announcement for developers to test their alert-handling code, beginning from next Thursday on the testnet. These weekly alerts will be automated and contain the message "[TEST] This is a test alert broadcast at $TIMESTAMP" and will expire between 2-4 hours with varying priorities. They will be announced at 13:00 UTC, which is currently 9am EST. The purpose of these alerts is to provide developers with a platform to test their systems and make necessary improvements. It is important to note that these alerts are only for testing purposes and not actual emergencies. The email ends with a link to download a free book called "Graph Databases," which is written by three acclaimed leaders in the field. This move will help identify any issues or bugs in their alert-handling system and improve it accordingly. Overall, this new feature will be beneficial for developers who want to test their alert-handling code and ensure that their systems are working effectively. It is a step towards improving the overall security and reliability of the system.</summary>
