    <summary>In an email conversation dated May 31, 2013, Rune Kj√¶r Svendsen expresses his preference for having bitcoind put out messages in batches. He argues that the current system is clunky and there are concurrency issues that may arise. The issue of two queue operations wanting to add to the queue simultaneously could be problematic if disk operations take a long time to finish. Jeff Garzik responds by stating that the need to update bitcoind for this reason is not compelling as most systems are currently able to process a block before another one arrives. Additionally, the problem of parallel processing has been solved for decades, thus making Svendsen's argument moot. Garzik is a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay Inc., a global bitcoin payment service provider.</summary>
