    <summary>A new encoding method has been proposed on Bitcointalk.org that could replace Base58Check in new data. The goal of this new encoding is to make it impossible to manipulate without completely changing it, have a clearly identifiable prefix regardless of data size, and be cheaper to process with simple and faster code. Additionally, the fixed-length string should be less ambiguous and more compatible with using seven-segment displays. It is also altcoin-friendly with a 16-bit namespace that can be read without decoding. However, since there are fewer digits and more identifying/signature characters, addresses will be longer. Several examples of the new encoding are provided, including one for 160 bits of data, an ordinary P2SH destination incorporating Greg's "require the hash mid-image to be relayed" concept (256 bits of data), and an alternative for BIP32 extended public and private keys (560 and 552 bits, respectively). Python code examples are included in the post, and the author suggests that a formal BIP may be written if the idea seems useful.</summary>
