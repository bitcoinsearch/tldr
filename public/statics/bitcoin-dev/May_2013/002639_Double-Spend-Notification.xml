    <summary>In an email conversation, Robert Backhaus expresses his opinion that the Bitcoin community should focus on making 0-confirms as reliable as possible. He suggests a solid system to notify on attempted double-spends as a good start. Peter Todd's experiment with a 2BTC reward is also mentioned, which piuk believes he has met the criteria for by creating a double-spender. Piuk plans to test it further and if it works as intended, he will demonstrate the attack at the next Toronto Bitcoin Meetup. A digital signature accompanies the email.</summary>
