    <summary>In 2013, Gavin Andresen, a prominent Bitcoin developer, raised concerns about three minor security/other issues with the platform. One of these issues was the lack of functionality to "sweep private key." Adam Back agreed that it would be nice to have this feature implemented. The other two issues pertained to unlocking the wallet without displaying the password in the console screen and a UX way to transfer BTC off a specific address. Andresen explained that currently, users have to spend the entire wallet onto a new address just to get BTC off a specific address, which creates more network traffic, bigger packets, higher fees, and damages privacy as all funds end up linked.</summary>
