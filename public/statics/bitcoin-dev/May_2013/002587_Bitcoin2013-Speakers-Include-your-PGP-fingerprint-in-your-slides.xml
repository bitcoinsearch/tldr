    <summary>In a discussion on May 14, 2013, Harald Schilly shared an interesting piece of information about storing encryption keys as a TXT entry on one's own domain. This can be done by using the command "dig +short harald._pka.schil.ly. TXT". Additionally, this method can be used automatically through the command "$ gpg ... --auto-key-locate pka -r email at address.domain". However, Adam raises concerns about the security of DNS, implying that this may not be the most secure way to store one's encryption keys.</summary>
