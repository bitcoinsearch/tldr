    <summary>The idea of creating an anonymous identity using a decentralized approach has been discussed in forums previously. It was mentioned as a solution to the problem of not being able to create Google accounts via Tor without a phone number. The concept involves implementing a server that creates a fidelity bond/anonymous passport and then integrating it with common software like MediaWiki, Wordpress or phpBB to prevent spam and abuse. The server generates transactions that contain pubkeys in inputs which are owned by private keys. To prove ownership of the passport/fidelity bond, a challenge nonce is signed from the server. This could be used on wikis instead of paying the wiki operator.</summary>
