    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, noticed that it takes quite some time for an Android phone to find a peer that will accept an incoming connection. Todd suggested using dedicated nodes backed by fast hardware and high bandwidth internet connections for fast startup. He also proposed discouraging non-Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) use by refusing to relay full blocks. To ensure trust in these special servers, Todd suggested having trusted individuals vouch for them with SSL certificates. Jeff Garzik, another Bitcoin developer, noted that over-reliance on DNS seeds is a problem in bitcoinj and needs fixing.</summary>
