    <summary>In an email conversation dated May 8, 2013, John Dillon speculated that Satoshi Nakamoto may have deliberately set up the Bitcoin network to require a hard fork in the future. Jeff Garzik responded with amusement, stating that the year 2038 is too far off to be relevant to the discussion. He went on to explain that a hard fork would be necessary to break the 1MB limit, which Satoshi had anticipated happening at some point in the future. Garzik's email signature indicates that he was working for exMULTI, Inc. at the time.</summary>
