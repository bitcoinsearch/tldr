    <summary>Melvin Carvalho and Jeff Garzik discussed the possibility of two coin ecosystems having the same genesis block. Melvin suggested that an out-of-band algorithm or hash could work as long as there was a one-to-one relationship between the described object and the UUID. Jeff disagreed, saying that it would have bad side effects and go against the point of the Bitcoin consensus algorithm. He did not want to encourage such behavior with code.</summary>
