    <summary>In a message dated May 8, 2013, Peter Todd speculated about whether Satoshi Nakamoto used 32-bit timestamps in Bitcoin's code deliberately. If so, this would require all Bitcoin users to update their software at the same time to make any changes. Todd suggested that a hard fork could be an opportunity to change the timestamps, as one would likely be necessary at some point for other reasons. The email was signed using GnuPG v1.4.11 with a SHA256 hash.</summary>
