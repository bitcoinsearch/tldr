    <summary>Zooko, an enthusiast of cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has expressed interest in the idea of a 'beta bitcoin blockchain'. However, he claims to lack a fundamental understanding of how it differs from testnet. He suggests that the real value comes from the shared codebase that Bitcoin core developers are paying attention to and that could be played with on some public blockchain. He proposes that a solution would be a branch or fork on GitHub called "bitcoin-next" or "bitcoin-staging." This would give people with an interest in Bitcoin a common codebase to aim pull requests at and fork on GitHub. Zooko says this feels different from the idea of going to an alt-coin, as he suspects most Bitcoin core developers aren't paying attention to them.</summary>
