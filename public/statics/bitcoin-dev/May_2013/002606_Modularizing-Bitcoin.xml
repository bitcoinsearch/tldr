    <summary>Bitcoin Grant is offering 500 bitcoins or $500,000 to developers who will undertake the modularization of bitcoin's infrastructure beyond the bloom filter. Through this initiative, Bitcoin Grant aims to develop a smarter and more efficient system for the future. The project aims to separate the wallet from the node and pass transactions directly to a relay node based on the bloom filter. The block node will maintain the block chain, validate, and relay new blocks. Modularization would make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count which is currently low. This is not just a feature request but an idea to initiate a discussion on how to work together towards developing a smarter and more efficient system. Bitcoin Grant welcomes any feedback, suggestions, and grant proposals from the community.</summary>
