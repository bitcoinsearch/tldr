    <summary>In an email thread on Bitcoin development, Jeff Garzik defended the storage format of Bitcoin protocol blocks, which he claimed was the most efficient and supported format for multiple applications. A member of the group proposed adding support for more Bitcoin-protocol-oriented HTTP requests to allow any client to supply the same interface, rather than being forced to create blkNNNN.dat on the fly. However, Garzik argued that this proposal would require a whole new client interface and was far outside the scope of an efficient HTTP protocol that downloads blocks. He also dismissed the alternative of giving access to a file on disk since it hardly needs discussion or the involvement of bitcoind, as Apache can do it right now. The member then suggested that adding another thread listening for HTTP requests at the same time as 8333 for standard format wouldn't be a rewrite, but Garzik disagreed.</summary>
