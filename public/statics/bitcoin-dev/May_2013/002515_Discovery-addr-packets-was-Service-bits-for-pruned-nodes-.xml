    <summary>In a 2013 email conversation about adding non-repudiation to the Bitcoin protocol, Peter Todd argued that it was not necessary for the first version. He suggested that non-repudiation would have to be added at the protocol level and was orthogonal to using SSL encryption to secure connections. However, Todd acknowledged that non-repudiation is always useful when there is trust, as it allows reputation to be tied to good behavior. Todd also discussed the concept of per-node identity keypairs as the first step towards non-repudiation and implementing SSL transport. He cautioned that care was needed to avoid problems such as deanonymizing use over Tor with these keys. Overall, Todd's email highlighted the importance of considering different security measures and their potential implications in the development of protocols like Bitcoin.</summary>
