    <summary>In 2013, Ricardo Filipe proposed a solution for the problem of few copies of historic data by suggesting that users could choose what parts of the blockchain to store. The chunks would be stored randomly according to user's available space and priority would be given to the "N most recent" chunks to have more replicas in the network. He suggested using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to organize this data rather than Bittorrent. Jeff Garzik responded negatively to this proposal stating that it would be the worst thing to do for Bitcoin as it would make the blockchain vulnerable to DoS attacks on one part of the DHT which would break the entire chain.</summary>
