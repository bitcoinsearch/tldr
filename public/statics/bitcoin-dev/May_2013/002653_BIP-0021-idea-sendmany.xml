    <summary>The author proposes a new bitcoin URI scheme for the simplest way to perform a transaction with multiple outputs. The intended purpose is to provide a single URI that specifies all of the outputs and minimizes opportunities for user error. The proposed format includes labels and addresses, which keeps them together for human readability. The label delimiter "/" is a reserved character, making it easy for bitcoin clients to parse. The author also discusses the potential failure modes and how to guard against them. Lastly, the author provides some examples and testing results with MultiBit.</summary>
