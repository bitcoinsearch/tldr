    <summary>In this message, Adam Back discusses the need for a user experience (UX) way to transfer Bitcoin (BTC) off a specific address. Currently, users have to spend their entire wallet balance onto a new address to move BTC off a specific address, which creates more network traffic, higher fees, and damages privacy. In addition, the FAQs suggest that this is the only way to transfer BTC off a specific address. The author mentions using "sendfrom" in the RPC interface, but notes that it is difficult to use and easy to make mistakes. The author suggests that an "advanced" GUI option to choose the source account/key would be a nice feature to have. They sign off with their contact information and a quote about love from Leibniz.</summary>
