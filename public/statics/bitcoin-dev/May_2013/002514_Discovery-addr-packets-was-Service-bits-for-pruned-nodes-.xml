    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd, the former suggested adding a new protocol message that asks a node to sign the current accumulated hash. When asked why not use standard SSL instead of implementing non-repudiation, Maxwell explained that SSL does not provide non-repudiation, which is necessary for proving that a node deceived him. Todd argued that non-repudiation is not needed for the first version since it has to happen at the Bitcoin protocol level and is orthogonal to using SSL. The concept of a per-node identity keypair is the first step towards non-repudiation and implementing SSL transport. Todd suggested implementing an SSL-protected transport and leaving non-repudiation and broader issues of node identity as a later, long-term project. He added that many clients may not want to support complexity but will still want to cheaply get the advantages SSL has with regard to MITM resistance and privacy with little effort.</summary>
