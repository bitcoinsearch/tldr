    <summary>Bitcoin.org currently has five alerts pages regarding past network events that lack visibility and cannot be easily followed. To address this issue, a setup has been created to enable developers to conveniently communicate about noteworthy network events. The pull request for this setup includes code, screenshots, live demos, instructions, and details. All comments are welcome, as the tool is ultimately designed for developers. It is up to them to decide whether to merge it or suggest any modifications.</summary>
