    <summary>The statement regarding audits through the Master Public key, M, is incorrect. Only incoming and outgoing transactions of publicly derived wallets will be part of the audit. Privately derived wallets cannot be obtained. However, addition points from privately derived wallets can be shared without loss of security: (m/i')*G. There is no concept of a single public master key.To provide full access to the list of incoming and outgoing payments, an auditor can be given the master public extended key. This will enable them to view all transactions from and to the wallet in all accounts, but not a single secret key.</summary>
