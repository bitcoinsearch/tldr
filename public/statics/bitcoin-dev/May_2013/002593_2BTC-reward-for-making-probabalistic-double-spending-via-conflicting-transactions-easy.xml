    <summary>Peter Todd is offering 2BTC to anyone who can create a command-line tool that can create two versions of a transaction sending coins to a desired recipient and another version sending all the coins back to the user, both with the same inputs. The tool must also broadcast both versions simultaneously to different nodes on the network. A good starting point for the work would be Gavin's spendfrom utility in the contrib/spendfrom directory in the Bitcoin-QT repository. Peter insists that it is better for the community if an attack is demonstrated first, followed by releasing the code some time later.</summary>
