    <summary>The email conversation discusses the issue of signed timestamps in Bitcoin blocks. Pieter Wuille proposes a solution for a well-defined 64-bit timestamp for each block, but only putting the lowest 32 bits in the header. He suggests that the actual 64-bit timestamp can be derived from the header deterministically by prefixing it with the lowest 32-bit value that does not violate the rule of at-least-above-the-median-of-the-previous-11-blocks. This proposal is not backward-incompatible and has the condition that there should never be a gap of more than 136 years between two blocks. The email ends with a link to download a free book on graph databases and an invitation to join the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
