    <summary>Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.2 release candidate 1 has been made available on SourceForge. The release is focused on maintenance and bug fixes, as well as a few new minor features. The release also includes changes to the fee policy, with the default fee for low-priority transactions being lowered from 0.0005 BTC to 0.0001 BTC. Additionally, payments of 0.543 times the minimum relay fee are now considered non-standard. Bitcoin-Qt changes include a new icon and splash screen, improved synchronization process reporting and the removal of hardcoded fee recommendations. The release also includes significant changes to the networking code, reducing latency and memory consumption.</summary>
