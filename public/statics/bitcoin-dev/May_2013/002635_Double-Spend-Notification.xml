    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the world of cryptocurrency, has expressed his support for double-spend propagation across the network. He believes that this approach is superior to other methods like replace-based-on-fee or child-pays-burn-coins. Gavin argues that informing merchants as soon as possible about customers attempting to cheat them is crucial and should be prioritized. Overall, he advocates for a system that has improved fraud prevention measures compared to the current one.</summary>
