    <summary>Addy Yeow asked the reason behind having 32-bit and 64-bit timestamp fields instead of all being 64-bit on Bitcoin. The answer is that Satoshi used 32-bits and changing those fields now would require every single Bitcoin user to change at once, which is a "hard-fork" change. It is probable that a hard-fork change will be needed eventually for other reasons, so fixing the timestamps can be left until then.</summary>
