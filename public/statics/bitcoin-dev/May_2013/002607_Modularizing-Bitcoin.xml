    <summary>The Bitcoin Grant is offering 500 bitcoins or $500,000 for the continued modularization of the Bitcoin system. The project will focus on separating the wallet from the node, with the wallet only holding private keys and creating transactions, while the block node maintains the block chain and validates and relays new blocks. This will make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count, which is currently fairly low. The Bitcoin Grant believes that excellent developers should be compensated for their work, especially when it comes to open source projects. The initiative aims to develop a smarter and more efficient system of tomorrow, today. Feedback and suggestions are welcome, as are grant proposals.</summary>
