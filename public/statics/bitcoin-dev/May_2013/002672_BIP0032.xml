    <summary>In an email thread discussing Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 32, Michael Gronager comments that the current formulation of the BIP text is confusing as it refers to both 'public derivation' and 'public derivation function'. He suggests using better terminology such as type-1 and type-2 derivation. The motivation for private derivation is to avoid the known (K,c) and known k_i =&gt; k known too. There are already other implementations available such as this Python one https://github.com/FelixWeis/hdwallet, and Java code in Bits of Proof. Implementing a deterministic wallet involves more than just key derivation, including detecting new keys/chains being used, lookahead, how to use accounts (if at all), and internal/external subchains.</summary>
