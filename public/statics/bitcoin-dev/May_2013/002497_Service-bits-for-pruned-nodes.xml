    <summary>In this email conversation, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd discuss whether or not DNS caching should be allowed for seeds in a P2P network. Todd suggests that if the step is taken to allow DNS caching, the responses should be rounded off to some number of bits to prevent DNS caching from being defeated. However, Hearn argues that allowing cacheable responses risks a wall of traffic suddenly showing up at one set of nodes if a large ISP caches a response. Todd then considers the possibility of seeds having high-bandwidth nodes they can direct clients to, but ultimately decides that given the poorly behaved nature of many ISP DNS servers when it comes to caching, keeping things simple is probably the best approach.</summary>
