    <summary>In December 2014, a discussion on DNS seeds took place which revealed that some DNS seeds were getting blocked by ISPs because the hosts they picked up (which ran Bitcoin core nodes) also served as web servers alongside them. These web servers were serving malware and other harmful content, which ended up on IP-based malware blacklists. Thus, it was not surprising that some servers in the world were running full nodes and malware servers together. However, it was unclear how ISPs were reading the DNS seed's node list, scanning those IPs for malware, and then ending up blocking the DNS seed. The incident of Microsoft taking over No-IP.com raised questions about whether DNS seeds were being blocked ostensibly because they were acting as dynamic DNS infrastructure for malware sites.</summary>
