    <summary>A recent request has been made for Bitcoind|qt to have Dual-Stack support, according to a message sent via the bitcoin-list mailing list on SourceForge. Along with this request, grarpamp suggested linking nodes into Tor, I2P, and CJDNS networks to gather more information. The idea behind the Dual-Stack support is to make it possible for IPv6 nodes to communicate with IPv4 nodes while maintaining compatibility with both types of networks. This feature would also allow for improved network efficiency and security. Grarpamp's suggestion to link nodes into Tor, I2P, and CJDNS networks could provide additional benefits in terms of privacy and anonymity. By linking to these networks, users would be able to securely connect with other nodes and receive information without fear of being tracked or monitored. Overall, these suggestions highlight the importance of network compatibility and security within the Bitcoin community. By implementing these features, users can ensure that their transactions are conducted safely and efficiently.</summary>
