    <summary>In a discussion between two individuals, Justus Ranvier and Mike Hearn, the question is raised regarding the difference between adding inputs to a coinbase and having pay-to-fee transactions in a block. Hearn suggests that if a miner includes pay-to-fee transactions in a block, those fees could be claimed by another miner in the case the first miner's block is orphaned. However, inputs to a generation transaction cannot be poached in the same way. This difference allows for certain services that can't be safely achieved with pay-to-fee transactions. The conversation ends with contact information for both parties.</summary>
