    <summary>In an email thread on December 10th, 2014, Austin Walne expressed his willingness to write up some documentation based on the questions raised. He also asked for any other key terminologies that should be included in the document. It was mentioned in the same thread that Fanquake had already started working on the documentation, although it wasn't mentioned in the email exchange. A link to Fanquake's work was provided on Github. Wladimir was also a part of this conversation.</summary>
