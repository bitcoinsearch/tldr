    <summary>In an email conversation, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik discussed the modularization process of code movement and refactoring done in parallel but in separate logical chunks. However, he also highlighted that this process led to a blizzard of new files and data structures, making it difficult for out-of-tree patches to be applied and reviewed. Garzik suggested examining the flow of patches into the tree over time and addressing the problem with a majority of upfront code movement, followed by simplifications and data structure work. Merely tagging patches as movement-only would not solve the issue.</summary>
