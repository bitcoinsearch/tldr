    <summary>In this context, the conversation revolves around defining new rules in terms of signatures and authorizations. The possibility of using math to prevent signing more than one message is also discussed, with Adam suggesting that it may be sort-of possible to achieve this. Peter Todd suggests that there's no need to delve into crypto math at this stage and instead proposes using extensions to the Bitcoin scripting system to verify ECDSA signatures directly. The discussion centers around the technical aspects of implementing such changes and how they can be achieved within the existing framework.</summary>
