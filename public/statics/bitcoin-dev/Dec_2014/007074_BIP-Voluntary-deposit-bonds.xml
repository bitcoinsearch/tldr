    <summary>In an email conversation on December 30th, 2014, Sergio Lerner expressed concern over the complexity of Bitcoin. He believed that even P2SH was an abuse of the virtual machine (VM) and that Gavin's OP_EVAL should have been chosen instead. Sergio argued that Bitcoin needs to be simple for new programmers to understand so that they can contribute to the project. In response, someone clarified that there is no "abuse" occurring and that what Sergio proposed would require an additional change to overlay functionality in order to actually do something. This additional change would likely be considered "ugly."</summary>
