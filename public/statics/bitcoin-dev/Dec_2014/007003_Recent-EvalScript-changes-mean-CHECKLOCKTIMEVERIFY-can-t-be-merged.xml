    <summary>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, expressed concerns over the development process of the consensus critical codebase in a message to the Bitcoin Core mailing list. He argued that the manner and volume of changes made for the v0.10 release were indicative of a development process that has been taking significant risks with regard to refactoring the consensus critical codebase. Specifically, Todd pointed out that pull-req #4890 had no ACKs at all and only two untested utACKS, which he found worrying for something that made significant consensus critical code changes. He also recommended not upgrading to v0.10 due to these issues. Todd suggested that instead of encapsulating the consensus code in a library, the changes required should be limited to simple movements of code for this release, accept that the interface to that library won't be ideal, and wait until feedback from multiple open-source projects with publicly evaluable code on where to go next with the API.</summary>
