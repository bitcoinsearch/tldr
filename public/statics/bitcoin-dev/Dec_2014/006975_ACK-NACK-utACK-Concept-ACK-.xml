    <summary>A user on the Bitcoin-development mailing list had requested documentation explaining key terminology used within code reviews. In response, Wladimir provided a list of abbreviations, including 'Concept ACK', 'utACK', and 'Tested ACK'. He also mentioned the term 'NACK', which means a reviewer wouldn't like the code merged, providing further explanation in the text. Wladimir expressed that a document on this would be useful as it may not be easily understood by outsiders. The user thanked Wladimir for his response and offered to draft something based on the thread.</summary>
