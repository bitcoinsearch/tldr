    <summary>The importance of modular code and logical organization of smaller files, especially for consensus critical code, is stressed by Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin Core developer and open source evangelist. He suggests that refactoring should come in a second wave after stable release and the first step should be to relocate blocks of code. He compares this with the process in the Linux kernel where One Big File driver with &gt; 1MB of source code was broken into logical source code files. In situations where the drivers had to keep working, failure was not an option. In code such as Bitcoin Core, it is important to optimize for reviewer bandwidth and think about the patch stream. The current stream of refactoring is criticized for being reviewer-unfriendly and sapping reviewer bandwidth. Some change is suggested to make it more effective.</summary>
