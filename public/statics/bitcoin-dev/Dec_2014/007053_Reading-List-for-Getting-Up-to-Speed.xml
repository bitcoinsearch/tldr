    <summary>In an email exchange dated December 24, 2014, Will Bickford expressed concern about sifting through 280,000 lines of code. However, it was clarified that only 36kloc of the code in the top level (/src) and libconsensus required skimming. The remaining 170kloc consisted of machine-generated code with translation strings. It was strongly recommended to at least skim through the smaller portion of the code.</summary>
