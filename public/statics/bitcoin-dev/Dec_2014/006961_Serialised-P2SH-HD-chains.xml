    <summary>A group in San Diego had been working on a standardized HD multisig chain-description format that all three wallets could understand. This format would be used to create a 2-of-3 multisig wallet using phone, PC, and hardware key fob which are running different wallet software. Once the chain-description file is shared with a third party, they too can generate addresses out of the wallet. This can be used for auditing, receive-only wallets, and recurring payments. The format has a script template and describes the HD chains in a separate section rather than in-line with the script. Unfortunately, there are still more details to work through before having a concrete proposal ready for this mailing list. Luke Dashjr asked if anyone was working on a serialization format to convey P2SH HD chains. He suggests creating a single token that can generate many P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script.</summary>
