    <summary>The idea of burn mining side chains has been proposed as a foundation for an ecosystem that allows permission-less merge mining for those interested in a side chain. However, there has been a lack of feedback on the idea, leaving Tamas Blummer of Bits of Proof puzzled. The proposal suggests burning Bitcoin in order to mine a side chain, which would then allow for merge mining with the Bitcoin network. Despite the potential benefits of this approach, it remains unclear why there has been little response to the idea.</summary>
