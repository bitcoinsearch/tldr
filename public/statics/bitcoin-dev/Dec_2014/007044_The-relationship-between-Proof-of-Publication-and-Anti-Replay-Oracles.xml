    <summary>The discussion between Paul Snow and Peter Todd centers around the relationship between anti-replay systems and proof-of-publication. While anti-replay systems can prevent replay by some set of rules, they cannot be used to implement proof-of-publication because knowing that no conflicting message exists says nothing about who is in possession of that message. On the other hand, with the blockchain, it is possible to prove that a message is in the blockchain, and anyone in possession of the blockchain will be in possession of the message. It is important to note that anti-replay systems are an abstract mathematical model that may be implemented in various ways, and any conceivable implementation must involve some type of storage. However, this storage can easily be 100% local to the anti-replay oracle and need not store the data itself.</summary>
