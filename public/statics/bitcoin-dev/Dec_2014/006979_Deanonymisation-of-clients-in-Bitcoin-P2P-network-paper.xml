    <summary>The author argues that it is important to prioritize the continual use of Tor or similar systems in order to protect hosts' privacy. Reimplementing Tor would result in losing significant investments and a large user base. Although there are limitations when using Bitcoin with Tor, the author suggests that both projects may need to evolve to better interface with each other. The author sees merit in exploring ways to improve synergy between the two projects, such as utilizing Bitcoin's resource compensation mechanism to solve issues with Tor's hardcoded circuit length. Overall, the author advocates for finding ways to improve the interoperability between Tor and Bitcoin while maintaining their standalone functionality.</summary>
