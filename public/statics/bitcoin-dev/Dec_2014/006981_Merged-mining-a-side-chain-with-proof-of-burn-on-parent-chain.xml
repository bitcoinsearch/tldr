    <summary>Isodor, a member of the Bitcoin community, believes that Rational Miner will include burn transactions for fees. He also notes that censoring transactions goes against Bitcoin's core values and is unlikely to receive widespread support. Meanwhile, Patrick argues that mining is still at cost even if following the rules, suggesting no changes will be made to this aspect of Bitcoin. Finally, Tamas Blummer of Bits of Proof provides no input on the matter.</summary>
