    <summary>The author of this context is seeking information on a serialisation format that can be used to convey P2SH HD chains for the purpose of making recurring payments. The idea is to generate a single token that can be used to generate multiple P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script. The author proposes the use of a simple series of tokens, each indicating either a HD chain or literal script content. For all HD chains in the data, a child key would be generated based on the payment number, and all tokens concatenated to form the P2SH serialised script. The proposed solution involves concatenating all tokens to form the P2SH serialised script. The author provides an example of how this would work for a simple 2-of-2. The question posed at the end of the context is whether this solution sufficiently covers all reasonable use cases.</summary>
