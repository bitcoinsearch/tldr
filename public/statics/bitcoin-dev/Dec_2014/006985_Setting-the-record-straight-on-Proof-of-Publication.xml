    <summary>On 12/12/2014, a message was posted by odinn discussing the work being done by the Mastercoin developers. However, it was questioned whether all of the developers would agree with this statement. The message also included a signature and information about supporting online privacy through email encryption. Additionally, there was an attachment named "0x38450DB5.asc" which was a PGP key for encryption.</summary>
