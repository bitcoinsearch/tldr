    <summary>On December 4, 2014, Luke Dashjr posted a query on whether anyone is working on a serialization format to convey P2SH HD chains. He proposed an idea of using a simple series of tokens, each indicating either an HD chain or literal script content, to generate many P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script. Jeffrey Paul questioned the need for such a token when a single token that can be used to get many P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script already exists. Luke-Jr responded that this idea of serialization format is useful in situations where the payee is not online. It could also avoid specifying scriptPubKey formats too explicitly. This idea was similar to some of the ideas he had been considering for generalized stealth addresses, using a declarative template scheme to avoid specifying scriptPubKey formats too explicitly.</summary>
