    <summary>Client-side validation and SPV have different types of security. Client-side validation is mathematically secure, while SPV is economically secure, but with certain assumptions about economics. The former is considered to be more secure than the latter, though it's a philosophical question. Proof-of-work consensus has some robustness against version inconsistencies and accidents, but it's not entirely dependable. The Great Fork of 2013 was resolved through human intervention since Bitcoin nodes couldn't detect that something was going wrong on their own. Naive proof-of-publication is also fragile in this respect, but it can be made more robust.</summary>
