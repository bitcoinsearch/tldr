    <summary>Bitcoin XT is a patch set on top of Bitcoin Core 0.10rc1 that improves the peer-to-peer protocol. The patch set includes double spend relaying and BIP 64 support, which are useful for merchants and Lighthouse to spot double spends and render a more helpful GUI respectively. By running XT, users can provide additional services to the P2P network, test features thoroughly and help build the case for inclusion in Bitcoin Core. There is a mailing list for discussion of patch inclusion and another for announcements. The XT project aims to provide a friendly environment where SPV app developers and merchants can experiment with new features and explore new directions for the protocol. Even just a few nodes can be useful as the patch set contains features that don't require everyone to opt-in.</summary>
