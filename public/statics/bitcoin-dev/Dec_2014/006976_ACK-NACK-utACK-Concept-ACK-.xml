    <summary>In an email exchange on December 10th, 2014, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik received a message from Wladimir expressing a "Concept ACK" regarding an idea proposed. The term "Concept ACK" indicates agreement with the overall direction of the proposal but acknowledges that the code changes have not been reviewed or tested. In this case, Wladimir liked the idea but suggested that the code may need rewriting or further review before implementation. Jeff Garzik is an open-source evangelist and also works at BitPay, Inc., a company that provides bitcoin payment processing services.</summary>
