    <summary>The article discusses the inclusion of burn transactions in Bitcoin mining, which offer Bitcoin fees. It states that miners cannot selectively block side chains due to the lack of information disclosed by the hashes associated with the burn. This allows for “merged mining” without the need for miner support or consent. However, there is a possibility that miners and other nodes may decide to block or stop relaying burn transactions to prevent deflation.</summary>
