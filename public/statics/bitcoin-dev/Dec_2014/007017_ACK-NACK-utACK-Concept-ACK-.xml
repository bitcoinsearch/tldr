    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, a member named Drak asks for clarification on the use of "nit" in the context of nitpicking and how it affects consensus. Drak believes that it is used for minor complaints or preferences. In response, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, explains the concept ACK (acknowledgement), which means agreeing with the idea and overall direction but not having reviewed the code changes nor tested it. He also provides another explanation of concept ACK as liking the idea but needing code rewriting or not having reviewed it yet. The email includes a promotion for BIRT iHub F-Type, a free enterprise-grade BIRT server.</summary>
