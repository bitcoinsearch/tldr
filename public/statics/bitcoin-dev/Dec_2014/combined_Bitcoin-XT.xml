    <summary>Bitcoin XT is a patch set built on top of Bitcoin Core 0.10rc1 that enhances the peer-to-peer protocol. This patch set includes double spend relaying and BIP 64 support, which are beneficial for merchants and Lighthouse to spot double spends and provide a more helpful GUI respectively. By using XT, users can offer additional services to the P2P network, thoroughly test features, and help in building a case for inclusion in Bitcoin Core. The project aims to create an environment where SPV app developers and merchants can experiment with new features and explore new directions for the protocol. There are two mailing lists available for discussion and announcements related to patch inclusion. According to the XT team, even just a few nodes can be useful as the patch set includes features that don't require everyone to opt-in. The goal of the XT project is to provide a friendly and conducive environment for app developers and merchants to experiment and explore new possibilities for the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
