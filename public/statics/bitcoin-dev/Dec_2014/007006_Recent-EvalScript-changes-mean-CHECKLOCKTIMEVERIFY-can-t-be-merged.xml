    <summary>Pieter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, sent an email to the Bitcoin development mailing list detailing his concerns with the development process of the consensus critical codebase. Todd noted that the large volume of code being moved and changed for the v0.10 release has made it difficult for him and others to keep up, especially with the significant consensus critical code changes being made. Todd cited pull-req #4890 as an example of this, noting that the pull request had no ACKs at all and only two untested utACKS. Todd also expressed concern about the risks being taken with regard to refactoring the consensus critical codebase. He recommended not upgrading to v0.10 due to these issues. Todd suggested a safer approach would be to accept that the interface to the consensus library won't be ideal and wait until there is feedback from multiple open-source projects with publicly evaluatable code on where to go next with the API.</summary>
