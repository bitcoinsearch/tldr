    <summary>In December 2014, Sergio Lerner proposed an idea to allow miners to lock funds by adding additional inputs to the coinbase transaction. Currently, the coinbase transaction only allows a pseudo-input to be added. Gregory Maxwell provided a concrete example of how this could work, suggesting that anyone can spend output "PUSH OP_NOP3" would make the anyone can pay transaction simply a coinbase input.However, there was some concern about this proposal being an abuse of the VM, with Gavin's OP_EVAL (hard-fork) being seen as a better option. The writer expressed a desire for Bitcoin to remain simple and easy to understand for new programmers, rather than becoming overly complex.</summary>
