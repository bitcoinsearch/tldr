    <summary>The consensus library is an important goal of the Bitcoin Core project as it would help in isolating the consensus code completely. This would make it easier to enforce a different regime of change control there or even freeze it over time. The consensus changes can be tracked by following that repository, instead of filtering it between tons of GUI, RPC or utility commits. While some refactoring is unavoidable, the author believes that having the consensus isolated into a portable self-contained library is the most important goal of Bitcoin Core project at this point. The author also suggests finding a way to rebase CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY so that it can land in 0.11 without causing an unreasonable risk to safety.</summary>
