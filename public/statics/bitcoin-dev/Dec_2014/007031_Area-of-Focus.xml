    <summary>Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) replace Domain Name System (DNS) results with warning pages if they detect an IP address serving malware. However, this approach may block perfectly good nodes too. One solution is to hide the actual IPs in the results, but this is seen as an "ugly hack". There have been discussions regarding DNS seeds being blocked by ISPs because some of the hosts they pick up run Bitcoin Core nodes alongside malware-serving web servers. It is unclear how ISPs are reading the DNS seed's node list and scanning those IPs for malware before ending up blocking the DNS seed. Some believe that ISPs null-route a DNS server for resolving domains to IPs that happen to be hosting malware, which could be a result of their acting as dynamic DNS infrastructure for malware sites.</summary>
