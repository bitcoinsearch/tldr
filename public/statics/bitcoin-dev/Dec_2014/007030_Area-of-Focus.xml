    <summary>A potential solution to DNS seed server blacklists due to IP-based malware is discussed within the Bitcoin development mailing list. The discussion suggests that some DNS seeds are blocked by ISPs because the hosts they pick up, which run Bitcoin core nodes, often run web servers alongside, serving malware or other content, leading to them being blacklisted. A possible solution to this issue may be supporting a subdomain with results XORed with some constant mask to tweak the real IP. It may also be useful to add a TXT/AAAA/whatever record with a signature of the results provided by the DNSseed operator. Furthermore, Will Bickford expresses an interest in helping with Bitcoin development testing and requests feedback on where he can make the most significant impact. Christian Decker added a safety check to his crawler, hoping to prevent it from being blacklisted.</summary>
