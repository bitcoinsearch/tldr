    <summary>Will Bickford expressed his interest in helping with Bitcoin core development by automating and enhancing software systems, as well as root causing and fixing issues. He asked for feedback on where he could make the best impact, after seeing Gavin's call for help with testing. Jeff Garzik recommended that Will take a look at how the current tests are built in src/test, which includes RPC, REST, P2P, internal unit tests, and more. Jeff also suggested operating automated tests at the Qt level and joining #bitcoin-dev IRC to ask questions and read the Bitcoin wiki. Overall, Jeff emphasized that figuring out a good test requires knowing Bitcoin and the current test regimes.</summary>
