    <summary>On December 29, 2014, a conversation took place between Thomas Zander and Mike Hearn. The discussion revolved around the current DNS protocol and the limitations it presents. Mike made an ad-hominem attack by calling someone "a parody," which Thomas and a third party deemed unacceptable behavior in any collaborative group. However, Thomas focused on criticizing the idea itself rather than engaging in personal attacks. The conversation ended with Thomas signing off using PGP encryption.</summary>
