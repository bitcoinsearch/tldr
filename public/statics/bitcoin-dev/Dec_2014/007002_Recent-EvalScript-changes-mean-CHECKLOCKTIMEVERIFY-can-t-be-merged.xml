    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter Todd responds to a concern regarding the safety of changes made to the consensus critical codebase. The change in question is commit c7829ea7, which disentangled the script validation from the node state introduced by the signature caching changes. Todd sees the change as narrow and reasonable, with five participants on the PR and moderately good test coverage. He suggests that instead of violating the layering by re-parsing the transaction as the lower level, the data should be additional information that is needed available. Todd also notes that 0.10 is a major release with many important, even critical, behavioral changes, and that these changes have their own risks.</summary>
