    <summary>In an email thread from December 2014, Wladimir discussed the different types of acknowledgments used when reviewing code changes for the Bitcoin software. He explained that a "Concept ACK" means agreeing with the idea and direction of the change, but not having reviewed or tested the code. A "utACK" means that the reviewer has looked at the code changes, but has not tested them. Finally, a "Tested ACK" means that the reviewer has both reviewed and tested the code changes and verified their functionality. Wladimir also mentioned the use of NACK, which is a more specific rejection of a code change with an explanation provided. He suggested that a document explaining these terms would be helpful for outsiders as it can be confusing to understand the different levels of acknowledgment without context. Despite this suggestion being made before, no such document had been created at the time of the email.</summary>
