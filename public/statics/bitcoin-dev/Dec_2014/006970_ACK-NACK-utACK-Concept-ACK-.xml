    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, the terms "utACK" and "tested ack" were mentioned as acronyms for untested and tested acknowledgment. Sergio Lerner asked if there were any other acronyms or if these were documented somewhere. The conversation ended with a link to download BIRT iHub F-Type, which provides free enterprise-grade BIRT server technology for business reports and dashboards with interactivity and app integration, among others.</summary>
