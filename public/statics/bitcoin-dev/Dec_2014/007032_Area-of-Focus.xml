    <summary>According to an email sent by Jeremy Spilman on December 20, 2014, it appears that DNSseeds are being blocked because they are being used as dynamic DNS infrastructure for malware sites. This seems to be an automated process that predates the msft no-ip.com issue. Similar problems have also been encountered with the IRC based method originally used by the software.The problem of mail relay spam blacklisting is also discussed, with the suggestion that there is a whole industry selling “semi-snake-oil” blocking solutions to make the internet safer. The low margin business requires a cheap and highly automated approach, which results in lots of inappropriate things getting blocked. The solution is to move out of their sights, so that they at least have to specifically target Bitcoin. If they do, it will at least be worth the time spent fixing it.Finally, opendns is mentioned as still blocking all of sipa.be as of the writing of the email. Readers are invited to try loading http://bitcoin.sipa.be while using opendns to confirm this.</summary>
