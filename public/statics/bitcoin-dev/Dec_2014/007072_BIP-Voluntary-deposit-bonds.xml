    <summary>In this message, Justus Ranvier responds to Jorge Tim√≥n's question on how miners paying themselves helps with security and future lower subsidies. He explains that if miners wanted to offer value-added services, the most natural way for their customers to pay them is to allow inputs to the generation transaction. This could also be done with pay-to-fee transactions but would make the services more expensive due to risk premium. The attachment at the end of the message is a public key ID for Justus Ranvier.</summary>
