    <summary>The Bitcoin Core project has come under criticism for the number of refactorings taking place, with concerns raised about the frequency and speed at which they are being done. The problem with refactoring is that small edge case bugs can easily creep in and cause unforeseen problems. The first steps to more modular code should be to relocate blocks of code so everything is more logically organised in smaller files, while refactoring should come in a second wave after a stable release. When it comes to actual API changes, these need to be considered as feature requests and scrutinised much more closely as they break backwards compatibility. As history shows, small edge case bugs can creep in very easily and cause a lot of unforeseen problems.</summary>
