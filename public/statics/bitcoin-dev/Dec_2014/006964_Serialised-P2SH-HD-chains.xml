    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, inquired about a serialization format to convey P2SH HD chains for recurring payments. He suggested creating a simple series of tokens that would indicate either an HD chain or literal script content. Eric Lombrozo is building a BIP to standardize a multisig application of BIP32 that would embed all the necessary information for a "multisig xpub" into a string and pipe it through a BIP32-like algorithm to pop off P2SH addresses in a deterministic order. The resultant multisig wallet would have a total keychains system, minimum number of keys required, and which derivation paths on each keychain are to be combined. Michael Perklin suggested connecting Eric and Luke to help each other if both are working on similar projects.</summary>
