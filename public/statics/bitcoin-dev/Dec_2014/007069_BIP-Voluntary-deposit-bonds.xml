    <summary>On December 29, 2014 at 9:10:20 PM, Mike Hearn asked Luke about the difference between adding inputs to a coinbase and having pay-to-fee transactions in the block. Luke explained that pay-to-fee transactions could be "stolen" by another block at the same or greater height. On the other hand, additional inputs to the generation transaction are tied to that block alone. This means that the additional inputs are more secure and cannot be taken by another block.</summary>
