    <summary>Tamas Blummer, the creator of Bitcoin mining algorithm, has proposed a new mining algorithm for side chains that uses Bitcoin to secure them. The proposed method involves a burn transaction that sends at least n satoshis to an OP_RETURN h, with h mod m matching the Bitcoin block hash mod m for the block the burn transaction was mined into. Those who want to mine the side chain will assemble side chain block candidates and submit a Bitcoin transaction burning to the hash of the block candidate. If the burn transaction is included in the Bitcoin blockchain and meets the lottery criteria, the block candidate can be submitted to extend the side chain. A side chain block header sequence would be accepted as a side chain trunk if a sequence of Bitcoin SPV proofs for burn transactions prove that linked blocks have the highest cumulative burn compared to alternative sequences.The concept of Proof of Burn establishes an opportunity cost for breaking the rules in Bitcoin. The cost involves participants burning their cryptocurrency, serving as a real consequence for following the rules. However, there is no direct effect for those who decide on the adequacy of the cost between Proof of Burn and other approaches that keep Bitcoins within participating outputs. Any notion that differentiates between the two must assume what interests the Bitcoin community as a whole. In an email conversation, Alex Mizrahi discussed the potential for sidechains and merged-mined chains to be vulnerable to collusion attacks. However, proof-of-burn systems could incentivize defenders to protect against attacks and allow for a strong response. The goal is to have an opportunity cost to breaking the rules, but relying on opportunity cost is problematic when the system isn't heavily used. Additionally, the system isn't secure until it's heavily used, and it isn't heavily used until it's secure. Usually, people assume that miners aren't going to collude; otherwise, even Bitcoin is not secure. But this is not the case with sidechains or any merged-mined chains. Once there is a clear incentive, collusion is much more likely.Isidor Zeuner questions the effectiveness of Proof of Burn in comparison to other approaches that keep Bitcoins within the set of outputs that can still participate. Blummer responds by stating that without burning the output, there is no cost to expressing alternate opinions simultaneously. He goes on to suggest that any notion which differentiates the two approaches must make assumptions about what defines the interest of the Bitcoin nodes as a community.The proposal for a new mining algorithm for side chains by Tamas Blummer aims to create a real cost for following the rules and to avoid sybil attacks. The use of internal proof-of-burn systems could increase the incentive to defend the system by allowing tokens to be burned as a true sacrifice of value. However, there are complexities involved in determining the most effective approach for Bitcoin mining and the importance of considering the interests of the wider community.Tamas Blummer has proposed the idea of burn mining side chains to enable permission-less merge mining for anyone interested in a side chain. The proposal suggests using burn transactions to prove linked blocks have the highest cumulative burn compared to alternative sequences, thus enabling a "merged mining" system without requiring Bitcoin miner support or consent. This is not a new idea and was previously outlined by Peter Todd in a system called "zookeyv". Peter Todd contributed to the conversation, mentioning the potential for replace-by-fee-scorched-earth thinking within this context. The conversation also briefly touched on the lack of concrete information from Blockstream regarding the specific uses of merge-mined sidechains.The proposed method for side chains involves a dynamic difficulty to mine with burn that implies a floating exchange rate between Bitcoin and the side coin. To contain fork rate, the parameter m would have to be adjusted dynamically, similar to Bitcoin's difficulty. It needs to increase if fork rate increases and decrease if no valid block is burned with Bitcoin blocks. Rational burn miners who frequently face and lose head-to-head runs with competing forks would increase their bet for the next burn cycle.Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities involved in determining the most effective approach for Bitcoin mining and the importance of considering the interests of the wider community.</summary>
