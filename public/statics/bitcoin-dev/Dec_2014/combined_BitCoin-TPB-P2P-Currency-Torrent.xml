    <summary>The author of the email has been trying to understand bitcoin from both a mathematical and programming point of view. They propose using its data package to store useful messages and creating a peer-to-peer transfer system that uses bitcoin as currency and data provider. The author suggests that by inserting a similar message to that of a torrent into a Bitcoin portion, one could not only tip the person sharing the content but also make an anonymous request for specific content.Micro-transfers would allow users to receive an entry to the content's torrent information. The author invites someone with more practice working with Bitcoin algorithms to develop a front-end system with them and hopes that others share their vision for a fair and open content world. However, it should be noted that the Pirate Bay's content is illegal and discussion of it may not be appropriate for the mailing list.The author also criticizes the use of spam transactions to access content. They have an idea to implement a blockchain as a tracker, not necessarily related to Bitcoin, where magnet links can be stored in the blockchain. This would allow users to tip content sharers and make anonymous requests for specific content. The email ends with a link to download BIRT iHub F-Type, a free enterprise-grade BIRT server.</summary>
