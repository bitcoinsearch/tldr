    <summary>Will Bickford has started familiarizing himself with Bitcoin development and the source code, which he estimates to have around 280,000 lines of code. He plans to post regular status updates on his blog at http://hewo.xedoloh.com/bitcoin-dev/ for others who are also getting started with Bitcoin development. Based on a sampling of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/key.cpp, which took him about 5 minutes to skim through 2600 lines of code, he would need to devote 110 hours to read the entire code base. Bickford is curious if there is a map of the most important areas to study for new developers and automated test writers. He believes that investing that much time into reading the code base would allow him to accomplish a fair amount of testing. Overall, he is committed to learning as much as he can about Bitcoin development and sharing his progress with others.</summary>
