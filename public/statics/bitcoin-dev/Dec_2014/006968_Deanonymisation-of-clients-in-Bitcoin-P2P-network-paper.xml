    <summary>The context discusses the use of Tor for writing to the Bitcoin network and better Bloom filtering for reading it. This approach would solve latency problems and reduce the level of startup time optimization needed. When BIP70 is in use, the PaymentRequest can be downloaded and the Payment message uploaded via an SSLd Tor connection to the merchant. Malicious exits can only DoS the user but cannot do anything else, so multiple exit paths are not necessary. Wallets designed for crypto geeks should expose all the knobs to let people run wild. Distributors of consumer wallets can use this research to distribute wallets with policies that may be less prone to Tor-specific attacks or leave it out altogether if their audience has different expectations for connecting to Bitcoin.</summary>
