    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing ways to address the issue of DNS seeds being blocked by ISPs due to the hosts they pick up, which often run malware or other web servers alongside. Despite the desire to maintain DNS because of its built-in anonymity network, there is a need for a potential solution that will prevent ISP's from blocking these seeds. One possible solution is to support some subdomain which has results XORed with some constant mask to tweak the real IP. It may also be helpful to include a TXT/AAAA/whatever record with a signature of the results provided by the DNS seed operator.In other news, Will Bickford expressed interest in helping with Bitcoin core development in his spare time. He mentioned using C++ and Qt daily, as well as enjoying root causing and fixing issues. He saw Gavin's comment about needing help with testing in a Reddit AMA some time ago and is curious where he can make the most impact. The email ends with an advertisement for the free enterprise-grade BIRT server from Actuate.</summary>
