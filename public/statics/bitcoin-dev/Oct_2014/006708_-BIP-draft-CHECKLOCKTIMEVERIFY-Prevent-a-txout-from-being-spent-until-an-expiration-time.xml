    <summary>In an email sent on October 7, 2014 at 8:50 AM, Gavin Andresen expressed neutrality towards the debate between hard-forks and soft-forks in regards to Bitcoin. He admits that both methods can work, but suggests that a preference for soft-forks should be given, if possible. This is due to the fact that once a hard-fork is planned, discussions often arise about including additional changes, which increases the frequency of hard-forks. Andresen believes that hard-forks should only be used when the change being considered necessitates one, to minimize their occurrence.</summary>
