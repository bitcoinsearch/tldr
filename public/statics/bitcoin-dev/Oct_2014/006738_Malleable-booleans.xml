    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Pieter Wuille raised concerns about the use of booleans in Bitcoin scripts. He noted that scripts using booleans as inputs will be inherently malleable, which could potentially lead to unintended consequences for users. Wuille has experienced this issue before in C++ programming, citing the example of assigning "2" to a native C++ bool, neither of the if statements will hit. To address this, Wuille suggested that BIP62 should be changed to state that interpreted booleans must be of minimal encoded size, in addition to numbers. Thomas Zander also suggested rejecting a script where a bool is not explicitly zero or one.</summary>
