    <summary>In an email exchange on October 1st, 2014, Gavin Andresen noted that if the first transaction is P2SH (pay-to-script-hash), then the miner wouldn't know there is an advantage to holding it until it's too late. The scriptPubKey is an opaque hash until the second transaction is final and relayed/broadcast. This comment was made in response to a question about proof-of-burn schemes and whether using P2SH would defeat their purpose.</summary>
