    <summary>The lack of a multistage workflow feature in GitHub is hindering the workflow for some users. Pull requests do not have a "status," although it would be possible to use labels as a workaround. However, only the repository team can set these labels, which could pose a problem. It might be feasible to build something on top of the GitHub API to handle this issue. Additionally, people failing to comment on issues is another hindrance. Setting a reasonable deadline and implementing a default decision after that time could motivate individuals to get involved in a timely manner.</summary>
