    <summary>The author of the given context expresses dissatisfaction with the list software/service used by lists.sf.net. The mailing list, which is based on digital signatures, is incompatible with Yahoo's "mail signatures must be valid" policy. Moreover, the moderation and mail archiving features of the mailing list are not satisfactory. Trashing all @yahoo accounts because ancient mailman does a MITM attack on people's email is not good. The author suggests that the mailing list should be replaced by a better alternative. The author recommends using mail-archive.com as an alternative to lists.sf.net. According to the author, mail-archive.com can easily be used with any mailing list by adding it as a member. The author also provides a link to the documentation for adding mail-archive.com to a mailing list.</summary>
