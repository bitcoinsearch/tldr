    <summary>A bug related to adding secp256k1 into Web Crypto API, which will be implemented natively in some web browsers, was filed by Melvin Carvalho. The bug is expected to be addressed by the extension bug 25618 if none objects before the 20th of Oct @20:00 UTC. On October 13, 2014, Matt Corallo added a related bug on Curve25519 and some MS Research curves that generated far more discussion. Myron Davis reopened the issue and requested feedback from crypto implementers since it has some great advantages in faster signature verification and how the values were determined for the curve. With discovery of backdoor's in NIST's random number generator, he would like to see a determined parameter curve instead of a "random" curve option.</summary>
