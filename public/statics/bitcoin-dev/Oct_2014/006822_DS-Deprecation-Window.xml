    <summary>In an online discussion on Bitcoin forums, user Tom Harding expressed caution about miners including a double-spend in their block. He hoped that such a scenario would be avoided due to several factors, including a measured time offset from the first spend received and most other nodes having seen his transaction. However, another user named Matt raised concerns that this proposal could have disastrous side effects for miners. Two other users also replied to the thread with additional insights.</summary>
