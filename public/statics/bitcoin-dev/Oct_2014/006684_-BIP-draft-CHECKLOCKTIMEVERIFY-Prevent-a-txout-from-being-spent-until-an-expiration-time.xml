    <summary>In an email exchange on October 3, 2014, Matt Whitlock proposed the idea of having a new opcode replace the top stack item with the block height of the txout being redeemed. This would enable arbitrary logic to be implemented, including time constraints for spending outputs and complex logic with alternative key groups. However, Luke-Jr pointed out that this cannot be done in a softfork. Additionally, he noted that the concept of "output can ONLY be spent until a certain time" contradicts Bitcoin's security assumptions. The assumption is that assuming an honest sender, the transaction will remain valid and simply reconfirm if a reorg kicks it out.</summary>
