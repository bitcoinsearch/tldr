    <summary>In an email exchange between Wladimir and Geir Harald Hansen on October 12, 2014, Pieter Wuille had announced that orphan blocks would no longer be stored in memory, reducing memory usage during sync. When Geir asked if this change would slow down reorgs after a fork, Wladimir responded by explaining that orphan blocks are blocks whose parent is not known and in the case of a reorganization, the client jumps to a new best chain, for which the original tip and the new best tip and all their parents must already be known. Geir then apologized for his confusion earlier regarding shorter sides of forks being orphaned.</summary>
