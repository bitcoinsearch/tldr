    <summary>On October 1, 2014, Sergio Lerner suggested that applications and nodes should only broadcast transactions having OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY a few blocks after the timeout value. If a node broadcasts a TX having OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and nLockTime is equal to the current height and equal to the timeout value, but that peer is one block behind in the blockchain, the transaction will be rejected by the peer and the source will be banned. Another option would be not to ban peers sending transactions failing to verify OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, but Sergio does not like this. Still, another option would be that the sender checks periodically the height of its peers(using the version command) to ensure to send the transaction having OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY only to the peers that are up to date with the blockchain.There are "upper-level" details to consider when it comes to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). The first release should include the NOPx blacklist pull-req and leave NOP2/CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY in that blacklist for another minor release or two.</summary>
