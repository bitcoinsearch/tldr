    <summary>In an email conversation on October 28, 2014, Tom Harding acknowledged that without double-spend relay, a miner would not be able to detect transactions that conflict with others. He also stated that even with it, the miner cannot be sure and may choose to include no transactions at all to be safe. This is because a malicious miner can flood the network with orthogonal double spends, which other miners will spend time on before realizing they are double-spends.</summary>
