    <summary>This is an issue filed for adding secp256k1 into Web Crypto API, which will be implemented natively in some web browsers. Myron Davis has requested to look at it again as secp256k1 is supported in several SSL/TLS libraries including Botan, NSS, openssl, LibreSSL, PolarSSL and JSSE. The other three curves have parameters that do not define how they were generated. On the other hand, the secp256k1 curve has advantages in faster signature verification and how the values were determined for the curve. With the discovery of backdoor's in NIST's random number generator, there is a need for a determined parameter curve instead of a "random" curve option. If there is any feedback from crypto implementers, readers can add comments to the thread provided.</summary>
