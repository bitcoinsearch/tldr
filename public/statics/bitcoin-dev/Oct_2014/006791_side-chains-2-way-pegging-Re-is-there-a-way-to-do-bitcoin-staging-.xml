    <summary>A person named Daniel Murrell has posted a paper on a mailing list and later requested feedback on the site he had privately set up. He also mentioned that he won't be making such advertisements after every paper he posts on this list. Bryan Bishop, another member of the mailing list, responded to this message by suggesting that the frequency of these messages should be toned down. Jeff Garzik, who is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, has also made an appearance in the discussion. The main topic of discussion is the paper and side-chains which are on-topic for the mailing list. The mailing list is publicly archived.</summary>
