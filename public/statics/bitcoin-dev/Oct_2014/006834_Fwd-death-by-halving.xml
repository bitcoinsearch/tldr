    <summary>The discussion surrounding the relevance of halving in Bitcoin is ongoing, with some arguing that the fact that it has not caused significant disturbances in the past does not mean it will not do so in the future. The changing environmental conditions and increasing weight of for-profit companies as opposed to individual miners makes this argument relevant. It is important to discuss the potential impact of halving on the mining market instead of dismissing it outright. While there are benefits to encouraging investment in mining infrastructure through halving, it is also important to consider the security of the system and the economic incentives of miners to play by the rules. The complexity of the Bitcoin system cannot be reduced to just the subsidy schedule.</summary>
