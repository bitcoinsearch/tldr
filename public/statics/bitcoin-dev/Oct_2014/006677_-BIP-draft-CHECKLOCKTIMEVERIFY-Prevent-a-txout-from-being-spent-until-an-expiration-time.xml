    <summary>The conversation is between Peter Todd and Luke Dashjr regarding the proposal to build a script that can only be spent up until block X. Luke asks if it can be used to do the opposite as well. Peter suggests creating a GET-TXIN-BLOCK-(TIME/HEIGHT)-EQUALVERIFY operator, replacing "height" with "time" for timestamps. He also mentions that unlocking should be set to years into the future to exceed any reasonable business cycle. Luke thinks short maturity periods are just as appropriate, but Peter believes it incentivizes mining centralization. Instead of destroying coins, which doesn't sit well with people, he suggests sacrificing them. The email includes a PGP signature and an ad for achieving PCI DSS 3.0 Compliance Requirements with EventLog Analyzer.</summary>
