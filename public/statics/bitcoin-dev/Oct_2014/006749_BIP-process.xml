    <summary>In this email exchange, Gavin Andresen expresses his preference for the author being the primary control in a process and suggests reverting if they do not do the right thing. In response to a suggestion of having a separate mailing list for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) discussions, he agrees it's a great idea and suggests creating a strictly moderated bitcoin-bips at lists.sourceforge list if there isn't a better solution than SourceForge. Jeff Garzik was also mentioned as someone who was looking for a better mailing list solution.</summary>
