    <summary>In an email thread from October 14, 2014, Thomas Zander asked about rejecting a script where a boolean value is not explicitly set to zero or one. It is unclear what context Zander was referring to, but it seems he had concerns about the reliability and consistency of code. Without more information, it is difficult to fully understand his question. However, the idea of enforcing strict boolean values in programming is not uncommon. By requiring developers to explicitly set boolean variables to either true or false, it can help prevent errors and ensure that code behaves as expected. This practice can also make code easier to read and understand, as it eliminates ambiguity regarding what a particular variable is intended to represent.Overall, while the original context of Thomas Zander's question is unknown, the concept of enforcing strict boolean values in programming is a common practice that can improve code reliability and readability.</summary>
