    <summary>Melvin Carvalho suggested creating a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to put forth ideas and proposals. The new REST interface is seen as a good starting point for further discussion. The interface exports information that's already available, but it won't be developed into a full-fledged block explorer. Feedback on the HTTP headers and form is welcome. There are plans to add last-modified and etag headers. Additionally, there are proposals to export UTXOs like Mike Hearn's getutxos query and to rebuild the RPC server to something multithreaded. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist at BitPay Inc. A link to PR #2844 can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2844.</summary>
