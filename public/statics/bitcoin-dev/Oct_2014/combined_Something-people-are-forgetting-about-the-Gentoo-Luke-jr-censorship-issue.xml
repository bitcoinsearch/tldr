    <summary>Bitcoin Core, the open source project that serves as the reference implementation for the Bitcoin network, has faced issues with Linux distributions modifying their software while packaging it. Luke Dashjr, a contributor to Bitcoin Core, has made changes to the software to bring it closer to user expectations, but similar issues are expected to arise in the future with other Linux distributions. Trademarking the project name and enforcing "clean" packaging is a solution that has been successful with projects like Firefox and Chrome. The addition of a blacklist to Bitcoin Core would be a significant change to the platform's decentralized nature, and Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer at BitPay, confirms that there are no plans to add one. Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer, suggested that trademarking the name of a project and enforcing 'clean' packaging could be a solution to issues with Linux distros altering software as they package it. However, Gentoo (and similar source-based distributions) distribute instructions which allow end-users to download, compile, and install software rather than distributing the software itself. In a message posted on October 10th, 2014, he addressed the issue of Bitcoin Core's software being modified by Linux distros as they package it. He pointed out that it had been difficult for these projects to prevent distros from modifying their software and suggested that building good relationships with the packagers of distros could be the best solution. A developer named Luke-Jr wants to add code that can censor certain network traffic, such as SatoshiDice transactions because he thinks they are a denial of service. However, this could cause legal implications. The technical ability to filter certain types of network traffic can cause users to be legally liable to use it to filter illegal content, which can put Bitcoin users in legal danger. Hence, the request is not to include the code and, if possible, not even write or publish it.</summary>
