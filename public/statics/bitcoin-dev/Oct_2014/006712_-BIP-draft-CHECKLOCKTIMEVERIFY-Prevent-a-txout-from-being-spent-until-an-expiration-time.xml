    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Wladimir, the former discusses submitting a pull request to improve the existing userbase of Bitcoin. However, Wladimir suggests that such improvements may not make it into the next major release, but could potentially be included in the upcoming minor release (0.9.4). He goes on to explain that after headers-first and pruning are merged, there will be a feature freeze for the 0.10 branch, which will then be released before the end of the year. The earliest that the next major release (0.11) could be expected would be in six months.</summary>
