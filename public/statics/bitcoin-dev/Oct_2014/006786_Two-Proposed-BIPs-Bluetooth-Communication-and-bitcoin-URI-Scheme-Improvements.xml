    <summary>The discussion is about whether BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) should document how things *should* work or how they actually do work. BIP32 is an example of the former, while BIP44 is an example of the latter. The latter is valuable since it documents how certain wallets work. There is also a need for informational BIPs like BIP43 that reserve BIP numbers to avoid namespace collisions even if their work does not affect any other project. The discussion suggests the need for an efficient process for such informational BIPs. The message includes a PGP signature and a non-text attachment named "0x38450DB5.asc".</summary>
