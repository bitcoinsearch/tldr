    <summary>The Bitcoin testnet is a network that allows developers to experiment with new features and test their applications without risking actual bitcoins. If no block is found for 20 minutes, one minimum-diff block may be mined. On October 30th, 2014, Rusty Russell proposed an algorithm to place a ceiling on confirmation latency by allowing weaker blocks after a certain time. Russell shared the details of his proposal via a blog post. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, signed off the email chain with his signature information.</summary>
