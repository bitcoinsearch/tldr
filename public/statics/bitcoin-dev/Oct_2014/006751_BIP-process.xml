    <summary>In an email thread discussing better mailing list solutions for the bitcoin-bips, Adam expressed his preference for sourceforge or other open list software over Google Groups. He believes that Google's lists have a proprietary and Gmail lock-in focus which makes it difficult to subscribe with a non-Google address if one is associated with a Gmail account. Mike Hearn suggested creating a strictly moderated bitcoin-bips mailing list at lists.sourceforge. However, Jeff Garzik was looking for a better solution than SourceForge. Mike argued against using SF.net or mailman-controlled lists due to their breaking of DKIM signatures. This means they are incompatible with Yahoo and all mail from Yahoo users gets sent to the spam folder immediately. He believes that Google Groups get this right and suggests that other list operators may do so as well. Additionally, he notes that Google Groups has moderation features. Lastly, the email includes a link to Site24x7 which offers comprehensive server monitoring for $9/month.</summary>
