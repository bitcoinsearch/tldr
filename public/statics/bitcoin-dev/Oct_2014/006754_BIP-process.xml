    <summary>In an email conversation, Adam Back expressed his preference for simple open list software over Google Groups due to concerns of proprietary nature and Gmail lock-in. He suggested SourceForge as an alternative but was advised against it. The issue with Google Groups was that it made it difficult to subscribe with a non-Google address if there was any hint of association with a Gmail account. Mailman was suggested as a satisfactory option.</summary>
