    <summary>Flavien Charlon inquired about the status of watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core and whether there is documentation on how to add them through RPC. It is unclear if this feature has been merged into master and made usable. Additionally, Flavien asked about the ETA for a release candidate as it moves towards version 0.10. Finally, he wondered if nightly builds were available to try out the new features.</summary>
