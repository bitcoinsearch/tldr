    <summary>The email thread starts with Flavien Charlon asking about the status of watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core and if it is usable. Wladimir confirms that it has been merged and can be accessed through the "importaddress" RPC call. He also mentions that the aim for the 0.10 release is a few months away, probably by the end of the year. Wladimir cautions against using master without at least some development/debugging experience to trace down problems when they appear, so it's best to build it yourself if you're going to test day-to-day development versions. Felipe Micaroni Lalli signs off the email with his PGP ID and information.The email also includes an advertisement for comprehensive server monitoring with Site24x7, which offers monitoring for up to 10 servers for $9/month, with alerts through email, SMS, voice calls, or mobile push notifications.</summary>
