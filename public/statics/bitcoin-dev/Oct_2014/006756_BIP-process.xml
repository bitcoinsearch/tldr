    <summary>In an email thread dated October 15, 2014, Btc Drak commented that Google lists are proprietary or Gmail-focused, making it difficult to subscribe using a non-Google address. Another user suggested using Mailman, a mailing list management software. A third user recommended mailmanlist.net, which hosts small Mailman lists for $5 per month with no issues. The email signatures of the users were also included in the thread.</summary>
