    <summary>In a conversation between Matt and Tom Harding, it was discussed that without double-spend relay, miners will not know about conflicting transactions. Tom plans to add that first-double-spends are relayed according to #4570. However, if a miner includes a double-spend in their block, they have to be very careful. They hope that only a small fraction of the network will delay their block based on the time offset from the first spend they received. Also, they hope that not too many nodes saw an earlier spend that they did not see, which could increase the fraction. Additionally, most other nodes should see their transaction. If they did not, they would learn about it by receiving the block, and this would likely delay the block. The best course of action for a miner is to exclude fast transactions. Miners are incentivized to connect to everyone on the network and look for double-spends. The conversation can be found at https://github.com/dgenr8/out-there/blob/master/ds-dep-win.md.</summary>
