    <summary>In an email exchange on October 7th, 2014, Gregory Maxwell discussed the potential issue of anonymous double-spends in Bitcoin. He proposed a method where the output of a fraudulent spend would be locked one block higher, and then that output would be spent again in the same manner, with each step paying fees. While this idea could potentially prevent double-spends, Maxwell noted that it was not automatic and relied on miners choosing to take the kickback payments.Maxwell also mentioned that if someone were to modify bitcoind to make this choice automatic, then DECOR+ would be the only solution he knew of to avoid anonymous double-spends with chained kickbacks. In response to another proposal to use locktime on normal transactions, Maxwell argued that this would not solve the problem, but only diminish it by a constant value, which was currently low.</summary>
