    <summary>Adam Back suggested an alternative to the current reward reduction system in Bitcoin mining. Instead of halving the reward every four years, he proposed a reduction of 1/100th per two-week period. However, some argue that the current system is convenient for miners who base equipment purchases on the four-year cycle. Additionally, dividing by two is seen as the cleanest way to reach zero after a specific number of divisions.</summary>
