    <summary>In an email dated 09/23/2014 at 11:12 PM, Mem Wallet asked about the use of deterministic nonces for ECIES and the potential consequences of doing so. The email requested a description of what might go wrong if such nonces were used. In response, the recipient of the email suggested that using deterministic nonces for signatures is acceptable, but they should not be used for ECIES unless they are high quality random bytes. It was noted that unit test vectors could be an exception to this rule.</summary>
