    <summary>In the world of cryptocurrencies, BIP changes are important and require community consensus. As specified in BIP1, discussions about these changes should be held on the mailing list to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Therefore, it is not appropriate to discuss BIP changes on GitHub PRs. This was stated by Wladimir, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, in response to a question about where to hold BIP discussions. By following these protocols, the community can work together to make informed decisions about the direction of their projects.</summary>
