    <summary>In an email conversation, Adam Back and Peter Todd express their preference for mailing list software other than Google Groups. According to Adam Back, Google lists are a little proprietary or Gmail lock-in focused which makes things extra hard to subscribe with a non-google address if google has any hint that your address is associated with a gmail account. Peter Todd agreed and suggested something mailman-based instead. They both believe that one of the big advantages of open mailing lists is that multiple third-parties can easily provide archives, for instance www.mail-archive.com.</summary>
