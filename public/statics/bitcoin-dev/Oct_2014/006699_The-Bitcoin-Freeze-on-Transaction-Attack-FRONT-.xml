    <summary>The problem of creating an arbitrary fee can arise due to a bug or accident in defective wallet software, and not necessarily as an attack. This is because the value spent is not part of the signature, which makes it easy to manipulate. Miners could be incentivized to collect these huge fees, which might provide a higher incentive than the block subsidy on the trunk. Assuming miners are rational, they might even form temporary coalitions to claim the fee by offering other miners a share of the fee gained if they help extend their fork. This could trigger a long 'battle' of ad-hoc coalitions.Addressing the known bug of the signature hash would have positive effects for resource-limited hardware wallets. Alan Reiner had suggested interpreting an OP_NOP for a value hashing signature check earlier on Bitcointalk.</summary>
