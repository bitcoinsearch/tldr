    <summary>A Bitcoin developer named Warren has created a branch of Bitcoin 0.9.3 including watch-only and several patches to clean it up from the master branch. It seems to work fine although it is not heavily tested. The importaddress RPC call works the same as importprivkey except that you pass it an address. Watch-only addresses have been merged into Bitcoin Core, but it's not recommended to use the master version without at least a little bit of development/debugging experience of yourself. A release candidate for version 0.10 is expected in a few months, probably by the end of the year. There are no nightly builds available at this time. Warren Togami was building them for a while, but he stopped some time around June.</summary>
