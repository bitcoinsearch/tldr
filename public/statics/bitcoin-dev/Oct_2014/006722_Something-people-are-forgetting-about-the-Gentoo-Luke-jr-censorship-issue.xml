    <summary>In a message posted on October 10th, 2014, Mike Hearn addressed the issue of Bitcoin Core's software being modified by Linux distros as they package it. He noted that this was not a unique problem and that other projects had faced similar issues. However, he pointed out that it had been difficult for these projects to prevent distros from modifying their software. One example he gave was Firefox, which succeeded in making Debian stop distributing it. Hearn suggested that building good relationships with the packagers of distros could be the best solution. He also mentioned that Linux distros distributing apps licensed under GPL are required by law to offer the sources of the thing they build and distribute as binary. This allows users to check the difference with upstream. Most distros have a process in place for this, even for not FLOSS software like bitcoin core.</summary>
