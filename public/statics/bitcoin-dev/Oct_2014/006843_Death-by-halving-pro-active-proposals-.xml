    <summary>The author proposes proactive measures to mitigate the impact of subsidy halving on mining. They suggest merged-mining as a way to increase miners' profits and compensate for reduced rewards. The author suggests encouraging merge-mining on SHA-256 instead of discouraging alt-coins. Another proposal is to create a donation pool where miners donate 1% of their revenue to pay back miners during the first month after the reward halving. This would increase block earnings by 20% during that period. The author acknowledges that convincing miners may be difficult but suggests that it could be done automatically with nLockTime freeze of transactions with high fees, eliminating the need for a trusted third party. The author concludes by inviting other proposals.</summary>
