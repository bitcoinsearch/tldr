    <summary>In an email exchange on October 28, 2014, Thomas Zander called out another individual for not having read through the archives where certain ideas had been discussed and a consensus reached. The individual responded by stating that they hadn't started the thread and therefore didn't research the archives until now. They also requested a link to the discussion rather than being dismissed harshly.</summary>
