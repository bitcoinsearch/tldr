    <summary>The context provided is regarding Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that have been implemented and are fixed in place. Any changes to these BIPs would require a new BIP amendment. The following BIPs are included in this category: BIP 14 (BIP Protocol Version and User Agent), BIP 21 (URI Scheme), BIP 22 (getblocktemplate - Fundamentals), BIP 31 (Pong Message), BIP 34 (Block v2, Height in coinbase), BIP 35 (mempool message), and BIP 37 (Bloom filtering).According to the author, these BIPs should be considered for the final state as they have been implemented widely. Therefore, any modifications to these BIPs will require a new BIP amendment. The list includes various BIPs such as BIP 14 that deals with BIP protocol version and user agent, BIP 21 that focuses on URI scheme, BIP 22 which emphasizes getblocktemplate fundamentals, BIP 31 for Pong message, BIP 34 for block v2 height in coinbase, BIP 35 that deals with mempool message, and finally BIP 37 for bloom filtering.Overall, the author has requested feedback on whether or not the proposed BIPs should be considered for a final state. It is crucial to note that these BIPs have already been implemented all over the place and are entirely fixed in place now, and thus any changes would require a new BIP as an amendment.</summary>
