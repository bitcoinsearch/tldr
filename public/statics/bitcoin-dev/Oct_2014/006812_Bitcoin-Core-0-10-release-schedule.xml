    <summary>The context consists of a follow-up question on Github, related to current dust change handling. The question asks about the flag that would keep wallets aware of precious transactions and whether it was incorporated into 0.10 or not. Another suggested feature related to dusting is also mentioned in the context. A query related to floating fees for Core 0.10 is also included. Wladimir responds by confirming that floating/smart fees have been merged a while ago via two links provided in the context. The signature at the end of the message contains PGP encryption.</summary>
