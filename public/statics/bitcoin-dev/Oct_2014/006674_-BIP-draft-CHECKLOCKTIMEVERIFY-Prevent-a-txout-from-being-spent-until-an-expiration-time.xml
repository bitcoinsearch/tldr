    <summary>On October 1, 2014, Luke Dashjr and Peter Todd discussed a new way to increment the stack item by the height at which the scriptPubKey was in a block. Peter suggested creating a GET-TXIN-BLOCK-(TIME/HEIGHT)-EQUALVERIFY operator, with the scriptPubKey being GET-TXIN-BLOCKHEIGHT-EQUALVERIFY. He also said that it would be better to have sacrifices unlock years into the future to exceed any reasonable business cycle. However, Luke believed that short maturity periods were also appropriate for many use cases. Nevertheless, he thought that incentivizing mining centralization with short maturities was very easy to do. He personally preferred destroying coins, but it did not sit well with others, so this was the next best thing.</summary>
