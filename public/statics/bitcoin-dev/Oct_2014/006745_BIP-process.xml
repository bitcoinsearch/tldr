    <summary>The author of an email proposes a change in the process regarding the https://github.com/bitcoin/bips repository. Currently, there are many open pulls for various BIPs, and it is not clear who should comment on them or decide which changes to merge. The author suggests making the author or someone they delegate to be the primary contact for each BIP. They should comment on changes, accept or reject them, and if accepted, the change will be merged. This means that there is a responsibility for the author to adhere to BIP 1. Additionally, the author thinks that it makes sense to move the BIP discussion to a separate mailing list. Discussions about Bitcoin Core implementation concerns and global changes to Bitcoin should be separated as the current situation is too busy for some people. However, it is critical that everyone writing a Bitcoin node or client is up-to-date with proposals and can comment on them.</summary>
