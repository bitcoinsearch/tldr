    <summary>Bitcoinj, one of the world's most popular Bitcoin libraries, has announced version 0.12 which includes hierarchical and deterministic (HD) wallets that use BIP32 specification, support for mnemonic codes (BIP 39), Tor integration using the Orchid library, support for multisig wallets, faster and deterministic ECDSA, many API improvements, and upgrades to the included GUI wallet. The new HD wallets are a major privacy enhancement, as change and receive addresses are no longer being reused. This release took 8 months of work and is used by several Android and desktop wallets, academic research projects, blockchain.info, Circle, Lighthouse, CryptoCorp, biteasy, BlueMatt's relay network, bitpos, and countless alt coin wallets.</summary>
