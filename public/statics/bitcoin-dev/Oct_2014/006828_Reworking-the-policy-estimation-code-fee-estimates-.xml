    <summary>In an email conversation between Alex Morcos and Gavin Andresen, they discuss the idea of using a default fee estimation threshold for Bitcoin transactions. Morcos suggests making the 90% number an argument to an rpc call, allowing users to specify if they require a different certainty. Andresen thinks that a default percentage of 80% would be more suitable to avoid complaints about slow transaction confirmations. However, he is reluctant to add too many 'knobs' for the RPC interface and believes that setting both the number of confirmations and the estimation threshold on a transaction-by-transaction basis is unnecessary. Instead, he suggests that the default percentage could be set as a command-line or bitcoin.conf option.</summary>
