    <summary>In October 2014, Alex Mizrahi expressed concern about the potential catastrophic loss of hashpower and security after a reward halving if miner's income margins are less than 50 percent. Assuming that half of the mining equipment gets shut off, the security against any takeover is quite secure. However, the document makes a series of assumptions that individually may be implausible but together are just fiction. The research presented did not convince the reader of the potential negative outcomes, and it disregards the equilibriums reached by doing so.</summary>
