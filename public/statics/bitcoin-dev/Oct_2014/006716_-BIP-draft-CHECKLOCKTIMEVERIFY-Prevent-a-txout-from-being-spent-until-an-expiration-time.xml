    <summary>In a discussion about using scriptPubKey to control locktime in Bitcoin transactions, Gregory Maxwell and Adam Back talk about the limitations of using nlocktime at the script level. They note that there is a complexity cost associated with this approach, which often requires extra dependent transactions and workarounds for malleability issues. Even with malleability fixes, some features cannot be used, and accidental vectors for malleability may still exist. Using locktime control in a scriptPubKey avoids these limitations and simplifies protocols. The group discusses examples of complex transaction use-cases affected by malleability that cannot be fixed by CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.</summary>
