    <summary>Jeremie Dubois-Lacoste, Director of Belgian Bitcoin Association and Post-Doctoral Researcher at Université Libre de Bruxelles, is seeking information on the availability of a patch he intends to implement. Jeremie wants to add an optional parameter to "-rescan" that would allow the rescan to start from an explicitly given point in time. When performing the wallet rescan, everything before the block number would be ignored. The proposed feature would function similarly to the wallet birthday mechanism, with the difference being that the user would give the starting point at launch time on the command line. Another option could be to provide a timestamp instead of a block height. Regardless of the choice, the information would always be provided explicitly by the user. Jeremie seeks feedback on whether this feature is already available so he can avoid duplicating efforts.</summary>
