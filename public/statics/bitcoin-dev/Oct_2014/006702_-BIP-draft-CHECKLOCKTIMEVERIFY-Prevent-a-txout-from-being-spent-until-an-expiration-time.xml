    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen on Oct 4, 2014, Mike stated that new version numbers only result in a log print while being hard forked off results in both log prints and the -alertnotify being run. He also mentioned that it is better to receive an -alertnotify sooner rather than later for either a hard fork or a soft-fork. Gavin did not express any opinion on the hard- versus soft- fork debate, stating that he thinks either can work.</summary>
