    <summary>The conversation between Gavin Andresen and Alex Morcos revolves around the fee estimation logic in Bitcoin, specifically the threshold percentage for confirmation. Gavin asserts that a default of 80% would be sufficient to avoid complaints about slow confirmations, while Alex suggests making the threshold percentage tunable as an argument to an RPC call. However, Gavin is hesitant to add too many options to the RPC interface and suggests that a command-line/bitcoin.conf option for the default percentage would suffice. The discussion also includes data from real-world tests indicating that even the highest fee rate transactions only get confirmed at about a 90% rate in one block, leading to noise in the data and making it difficult to guarantee a greater than 90% chance of confirmation. Overall, the discussion centers on finding the best approach to fee estimation in Bitcoin.</summary>
