    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer, suggested implementing parallel block downloading to improve the syncing speed of Bitcoin's network. The benchmarking results show that syncing to 295,000 using this method takes only one hour and five minutes, which is significantly faster than the old code that took seven hours and wasn't even at 250,000. The target was chosen because after that point, ecdsa dominates, and the libsecp256k1 is six times faster, making more of a difference.</summary>
