    <summary>On October 1st, 2014, Luke Dashjr asked Gavin Andresen for his thoughts on a way to increment the stack item by the height at which the scriptPubKey was in a block. The limitation of encoding the target height/time directly is that miners may choose not to mine the first transaction until they can take the "burn to fee." If the first transaction is P2SH, then the miner won't know there is an advantage to holding it until it's too late as the scriptPubKey is an opaque hash until the second transaction is final and relayed/broadcast.</summary>
