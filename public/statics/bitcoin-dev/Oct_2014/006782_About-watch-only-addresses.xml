    <summary>The discussion revolves around the usability of watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core. Flavien Charlon enquires about the status and usability of watch-only addresses and also asks for documentation on how to add a watch-only address through RPC. Wladimir confirms that it has been merged and provides information on the "importaddress" RPC call, which works similarly to "importprivkey", except that an address is passed instead. He also mentions that there are no nightly builds at this moment, and it's not recommended to use master without some experience in development/debugging. Warren Togami Jr. shares his own branch of Bitcoin 0.9.3 plus backports including watch-only and a huge pile of patches cleaning it up from the master branch. Sipa's address index branch may be more suitable for an use case where information about any address is required, and jmcorgan continued to maintain an up-to-date version. DexX7 has his own branch for balance queries with a few other RPC calls, and he recommends reviewing the changes first before considering using it.</summary>
