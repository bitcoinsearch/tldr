    <summary>On October 26th, 2014, Wladimir proposed a plan for the release of Bitcoin 0.10. He suggested splitting off a 0.10 branch on November 18th and releasing 10.0rc1 on December 1st to start the Release Candidate cycle. The RC cycle would run until no critical problems are found, with the final release expected no later than January 2015. Major work that needed to be merged before November 18th included BIP62, Verification library, Gitian descriptors overhaul, Autoprune, adding "warmup mode" for RPC server, and adding unauthenticated HTTP REST interface. One person responded to the proposal, expressing their support and noting that they were working on their own REST API for electronic coins. They asked if there was a BIP or some other document outlining the REST output and if v1 of the interface was set in stone. They also inquired about developing the interface into something that would be W3C standards compliant and allow for standardization of block explorer and bitcoind outputs. Wladimir noted that he had originally intended for the 0.10 release to happen much sooner but insisted on including headers-first, which took longer than expected. He also mentioned a preference to switch to a fixed 6-month major release schedule starting in July 2015 with 0.11.0.</summary>
