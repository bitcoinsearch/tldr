    <summary>Adam Back discussed the existing script level nlocktime and its ability to perform almost everything in a turing completeness sense. However, he added that using it could result in a complexity cost because of extra dependent transactions. He also mentioned that malleability fixes work only if certain features are not used, and there is no complete guarantee that all accidental vectors for malleability have been eliminated. Using locktime control in scriptPubKey can avoid these limitations and simplify protocols, eliminating the need for a three-step state machine and risky validation code to ensure that a refund received is actually workable.</summary>
