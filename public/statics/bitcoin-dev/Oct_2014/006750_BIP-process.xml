    <summary>Jeff Garzik was looking for a better mailing list solution than SourceForge, and it was suggested that a strictly moderated bitcoin-bips at lists.sourceforge list be created. The suggestion was made to stay away from SF.net or any mailman-controlled lists if possible as they break DKIM signatures which causes issues with Yahoo. All mail from Yahoo users gets spamfoldered immediately if sent through these lists. It was noted that Google Groups gets this right and has moderation features, and other list operators may also have similar features.</summary>
