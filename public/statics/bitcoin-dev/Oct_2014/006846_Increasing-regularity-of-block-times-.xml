    <summary>In a forum post, Rusty Russell shared his thoughts on an algorithm to place a ceiling on confirmation latency by allowing weaker blocks after a certain time. He wondered if anyone had considered this before or if there were any flaws in the scheme. For more details on how this algorithm would work, Russell provided a link to his website where he outlines the "gory details" of the process.</summary>
