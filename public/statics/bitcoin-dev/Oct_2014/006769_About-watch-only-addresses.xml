    <summary>In an email exchange on October 17, 2014, Flavien Charlon inquired about the status of watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core and whether it was merged into master. Wladimir replied that it had been merged and that there is a “importaddress” RPC call which works similarly to “importprivkey”. He also confirmed that the aim for release candidate is within a few months, probably by the end of the year. At the time, there were no nightly builds available, but Warren Togami had been building them until around June. Wladimir cautioned against using master without development/debugging experience and advised building it yourself if you want to test day-to-day development versions.</summary>
