    <summary>Daniel Murrell has created an open forum for cryptocurrency-related research called "Open Cryptocurrency Review". He is unsure if it's welcome in the community, but he would like to know if it's worthwhile. The forum allows for discussion about research and provides a central repository for it. It has not received much attention yet, as Daniel has not advertised it much. He encourages others to check it out and see if there are any potential use cases for it. If it gets core developers talking about it and finds it useful, then others will likely be inspired to use it. Even just one discussion thread could help in this regard. Daniel emphasizes that the forum is not for profit and is merely an experiment. He hopes that by creating this platform, he can contribute to the cryptocurrency community.</summary>
