    <summary>In an email thread dated October 15, 2014, Wladimir proposed moving the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) discussion to a separate mailing list. Currently, the bitcoin-development mailing list serves two purposes: discussing Bitcoin Core implementation concerns and global changes to Bitcoin in the form of BIPs. However, some people find the list too busy, while others believe it is critical for everyone writing a Bitcoin node or client to be up-to-date with all proposals and able to comment on them. The author of the email joined the bitcoin-development mailing list when Bitcoin was already in the 10-billion market capitalization range and expressed surprise at how low the traffic on the list was given the importance of Bitcoin. They went on to state that they would vote against splitting the list as they believed there should be more discussion on the current list rather than less. The author signed off with greetings before adding a digitally signed message part to the email thread.</summary>
