    <summary>In an email conversation on October 7, 2014, Sergio Lerner proposed that the solution to the freeze problem in cryptocurrency transactions, called "FRONT," is automatic fee-sharing or "ORBS." However, he also noted that this solution creates the risk of double-spending through a process called "CHAKIDO," which is much worse than the freeze problem. The recipient of the email expressed confusion about the terminology used and suggested that it is already possible for miners to engage in double-spending through fraudulent transactions and paying large fees. By continually spending the output of the fraudulent spend, these miners could see higher expected returns by assisting in theft. However, the ability for miners to roll forward fees does not make this situation any worse since transactions can also roll forward fees.</summary>
