    <summary>In an email exchange on October 28, 2014, Gregory Maxwell corrected a previous statement made about the cost per block for Bitcoin mining. He stated that currently, the cost per block is not around $100 USD but rather closer to $2500 USD per block. This correction was important as it helped to clarify the true cost of mining Bitcoin and avoid any misunderstandings. Maxwell's post also prompted another user to thank him for his time spent on the issue and for providing valuable insights into why the halving process in Bitcoin was not a major concern.</summary>
