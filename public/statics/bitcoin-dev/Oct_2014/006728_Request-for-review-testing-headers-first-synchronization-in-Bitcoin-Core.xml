    <summary>In an email conversation on October 12, 2014, Pieter Wuille announced that there will be no orphan blocks stored in memory anymore. This will reduce memory usage during sync, but the question was raised whether this change would slow down reorgs after a fork. However, Luke-Jr clarified that this change should not affect reorgs since Wuille was referring to actual orphan blocks without a known previous or parent block, not stale blocks.</summary>
