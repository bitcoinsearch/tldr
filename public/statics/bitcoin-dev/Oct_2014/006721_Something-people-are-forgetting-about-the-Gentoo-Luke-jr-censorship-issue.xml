    <summary>Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer, suggested that trademarking the name of a project and enforcing 'clean' packaging could be a solution to issues with Linux distros altering software as they package it. This approach is used by Firefox and Chrome to ensure people know what they are getting. However, Gentoo (and similar source-based distributions) distribute instructions which allow end-users to download, compile, and install software rather than distributing the software itself, so the trademarking approach is only effective with regards to binary distributions, not source-based distributions.</summary>
