    <summary>In an email conversation, Melvin Carvalho expressed his apologies for coming in late and asked some questions regarding a REST API for electronic coins. He asked if there was a BIP or some other documentation outlining the REST output. In response, Wladimir pointed to the opening post by Jeff Garzik, which contained some documentation on using the API. However, there was no write-up about the current functionality in the release notes. Melvin's second question was about how set in stone version one of the API is going forward. Wladimir responded that it wasn't too late to change the URI, but it hadn't been merged yet. Finally, Melvin asked if there would be any support to develop the interface into something that would be W3C standards compliant, or reviewed by the REST community. Wladimir responded that although a W3C standard takes a long time to pan out, it may be more useful to have the API available rather than wait for standardization. They are only interested in exposing read-only public data already available in Bitcoin Core's internals.</summary>
