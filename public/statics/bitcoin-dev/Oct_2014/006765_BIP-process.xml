    <summary>In a mailing list discussion from October 15, 2014, Mike Hearn raised concerns about the compatibility of the mailing list with Yahoo's "mail signatures must be valid" policy. He noted that this was particularly problematic for a project based on digital signatures. In response, Oliver suggested removing settings related to DKIM signatures and not altering the mail body through advertising or other means. This would avoid causing problems for recipients.</summary>
