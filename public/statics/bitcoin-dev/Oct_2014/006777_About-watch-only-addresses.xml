    <summary>Bitcoin Core now has a feature that allows it to read the balance of any public address via RPC call or after importing the balance, which was previously only available through the QT interface. However, a watching wallet still needs to be synchronized with the chain in the same way as any other wallet. This means that if an existing address is added, it must be rescanned.</summary>
