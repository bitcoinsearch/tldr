    <summary>The discussion is about the halving event that occurred in 2012 and whether it would be a non-event again. Alex Mizrahi believes that next time it will be different because the market will become more mature with time and a mature market will result in lower margins. The halving can do much more damage when margins are relatively small. In addition, there is a difference in ecosystem maturity. In 2012, miners were not so focused on profits, but now they are mostly profit-motivated. Back then, we didn't have multipools, which automatically switched between mining different alt-chains to maximize miners' profits. If the halving results in a significant hashrate drop, it might be possible to buy enough hashpower to attack Bitcoin. Miner sophistication has increased drastically in 2 years, and sites like coinwarz.com can heavily influence mining. Litecoin is set to half reward in 9 months, and it will be interesting to observe what happens there.</summary>
