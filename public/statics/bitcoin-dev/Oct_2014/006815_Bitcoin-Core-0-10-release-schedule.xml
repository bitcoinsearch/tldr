    <summary>In an email conversation between Wladimir and Melvin Carvalho, Melvin asked for documentation on the REST API for electronic coins, which he is also working on. Wladimir referred him to the opening post from Jeff Garzik which contained some documentation on how to use the API. However, there is currently no write-up about the current functionality in the release notes. Melvin offered to help with documentation. Melvin also asked about the stability of the v1 going forward and whether or not there would be support to develop this interface into something that would be W3C standards compliant. Wladimir responded saying that it's not too late to make changes to v1 as it hasn't been merged yet. He also mentioned that a W3C standard takes a long time to come through but it may be more useful to have the API available rather than wait for the API to be standardized. Wladimir noted that they are only interested in exposing read-only, public data that is already available in Bitcoin Core's internals. They are not aiming to add a fully-fledged block explorer with address indexes. Although that could be part of the standard if it allows implementations to support just a subset. Finally, Wladimir suggested that Melvin coordinate his efforts with Jeff Garzik and consider putting down some thoughts and proposals in a BIP.</summary>
