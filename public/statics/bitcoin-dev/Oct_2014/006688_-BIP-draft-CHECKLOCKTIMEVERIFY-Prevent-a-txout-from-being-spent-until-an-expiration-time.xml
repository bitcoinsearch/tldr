    <summary>Jeff Garzik discusses software upgrades in the context of Bitcoin development. He mentions that those few still running on the old 0.3.x codebase can choose to skip upgrades, but for others, upgrades are not optional. However, there is some headroom built-in for less disruptive upgrades that do not require 100%. In response to a discussion about detecting upgrades, Garzik suggests that detecting an upgrade is easier with a soft-fork. Bitcoin Core and bitcoinj both implement this. Garzik recommends that someone should write this up for the bitcoin.org developer docs, as there have been extensive discussions on #bitcoin-dev and other forums regarding these issues.</summary>
