    <summary>In an email conversation between Jérémie Dubois-Lacoste and Ferdinando M. Ametrano, the former argues that just because a topic has been discussed repeatedly over a long period of time doesn't mean it's irrelevant. However, he also believes that discussions can become pointless when no new information is presented. The discussion in question concerns whether or not Bitcoin mining is a serious concern after the first halving passed without incident.Ferdinando M. Ametrano responds by stating that every post made on this topic consumes the time of many people and encourages Jérémie to refine his posts so they are more productive. He also disagrees with Jérémie's assertion that Bitcoin mining is not a serious concern and provides calculations to support his argument. At current difficulty, with a SP30, each block has an expected cost of around $3000, discounting all one-time hardware costs.</summary>
