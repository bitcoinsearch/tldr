    <summary>There are several proposals to mitigate the impact of subsidy halving on mining. One way is through merged-mining, which increases miners' profits and compensates for reduced rewards. The author suggests encouraging merge-mining on SHA-256 instead of discouraging alt-coins. Another proposal is to create a donation pool where miners donate 1% of their revenue to pay back miners during the first month after the reward halving. This would increase block earnings by 20% during that period. However, convincing miners may be difficult, but it could be done automatically with nLockTime freeze of transactions with high fees, eliminating the need for a trusted third party.A post by an anonymous user on a Bitcoin forum suggests that a key future use of the chain will be securing other chains through merged-mining. The user discusses a future where there are 10,000 chains secured by one block. In October 2014, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik and Sergio Lerner proposed solutions to mitigate any damage that could occur when the subsidy was halved. They suggested encouraging SHA-256 merge-mining instead of discouraging SHA-256 alt-coins and creating a donation pool. Overall, there are multiple suggestions for addressing the impact of subsidy halving on mining, including merged-mining, donation pools, and encouraging SHA-256 merge-mining.</summary>
