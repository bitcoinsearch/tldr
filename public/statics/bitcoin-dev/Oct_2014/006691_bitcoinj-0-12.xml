    <summary>The author of BitcoinJ has explained that stealth addresses and SPV do not mix well, so there are no plans to support them. Instead, a description of how to do something similar with the payment protocol has been written. The author will be focusing on fully launching Lighthouse and crowdfunding for decentralisation/crypto related projects rather than working on major feature work on bitcoinj. If the author were to tackle a big project, it would be refactoring the wallet so it doesn't store transactions directly anymore, just unspent outputs. This is because the top user reported problem with the current design is people hitting scalability limits.</summary>
