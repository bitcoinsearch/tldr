    <summary>A suggestion was made to use Discourse for the BIP page in order to make it look smoother and draw more input. Unsystem Forum is run on Discourse and has Twitter, Github, and email integration. The writer of the post requested other people's thoughts on the matter and provided a link to the Unsystem Forum for reference. In response, xor suggested that the BIP discussion should be moved to a separate mailing list to avoid making the bitcoin-development list too busy. He believes that there should be more discussion on the list and splitting it up won't help with that. The post also includes an advertisement for Site24x7, a server monitoring service, and a brief description of abis.io, a protocol concept which aims to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy.</summary>
