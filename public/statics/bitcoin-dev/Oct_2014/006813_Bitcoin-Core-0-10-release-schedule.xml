    <summary>On October 26, 2014, Luke Dashjr reached out to Wladimir, asking for his opinion on what is ready and not too risky to be included in version 0.10. Luke mentioned that they needed a bug fix for submitblock, CreateNewBlock, and miner_tests. He also suggested introducing CNodePolicy for putting isolated node policy code. Harmless changes including support for returning specific rejection reasons, support for BIP 23 block proposal, elaborating on signverify message dialog warning, and further commits to merge after the introduction of CNodePolicy were also proposed. The miners requested enabling customization of node policy for data carrier data size with a low-risk configuration change. Wladimir approved all the changes except for the full-blown "miner policy class," which he thought was best to wait for version 0.11.</summary>
