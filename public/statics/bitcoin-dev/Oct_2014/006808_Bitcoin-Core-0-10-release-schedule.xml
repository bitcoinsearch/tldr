    <summary>On October 26, 2014, Wladimir asked for anything that is ready and not too risky to be included in version 0.10 of the software. Wladimir suggests that at the very least, there should be bug fixes like #5106, #5103, and #5078. Harmless additions like #3727, #1816, #5144, and #5071 are also acceptable. Additionally, there is a debatable proposal (#5077) that could be added, but it is up for discussion. Miners seem to want this feature, even though it is debatable. Further commits exist that should ideally get in after the suggested code is merged.</summary>
