    <summary>Flavien inquires about the status of watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core. He is interested to know if it has been merged in master and is currently usable, as well as if there is documentation available on how to add a watch-only address through RPC.In addition, Flavien also asks about the estimated time of arrival for a release candidate as he believes that Bitcoin Core is heading towards the 0.10 release.</summary>
