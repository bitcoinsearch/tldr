    <summary>In the world of cryptocurrency, "Flag day" herd behavior is unlikely for well-informed and prepared market participants. In fact, it is considered rational to turn off mining devices until difficulty adjusts. It is not advisable to continue mining for more than two weeks when it becomes a loss-making activity. Doing so would be regarded as altruistic behavior, which cannot be relied on.</summary>
