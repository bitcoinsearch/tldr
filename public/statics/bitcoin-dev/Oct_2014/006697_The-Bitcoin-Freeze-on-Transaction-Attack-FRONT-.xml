    <summary>An idea from TierNolan suggests that a miner who owns 1/N of the total hashrate must choose between two strategies if the last known block claimed a large tx fee of L. The first strategy is mining on top of that block and winning the usual reward R with probability 1/N. The second strategy is mining on top of the previous block, trying to make two blocks in a row, which might get a reward of L with probability 1/N^2. For the first strategy, the expected payoff is R/N, while for the second strategy, the expected payoff is L/N^2. The second strategy is viable if R/N &lt; L/N^2.</summary>
