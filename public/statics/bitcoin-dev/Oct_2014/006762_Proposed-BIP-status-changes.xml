    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list in October 2014, there was a debate as to whether changes to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be discussed on the mailing list or through GitHub pull requests. Wladimir argued that BIP changes should be discussed on the mailing list in order to get community consensus, as specified in BIP1. The conversation highlights the importance of community involvement and open discussion in the development of cryptocurrency protocols. It also demonstrates the value of established guidelines, such as BIP1, in ensuring transparency and collaboration within the community.</summary>
