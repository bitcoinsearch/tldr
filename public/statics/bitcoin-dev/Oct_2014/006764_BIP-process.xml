    <summary>In an email conversation dated October 15, 2014, Mike Hearn criticized the moderation and mail archiving features of a certain platform. He added that it has no redeeming qualities at all. However, Thomas Zander argued that the platform being open source, an open platform with no lock-in 'features', and working with everyone using standards properly are its advantages. He also noted that if an old version fails to function with Yahoo, he is in favor of finding a different provider because that's what open platforms like Mailman are for.</summary>
