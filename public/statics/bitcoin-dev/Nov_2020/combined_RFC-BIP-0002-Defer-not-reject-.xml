    <summary>アルム　カールヨハン has proposed a change to BIP-0002 regarding the 3-year-rule, which currently only permits a BIP to be changed to "Rejected" status. The suggested alteration is to change the status of a BIP to "Deferred" instead of "Rejected". The proposal aims to disambiguate the second rule into "deferred" status or add a new status called "Inactive." The current rules for rejecting a BIP have ambiguous meanings, with soft and hard rejections. Furthermore, an alternative proposal has been put forth that suggests updating the rejection criteria in BIP 2 to require an actual concern rather than just a lack of progress in three years.The BIP editor can reject a BIP for various reasons such as duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility, or not in keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy. A BIP may be changed from Draft or Proposed status to Rejected status upon request by any person if they have not made progress in three years. However, such a BIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph.Readers are requested to consider both proposals and provide feedback. The proposal can be found on https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1016.</summary>
