    <summary>Ruben Somsen, a Bitcoin developer, responded to AdamISZ's inquiry regarding creating a censorship-resistant data layer without using the blockchain. Ruben suggests that it is possible to create a custom blockchain for this specific purpose using Blind Merged Mining, although it may not be the most practical solution. He also provides a link to more details about the perpetual one-way peg mechanism needed to pay for fees without introducing speculation. In response to Greg Maxwell pointing out a flaw in his idea, AdamISZ reflects on how difficult it is to create a solution for this problem without begging the question or using the slow and expensive blockchain.</summary>
