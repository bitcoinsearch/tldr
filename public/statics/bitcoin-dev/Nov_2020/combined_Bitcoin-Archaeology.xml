    <summary>The post details the author's experience attempting to build the first three versions of Bitcoin (v0.1.0, v0.1.3, and v0.1.5) using vintage Oct 2009 toolchains with MSYS/MinGW v1.0.11. While most things seemed to build okay, OpenSSL failed due to issues in mk1mf.pl. The author lists several options for resolving the issue, including trying to find out how Satoshi did the MinGW OpenSSL build back in 2009, doing the OpenSSL build through Cygwin, or using Msys2 with later versions of perl and libc.The author seeks help in recalling the steps to build OpenSSL v0.9.8h in MSYS 1.0.11 and asks if anyone knows where to find a non-sketchy copy of Visual C++ 6.0. They provide links to the binaries they used to create the build environment for anyone interested in giving it a shot. The author notes that there may be a version sed, basename or dirname that is missing in MSYS, but the dependency is yet to be found. In addition to the author's experience, a user is seeking a copy of "bitcoin-0.1.2.rar" from 2009/2010 that they are unable to locate. They have gathered all the source archives from v0.1.0 to v0.9.0 except for this one missing file and are curious to examine it purely out of curiosity. The Web Archive has no crawlers that have captured it, but there are links provided for its first and last sighting on the Web Archive.Dan Bryant is also working to build old OpenSSL releases in MSYS/MinGW v1.0.11, specifically the first three versions of Bitcoin (v0.1.0, v0.1.3, and v0.1.5). However, he is having issues with OpenSSL due to some issues in mk1mf.pl, and is seeking guidance to complete the build. He has attempted several options, such as finding a non-sketchy copy of Visual C++ 6.0 and using precompiled OpenSSL releases, among others.The author of the post successfully compiled Bitcoin versions 0.1.0 to 0.3.13, after which the compiler was changed. They plan to refine their work and post binary builds on the repository. The IRC bot might be disabled to prevent spamming the `#bitcoin` IRC channel. The author mentions a patch process that will make it straightforward. The author plans to stop at version 0.8.6 since official builds start from there.Lastly, the author details how they built old OpenSSL releases in MSYS/MinGW v1.0.11 in an earlier post and attempted to recreate the vintage Oct 2009 toolchains used by Satoshi. Using VMs, the author found that most things built okay except for OpenSSL, which failed due to issues in mk1mf.pl. Despite the challenges faced, the author feels that reproducing these old builds is important, but it may also just be their OCD. The provided references are the Satoshi Nakamoto code repository and the OpenSSL mk1mf.pl file on GitHub.</summary>
