    <summary>The author has created a formal specification of Miniscript using the specification language of Alloy analyzer and shared it on Github. The spec can be used for implementing Miniscript libraries, generating test cases for implementation, checking the implementation against the spec, extending or amending Miniscript, and exploring the properties of Miniscript. The author invites anyone interested in Miniscript to review the spec and share their ideas. However, the spec may contain mistakes as it was not yet checked against any implementation and the author requests anyone who finds an inconsistency to submit an issue on Github.</summary>
