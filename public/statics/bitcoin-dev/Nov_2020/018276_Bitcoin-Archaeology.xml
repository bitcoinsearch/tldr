    <summary>A user is seeking a copy of "bitcoin-0.1.2.rar" from 2009/2010 that they are unable to locate. They have gathered all the source archives from v0.1.0 to v0.9.0 except for this one missing file and are curious to examine it purely out of curiosity. The Web Archive has no crawlers that have captured it, but there are links provided for its first and last sighting on the Web Archive. Dan Bryant is working to build old OpenSSL releases in MSYS/MinGW v1.0.11, specifically the first three versions of Bitcoin (v0.1.0, v0.1.3, and v0.1.5). However, he is having issues with OpenSSL due to some issues in mk1mf.pl, and is seeking guidance to complete the build. He has attempted several options, such as finding a non-sketchy copy of Visual C++ 6.0 and using precompiled OpenSSL releases, among others. Dan provides links to various tools he used for the project and is in the process of refining his work before posting binary builds on his repository.</summary>
