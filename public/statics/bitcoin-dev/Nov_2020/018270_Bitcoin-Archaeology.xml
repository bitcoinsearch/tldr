    <summary>The writer describes their experience in attempting to build the first three versions of Bitcoin (v0.1.0, v0.1.3, and v0.1.5) using vintage Oct 2009 toolchains with MSYS/MinGW v1.0.11. While most things seemed to build okay, OpenSSL failed due to some issues in mk1mf.pl. The writer lists several options, including finding out how Satoshi did the MinGW OpenSSL build back in 2009, doing the OpenSSL build through Cygwin which could cross-compile to MinGW at the time, buying a sketchy version of VC 6 on eBay and trying that, patching Bitcoin 0.1.0 to use OpenSSL v1.0.0 where they fixed the perl bug, giving up and using a precompiled OpenSSL release, or giving up and using the Linux build methods introduced in Bitcoin v0.1.6. The writer provides links to the binaries they used to create the build environment for anyone interested in giving it a shot.</summary>
