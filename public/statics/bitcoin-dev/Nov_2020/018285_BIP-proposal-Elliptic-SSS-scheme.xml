    <summary>The proposed solution for sharing private keys and other sensitive information is a modified SSS scheme with two key features. Firstly, secret restoration is impossible without corresponding signatures. Secondly, share[i] belongs to privateKey[i] only. This means that it cannot be signed with a different private key. The approach can be helpful in sharing sensitive information at the application level or as an m-of-n multi-signature. The concept description is available in the attached pdf file named musig-esss.v1.pdf. Additionally, there is a working example in node.js available on the GitHub repository provided by the author at https://github.com/ega-forever/esss. The author expresses gratitude in advance for the time spent reviewing the proposal.</summary>
