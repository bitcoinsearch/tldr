    <summary>A proposed change to BIP-0002 has been made by アルム　カールヨハン. The suggested alteration is regarding the 3-year-rule which currently only permits a BIP to be changed to "Rejected" status. アルム　カールヨハン proposes that the status of a BIP should be changed to "Deferred" instead of "Rejected". The current rules for rejecting a BIP have ambiguous meanings, with soft and hard rejections. The proposal aims to disambiguate the second rule into "deferred" status or add a new status called "Inactive." Furthermore, an alternative proposal has been put forth that suggests updating the rejection criteria in BIP 2 to require an actual concern rather than just a lack of progress in three years. The proposal can be found on https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1016. Readers are requested to nod at one or both proposals.</summary>
