    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Christian Decker and Peter Todd talk about how shabang.io determines whether or not a transaction funded a Lightning channel. Decker explains that shabang.io most likely collects the short_channel_ids which point to on-chain outputs that funded a channel. However, this method only works for public channels, as non-public channels can still be identified on settlement. Todd suggests that it would be beneficial if shabang.io documented their process on their website.</summary>
