    <summary>A discussion on the differentiation of soft fork and hard fork for BIPs in the consensus layer was initiated by Marco Falke via bitcoin-dev on February 14, 2018. Falke suggested that buried deployments should not be categorized as soft or hard forks, as they do not require community or miner coordination for safe deployment. Furthermore, he questioned the necessity of having BIPs for such deployments when they do not require software coordination. Instead, he proposed adding these documents to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs. However, Falke also stated that he would be okay with adding an Annex to the original soft fork/hard fork BIP describing each shortcut. He found it redundant to have two BIPs for every protocol change; one for the change itself and another for implementation-specific shortcuts taken. The discussion was concluded by Luke.</summary>
