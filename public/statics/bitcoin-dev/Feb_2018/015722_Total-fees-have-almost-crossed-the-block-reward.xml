    <summary>Peter Todd, a contributor for bitcoin-dev, has raised a question regarding shabang.io's method of determining whether a transaction has funded a Lightning channel or not. He speculates that the website collects short_channel_ids which lead to on-chain outputs that have funded channels. However, this method is limited to public channels as non-public channels can still be identified upon settlement.</summary>
