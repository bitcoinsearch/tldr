    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and someone else on February 12, 2018, Todd expresses his misunderstanding of a proposal involving Alice re-spending her unconfirmed payment. He goes on to explain that he thinks the case is not solvable without placing some restrictions on spending unconfirmed outputs. However, the person he is corresponding with asks for clarification on what exactly Todd means by "not solvable," wondering if there is a specific problem with the proposal or if Todd has concerns about computing and tracking the package fee rate for transactions within the mempool, among other possible issues.</summary>
