    <summary>The writer of the message is curious if it is possible to encrypt text data in a Bitcoin transaction so that only the receiver can read it. They are specifically looking for a way to do this without exchanging information off the network and are wondering if it could be possible on a sidechain or RSK. The writer mentions having concrete uses for this type of encryption and invites others to share their ideas as well.</summary>
