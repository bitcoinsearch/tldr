    <summary>On February 14, 2018, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the computation of package-fee rates of mempool transactions. The idea was to reuse the calculation already being done for Child-Pays-for-Parent (CPFP) in order to compute the required value. However, it was pointed out that CPFP is only being used in miner code and not in the mempool, which may make the implementation non-trivial. There was also a question raised about whether the package fee rate is considered when ejecting transactions from the bottom of the mempool during high congestion.</summary>
