    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, developers debated the issue of "pinned" transactions in relation to BIP 125. The term refers to a child transaction that has been made and must be "unpinned" before it can be replaced. However, the current BIP 125 rules require not only the relay of the transactions being thrown away but also the absolute fee, which is generally prohibitive due to high fees. Some suggested a diffed tx replacement propagation solution as a better alternative to limit spends of unconfirmed outputs. In addition, Peter Todd asked how many wallets had implemented CPFP fee bumps for incoming transactions.</summary>
