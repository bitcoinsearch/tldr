    <summary>A question was asked about the increased block space enabled by the segregated witness upgrade. It was inquired if the extra block space beyond the legacy 1MB limit is limited to just witness data. The response clarified that the block size limit has been replaced in favor of a block weight limit and there are not two separate limits. Bytes that must be sent to old clients are weighted at 4 units each which allows it to be a soft fork. A PGP signature was included in the original message for security purposes.</summary>
