    <summary>Kalle, a user on the Bitcoin mailing list recently suggested locking up bitcoin with an "OP_CSV" attached to it. The idea is to create a transaction spending a set of UTXOs to a P2SH address and then throw away the private keys. To spend the bitcoin, you would have to broadcast the transaction and wait the given amount of time, then use the new txout. Kalle suggests that Bitcoin Core could handle this in a fairly straightforward manner by introducing two new commands, which he calls freeze and unfreeze. Kalle believes that if this becomes standard enough, it should disincentivize potential robbers as it would be expected that most assets are locked up.</summary>
