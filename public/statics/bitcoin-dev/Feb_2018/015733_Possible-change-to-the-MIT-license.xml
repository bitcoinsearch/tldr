    <summary>Bitcoin is licensed under the liberal MIT license, which has been useful for many software projects. However, recent hard forks and confusion between Bitcoin (the software) and bitcoin (the currency) have prompted questions about the suitability of this license for the project. The entanglement of both has led to a list of Bitcoin lookalikes that are harming the Bitcoin ecosystem. The author suggests amending the MIT license by adding a line that restricts the use of the software in any other project that uses the name Bitcoin as part of its name and/or marketing material unless it is fully compatible with the Bitcoin (Core) blockchain. This would prevent the creation of "Bitcoin Whatever" forks and mitigate the confusion among users. While enforceability may be dubious, it could expose infringing projects to liability.</summary>
