    <summary>Greg Maxwell, a Bitcoin Core developer, shared his thoughts on modifying Bitcoin via a mailing list. He clarified that his post was not meant to be interpreted as a proposal to modify Bitcoin but rather just some thoughts he had that he felt like sharing. Ryan J Martin replied to the thread and suggested that such changes would be better attempted as a fork to a new coin and changing the max number of coins, block reward, difficulty algo, mining policy and protocol would be a non-starter. He also asked about the proposed quantifiable benefits of removing timestamps and how this would be done at the protocol level. There is no mention of any concrete plans to modify Bitcoin in the thread.</summary>
