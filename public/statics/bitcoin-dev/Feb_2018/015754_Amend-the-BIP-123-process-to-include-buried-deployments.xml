    <summary>The author of this context defines a buried deployment as a consensus rule change that affects the validity of blocks which are buried by a significant number of blocks in the current valid most-work chain, but the current block and its parents remain valid. The author suggests that BIPs in the consensus layer should be assigned a label "soft fork" or "hard fork", but not for BIPs that document buried deployments. Buried deployments differ from soft and hard forks in that they do not require community and miner coordination for safe deployment. A massive chain reorganization must occur off of a block in the very past for a chain fork to happen due to a buried deployment. However, the author notes that in the highly unlikely event of such an occurrence, Bitcoin's general security assumptions would be violated regardless of the presence of a buried deployment.</summary>
