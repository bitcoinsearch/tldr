    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jules Lamur, a student working on developing a mining pool with two colleagues, discussed the lack of documentation on existing protocol implementations. In order to rectify this, Lamur suggested publishing an IETF RFC draft or a BIP for the protocol's specification. The BIP 40 and BIP 41 were allocated for the wire protocol and mining protocol respectively in August 2013, but no progress has been made since then. Lamur asked if he and his colleagues could start writing a draft for the BIP 41 mining protocol. Additionally, when working on extensions for RSK merge mining, an internal document with the most up-to-date Straum protocol description was prepared. The document can be accessed at the provided link.</summary>
