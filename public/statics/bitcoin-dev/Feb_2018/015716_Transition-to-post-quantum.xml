    <summary>In a recent message to the bitcoin-dev list, Tristan Hoy shared his research on post-quantum attacks on Bitcoin and options for mitigating them. He found that none of the recommended post-quantum DSA algorithms are scalable and it is premature to commit to a specific one as the space is advancing quickly. However, he identified a strategy that mitigates against the worst case scenario without requiring changes to the Bitcoin protocol or commitment to a specific post-quantum DSA. This strategy involves a change to key generation only, which will be implemented by wallet providers. It also serves as a secure means of transferring balances into a post-quantum DSA address space, even if ECDSA is fully compromised. Feedback on his proposal would be appreciated. Those interested in learning more about this issue may refer to Tim's message and thread on the bitcoin-dev list.</summary>
