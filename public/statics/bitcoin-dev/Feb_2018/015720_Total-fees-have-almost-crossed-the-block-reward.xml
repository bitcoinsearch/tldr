    <summary>Melvin Carvalho, a member of the Bitcoin development community, shared some data points on the current state of Bitcoin in February 2018. He noted that while fees were increasing and replacing the block reward as the main incentive for miners, they were becoming prohibitive for some use cases. Ryan, another member of the community, added to the discussion by suggesting that the intuitive metric of satoshi/byte may not be game theory optimal over the long term. He proposed more progressive fee approaches, but also acknowledged that implementing such changes could have unintended and harmful side effects. Ryan also shared some additional stats on mempool congestion, fee distribution, segwit adoption, and Lightning Network adoption on mainnet.</summary>
