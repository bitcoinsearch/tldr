    <summary>A discussion on the use of BIPs for documenting buried deployments has taken place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Buried deployments refer to changes in consensus rules that affect the validity of blocks that are buried by a sufficient number of blocks in the current most-work chain, but do not require community and miner coordination for a safe deployment. The discussion centered around whether or not buried deployments should be documented using BIPs and whether they should be classified as soft or hard forks. Some participants argued that buried deployments are a subcategory of hard forks, while others proposed that they be treated as an independent category. However, it was noted that regardless of their classification, buried deployments cannot prevent massive chain reorganizations in the event of a security breach.</summary>
