    <summary>Custom open-source licenses can create compliance issues for organizations trying to use software. Deviations from universally-accepted open-source licensing terms can lead to legal complications, causing users to seek approval from their employers before using the software. Therefore, changes to the license may not be viable, regardless of how it is phrased. A suggestion was made to change the license in a way that only limits cryptocurrencies with the same Proof of Work, as having two coins with the same Proof of Work can be a security concern. However, there is opposition to changing the license due to potential branding attacks. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
