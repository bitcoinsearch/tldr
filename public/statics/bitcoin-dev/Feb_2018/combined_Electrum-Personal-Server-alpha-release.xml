    <summary>Two proposals have been introduced to improve the security of Bitcoin wallets. The first proposal involves running a Bitcoin Core instance with internal support for the proposed interface or via an external Python bridge script. The interface can create new wallets, add watch-only addresses, and create new transactions through fundrawtransaction with watch-only-addresses in the background. Coin selection and fee calculation would occur on the Core node, while signing of transactions would happen on the client. A 2of2 (or 2of3 with a backup key) could also be achieved where the node would hold a key for “2FA” if the node and the client environment are owned by the same person. Backup restores are possible via the UTXO set and take less than a minute.The second approach is Electrum Personal Server which allows users to use the Electrum UI with full node verification and privacy but without relying on third-party Electrum servers. Users must configure Electrum Personal Server with their master public key and those addresses are imported into Bitcoin Core as watch-only. If the wallet contains historical transactions then it must be rescanned. An alpha version of Electrum Personal Server is available on the repository. Electrum's "instant on" feature is traded away when using Electrum Personal Server in return for full node verification and privacy. It remains the most resource-efficient way right now to use a hardware wallet connected to your own full node. Similar ideas could be applied to other lightweight wallets, where a full node can run on smartphones with pruning and blocksonly, then a similar script would allow the user to connect their Samourai Wallet, Breadwallet or GreenAddress app to their own full node.</summary>
