    <summary>Melvin Carvalho, a member of Bitcoin development team came across a website named shabang.io which shows the adoption of lightning network on mainnet. The site shows that lightning network is increasing well and some blocks are not far off 1% lightning funding, which Melvin thinks bodes well. He predicted that over 1% of bitcoin transactions will be lightning-based by the end of the year. However, Peter Todd, another member of the Bitcoin community questioned how shabang.io determines whether or not a transaction funded a Lightning channel.</summary>
