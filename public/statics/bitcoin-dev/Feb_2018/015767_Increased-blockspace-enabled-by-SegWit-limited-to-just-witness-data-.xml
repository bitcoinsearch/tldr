    <summary>The author, Cannon, has a question regarding the increased blockspace enabled by the segregated witness upgrade. They want to know if the extra blockspace beyond the legacy 1 MB limit is limited to just witness data. The email includes a PGP signature and fingerprint for secure communication, and the author also notes that any email correspondence not signed or encrypted with PGP should be considered potentially forged and not private.</summary>
