    <summary>There is an ongoing debate in the Bitcoin community over whether BIPs that document buried deployments should be classified as "soft fork" or "hard fork". Buried deployments refer to a consensus rule change that affects the validity of blocks buried by a large number of blocks in the current valid most-work chain. The author suggests that BIPs in the consensus layer should not be labeled as "soft fork" or "hard fork", except for those that document buried deployments.Some argue that BIPs are not necessary for documentation on buried deployments since they do not require software coordination, but others believe that clear documentation is important to aid developers in understanding what safety analyses have already been conducted. Inaccurate analyses could lead to serious consequences, so having clear documentation in place is crucial.The discussion also touches on the depth assumption required to ensure that buried deployments do not result in a chain split, as well as whether or not a massive chain reorganization must occur off of a block in the very past for a chain fork to happen due to a buried deployment. However, it is noted that regardless of their classification, buried deployments cannot prevent massive chain reorganizations in the event of a security breach.In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Marco Falke defined a "buried deployment" as a consensus rule change that affects the validity of blocks buried by a sufficiently large number of blocks in the current valid most-work chain. However, there are concerns about the definition given that it would imply there is no need to validate any block deeper than the most recent 25,000. Falke also suggests that the differentiation between soft forks and hard forks should not be made for buried deployments because they do not require community and miner coordination for a safe deployment, but this is only true if the hard fork cannot result in a chain split. It is important to note that a buried deployment is a subjective subcategory of a hard fork, not an independent category unless an objective threshold can be established. Overall, the debate on whether BIPs that document buried deployments should be labeled as "soft fork" or "hard fork" is ongoing in the Bitcoin community. While some believe that clear documentation is important for developers to understand what safety analyses have already been conducted, others question the necessity of having BIPs at all. Regardless of their classification, it is noted that buried deployments cannot prevent massive chain reorganizations in the event of a security breach.</summary>
