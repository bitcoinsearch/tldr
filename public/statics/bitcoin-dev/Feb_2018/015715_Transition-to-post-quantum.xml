    <summary>Tristan Hoy has researched the possibility of a post-quantum attack on Bitcoin and how it can be mitigated. In his draft, he notes that none of the recommended post-quantum digital signature algorithms (DSAs), such as XMSS and SPHINCS, are scalable. He also identifies a strategy that can mitigate against the worst-case scenario of an unexpectedly early attack on ECDSA without requiring any changes to the Bitcoin protocol or full commitment to a specific post-quantum DSA that will likely be superseded in the next 3-5 years. The proposal involves a change to key generation only and will be implemented by wallet providers. This solution also serves as a secure means of transferring balances into a post-quantum DSA address space, even if ECDSA is fully compromised and the transition is reactionary. Feedback is welcome.</summary>
