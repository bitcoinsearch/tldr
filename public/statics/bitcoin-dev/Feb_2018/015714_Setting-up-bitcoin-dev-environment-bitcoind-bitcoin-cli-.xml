    <summary>On February 9th, 2018, Maksim Solovjov reported issues with launching bitcoind in -regtest regime. When attempting to launch bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 101, an error occurred stating "Method not found" with error code -32601. It was later revealed that setgenerate was removed in version 0.13.0, which is explained in the doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md. Additionally, when trying to run bitcoin-cli getinfo, another error occurred stating "Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and no rpcpassword is set in the configuration file (/Users/..../Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)." The user was advised to check their installed version of Bitcoin and note that even before deprecation, a bitcoin.conf file needs to be properly located for bitcoin-cli to find it.</summary>
