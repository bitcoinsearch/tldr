    <summary>Helder Garcia is seeking to comprehend the mechanism of signalling and activation of updates in Bitcoin. In his pursuit, he has studied several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) including BIP34, BIP9, and BIP8. While going through BIP8, he has come across a concept that even if the threshold of 95% signalling is not reached in the STARTED state, an update will be activated as soon as blockchain height equals or exceeds the timeout_height. Helder wants to know if his understanding is correct and whether there is a risk associated with activating a change without having the majority of hash power accepting it.</summary>
