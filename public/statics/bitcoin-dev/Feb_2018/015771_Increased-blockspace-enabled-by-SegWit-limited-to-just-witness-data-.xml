    <summary>The email thread is discussing the increased blockspace enabled by the segregated witness (segwit) upgrade. The upgrade replaces the 1MB block size limit with a block weight limit of 4M weight. Bytes that must be sent to old clients are weighted at four units each, which allows it to be a soft fork. As a soft fork, all preceding rules remain in effect, and no rule has been replaced. Blocks must validate against pre-segwit rules or are invalid. Additional rules are applied that further restrict validity and consider additional (witness) data in the context of the block. The original question posed was whether the extra blockspace beyond the legacy 1 MB limit is limited to just witness data. Cannon signed his message using PGP, and his email correspondence not signed/encrypted with PGP should be considered potentially forged and not private.</summary>
