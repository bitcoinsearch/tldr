    <summary>Greg Maxwell, a Bitcoin Core developer, presented a proposal for Taproot, which can make smart contracts indistinguishable from regular transactions. The Taproot mechanism is designed to create a coin that can be redeemed by either Alice and Bob or CSV-timelock and Bob. The verification computational complexity of the signature path is the same as any other plain signature. If the anonymity set of fancy usage is only other fancy usage, it may not be very large in practice. However, with this construction, there will be no overhead in the common case and no requirement for durable storage of other data. The construction allows the largest possible anonymity set for fixed party smart contracts by making them look like the simplest possible payments. MuSig can be used to make it indistinguishable from 1-of-1.</summary>
