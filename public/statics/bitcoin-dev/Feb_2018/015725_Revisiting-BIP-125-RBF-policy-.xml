    <summary>In an email thread, Peter Todd discusses the problem with Rule 3 of BIP 125. Todd explains that creating a double-spend to pay both Bob and Alice would invalidate Alice's sweep-transaction as per this rule. The sweep-transaction is very large, and hence pays a large absolute fee even though her fee-rate is very low, which "pins" the RBF transaction. In response to Todd's proposal, another member suggests that the effective fee rate of the maximum feerate package be computed from the set of transactions that begins with the candidate replacement. They believe that CPFP is already computing this value.</summary>
