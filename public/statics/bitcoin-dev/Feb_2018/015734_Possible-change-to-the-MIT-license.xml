    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, JOSE FEMENIAS CAÃ‘UELO proposed that no part of the Bitcoin codebase should be included in any other project that uses the name "Bitcoin" as part of its name and/or marketing material unless the software produced by that project is fully compatible with the Bitcoin (Core) blockchain. However, this proposal was met with criticism from other members of the community who argued that this issue would be better solved with trademarks. They also pointed out that such a license would not affect anybody forking older versions of Bitcoin or using existing independent blockchain implementations and renaming them "Bitcoin-Whatsoever". Moreover, there is legal uncertainty associated with this proposal, and it raises questions about what happens when an old version becomes technically incompatible with a future version by the Core team due to not understanding various new softforks. The issue of which version wins the right to the name also remains unresolved. Additionally, some members of the community feel that being unable to even mention Bitcoin is overkill, and the software license would not affect the blockchain data.</summary>
