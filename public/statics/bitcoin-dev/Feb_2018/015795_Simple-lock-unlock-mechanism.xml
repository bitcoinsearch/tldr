    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development community has raised a concern about Graftroot, a proposed change to the way in which Bitcoin transactions are conducted. The issue is that under this new system, someone could sign a time-locked output with a script that has no time-lock. However, it has been suggested that making the graftroot key a 2-of-2 muSig with an independent third party that commits to only signing CLTV scripts could prevent this problem. It may also be possible to make the key 3-of-3 or 5-of-5 if multiple independent services can be found to support it.</summary>
