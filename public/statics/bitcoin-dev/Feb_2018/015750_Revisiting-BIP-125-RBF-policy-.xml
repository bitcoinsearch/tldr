    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter Todd expresses that the "Super Withdrawals" procedure to prevent double-spending is very complex and hard to test. He also mentions that by relaxing restrictions on bip125, it becomes much easier to do certain things. Additionally, he talks about wallets implementing CPFP fee bumps for incoming transactions and how it can be cost-prohibitive to create a transaction specifically for the purpose of a CPFP fee bump. However, he does note that the workflow is smooth and everyone is happy when both transactions confirm. Overall, Todd emphasizes the complexity involved in preventing double-spending and implementing certain procedures, but acknowledges the benefits of relaxed restrictions.</summary>
