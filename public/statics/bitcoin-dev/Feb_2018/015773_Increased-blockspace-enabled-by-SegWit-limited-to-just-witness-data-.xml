    <summary>The email thread is about the block size limit in bitcoin after the segregated witness upgrade. Ryan believes that the block size limit has been replaced by a block weight limit, which is more restrictive than the previous rule. However, Eric argues that as a soft fork, all preceding rules remain in effect, and no rule has been "replaced." He explains that additional rules are applied that further restrict the validity of blocks and consider additional (witness) data in the context of the block. CANNON asks a question about whether the extra block space enabled by the segregated witness upgrade is limited to just witness data beyond the legacy 1 MB limit. The PGP-signed message also includes CANNON's email address and a notice that all email correspondence not signed/encrypted with PGP should be considered potentially forged and not private.</summary>
