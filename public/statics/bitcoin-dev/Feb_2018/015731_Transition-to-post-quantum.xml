    <summary>Tristan Hoy presented his research on the potential of post-quantum attack on Bitcoin, and options for mitigating it. The recommended post-quantum DSAs (XMSS, SPHINCS) are not scalable, and commitment to a specific post-quantum DSA at this point would be premature as it's a rapidly advancing space. Hoy identified a strategy that mitigates against the worst-case scenario without requiring changes to the Bitcoin protocol or total commitment to a specific post-quantum DSA. This strategy also serves as a secure means of transferring balances into a post-quantum DSA address space, even in the event that ECDSA is fully compromised. The proposal is a change to key generation only and will be implemented by wallet providers. Feedback is requested.</summary>
