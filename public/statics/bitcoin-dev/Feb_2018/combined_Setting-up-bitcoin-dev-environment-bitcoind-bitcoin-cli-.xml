    <summary>The writer is seeking assistance in setting up a bitcoin development environment on their Mac. They have installed the Bitcoin Core client and downloaded binaries, but are facing various issues. Firstly, they are unable to open the configuration file from bitcoin-qt even though it exists at $HOME/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf. Secondly, when attempting to launch bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 101, an error occurred stating "Method not found" with error code -32601. It was later revealed that setgenerate was removed in version 0.13.0. Lastly, when trying to run bitcoin-cli getinfo, another error occurred stating "Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and no rpcpassword is set in the configuration file (/Users/..../Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)."On February 9th, 2018, Maksim Solovjov reported issues with launching bitcoind in -regtest regime. The user was advised to check their installed version of Bitcoin and note that even before deprecation, a bitcoin.conf file needs to be properly located for bitcoin-cli to find it. It was later revealed that setgenerate was removed in version 0.13.0, which is explained in the doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md.</summary>
