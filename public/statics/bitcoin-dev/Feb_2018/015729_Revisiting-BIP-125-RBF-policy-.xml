    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Peter Todd discussed the issue of "pinned" transactions and the current rules of BIP125. This rule requires transactions that are being replaced to pay not only the relay fee but also the absolute fee, which can be cost-prohibitive. Todd suggested using diffed tx replacement propagation as an alternative solution, which would allow for minimum bandwidth accounting based on the size of the diff instead. However, relay fees and the number of replacements make it a non-issue at present. The primary flaw in bip125 is having to pay the absolute fee from the transactions being evicted, even those generated by others. The thread also touched on monitoring, confirming, and rebroadcasting missing transactions in a way that is safe against reorgs.</summary>
