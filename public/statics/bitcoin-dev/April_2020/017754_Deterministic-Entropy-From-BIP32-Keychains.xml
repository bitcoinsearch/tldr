    <summary>In an email conversation, Ethan mentioned his plan to submit a BIP for the deterministic entropy from BIP32 keychains. This idea was already being considered by others, and Ethan had let it sit for a while for their consideration. However, he was also considering splitting the BIP into two parts: one for the entropy derivation and another for the applications section. This approach would be similar to how BIP32 serves as the basis for derivation schemes like BIP39, BIP44, BIP49, etc.Rodolfo Novak had initially contacted Ethan to inquire about the BIP number planned to be assigned and if there was any review of the BIP yet. It is unclear from the context whether Ethan provided an answer to these questions in his response.</summary>
