    <summary>The article emphasizes the importance of improving Bitcoin's security measures, particularly in terms of better cold storage designs that can be shared openly and reviewed by the public. The author highlights the need to understand that "bitcoin cold storage security is impenetrable" as the value of Bitcoin increases. To address this issue, the author announces the release of an open-source prototype for on-chain bitcoin vaults using pre-signed transactions and secure key deletion. This enables the initiation of a recovery or clawback during the delay period, thereby increasing security for Bitcoin users.Furthermore, the author mentions collaborating with Spencer Hommel, Jacob Swambo, and Bob McElrath on two related manuscripts addressing the topic of bitcoin covenants and vaults based on pre-signed transactions. The article provides links to existing implementations and requests feedback and discussion around these concepts. Overall, the article stresses the need for continued efforts to improve Bitcoin's security measures to ensure the safety of all users and their investments.</summary>
