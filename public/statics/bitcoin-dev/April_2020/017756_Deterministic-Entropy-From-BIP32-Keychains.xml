    <summary>A user has opened a BIP PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/910 and created a Python library with test vectors referenced in the BIP text. It is unclear whether or not the "Applications" section of the BIP will be split into a separate document or remain in the current BIP. Rodolfo Novak from Coinkite Inc. has expressed interest in implementing the Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains BIP on Coldcard and is wondering if a BIP number has been assigned and if there has been any review of the BIP so far.</summary>
