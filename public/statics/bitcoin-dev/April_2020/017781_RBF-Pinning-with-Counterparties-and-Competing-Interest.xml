    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, has been working on mempool issues for months and believes that increasing development resources towards finishing the project is the way forward. He argues that new carve-out rules would remove complexity invariants needed to keep nodes operational. Rubin suggests focusing on testing construction, refactoring algorithms, and package relay. While none of these fixes the exact problem at hand, they can help explore opportunities to attach compact proofs of improved fee efficiency to pinned transactions. Rubin is also working on plans and designs to completely redo the mempool's architecture, which could take years to complete. In conclusion, he encourages developers to coordinate resources to accelerate completion of this work.</summary>
