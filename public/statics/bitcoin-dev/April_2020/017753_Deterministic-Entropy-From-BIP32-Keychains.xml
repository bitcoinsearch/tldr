    <summary>Christopher Allen believes that there needs to be a review by a cryptographic engineering expert, ideally Pieter Wuille. Although he thinks such a review will suggest some improvements, he believes something in this area should be done. One solution is with the offline tool #LetheKit provided by BlockchainCommons/bc-lethe-kit. Using this tool, one can go to their vault, input their BIP39 from an offline titanium key or SLIP39 Shamir shards, and then derive a child key in BIP39 form. The derived key can be delivered via QR from the air-gapped LetheKit to another device.</summary>
