    <summary>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Shiva Jairam asked for feedback on his project mapping out BIP002 into a business process model using BPMN2.0. He provided a link to the concept model he had created so far and requested review or discussion from experts in the field. Nopara73 responded with a tip that if someone wants feedback on their work, they should share it first so that others can understand the scope of the project. Shiva Jairam clarified that this was an academic research project and he was not an expert in blockchain or bitcoin. He asked if anyone was willing to review or discuss his model and requested guidance on where to seek help if this was not the right platform. The email thread included links to BIP0002 on Github and the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
