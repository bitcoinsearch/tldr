    <title>Sorting outputs of a transaction in alphabetic order to protect privacy</title>

    <summary>A member of an online list has proposed a solution to improve privacy for cryptocurrency users. The issue addressed is that wallet developers often construct transactions with the second output being the sender's change address. This makes it easier for chain analyzers to identify addresses and invade user privacy. The proposed solution is to sort outputs in alphabetical or random order before broadcasting, making it harder for analyzers to determine which output is the change address. The post marks the author's first contribution to the group after previously being a lurker.</summary>
