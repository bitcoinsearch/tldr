    <summary>Shiva Jairam is requesting a review or discussion on his project regarding an academic research for his studies. He is trying to map out BIP002 into a business process model using BPMN2.0. Shiva admits that he is not an expert in Blockchain nor Bitcoin and has just recently began looking into the technologies. He is seeking help from anyone who is willing to review or discuss his model. If this is not the right place to discuss such a topic, pointing in the right direction is much appreciated.</summary>
