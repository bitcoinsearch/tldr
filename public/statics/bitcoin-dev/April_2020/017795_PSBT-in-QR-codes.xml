    <summary>A discussion on the topic of a common QR code compatible format for PSBT has been moved from the specter-diy repository to the BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning repository to avoid overwhelming the former. The hope is that this new repository will serve as a place to share examples and prototypes until a consensus can be reached among wallet developers. Christopher Allen shared this information in response to a post made by Riccardo Casatta on the bitcoin-dev forum, which included a link to the relevant GitHub issue.</summary>
