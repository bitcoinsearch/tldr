    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, known as SatoshiSingh, has proposed a solution to improve user privacy while transacting cryptocurrencies. The current system followed by wallet developers constructs transactions with the second output being the sender's change address. This makes it easier for chain analyzers to identify addresses and violate users' privacy. As a solution, SatoshiSingh suggests sorting outputs in alphabetical order or by a random order before broadcasting. This will make it harder for analyzers to determine which output is the change address.The idea was met with mixed reactions from other members of the mailing list. Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs, responded to the thread with his regards. It is noteworthy that this post marks the author's first contribution to the group after previously being a lurker. The proposed change in transaction construction is expected to enhance the privacy of cryptocurrency users and reduce the chances of their information being exposed to third parties.</summary>
