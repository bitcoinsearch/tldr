    <summary>Shiva Jairam, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, has requested feedback on his project which involves mapping out BIP002 into a business process model using BPMN2.0. The project is part of an academic research for his studies. Shiva admits to not being an expert in Blockchain or Bitcoin and has just recently begun looking into the technologies. He is seeking someone to review or discuss his model. However, he also suggests that sharing his work may encourage more people to commit to helping him since not many are willing to do so without knowing how large the work is.</summary>
