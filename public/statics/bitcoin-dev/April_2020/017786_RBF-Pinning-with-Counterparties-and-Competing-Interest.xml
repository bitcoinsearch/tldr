    <summary>In this conversation between Matt and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss a proposal for a potential attack on the Lightning Network. The proposal involves a "hashlock branch" that requires B and C to agree and show the preimage of some hash H. They suggest that miners, being economically rational, would accept an alternative transaction with a better feerate, and thus an economically-rational C would make that effort. In any case, even if C hooks a tree of low-fee transactions on its hook output or normal payment, miners will still be willing to confirm this and the B hook CPFP transaction without.</summary>
