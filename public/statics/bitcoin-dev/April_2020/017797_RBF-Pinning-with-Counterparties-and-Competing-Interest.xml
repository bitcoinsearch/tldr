    <summary>David A. Harding discusses the issue of excessive bandwidth usage in Bitcoin Core due to the absence of enforcement of BIP125 rule 3, which requires each replacement pay a feerate of 10 nBTC/vbyte over an existing transaction or package. He explains how an attacker starting at the minimum default relay fee could create a ~400,000 bytes tx with feerate of 10 nBTC/vbyte and perform 998 additional replacements, ultimately producing a transaction with a feerate of 10,000 nBTC/vbyte (1 BTC total fee). To fix this problem properly, aggressive delay processing is needed for transactions that are unlikely to be in the next few blocks. However, this would require a complete rewrite of bitcoind's logic.</summary>
