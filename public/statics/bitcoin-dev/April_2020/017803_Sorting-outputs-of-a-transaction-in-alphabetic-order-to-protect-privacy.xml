    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, SatoshiSingh, has suggested a change to the way transactions are constructed in order to improve user privacy. Currently, wallet developers typically construct transactions with the second output being the sender's change, which makes it easier for chain analysers to identify addresses and invade users' privacy. SatoshiSingh proposes sorting the outputs in alphabetical order or by a random order before broadcasting, making it more difficult for chain analysers to determine which output is the change output. The proposal was met with mixed reactions from other members of the mailing list. Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs, responded to the thread with his regards.</summary>
