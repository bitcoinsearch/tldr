    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Peter Todd discusses centralization in proof-of-publication (PoP) sidechains versus decentralization. He explains that the centralized version of PoP is significantly easier to maintain than a decentralized version. Scaling is also simpler in the centralized system as one can simply buy more hardware and distribute the key space over multiple shards. However, this simple architecture only works with trust, which raises questions about how to ensure that valid trees are built and results are distributed without trust. Peter Todd's prior work on Treechains attempts to address this issue, but it remains an orders of magnitude more difficult problem.</summary>
