    <summary>In an email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, concerns were raised about the current incentive system in Bitcoin. The author of the email believes that the current incentive system doesn't align with the way miners are distributed, which allows big miners to spam the network with low-fee transactions, forcing regular users to pay extremely high fees to get their transactions confirmed. The author suggests that such an attack could be profitable even if a player controls just 5-10% of the hashing power and presents calculations based on 10 blocks mined yesterday, all of which had rewards exceeding the normal 12.5 mining output.To solve this issue, the author proposes several solutions, including increasing block size every time there is sustained pressure, changing POW, or implementing a protocol-level maximum transaction fee. However, each solution has its own downsides. Therefore, the author recommends setting a maximum transaction fee to make the spam more expensive than the fees one would recover, ensuring that miners do not have an unfair advantage.The email also includes links to relevant information and discussions on the topic. Another developer proposed a solution to incentivize efficient usage by both users and miners, but the author found it too complex and suggested having nodes stop propagating transactions with fees over the max and miners reject blocks where coinbase &gt; block reward + max fee rate * block size. The author notes that unbounded fees together with small blocks and big miners introduce a terrible flaw in the incentives equilibrium, suggesting coupling his proposal with slowly increasing the block size with a process similar to difficulty adjustment. Overall, the email highlights concerns about the current incentive system in Bitcoin and proposes possible solutions to prevent high fees for regular users.</summary>
