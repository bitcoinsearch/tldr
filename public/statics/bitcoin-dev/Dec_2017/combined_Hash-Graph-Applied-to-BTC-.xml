    <summary>There is a debate about the legality of making a hard fork of Bitcoin that incorporates Hash Graph due to its proprietary license. However, it is argued that its open algorithm could be implemented without violating the license while still giving value to existing cryptocurrency tokens and keys. The individual posing the question is a programmer with experience implementing algorithms but has no notable experience with crypto algorithms specifically.Bitcoin's scalability problem is acknowledged, as its current limit of 6 transactions per second is insufficient for a global economy. While Lightning promises to solve this issue, it has not yet been fully implemented. In addition, a small amount of BTC was transferred to Ethereum using Coinomi wallet, which took several days on a low priority.It is important to note that no debug log is available at this time. Despite these challenges, there is still a possibility of making a hard fork of Bitcoin that incorporates Hash Graph, which could potentially address the scalability issue and enhance the functionality of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
