    <summary>The discussion in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the signing of messages, specifically against SegWit P2SH addresses. Damian Williamson expresses his opinion that signing a message is an important feature regardless of the method used. He suggests updating it for SegWit addresses while retaining its current simplicity. Another member, Mark Friedenbach, proposes a solution that involves having the signature be an actual bitcoin transaction with inputs that have the script being signed. This would enable signing by any existing infrastructure and allow multi-party signing setups using Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions. The proposal also unifies a single approach for message signing, proof of reserve, and off-chain colored coins. Dan Bryant asks if anyone is writing a BIP for Sign/Verify message against a SegWit address, to which Pavol Rusnak asks if he is still planning to write it.</summary>
