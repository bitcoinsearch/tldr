    <summary>The writer of the email criticizes a proposal that relies on miners to enforce block rules and increase block size. They argue that this will incentivize miners to falsify data and ignore the proposal unless it benefits them financially. The email then goes on to explain the concept of proof-of-work in physics and how it relates to the blockchain's measurement of time. The suggestion is made for each block to commit to a view of the mempool, but this would require sweeping the entire mempool contents per block, making a block size limit irrelevant. It is instead suggested that developers use existing mechanisms like RBF and CPFP to manipulate feerates and speed up transactions.</summary>
