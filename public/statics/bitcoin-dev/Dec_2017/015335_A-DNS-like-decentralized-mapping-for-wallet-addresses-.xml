    <summary>A user named Mandar Mulherkar posted a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on December 1, 2017, questioning whether there could be a DNS-like decentralized mapping service for cryptocurrency addresses. He suggested that instead of long wallet addresses, a human-readable address could be used to convert it into a wallet address. The wallet software would then use confirmations from the network to perform this address translation. In response, Justin W. Newton, the Founder/CEO of Netki, Inc., recommended using WalletNames.com, which is based on a standard that can support blockchain-based or traditional ICANN DNS. It provides users with a human-readable name that can be mapped to their cryptocurrency address.</summary>
