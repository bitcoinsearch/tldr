    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Lucas Clemente Vella suggested that Namecoin, the original altcoin, was aiming to build a decentralized domain name system (DNS) in a similar fashion to Bitcoin's blockchain. However, Namecoin failed to gain traction and did not become widely used. In response, Mandar Mulherkar asked whether a DNS-like decentralized mapping service could provide users with a human-readable address for cryptocurrency transactions, instead of long wallet addresses or QR codes. This would allow the wallet software to convert the readable address to a wallet address with network confirmations. Lucas suggested that OpenAlias.org could be a solution to this issue.</summary>
