    <summary>One method to decrease fees for Bitcoin transactions is to use Replace-By-Fee (RBF), which allows wallets to suggest lower fees and then increase them if the transaction gets stuck. Bitcoin Core has supported RBF for some time and now recommends lower fees when using RBF. A pull request was recently submitted to turn on RBF by default, but concerns were raised about how this would affect merchants who do not want their customers to use RBF. To address this concern, a flag called "no125=1" was suggested that would allow wallets to honor a merchant's preference not to use RBF unless the user explicitly overrides it. This flag can be added as part of a BIP-21 URI, and it should not break existing support. The author also suggests adding a bech32 param, but this is a separate discussion.</summary>
