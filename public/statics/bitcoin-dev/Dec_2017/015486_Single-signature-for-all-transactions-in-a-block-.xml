    <summary>The author of the message is asking a question regarding scaling and privacy enhancements. They suggest that combining SegWit with aggregated signatures and coinjoin could potentially achieve this goal, as using aggregated signatures in conjunction with coinjoin would decrease the size of all inputs of a coinjoin transaction while having privacy at the same time. The author believes that if the majority of transactions in a block did this, significant more transactions could be fit into a block. However, they have a question about the extra blockspace made possible by SegWit - whether it is limited to only witness data or can it be used for transaction data such as the scenario described. The author provides their PGP fingerprint and email address for secure correspondence.</summary>
