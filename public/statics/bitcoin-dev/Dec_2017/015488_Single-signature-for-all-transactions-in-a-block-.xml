    <summary>The Bitcoin Protocol Discussion mailing list received a question regarding the potential for scaling and privacy enhancements by using aggregated signatures in conjunction with coinjoin. The idea is to use aggregated signatures in a way that all inputs of a coinjoin transaction would have a single signature, which would significantly decrease the size and also provide privacy. The question asked whether the extra blockspace made possible by segwit is limited to only witness data or if it can be used for transaction data as well. The key to understanding how it works is to stop thinking in terms of a block size limit, but rather a block weight limit. A block must be less than 4 million weight, and there's no separate limits at all, so any saving in the witness space (e.g. through signature aggregation) is useful for both witness/non-witness data. One byte of witness data counts as one weight, whereas the rest counts for four weight. Therefore, any saving in the witness space is helpful for both types of data.</summary>
