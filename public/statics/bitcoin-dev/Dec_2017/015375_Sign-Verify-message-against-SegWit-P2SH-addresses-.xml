    <summary>The post discusses the need for a BIP for Sign/Verify message against a SegWit address, specifically for P2SH-PWPKH and/or native SegWit bech32 addresses. The author suggests that such functionality is important in scenarios where proof of assets is needed, or for cases where a person needs to prove that they are in charge of a large amount of funds. The post also mentions the possibility of signing a message to prove the ability to redeem some arbitrary branch in a MAST-like tree of scripts or being a minority part of a multisig. However, these features have privacy and security trade-offs. Additionally, there is no BIP for the current message signing mechanism. The author suggests a more generic implementation like the Elements implementation referred to by Greg Maxwell would be ideal to avoid exclusion of funds with complicated redeem scripts.</summary>
