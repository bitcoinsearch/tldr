    <summary>On December 3, 2017, Matt Corallo expressed concerns over the lack of evidence regarding the "Risk of centralisation of mining" drawback in section 4.3 of the sidechains paper. He stated his opinion that it is critical for new sidechains to be rare events due to this uncertainty. However, it is impossible to guarantee this rarity as federated sidechains are already possible with simple multisig and could potentially be merge-mined chains. Despite this, the value of permissionless sidechain innovation is significant.</summary>
