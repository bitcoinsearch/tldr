    <summary>Sjors Provoost, a Bitcoin Core developer, has suggested adding a "-ignoredflags=x,y,z" section to the URI that can be used to ignore flags and BIPs. This comes after a discussion regarding the default use of Replace-By-Fee (RBF), BIP 125, in Bitcoin Core wallets. RBF allows for lower fees as transactions can be easily bumped if they get stuck due to underestimation. A pull request was submitted by Provoost to turn on RBF by default, but some merchants were reluctant to see their customers use it. To ease the transition, Matt Corallo suggested a "no125=1" flag, which, when set, would prevent wallets from using RBF unless the user explicitly overrides the merchant's preference. This flag should not break existing BIP-21 support and is optional. Provoost also suggests adding a bech32 param, but this is for another discussion. The links to BIP 125, the release of v0.15.0 of Bitcoin Core, and the discussion related to the pull request are provided in the email.</summary>
