    <summary>On 12th January, Paul Sztorc via bitcoin-dev, announced that Drivechain has created a new source code and is no longer in the vaporware stage. The documentation/BIP-Drafts are ready for formal BIP number assignment and code review. They have also requested feedback from others looking to deploy real-world sidechains, such as the RSK folks. Matt contributed to the conversation with comments on BIP 1 and 2 of the proposed code. He expressed his disappointment with the amount of data going into the main chain, the semantics of the deposit process, and lack of convincing evidence that the risk of centralisation of mining drawback had been meaningfully addressed. Matt also expressed concerns about the security model proposed in BIP 2, stating that it could further reduce hashpower-secured sidechains' security level by requiring users to potentially pay more than an attacker would be willing to pay to keep their chain secure. In addition, Matt pointed out that the proposal does not solve the drawbacks outlined in section 4.3 of the paper and may make it worse. Instead, he suggested relying on a high threshold for the addition of new sidechains. Overall, the discussion revolved around the Drivechain proposal and its implications on Bitcoin's ecosystem.</summary>
