    <summary>The post on Reddit argues against using the term "bits" in Bitcoin as it can cause confusion for beginners. The author provides a list of homonyms that are used every day, suggesting that our brains are able to interpret language based on context. However, the post ignores the fact that there are multiple meanings of bits within the same context, such as 24 bit audio resolution or 24 bit price. This can cause confusion and make it difficult for people to know when to apply one definition or the other. The post suggests that while those familiar with Bitcoin may be able to tell the difference, not everyone will be able to do so.</summary>
