    <summary>One proposal to simplify the use of Bitcoin is to create a new unit of measurement called "coinbit." The idea is that one Bitcoin would be equal to 1 million coinbits. This would allow for easier calculations and use of smaller denominations. Additionally, the abbreviation "bit" could be used as a shorthand for "coinbit." While this proposal has not been widely adopted, it represents one possible solution for streamlining the use of Bitcoin in everyday transactions.</summary>
