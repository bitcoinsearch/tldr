    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of SI prefixes in Bitcoin units, with a suggestion to make 100 satoshi equal to 1 mu. The idea of using finney as a unit of value is also supported, with its smallest unit being 1 satoshi. The possibility of redefining 'satoshi' is dismissed. The argument against using 'bits' as a unit of measurement is presented, citing confusion that could arise from multiple meanings of the word within the same context.</summary>
