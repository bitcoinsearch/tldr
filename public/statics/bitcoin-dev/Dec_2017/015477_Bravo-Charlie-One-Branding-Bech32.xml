    <title>Bravo Charlie One: Branding Bech32</title>

    <summary>The author proposes a "branding" strategy to increase user familiarity and acceptance of the error-correcting, case-insensitive Bitcoin addresses of the future, such as those based on BIP 173 Bech32 addresses. The author suggests using radio alphabets, which work well for conveying unusual names or pseudorandom strings, and proposes "Bravo Charlie Addresses" as the official nickname for Bech32 Bitcoin use. The author believes that adopting a familiar phrase such as this will help raise user awareness of this exciting new technology. Additionally, the author invites discussion on recommendations for Bitcoin spelling-alphabet use in English and other languages to facilitate coherent user documentation. Finally, the author notes that while this branding only applies directly to Bitcoin Bech32 addresses, the standard is generally adaptable and could be useful for other applications such as key fingerprints for PGP, SSH, and TLS.</summary>
