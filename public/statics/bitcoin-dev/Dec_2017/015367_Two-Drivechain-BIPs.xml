    <summary>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj pointed out a vulnerability that could be fixed by restricting withdrawals to simple P2PKH or P2WPKH only. This solution would not require too much work but would prevent people from withdrawing to legitimate P2SH scripts, such as multisig scripts. However, in the presence of Scriptless Script and Bellare-Neven signatures, this solution may not be enough to prevent the creation of the Theft Contract and the Accomplice Contract. The poster asked if anyone on the list could help answer this question.</summary>
