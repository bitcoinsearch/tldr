    <summary>The writer requests BIP numbers to assign to the ideas discussed in the thread. The writer also argues that despite some potential drawbacks, there are benefits to the technical review currently taking place. They note that the purpose of BIP numbers is to ensure everyone discussing a topic is on the same page. The email continues with a response to a previous message about the security model for sidechains. The writer disagrees with the idea that there are no repercussions for fraudulent withdrawals and lists several negative consequences. Additionally, they argue that the collective action problem inherent in fraudulent withdrawals is more burdensome than Bitcoin's. Lastly, the writer accuses the previous author of committing the "useless sidechain fallacy" by stating that because they believe a sidechain is useless, it must be so for everyone.</summary>
