    <summary>The email exchange between Damian Williamson and ZmnSCPxj on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around a BIP proposal called UTWFOTIB, which stands for Use Transaction Weight For Ordering Transactions In Blocks. The discussion focuses on the idea of using the next block size to order transactions in blocks, with some concerns being raised about the feasibility of this proposal. Specifically, there are questions about how nodes would be able to verify the correct size of the transaction pool, as well as whether there is an incentive for miners to cheat by providing a next block size that is higher or lower than the proposal would give. ZmnSCPxj argues that consensus rules should restrict themselves to the characteristics of the block and its transactions, rather than depending on the transaction pool, which is not safe for any consensus rules. This point is echoed by Damian Williamson, who revises the proposal and posts it back to the mailing list. Despite the concerns raised, both parties agree that the proposal is worth considering and discussing further.</summary>
