    <summary>A question regarding scaling and privacy enhancements has been asked on the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion mailing list. The author suggests that combining SegWit with aggregated signatures and coinjoin could potentially achieve this goal. By using aggregated signatures in conjunction with coinjoin, all inputs of a coinjoin transaction would have a single signature, which would significantly decrease the size while preserving privacy. If the majority of transactions in a block did this, more transactions could fit into a block. However, they have a question about the extra blockspace made possible by SegWit - whether it is limited to only witness data or can it be used for transaction data such as the scenario described. In an email to bitcoin-dev, CANNON also asked about scaling and privacy enhancements. They suggested that combining segwit with aggregated signatures and coinjoin could accomplish this. Resources provided by Bryan include links to transcripts and articles on signature aggregation, scalability, Schnorr signatures, and secp256k1. The key to understanding how it works is to stop thinking in terms of a block size limit, but rather a block weight limit. A block must be less than 4 million weight, and there's no separate limits at all, so any saving in the witness space (e.g. through signature aggregation) is useful for both witness/non-witness data. One byte of witness data counts as one weight, whereas the rest counts for four weight. Therefore, any saving in the witness space is helpful for both types of data. The author provides their PGP fingerprint and email address for secure correspondence.</summary>
