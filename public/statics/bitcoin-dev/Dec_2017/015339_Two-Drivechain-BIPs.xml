    <summary>The Drivechain project has released its code on GitHub, which means it is no longer just a concept. Though there are still some unfinished items like M1 and M8_V2, this is an excellent time to take a look at the project. Interested developers can also check out the Drivechain website and the blank sidechain on GitHub. Furthermore, the project's documentation and BIP-Drafts are now readable and available on GitHub for review. The documents include Hashrate Escrow and Blind Merged Mining. The team has requested formal BIP numbers from Luke and asked for code reviews, which will be most helpful if conducted on GitHub. Anyone interested in Drivechain should read the updated FAQ and review earlier discussions on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
