    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dan Bryant, inquired about any developments towards a BIP for signing or verifying messages against SegWit addresses. This query was made on 08/12/17 at 19:25 and received a response from Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs. Pavol asked if Dan still intended to write this BIP. This inquiry is related to the development of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals that suggest new features or changes to the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
