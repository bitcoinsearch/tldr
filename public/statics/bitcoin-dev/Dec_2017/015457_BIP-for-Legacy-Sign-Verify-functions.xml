    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development team, Luke Dashjr, has criticized a proposal to enhance the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) by providing a reference point for new address schemes. The proposed scheme would allow for signature verification using a public key obtained from an address. However, Dashjr pointed out that this approach is not possible, as it is impossible to get a public key from an address. Instead, key recovery is performed using the signature and message to extract the public key of the signer, which is then hashed and compared to the address provided. Dashjr argues that new schemes should not be based on the current one.</summary>
