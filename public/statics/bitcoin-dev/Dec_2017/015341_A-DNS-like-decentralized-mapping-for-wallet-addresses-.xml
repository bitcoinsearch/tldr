    <summary>A new member of the bitcoin-dev community, Mandar Mulherkar, sent an email on November 30th, 2017 questioning the current state of wallet addresses and if there could be a more user-friendly option for mass adoption. He suggested a DNS-like decentralized mapping service that would provide users with a crypto address instead of long wallet addresses. In response, someone recommended looking into Namecoin or Blockstack as potential options. The author personally believed that Namecoin was technologically better. Additionally, the suggestion of using stealth addresses was put forth, but it was noted that more support for them in bitcoin wallets was necessary.</summary>
