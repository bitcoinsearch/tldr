    <summary>In an email conversation on December 5, 2017, Sjors Provoost and another individual were discussing the possibility of reusing sections of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) for other purposes. They agreed that not all BIPs would be suitable for this, but thought it was worth considering for some. One suggestion was to reuse a section of the payment request URI for multiple purposes, such as Confidential Transactions (CT). However, they also noted that any ignored flags would need to be clearly defined in the BIP in order to ensure proper behavior.</summary>
