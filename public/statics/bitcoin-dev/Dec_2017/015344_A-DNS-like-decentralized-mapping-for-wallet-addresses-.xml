    <summary>A user on the bitcoin-dev mailing list posed some questions regarding mass adoption of cryptocurrency, suggesting that a DNS-like decentralized mapping service could be used to provide users with a more user-friendly address format. Instead of long wallet addresses, this system would allow for human-readable addresses that can be easily converted to wallet addresses by the software. The user requested information on where to research this concept further. Another user in the thread recommended checking out the Open Alias project, which is based on DNS+DNSSEC and offers nice addresses for improved usability. The link to the Open Alias website was provided for further exploration.</summary>
