    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mandar Mulherkar, asked whether there could be a DNS-like decentralized mapping service to provide users with a user-friendly crypto address instead of long wallet addresses. This would allow for easier adoption, as users could simply type in a human-readable address that would be converted by their wallet software. Mulherkar requested further information on the topic. One responder suggested checking out Blockstack, which is working on a similar concept. The conversation ended with a reminder not to email any sensitive information that one would not feel comfortable sharing with the NSA.</summary>
