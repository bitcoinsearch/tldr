    <summary>Greg Maxwell has suggested the possibility of a header sync mechanism that would allow parallel download from multiple peers. The current getheaders/headers semantics require headers to be downloaded sequentially from genesis, making this proposal an improvement. In testing, it was found that syncing headers directly from a colocated node took less time than downloading them from other nodes. The idea of compressed headers stream was also discussed in the same thread.</summary>
