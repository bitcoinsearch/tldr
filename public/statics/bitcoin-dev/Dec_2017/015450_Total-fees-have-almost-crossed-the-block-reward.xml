    <summary>The long term security of blockchain is a concern post the block reward era. As fees replace block rewards, fees have risen to 45% from 10%, potentially reaching 50%. While this improves coin security in the long term, it restricts some use cases due to high transaction fees. Segwit adoption currently stands at around 10%. The mempool shows peak congestion and it remains to be seen if this is a cause for concern. These data points are interesting for further discussion.</summary>
