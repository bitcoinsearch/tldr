    <summary>In a Bitcoin Developer email thread, Damian Williamson proposed a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) called Use Transaction Weight For Ordering Transactions In Blocks (UTWFOTIB). However, there was concern raised by ZmnSCPxj over the proposal's reliance on the transaction pool. Since nodes may have different views of the transaction pool, it is impossible to validate if the next block size is correct for the current transaction pool. Moreover, Sleeping Beauty node that has been temporarily stopped would have no view of the consensus transaction pool during the time it was stopped. Therefore, ZmnSCPxj argued that consensus rules should restrict themselves to the characteristics of the block and transactions within the block and not depend on the transaction pool.</summary>
