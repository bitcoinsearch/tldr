    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing the possibility of a store-and-forward server that would allow users to trade some privacy for convenience. The proposed solution, like BIP75, would allow users to use an email address as their account instead of a single Bitcoin address or xpubkey. While some members of the community see the addition of DNS as a potential security risk, others find it an interesting draft that could be turned into something useful and leveraged with BIP32 to allow payment requests to be generated that automatically pointed payees to the correct branch. Combining this with BIP-47 could associate payment codes with email via DNS.</summary>
