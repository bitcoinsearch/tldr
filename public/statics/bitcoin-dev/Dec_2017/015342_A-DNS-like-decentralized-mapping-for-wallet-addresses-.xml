    <summary>In an email sent on 12/01/2017 at 03:15 AM, Lucas Clemente Vella via bitcoin-dev expressed that a certain feature did not catch on. It was noted that this feature is still operational and works well. The author of the email also mentioned namecoin, which he believes has great potential but has not yet been widely adopted. The author expressed hope for major bitcoin wallets to include support for name to data mapping using namecoin.</summary>
