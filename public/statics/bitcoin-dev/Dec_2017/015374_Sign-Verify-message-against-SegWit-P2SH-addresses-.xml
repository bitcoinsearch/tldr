    <summary>In the Bitcoin community, there is a discussion about whether or not to create a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for Sign/Verify message against a SegWit address. Although there are some posts and an issue opened about it on GitHub, it seems that no one is currently working on creating the BIP. The feature is not in wide use, but it could still serve an important purpose, such as when proof of assets are requested. The conversation around this topic can be found on the GitHub issue #10542. It is unclear if the proposal will gain enough support to move forward, but it is clear that there are individuals in the community who see value in having this feature available. It remains to be seen whether or not a BIP will be created for Sign/Verify message against a SegWit address in the future.</summary>
