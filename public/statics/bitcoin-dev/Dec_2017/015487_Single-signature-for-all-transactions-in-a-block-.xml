    <summary>In an email to bitcoin-dev, CANNON asked about scaling and privacy enhancements. They suggested that combining segwit with aggregated signatures and coinjoin could accomplish this. The idea is to use aggregated signatures with coinjoin so that all inputs of a coinjoin transaction would have a single signature, greatly reducing size while preserving privacy. If the majority of transactions in a block did this, more transactions could fit into a block. Resources provided by Bryan include links to transcripts and articles on signature aggregation, scalability, Schnorr signatures, and secp256k1.</summary>
