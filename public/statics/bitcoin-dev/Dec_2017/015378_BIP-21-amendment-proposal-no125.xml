    <summary>In a recent bitcoin-dev post, Sjors Provoost discussed his pull request for RBF to be turned on by default, which sparked some discussion. To accommodate merchants who are wary of their customers using RBF, Matt Corallo suggested that wallets honor a no125=1 flag. This flag would prevent wallets from using RBF unless the user overrides the merchant's preference. However, Luke Dashjr and Peter Todd objected to this proposal, stating that there is no reason to avoid the RBF flag and that it doesn't reduce risk or prevent double spending. They also noted that many miners allow RBF regardless of the flag and that malicious double spending doesn't benefit much from RBF.</summary>
