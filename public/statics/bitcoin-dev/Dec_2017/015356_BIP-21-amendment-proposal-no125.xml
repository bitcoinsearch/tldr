    <summary>Sjors Provoost had submitted a pull request to turn on RBF by default, which led to discussions. To ease the transition for merchants who are reluctant to see their customers use RBF, Matt Corallo suggested that wallets honor a no125=1 flag. The BIP-21 URI would include this flag to indicate that wallets should not use RBF unless explicitly overridden by the user. However, Luke Jr. argued that there is no reason to avoid the RBF flag as it does not reduce risk or prevent double spending. Additionally, Luke Jr. suggested adding a bech32 param, which sparked another discussion.</summary>
