    <summary>In a recent message to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a new member suggested the creation of a DNS-like decentralized mapping service for cryptocurrency addresses. The idea is that instead of providing a long string or QR code that requires an app, users could simply type in a human-readable address and have it converted to a wallet address by the software. The original altcoin, Namecoin, attempted to build a blockchain-based decentralized DNS system similar to what the user is proposing, but it did not gain widespread adoption. However, Namecoin may still be the most logical choice for a name registry database. The user asked for guidance on where to research this concept further.</summary>
