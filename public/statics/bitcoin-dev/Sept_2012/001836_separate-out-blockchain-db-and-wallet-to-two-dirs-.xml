    <summary>In an email conversation between Wladimir and Jeff Garzik on September 14, 2012, it was discussed that having multiple wallets within one 'environment' is not currently feasible due to limitations with BerkelyDB. The databases are all located within one directory and the ability to have multiple wallets or a wallet in the block chain in separate directories will be possible with the introduction of LevelDB and a custom format for the wallets. This is a frequently requested feature and is a database constraint at the moment.</summary>
