    <title>Segmented Block Relaying BIP draft.</title>

    <summary>In an email sent by Matthew Mitchell on September 10, 2012, he shared a draft proposal for improving block relaying and validation in Bitcoin. The proposal aims to enable parallel processing and eliminate redundancy in the process. Mitchell explains that this becomes more beneficial as blocks sizes increase. The proposal can be accessed via a link provided in the email. However, there is a question raised regarding the need to send the hash tree. The sender wonders why sending the block header, transaction list, and transactions not already known by a node, which is often just the coinbase, is not enough.</summary>
