    <summary>In this context, Michael is suggested by Thiago to make Libcoin the official Bitcoin. Thiago also shares a link regarding the same idea. Martinx asks Michael if he could release a new version of Libcoin similar to the mainline Bitcoin without any additional code or changes in stdout/stderr messages and how much it would cost. Thiago mentions that he needs to run the "blockchain side" as Linux user called "blockchain" and each regular Linux user will have its own wallet.dat file (without the blockchain).</summary>
