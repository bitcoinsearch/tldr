    <summary>In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Gregory Maxwell on 9/23/12, Garzik mentioned that a deterministic lifetime for transactions (TX) could be provided to initiate recovery procedures and revise the transaction once it disappears 144 blocks or 24 hours after transmission. This helps prevent zombie TXs from lingering around without confirmation, thereby saving resources. However, Maxwell questioned if the chain could enforce this number, and why clients can't delete transactions that don't follow current chain rules. He explained that there are bursts of weird transactions flooding the network, and some miners are intentionally excluding them.</summary>
