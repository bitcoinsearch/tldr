    <summary>In a forum post on September 26th, 2012, Wladimir proposed creating a page on bitcoin.org that would link to a wiki page of developer resources. He acknowledged the potential for disagreement about what should be included on the site, but suggested being pragmatic. By creating a separate page for developers, there would be an easy link from the main site while still allowing for editable and expandable content.</summary>
