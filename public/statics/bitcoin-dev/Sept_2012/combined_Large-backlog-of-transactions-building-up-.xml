    <summary>In the provided context, there is a discussion around the issue of mempool size. Jeff Garzik and another individual discussed the disconnect between what miners mine and what relayers relay, which can cause clutter in the mempool over time. There are bursts of weird transactions flooding the network, and some miners are intentionally excluding them. The suggestion was made for an archive-mempool that is only checked when an orphan transaction is received. However, there is concern that being more aggressive can turn otherwise valid transactions into orphans.The author of the post is seeking information about long term logs containing pool size and timestamps. They forgot to enable timestamps in their nodes' logs but have noticed an increase in the number of pending transactions not cleared into blocks. One of their nodes has 4000 transactions in the mempool, and only a few hundred are being cleared in blocks despite current transaction rates being around 300 per ten minute interval.Jeff Garzik argues that all mempool implementations should limit the lifetime of any transaction to a specific number of blocks to prevent zombie transactions from littering memory as they hang around without getting confirmed. He suggests writing a patch and coming up with a good number that the network can agree upon. Gregory Maxwell questions if the chain could enforce this number and why clients can't delete transactions that don't follow current chain rules.In another discussion, it is clarified that nodes repeat wallet transactions and any previous transactions not yet included in the chain. Bitcoinj clients do not repeat transactions in the same way as nodes. Overall, there are ongoing discussions surrounding the management of the mempool and the need for a deterministic lifetime for transactions to prevent resource waste.The discussion between Jorge Timón, Jeff Garzik, and Gregory Maxwell revolves around transactions that are not yet in the blockchain. Garzik suggested a deterministic lifetime for transactions to prevent zombie transactions from wasting resources without getting confirmed. However, Timón questioned if the chain could enforce this number and why clients couldn't delete these transactions.Maxwell explained that miners exclude bursts of weird transactions intentionally, and double-spending transactions are not stored, creating huge chains. These transactions depend on their parent, which is dropped due to rule violations. As a result, the software keeps them around as orphans until their parent arrives. Maxwell suggested maintaining a cache of rejected transaction IDs to consult for orphan transactions' parents, but it would need to be dropped during reorgs. This would help prevent zombie transactions and save resources.However, there are still questions about whether the chain can enforce the deterministic lifetime for transactions and why clients can't delete transactions that don't follow current chain rules. Despite these concerns, there is agreement among the participants that a solution is needed to manage pending transactions and prevent resource waste.</summary>
