    <summary>The discussion is about testing and the tools used for it in the context of Bitcoin development. Jenkins and pull-tester are both being used to run a set of scripts available on TheBlueMatt/test-scripts repository. The poster doesn't care about using Jenkins but suggests keeping all the tests in one place. In another email, Steve discusses his experience with test-driven development and requirements management. He intends to leave Bettermeans behind and develop rudimentary requirement sets, basic requirement tracking, and tests. The focus is on ensuring new stuff doesn't break old (e.g., losing a wallet) and evaluating the best workflow process. Steve is looking for help or reviews from interested parties, even if it's just encouragement.</summary>
