    <summary>In this email conversation, Jorge Tim√≥n expresses his interest in transitive/multi-hop transactions with colored coins and raises a question regarding the impossibility of signing input scripts. Jeff Garzik responds to his query by stating that a new SIGHASH_* type is needed to achieve what they want. Garzik then poses a problem he is trying to solve with pybond- atomic transfer of coins between two parties with approval from both parties. He asks whether it is possible within the current bitcoin system. The answer seems to be no, but it can be made possible with a new SIGHASH_* type.</summary>
