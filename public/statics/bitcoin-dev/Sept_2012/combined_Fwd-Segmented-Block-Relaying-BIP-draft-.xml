    <summary>In September 2012, Gregory Maxwell and Matthew Mitchell exchanged emails discussing a new proposal for Segmented Block Relaying which utilized a merkle tree structure. Mitchell explained that the level of the merkle tree with the hashes for the segments could be retrieved using "gettreelevel" and "treelevel." By specifying a deep level, one could request all transaction hashes. The proposal could be modified by removing the "level" byte in "gettreelevel" and always sending the deepest level, thus allowing users to only download the necessary hashes to verify each segment.Maxwell responded to this suggestion by stating that sending the hash tree was unnecessary and that the block header, transaction list, and transactions not already known to a node were sufficient. The proposal would have allowed for more efficient verification of blockchain segments by only requesting necessary hashes. However, Maxwell's response suggested that the proposal may not have been necessary or practical in practice.</summary>
