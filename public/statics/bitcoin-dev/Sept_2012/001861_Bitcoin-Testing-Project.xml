    <summary>The discussion is about the use of two separate tools: Jenkins, a continuous integration system used to run tests for every commit and pull request on GitHub, which is also an issue tracker. The consensus is that new issues should only be reported on GitHub unless it's security-related, in which case an email should be sent to the core developers directly. Developers are responsible for ensuring regression tests for bugs they fix make it into the unit tests or functional test repository, while QA should hold them accountable for it. The other thing being discussed is coordinated release testing, which cannot be automated but aims to pick up on things that testing suites missed. Any discovered issues should be reported on GitHub since it's the final repository of issues that hold up Gavin from doing a release. Steve's concern is that Git is too developer-centric to be useful for organizing testing, as he needs a QA environment conducive to testing and different tools and methodologies. He emphasizes the importance of linking bugs, requirements, fixes, retests, and updating of regression test plans, as well as the ability to organize testing campaigns and assign work units and relevant documents/scripts/ideas.</summary>
