    <summary>In an email, Steve expresses his desire to leave Bettermeans behind and focus on test driven development with a strong background in requirements management and automation. Steve has been developing rudimentary requirements set, basic requirement tracking, and tests to prove/stress the requirements. He installed various open-source applications such as Mantis, SalomeTMF, and Bugzilla and is currently evaluating the best workflow process. He wants to get release/acceptance tests done that primarily focus on new stuff not breaking old and needs no special requirements. Steve is finalizing the workflow flow diagrams and they should be ready for inspection soon. He is looking for people who are interested in helping him out with all this. Anyone interested in helping out/reviewing processes can drop him an email.</summary>
