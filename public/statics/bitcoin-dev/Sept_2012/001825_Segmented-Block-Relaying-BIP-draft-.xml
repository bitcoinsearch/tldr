    <summary>In an email exchange in 2012, Matthew Mitchell proposed a solution to requesting transactions for a blockchain network. Mitchell's proposal suggested taking full advantage of the merkle tree structure and skipping transactions that have already been received. He claimed that his proposal was better than others because it was simple to implement. He argued that getting hashes at a particular level of a merkle tree and placing selected transactions from a block into a message were not hard to do. However, he acknowledged that determining the best level of segmentation would be more challenging. In response, Gregory expressed confusion about the value of using the tree level and questioned why ranges from the lowest level could not be used instead.</summary>
