    <summary>On September 25, 2012, Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo discussed the usefulness of pulltester and Jenkins, stating that they both run the same set of scripts. He suggested keeping them and improving them if needed. He also proposed creating a page that links all the developer resources for Bitcoin development, including information on checking out the source code, contribution guidelines, where to ask development problems, and which bugs to solve first. Corallo was willing to write this proposed page but acknowledged that it may spark discussion about what should be included on bitcoin.org.</summary>
