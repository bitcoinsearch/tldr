    <summary>In an email conversation in 2012, Matt Corallo discussed the idea of segmenting blocks, stating that it would add little to nothing with any sane block size. He did concede that if a block were to be 10GB, then it may make sense to segment it. However, he also noted that there is a hard protocol limit of 1MB and that removing the cap would compromise the core economic promises of the system as well as the long-term security of the network. Furthermore, removing the cap would require a complete and incompatible hardfork, which would allow for changes to be made to the protocol. Corallo argued that changing how blocks are fetched is almost incidental to the number of other things that would be changed, and that it doesn't make sense to design for that. Instead, he believes that something far simpler is prudent for the design of Bitcoin.</summary>
