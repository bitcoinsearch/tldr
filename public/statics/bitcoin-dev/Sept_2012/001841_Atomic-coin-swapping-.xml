    <summary>In the context provided, it is explained why signing input scripts would make it impossible to construct a transaction. This is because signatures cannot sign themselves and including scriptSigs in the signed data would cause the newly calculated signature for one input to break the signatures for all others. Therefore, it is not possible to sign input scripts along with the rest of the transaction data.</summary>
