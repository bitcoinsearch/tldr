    <summary>In an email thread from September 14, 2012, grarpamp suggests creating a feature ticket to address the problem of sysadmin when it comes to blockchain. He advises against hardcoding paths and suggests that all paths should be specifiable in bitcoin's config file, with the location itself specifiable on the command line. In response, Peter Vessenes agrees with the idea and suggests that the blockchain should go in /var/lib/bitcoin by default. He notes that he is not a formal sysadmin but a longtime Linux guy. The email thread concludes with Peter's contact information as CEO of CoinLab.</summary>
