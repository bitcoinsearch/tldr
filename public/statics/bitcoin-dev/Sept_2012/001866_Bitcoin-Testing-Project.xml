    <summary>The Bitcoin project uses Jenkins to run test scripts after every new commit. The team believes that automated tests are essential and the only way to ensure that important tests are run. Additionally, automated tests are necessary to catch platform interactions. While there is documentation on testing, it is not comprehensive or simple for people interested in manual testing to follow. The lack of code coverage from current tests is concerning, and the team acknowledges that more needs to be done in this area. However, meta discussions without substance are not helpful at this time. The team encourages anyone who wants to help to work on what interests them and report their progress back to the group. If someone wants a list of suggested testing methods, they should reach out to Matt Corallo off-list.</summary>
