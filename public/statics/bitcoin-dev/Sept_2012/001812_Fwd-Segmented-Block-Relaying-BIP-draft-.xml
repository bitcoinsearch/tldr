    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Matthew Mitchell in September 2012, the two discussed a new proposal for Segmented Block Relaying using a merkle tree structure. Mitchell explains that by using "gettreelevel" and "treelevel," one can retrieve the level of the merkle tree with the hashes for the segments needed to be downloaded. One could request all transaction hashes by specifying a very deep level. The proposal could be modified by removing the "level" byte in "gettreelevel" and always sending the deepest level (i.e., the transaction hashes). By specifying the level, users would only need to download the hashes necessary to verify each segment. In response, Maxwell suggested that sending the hash tree was unnecessary and that the block header, transaction list, and transactions not already known to a node were enough.</summary>
