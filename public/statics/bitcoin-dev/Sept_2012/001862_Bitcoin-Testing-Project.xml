    <summary>In an email conversation between Mark Friedenbach and Jeff Garzik, they discussed the importance of developers creating regression tests for bugs they fix. While both agreed that it was important for developers to take responsibility for this, Garzik noted that the finite resources available to developers would make it difficult to achieve this goal for certain types of bugs such as P2P network interaction or RPC API bugs. These bugs require extensive testing which could involve many days or weeks of coding just to simulate the environment. Despite this, Garzik suggested moving towards this direction but also acknowledged the need for good QA coders to help automate complicated testing like simulating a P2P environment and checking the RPC API.</summary>
