    <summary>In a forum post on Bitcointalk, Jeff Garzik mentions colored coins and their potential use in distributed bonds. He is working on solving a problem where Alice transfers a 1-satoshi colored coin to Bob, who then transfers 100 BTC to Alice. These steps must happen as an atomic unit, with both parties approving the transfer through appropriate signatures. Garzik wonders if this is possible within the current bitcoin system and suggests that it may require a new SIGHASH_* type. Colored coins are further explained in a link provided by Garzik, and he references another link discussing distributed bonds. He also mentions pybond, which he is currently pursuing to address this issue.</summary>
