    <summary>Bitcoin has released a new version 0.7.0, which is recommended for those running an older version to upgrade. The bugs should be reported using the issue tracker at GitHub. The source code for the project can also be found on GitHub and source-only tarballs/zipballs can be downloaded from there as well. Ubuntu Linux users can use a "Personal Package Archive" (PPA) to keep Bitcoin up-to-date.To upgrade an older version of Bitcoin, shut it down and wait until it has completely shut down before installing the new version. Incompatible changes include the replacement of 'getmemorypool' RPC command with 'getblocktemplate/submitblock' and 'getrawmempool' commands, and the removal of deprecated RPC 'getblocknumber'. Several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals have been implemented, including BIP 22, BIP 34, and BIP 35. Improvements have been made to core Bitcoin handling and blockchain database, JSON-RPC API, P2P networking, and Qt GUI. Internal codebase also includes additional unit tests and compile warning fixes.This release of Bitcoin was made possible by contributions from several individuals, including Chris Moore, Gavin Andresen, Gregory Maxwell, Jeff Garzik, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. Denial-of-service vulnerabilities were reported by Sergio Lerner.</summary>
