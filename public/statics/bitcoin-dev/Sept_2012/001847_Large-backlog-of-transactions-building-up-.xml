    <summary>In the context provided, it is mentioned that nodes repeat wallet transactions and any previous transactions that are not yet included in the chain. This can be seen in CWalletTx::RelayWalletTransaction. It is clarified that there should not be an issue with nodes repeating their own transactions but not the unconfirmed parents.Additionally, it is noted that Bitcoinj clients do not repeat transactions in the same way as nodes. Instead, they simply announce their own transactions.</summary>
