    <summary>The conversation revolves around the importance of testing in software development. While there are test cases that can be automated through Jenkins, there are also tests that cannot be automated such as checking if the GUI looks okay on all platforms supported. The team is doing well with automated functional test cases but is failing to ensure that the software runs on all platforms before the final release. This is where a QA team can add value.Steve suggests using a release acceptance test plan that could be a step-by-step checklist on a wiki page, Google Doc, or Dropbox shared folder. Gavin Andresen participated in the conversation.</summary>
