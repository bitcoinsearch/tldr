    <summary>A Debian user has suggested moving the &gt; 2 GB db to $HOME/.cache/bitcoin and leaving the wallet and other config files in $HOME/.bitcoin. This would allow backups to skip the .cache directory and follow the freedesktop.org XDG Base Directory Specification. Personal info/settings would stay in .bitcoin/ and everything that can be rebuilt would go to .cache/bitcoin/. The proposal has been made for consideration and feedback from the Bitcoin community.</summary>
