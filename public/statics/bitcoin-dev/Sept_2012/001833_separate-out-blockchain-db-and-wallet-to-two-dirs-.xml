    <summary>The idea of placing the blockchain in /var/lib/bitcoin by default is suggested by a longtime Linux user, although they admit they are not a formal sysadmin. However, bitcoin does not allow easy separation of the files without detachdb, which is off by default. Additionally, there is no user agnostic system daemon provided to process blocks separately from user wallet operations. As a result, until then, it is suggested that the blockchain remain split up somewhere under .bitcoin rather than in /var or anywhere else.</summary>
