    <summary>The author of this post is seeking information about long term longs that contain the pool size and timestamps. They forgot to enable timestamps in their own nodes' logs, which they believe may have a privacy benefit but has resulted in difficulty tracking the trend of pending transactions. The author has noticed an increase in the number of pending transactions that are not being cleared into blocks, with one of their nodes holding 4000 transactions in the mempool. Despite current transaction rates being around 300 per ten minute interval, only a few hundred are being cleared in blocks. The author is curious about why the other pending transactions are not getting drained out of the mempool.</summary>
