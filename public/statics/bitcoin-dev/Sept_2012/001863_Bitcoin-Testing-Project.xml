    <summary>In this message, a discussion between Mark Friedenbach and Steve is taking place regarding adding QA processes to the existing workflow. Steve suggests that open source software lacks integration of test cases, generating test plans, and linking them to requirements, which works with Git. He thinks that QA needs more than just an issue tracker, and they need software for workflow management, which could be easily integrated into Mantis or Bugzilla. Both Mantis and Bugzilla have two-way functionality with Git. Steve emphasizes the importance of linking bugs, requirements, fixes, retests, regression test plan updates, and organizing testing campaigns. He wants to develop a QA environment that is conducive to testing and will allow testers to shine in all their glory. The extra software required would be used by QA, and all the core development team would still use Git. Steve feels that developers should not do regression testing or any signoff testing on their own codes, and QA should hold them accountable for that. In case of coordinated release testing, discovered issues should be reported to Github, the final repository of issues that holds up Gavin from doing a release.</summary>
