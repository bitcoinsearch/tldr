    <summary>In September 2012, a discussion between Wladimir and Daniel F took place regarding the addition of a developer resources page to bitcoin.org. Wladimir expressed his willingness to write such a page but noted that it could lead to debates about what content should be included. Daniel F suggested that a page called bitcoin.org/developers be created, which would link to a wiki page with editable and expandable developer resources. It was agreed that adding a direct link to a developer resources page on the main site would make sense since the front page already had wiki links.</summary>
