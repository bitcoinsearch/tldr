    <summary>The author of the message regrets the lack of testing done for the 0.7 release and is looking to make improvements. They have a background in test-driven development and requirements management. The author is planning to leave bettermeans behind and is developing a rudimentary requirement set, basic requirement tracking, and tests to prove/stress the requirements. The next most important thing is to get release/acceptance tests done. The author is currently evaluating various open-source applications such as Mantis, SalomeTMF, Bugzilla, etc., and is finalizing workflow flow diagrams. They are seeking help from anyone interested in reviewing processes and providing encouragement.</summary>
