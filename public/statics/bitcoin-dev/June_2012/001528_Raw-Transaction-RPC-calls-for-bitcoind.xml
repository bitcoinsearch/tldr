    <summary>A pull request has been submitted for an API that implements low-level "raw" transactions and feedback is being sought on the API. The signrawtx method is the key new method; it takes a raw transaction, signs as many inputs as possible and returns the same raw transaction with signatures. The API is intended for people writing services on top of bitcoind rather than for command line usage. However, appropriate transaction fees should be included, or the sendrawtx method is likely to fail. The design doc, pull request and test plan are available at https://gist.github.com/2839617, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1456 and https://secure.bettermeans.com/projects/4180/wiki/Raw_Transaction_RPC_Test_Plan respectively. A list of all new RPC calls along with their help output and example use is also provided. These include listunspent [minconf=1] [maxconf=999999], getrawtx, createrawtx [["txid",n],...] {address:amount,...}, signrawtx  [,...] and sendrawtx.</summary>
