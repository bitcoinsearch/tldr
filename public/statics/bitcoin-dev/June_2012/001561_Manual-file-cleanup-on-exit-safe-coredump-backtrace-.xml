    <summary>The article discusses the issue of cleaning up files and directories when Bitcoin server exits cleanly or crashes. It is not safe to use 'rm -r' command to clean up the hierarchy, which includes database/, db.log, .lock, debug.log, addr.dat, and wallet.dat. Additionally, __db.* should also be added to the list in case bitcoind crashes. The article questions if there is an option available to flush/roll the above-mentioned files on exit so that they can be removed or ported. Regardless of the answer, bitcoind should not be dumping core. The article provides details about the version of Bitcoin v0.6.2.2-unk-beta () and the default data directory /.../.bitcoin. It also displays an EXCEPTION: 11DbException error caused by invalid arguments while opening a database. The error message suggests that it may be caused by moving a database from one database environment to another without clearing the database LSNs or by removing all of the log files from a database environment. Lastly, the article mentions a gdb backtrace command that shows information about the threads and functions.</summary>
