    <summary>The speaker in this context suggests having overloaded nodes respond with 50% fp rate filters as an option instead of disconnecting SPV clients when there aren't many full nodes available. However, they also state that bloom filter settings do not impact server-side load as the node still has to check every transaction against the filter regardless of its configuration. The question raised in the end is how to reduce load on a peer by negotiating different filter settings.</summary>
