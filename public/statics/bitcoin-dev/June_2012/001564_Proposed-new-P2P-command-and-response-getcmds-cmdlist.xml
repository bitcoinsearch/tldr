    <summary>The Bitcoin P2P protocol lacks a way to enumerate minor features or extensions, thus making it difficult to discover commands. Jeff Garzik proposed a simple extension which lists supported commands called getcmds and cmdlist. A pull request demonstrating this proposal can be found on GitHub. Another option is for verack to return this information at login, eliminating the need for a separate command/response. The idea of having "meta"-commands that alias to groups of commands was also suggested, such as "original" for the current core subset up to (and including) "pong". These aliases could exist in a text definition file held on GitHub or bitcoin.org.</summary>
