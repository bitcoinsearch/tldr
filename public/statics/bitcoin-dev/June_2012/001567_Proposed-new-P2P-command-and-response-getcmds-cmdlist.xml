    <summary>Wladimir, a contributor to Bitcoin development on Github, expressed his preference for a standardized "protocol version" instead of a capability-based system that explicitly lists all the possible combinations of interactions and constantly checks for specific feature support. He believes it can become too complex and fine-grained. Amir Taaki suggested an immediate introspection/command discovery in the first version exchange to avoid making assumptions on network operation. Taaki also likes the idea of a flat list of commands with "meta"-commands that alias to groups of commands. Jeff Garzik proposed a new P2P command and response for enumerating minor features or extensions in the Bitcoin P2P protocol, as the current version number increment is not self-documenting. The proposal adds a simple extension which lists supported commands and can be further improved by having verack return this information at login.</summary>
