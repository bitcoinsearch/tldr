    <summary>In an email exchange, Mike Hearn suggested moving away from BDB and replacing it with LevelDB. He argued that BDB was not ideal for Bitcoin usage due to its ties to a database environment and various other issues. Assuming LevelDB is an improvement in these areas, Mike said he supported the switch. However, Gavin Andresen had some concerns about LevelDB's relative obscurity, newness, minimalist build system, portability, testing, and compatibility guarantees. He suggested including the source code in the main Bitcoin tree and linking it statically for simplicity. Additionally, he asked if any other tweaks could be made to the DB format during the migration period. Pieter Wuille mentioned that Jeff was working on splitting the database into several files and he himself was working on the database/validation logic. Ideally, both changes would be included in a single release to minimize rebuilds. Finally, Pieter asked if they could see the code.</summary>
