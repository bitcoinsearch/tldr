    <summary>The writer notes that the approach Satoshi uses for storing transactions is sensible and already in use. However, scaling down to smaller devices poses a challenge due to the need to store all chain headers in RAM. While BitcoinJ avoids this issue, it creates more problems in other areas as it tries to avoid using a database engine which can be a cause of performance issues on older phones. The aim is to find a solution that works for both small and large devices without compromising on efficiency.</summary>
