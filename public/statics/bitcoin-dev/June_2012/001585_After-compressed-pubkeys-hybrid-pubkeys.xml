    <summary>In a message from 2012, Mike Hearn asked about the differences in format between three types of elliptic curve points. The formats are described as uncompressed, hybrid for even Y coords, and hybrid for odd Y coords. Pieter, who responded to the message, stated that the only difference between these formats is the first number. No further information was provided about the context or purpose of these elliptic curve points.</summary>
