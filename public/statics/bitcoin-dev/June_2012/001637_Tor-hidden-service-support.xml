    <summary>The Bitcoin Core team has merged Tor hidden service support in mainline, allowing users to run a hidden service bitcoin node and connect to other bitcoin hidden services via a Tor proxy. The feature is expected to be included in the 0.7 release. Each address in the fd87:d87e:eb43::/48 IPv6 range is mapped to an onion address and treated as belonging to a separate network. Other clients that wish to implement similar functionality can use the test case 5wyqrzbvrdsumnok.onion == FD87:D87E:EB43:edb1:8e4:3588:e546:35ca. The conversion is simply decoding the base32 onion address and storing the resulting 80 bits of data as low-order bits of an IPv6 address, prefixed by fd87:d87e:eb43:. This range is part of the RFC4193 Unique Local IPv6 range, which is normally not globally routable.</summary>
