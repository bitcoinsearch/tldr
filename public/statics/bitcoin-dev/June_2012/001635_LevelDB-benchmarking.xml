    <summary>The author of a GitHub repository, mikehearn/bitcoin, has added more commits to the codebase. However, it is not yet ready for a pull request, although it is closer to being so. Auto-migration is present but has not been well-tested with empty wallets. Migration progress UI is also available, and script execution is disabled during migration. The LevelDB source is checked into the main tree, and bitcoin-qt.pro updated to use it. Additionally, LevelDB is conditionally compiled, allowing it to be switched back to BDB if any unexpected issues or regression occurs on certain platforms. However, there are still some tasks left to do. More testing needs to be done, particularly with actual wallets. Non-Qt makefiles need to be updated, and on Windows, it is currently deactivated due to some missing files from leveldb and a lack of testing. The author asks for help with testing and makefile work. In another message, it is revealed that CTxDB::ReadOwnerTxes has never been used in the codebase, even in version 0.1.5. As a result, the author plans to delete the code when they next work on the patch.</summary>
