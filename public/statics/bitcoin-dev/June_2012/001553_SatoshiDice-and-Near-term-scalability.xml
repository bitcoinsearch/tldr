    <summary>The discussion revolves around the block size limit and its potential impact on the Bitcoin network. There are concerns regarding the exhaustion of the available block size despite thousands of transactions in the memory pool, leading to low priority transactions taking longer to confirm. The issue is exacerbated by SatoshiDice's ability to pay 0.0005 BTC fees and fill up the memory pool. It is suggested that prioritization needs to get smarter, or the average actual block size has to go up. Changing the block size limit is considered a hard fork measure, which requires a high level of community buy-in. Jeff Garzik raises the point that changing the block size limit is a "nuclear option" that will shut out older clients who will refuse to consider blocks larger than 1MB valid. Hard data indicating that SatoshiDice was shutting out the majority of other traffic is needed before any changes can be made. It is suggested that mainnet "normal tx" confirmation times be measured on a regular basis to quantify the situation.</summary>
