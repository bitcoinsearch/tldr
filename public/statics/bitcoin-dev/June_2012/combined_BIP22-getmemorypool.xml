    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, has expressed concerns about the complexity of the BIP22 standard for negotiating block generation. While he believes that having a stable and flexible API is important, he feels that too few people understand the details well enough to judge their necessity. Pieter suggests simplifying the standard to include only `getblocktemplate` and `submitblocktemplate`. The email thread dated June 11, 2012, involves a discussion about BIP 22, which is deemed overly complicated by the individuals involved. They express their desire to simplify it and invite feedback on key features that will likely be used by pool customers. One individual specifically mentions Electrum servers as users of these features. In addition, Pieter dislikes several ways of specifying the same behavior in the current BIP22 standard. He recommends picking one flexible way and discarding the others. Pieter questions why full transactions (serialized in hex) are sent in templates and submissions, suggesting that transferring txids may be sufficient. He also believes there are too many optional features in the standard, such as variations in coinbase outputs and noncerange limiting, making it unnecessarily complex for clients.Over the weekend, there were issues with the Sourceforge mailing list system causing Pieter's messages to appear multiple times in people's inboxes. The extra copies have since been deleted from the mailing list archives. Due to the mailing list not working properly, discussion shifted to the pull request on Github regarding BIP 22. Gavin Andresen and Pieter feel that it is overly complicated and would like to simplify it. Gavin is curious about which features will be commonly used by pool customers versus those that will only be used by a small percentage of them. He encourages discussion on the topic.In summary, Pieter suggests creating a new block template with several fields, including bits, previousblockhash, version, curtime, maxtimeoff, expires, sigoplimit, sizelimit, subsidy, coinbaseaux, coinbaseoutputs, and transactions. He also suggests submitting an object containing a hex serialized block header, hex serialized coinbase transaction, and a list of txids. Proof of work is checked last, so that error is only returned if there is no other problem with the suggested block.</summary>
