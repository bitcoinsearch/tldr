    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has proposed that hybrid public keys should be treated as 'non-standard' transactions. Hybrid public keys refer to those which combine compressed and uncompressed public keys. Although forbidding such transactions would make alternative implementation easier in the future, Andresen does not believe a network rule change is worth the hassle at this time. Instead, he suggests treating these transactions as non-standard by not relaying or mining them by default, but still accepting blocks that contain them. This approach would make it easier to implement a rule change in the future if necessary.</summary>
