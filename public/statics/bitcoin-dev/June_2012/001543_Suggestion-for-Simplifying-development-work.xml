    <summary>The CEO of CoinLab, Peter J. Vessenes, has been considering the possibility of wiping out the GUI from the satoshi client and reimplementing any necessary data requests as RPC calls. This would allow for forking -QT and other GUIs over, which could potentially simplify the codebase and speed up development. Peter is seeking input and thoughts on this idea from others in the community. He expresses a desire to find ways to help speed up development and believes that this change could be a big win.</summary>
