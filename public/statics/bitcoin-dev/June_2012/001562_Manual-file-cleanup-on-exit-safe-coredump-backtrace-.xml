    <summary>On June 15, 2012, a user named grarpamp raised a concern about the safety of cleaning up the blockchain hierarchy when bitcoind exits cleanly. In response to this, Pieter, another user suggested using the -detachdb argument if the user wants to detach the blockchain database files from the database environment at exit. However, Pieter mentioned that this feature was turned off by default in version 0.6.0 to speed up the shutdown process significantly and only a few people have a need to manually fiddle with their blockchain database files.</summary>
