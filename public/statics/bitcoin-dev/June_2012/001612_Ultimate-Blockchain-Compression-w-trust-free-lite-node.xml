    <summary>On June 19, 2012, Alan Reiner expressed his concern about an app developer who updated their RB tree code which caused a significant portion of the network to disagree on the correct root. This could potentially be disruptive and difficult to track down. Reiner emphasized the importance of good comprehensive tests and a well-specified algorithm in order to prevent similar issues from occurring. He likened worrying about implementers getting it wrong to worrying about them getting SHA256 wrong.Reiner suggested that a PATRICIA tree/trie would have been ideal for this situation due to its completely deterministic structure. He also noted that it is an order-of-magnitude more provable than libJudy trees.</summary>
