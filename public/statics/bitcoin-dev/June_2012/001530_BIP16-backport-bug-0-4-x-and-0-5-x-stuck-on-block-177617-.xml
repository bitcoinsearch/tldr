    <summary>A block with a P2SH redemption containing over 200 bytes was rejected by BIP16-enabled backports (0.4.x and 0.5.x), due to the enforcement of IsPushOnly, which also enforced the 200-byte "is standard" rule. This was not a problem in 0.6 because the original OP_EVAL commit moved the check outside of IsPushOnly. The issue could have been avoided if the semantics or behavior of IsPushOnly had changed significantly or if the OP_EVAL commit had been inspected in detail. To address this bug, 0.4.7 and 0.5.6 will be released within 24 hours, along with instructions on how to fix the issue. Users are instructed to ensure they have at least 1280 MB memory available, create a new file in their bitcoin directory called DB_CONFIG with two specific lines, start bitcoind or Bitcoin-Qt, wait at least six hours, and then delete the DB_CONFIG file and restart their client to use less memory.</summary>
