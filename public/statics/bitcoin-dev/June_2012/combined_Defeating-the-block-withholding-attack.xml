    <summary>In 2012, members of the Bitcoin community discussed the potential for an attack on mining pools that involves withholding valid blocks to harm a pool's profitability. The attacker gains "hurt the pool" benefit and some complicated forms can get "bonus" earnings out of the pool. However, the attacker does not lose out significantly. A proposed solution involves creating a scheme where miners can detect a qualifying hash to earn a share but cannot tell if the hash is for a valid block. This requires a major change to the block structure, which may not be justified at this point since attackers do not have direct monetary gain from this attack. Mike Koss asked Luke-Jr for clarification on how his proposal would work for decentralized pools, what the new block header would look like, what is required for a share to be earned, and what is required for a block to be valid. Koss suggested having a secret part of a block that is part of the merkle hash, which is not shared with the miners and is used in a secondary hash. However, this only works for centralized pools, which are contrary to the health of the Bitcoin network. Decentralized pools cannot have a secret. Peter Vessenes argued that waiting for real pain caused by these attacks is not wise, as it could result in a painful fork of the blockchain. Instead, he suggests planning for a solution 1-2 years in advance so users have time to upgrade before the problem becomes too severe. Finally, Vessenes notes that attackers could potentially hurt the pool's "luck factor" with this type of attack, while also spending the bitcoins earned to bribe users away from the targeted pool. In conclusion, the email exchanges revolve around technical aspects of mining cryptocurrency and the specific requirements for earning shares and validating blocks within the proposed system. Waiting until there is real pain will result in a painful fork; hence planning the fork 1-2 years out would allow people to upgrade on their own before it breaks. Attackers can hurt the pool's "luck factor" and spend the bitcoins they earn to bribe users away using this attack. While there are proposed solutions to the block withholding risk, it is unlikely that rule changes will gain enough acceptance among the greater Bitcoin community due to the harm centralized pools can cause to the network's security. Another proposed solution involves accepting blocks at a lower difficulty N if they are submitted with a candidate for the next block and SHA256(SHA256(NewBlockHash + NextBlockCandidateHash)) meets difficulty M. This algorithm should guarantee that every share has an equal chance of being a valid block at the time it is found, and attackers have no way to identify which shares to withhold even while they have full knowledge of the shares/blocks themselves. This solution creates a hard-fork in the blockchain, but since mining continues to use a double-SHA256 on a fixed 80 byte header, existing miners, FPGAs, etc should work unmodified. Poolservers will need to adapt significantly.</summary>
