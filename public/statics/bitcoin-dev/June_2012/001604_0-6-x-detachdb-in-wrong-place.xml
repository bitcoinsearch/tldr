    <summary>On June 18, 2012, grarpamp reported to Luke that he had been neglecting to update the stable repository with releases tagged in master. However, this issue was fixed by Luke's update. This update allowed git users to easily compare release tags to stable 'x' branches on gitorious. Before this update, Manuel diff of checkouts from each repo was required to do so. The work model used includes cloning the bitcoin repository and adding remote repositories such as stable and personal. By using "git fetch --all", users can update their copy of the remote branches and access them as "origin/master", "stable/0.6.x", etc. Personal branches can also be pushed using "git push personal".</summary>
