    <summary>In an email conversation, a user asks if the github/0.6.2 branch is safe for production, and it is stated that it is more widely used than other acceptably updated backports. The question is then asked about the degree of caution that should be taken when using github/master and its effects on wallets. The response is that while bugs have been present in master that can corrupt wallets or burn coin, the risk is not exceptionally great. Therefore, the user suggests not running master on wallets with large amounts of non-testnet coin, except for testing purposes, and having good backups that never touch the new code. The cautionary approach is magnified by the fact that there is currently not enough testing activity on master. The email notes that testnet exists so people can test without fear of losing funds, and that with the 0.7.0 (git master) testnet reboot, it should be more usable than it has been. It is suggested that anyone offering bitcoin services should set up parallel toy versions of their sites on testnet to bring more attention to their real services, get more testing done, show commitment to software quality, and take a more active role in advancing bitcoin development.</summary>
