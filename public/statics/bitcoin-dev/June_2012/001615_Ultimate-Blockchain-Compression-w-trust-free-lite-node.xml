    <summary>Alan Reiner suggests that a PATRICIA tree/trie would be ideal for the purpose as it has a completely deterministic structure and is more space-efficient than other options. However, he has been unable to find satisfactory implementations of this structure. PATRICIA Tries, also known as Radix trees, have worst-case O(k) complexity, where k is the number of bits in the key. The number of elements stored must be less than 2^k to avoid hash collisions, which would result in O(log N) complexity.</summary>
