    <summary>In a discussion thread, Mike Hearn and Matt were discussing the concept of bloom filter settings in relation to server-side load. Mike suggested that overloaded nodes could respond with 50% false positive rate filters instead of disconnecting SPV clients if there aren't many full nodes available. However, Matt disagreed and pointed out that the bloom filter settings have no impact on server-side load as a node still has to check every transaction against the filter regardless of how the filter is configured. Matt questioned how one could reduce load on a peer by negotiating different filter settings. Mike agreed with Matt's point and mentioned that he was mostly giving a reason why one may want to negotiate the filter settings in response to Matt's earlier question as to why it was done. They both agreed that as long as there are sane limits, filter negotiation largely isn't worth it. It also prevents any floats from appearing in the p2p protocol, though in either case, it shouldn't be able to cause issues.</summary>
