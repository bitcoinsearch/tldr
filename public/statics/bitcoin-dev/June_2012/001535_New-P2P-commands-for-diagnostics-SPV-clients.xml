    <summary>The reason why the combination of bloom filters and SPV clients is not used is because it allows the node using the bloom filter to scan transactions and choose how much effort it wants to put into each transaction on behalf of the SPV client. However, in order for this to work, a negotiation protocol would need to be specified. Despite this potential solution, it may still be too heavy for nodes and could result in overloading. In such cases, the node could simply disconnect intensive peers or refuse new connections.</summary>
