    <summary>Over the weekend, there were issues with the Sourceforge mailing list system causing Pieter's messages to appear multiple times in people's inboxes. The extra copies have since been deleted from the mailing list archives. Due to the mailing list not working properly, discussion shifted to the pull request on Github regarding BIP 22. Gavin Andresen and Pieter feel that it is overly complicated and would like to simplify it. Gavin is curious about which features will be commonly used by pool customers versus those that will only be used by a small percentage of them. He encourages discussion on the topic.</summary>
