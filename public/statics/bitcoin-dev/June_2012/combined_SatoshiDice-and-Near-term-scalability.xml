    <summary>The email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Stefan Thomas on June 15, 2012, focused on the potential of changing the block size limit for Bitcoin. Garzik noted that any increase in block size would require a high level of community buy-in because it would shut out older clients who refuse to consider blocks larger than 1MB as valid. The possibility of the block size limit increasing in the short term is low because it is considered a "nuclear option." Garzik requested good, hard data indicating whether SatoshiDice was shutting out the majority of other network traffic, before making any changes. Joseph, the owner of SatoshiDice, was willing to cooperate and not harm the Bitcoin network. It was suggested that if bitcoinj can be fixed to have smarter fee codes, Joseph may stop attaching small fees to every transaction. The issue of SatoshiDice and its impact on the scalability of Bitcoin has been raised by Jeff Garzik. A hard fork would require significant community buy-in, as it would exclude older clients. Data showing whether SatoshiDice was shutting out other traffic was requested, but no such data was presented. Jonathan Warren measures mainnet confirmation times regularly. He posted a chart of transaction confirmation times from June 2012 on bitcoinstats.org. Before "fairly recently," fee-paying transactions did not take as long to confirm. Jeff Garzik asked if anyone measured mainnet "normal tx" confirmation times on a regular basis and if there was any other hard data available. In conclusion, the discussions revolved around the block size limit and its potential impact on the Bitcoin network. The concern was that the exhaustion of the available block size despite thousands of transactions in the memory pool could lead to low priority transactions taking longer to confirm. The issue was exacerbated by SatoshiDice's ability to pay 0.0005 BTC fees and fill up the memory pool. It was suggested that prioritization needed to get smarter, or the average actual block size had to go up. Changing the block size limit was considered a hard fork measure, which required significant community buy-in. Hard data indicating that SatoshiDice was shutting out the majority of other traffic was needed before any changes could be made.</summary>
