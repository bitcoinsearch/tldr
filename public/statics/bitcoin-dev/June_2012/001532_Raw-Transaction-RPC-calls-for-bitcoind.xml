    <summary>On June 14th, 2012, Peter Vessenes sent an email to Gavin Andresen requesting a feature that would allow private keys to be provided at the command line with the signature in order to turn the client into a wallet-less signature machine. Andresen liked the idea and suggested that a third argument could be added to support an array of private keys, assuming that the semantics were followed. The third argument would allow the client to sign using only the private key(s) given and ignore the bitcoind wallet entirely. Additionally, the private keys would stay in bitcoind memory only for the duration of the RPC call.</summary>
