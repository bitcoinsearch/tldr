    <summary>On June 15, 2012, Peter Vessenes asked if it would be possible to remove the GUI from the Satoshi client and reimplement data requests as RPC calls. This would enable forking QT and other GUIs and simplify the codebase. The splitting of the UI into a separate process is a long-term goal, but the current RPC calls are not sufficient to implement a full-featured, responsive UI. JSON-RPC does not support bidirectional communication without ugly hacks. Wladimir questioned the need to split the project, stating that the UI is one of the drivers for requirements on the core, and it should remain a first-class citizen.</summary>
