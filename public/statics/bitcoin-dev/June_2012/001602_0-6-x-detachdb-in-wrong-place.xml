    <summary>The context is about workflow and release windows in master. The writer had not realized that there were release windows in master and thought it was more like a typical full-time dev process. This explains the presence of all the release tags in the GitHub repo and the presence of GitHub/0.6.2 as the path to Gitorious/0.6.x. The last bug fix after release is also agreed upon as an import/maintain model, which would be similar in solo repo. The stable repository has not been updated with releases tagged in master, but this has now been fixed, making it easier for Git users to compare release tags to stable 'x' branches on Gitorious. The writer does not know how to do this across repositories yet, except for manually diffing checkouts from each, which was necessary before the update. The declaration of defunctness also helps sort things out. The writer will track GitHub/master (edge) and Gitorious/0.bigN(eg: 6).x (stable) against Gitorious/bigTagRelease (latest public) for their works. They thank the team and Luke and hope that others with similar questions find this thread. Apologies are given for subverting the subject.</summary>
