    <summary>In an email thread from June 2012, Jeff Garzik raised a concern regarding the scalability of Bitcoin in relation to the popular gambling site, SatoshiDice. He suggested that a hard fork should only be considered if there was evidence that SatoshiDice was preventing other traffic. To support his suggestion, he asked if anyone measured the confirmation times for "normal tx" on the mainnet regularly. In response to this, Jonathan Warren replied with a graph showing the confirmation times for transactions on the mainnet. He noted that, before recently, fee-paying transactions never took as long as they did at the time of his post. The thread ended with no indication that any action was taken.</summary>
