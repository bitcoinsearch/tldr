    <summary>A discussion on block propagation times is taking place on a Bitcoin forum post. According to the post, the regular network consistently lags behind p2pool in propagating new blocks by 0-60 seconds.

Additionally, Lukes preview functionality is seen as a useful tool in this regard.</summary>
