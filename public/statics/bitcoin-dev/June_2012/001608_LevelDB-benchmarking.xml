    <summary>In this message, Gavin Andresen is seeking decisions from his colleagues on issues related to the Bitcoin network. They discuss whether or not they should switch to LevelDB as a replacement for bdb. They agree that if LevelDB solves the issue of DB_RUNRECOVERY errors and has a better API with fast performance, then they should switch. Next, they discuss LevelDB's minimalist build system, infrastructure, and compatibility with different operating systems. While it is new, they find it easy to compile, but lack of infrastructure may be an issue. They suggest checking the source into the main Bitcoin tree and linking it statically. Finally, they discuss tweaks to the database schema during migration, such as supporting tens of thousands of separate wallets and Pieter's ultra-pruning. Overall, they seem to be exploring the potential benefits and drawbacks of switching to LevelDB.</summary>
