    <title>Ultimate Blockchain Compression w/ trust-free lite nodes</title>

    <summary>In a forum post on bitcointalk.org, Alan proposed the use of a special tree data structure to organize all unspent-TxOuts on the network and communicate its "signature" between nodes, which could be implemented without disrupting the main network. The leaves of this tree correspond to addresses/scripts, and the data at the leaf is a root of the unspent-TxOut list for that address/script. To maintain security of the tree signatures, it will be included in the header of an alternate blockchain, which will be secured by merged mining. This provides the same compression as the simpler unspent-TxOut merkle tree. Nodes can download just the unspent-TxOut list for each address in their wallet and verify that list directly against the blockheaders. Therefore, lightweight nodes can get full address information from any untrusted peer with only a few kB of downloaded data.</summary>
