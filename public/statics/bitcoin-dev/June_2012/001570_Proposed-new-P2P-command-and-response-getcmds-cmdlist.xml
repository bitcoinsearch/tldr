    <summary>Wladimir, a contributor to GitHub issue, expresses his opinion on having a standardized "protocol version" rather than a capability-based system. He believes that capability-based systems become overly complex, whereas a version number provides clear information about supported capabilities. Wladimir suggests that it may be necessary to distinguish between different types of nodes, but it is not necessary to make it too fine-grained in nearly stateless protocols like Bitcoin. Andy agrees with Wladimir's idea of a capabilities command, as the ecosystem continues to expand, and thin clients connect to the network. Thin clients will need to ensure they are connected to at least one non-thin client.</summary>
