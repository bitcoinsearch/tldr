    <summary>The writer is suggesting a new format for distributing blocks in the blockchain network. Instead of using invgetdatablock, they propose using invgetdatamerkleblock which includes a merkle block structure comprising header, list of transactions, and merkle branches linking them to the root. This would optimize bandwidth since nodes wouldn't have to re-transmit transactions already seen in the mempool.The new command to download the contents of the mempool on startup makes it possible to propagate blocks across the network faster since download time is removed from the process. Additionally, the signature cache ensures verification is done efficiently. The implementation of this proposal could help reduce orphan blocks and spurious chain splits.The writer asks if Jeff has plans to implement any of these ideas, as they believe there is an opportunity to solve multiple problems at once.</summary>
