    <summary>The discussion is about the possibility of shipping pruned chains in a deterministic process to produce archival chains. The person suggests that pruning should be deterministic and proposes a method of downloading a binary containing pre-indexed and pruned chain up to a certain block, deleting data files, running with "-syncto=180000 -prune" and checking the hashes of the newly created files against what was downloaded. This method does not require additional effort and can be verified through a cron job. However, it is necessary for someone to verify that the binaries match the source, as otherwise the software could do anything without anyone knowing.</summary>
