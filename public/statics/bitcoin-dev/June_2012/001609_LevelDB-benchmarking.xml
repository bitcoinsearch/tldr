    <summary>The problem Bitcoin is facing is that block verification and propagation are too slow due to the CPU and IO intensive processes. This issue can be resolved by making the existing nodes faster as it buys more time before multi-machine nodes will be required. This solution does not replace moving users to SPV clients. The robustness of LevelDB is uncertain, but it has an API call to try and repair the database and it was refactored from BigTable for usage in Chrome, making it portable across Mac, Windows, and Linux. However, the lack of infrastructure due to its newness poses a concern regarding reworking bitcointools to read the LevelDB Blockchain, but there are Python bindings available for LevelDB.</summary>
