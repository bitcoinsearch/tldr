    <summary>The article discusses the challenges of storing transactions on smaller devices, particularly the need to store all chain headers in RAM. The developer of Armory's blockchain utilities is seeking ways to maintain a multi-terabyte blockchain without overwhelming available RAM. One solution proposed by the developer is to store all transactions as 10-byte "file-references," which are stored in a multimap indexed by the first 6 bytes of the tx-hash. However, if there are a billion transactions in the blockchain, each node would require approximately 48 GB of RAM to track all the data. The developer is open to hearing serious proposals on how to handle this issue and believes that blockchain compression will become ubiquitous in the future. The aim is to find a solution that works for both small and large devices without compromising on efficiency.The writer notes that while the approach Satoshi uses for storing transactions is sensible and already in use, scaling down to smaller devices poses a challenge. BitcoinJ avoids this issue but creates problems in other areas as it tries to avoid using a database engine which can be a cause of performance issues on older phones. The aim is to find a solution that works for both small and large devices without compromising on efficiency.</summary>
