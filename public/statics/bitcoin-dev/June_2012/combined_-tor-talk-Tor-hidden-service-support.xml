    <summary>During a discussion on the Tor-talk forum, a poster brought up the topic of conflicts. The poster mentioned that they had already provided an answer to this question in a previous reply on Tor-talk, but the reply is currently awaiting moderation due to bcc. The poster then proceeded to provide some information regarding seednodes on Tor/I2P and suggested including the block of the Phantom project in the IsRoutable check.The poster went on to explain that if Bitcoin was set up via Cat or Phantom, it would not be able to offload traffic to any local blocks or specific hosts on them. This would only affect Bitcoin and not other programs running on them. The poster also provided links to the Phantom project for reference.It is evident from the above context that the poster provided valuable insights into the topic of conflicts and how they can be resolved. The use of links to the Phantom project added more credibility to the post. Overall, the post provides useful information for those interested in the topic of conflicts in Tor/I2P and Bitcoin.</summary>
