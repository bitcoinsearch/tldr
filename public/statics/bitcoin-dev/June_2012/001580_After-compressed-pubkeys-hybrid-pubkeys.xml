    <summary>On June 16, 2012, Gavin Andresen initiated a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list about 'hybrid' public keys with the prefix 0x06/0x07. He asked for opinions on whether to forbid them, as it would make alternative implementations easier in the future, but wasn't sure if the hassle of a network rule change was worth it. He suggested treating any transactions that use these keys as 'non-standard,' meaning they won't be relayed or mined by default, but blocks containing them can still be accepted. He agreed that a rule change wasn't necessary at the moment, but making them non-standard now should make a rule change in the future easier.In response, someone hoped that no one would mine transactions using these keys before they could merge a denial into another rule change, but Andresen seemed unconcerned, saying "oh well" if it did happen.</summary>
