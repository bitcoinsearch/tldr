    <summary>In a conversation dated June 17th, 2012, grarpamp and Luke discussed the difference between two Bitcoin repositories hosted on GitHub and Gitorious. The latter was described as containing backported security and stability fixes to old, unmaintained versions of the software. Grarpamp indicated his preference for GitHub, but questioned the safety of the 0.6.2 branch for production use. Luke responded that this was a temporary branch and that stable releases were available on Gitorious for production purposes. Additionally, he noted that a recent fix to the -detachdb's position in -help had been merged into the master branch and would be backported to stable branches soon.</summary>
