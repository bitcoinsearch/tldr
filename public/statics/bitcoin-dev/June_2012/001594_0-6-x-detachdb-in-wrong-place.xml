    <summary>The context mentions two sources for Bitcoin - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin and https://git.gitorious.org/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable, where the latter is Luke's backports of security and stability fixes to otherwise unmaintained old versions. The speaker expresses difficulty in finding things as they come from cvs/svn but admits that maintenance of prior branches is useful. They plan to switch to GitHub for their work which would be more useful. They also ask whether the github/0.6.2 branch is safe for production and the degree of caution needed for wallet eating for those using github/master.</summary>
