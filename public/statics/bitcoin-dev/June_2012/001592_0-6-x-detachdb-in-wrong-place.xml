    <summary>In an email conversation between grarpamp and an unknown party, the latter mentions the absence of a certain line in the ifdef in the bitcoin git master. Grarpamp then asks for clarification regarding the difference between two repositories, specifically in relation to the project. They inquire about which repository the formal releases are tagged in, as well as which one contains branches with commits that will make it into the next formal release. The two repositories in question are https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin and https://git.gitorious.org/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable.It is revealed that the latter repository is Luke's backports of security and stability fixes to old versions of the software that are no longer maintained.</summary>
