    <summary>Amir Taaki has suggested that introspection/command discovery should be done in the first version exchange so no assumptions need to be made regarding the network. However, this would require a change in the current version message. Dr. Andy Parkins suggests that instead of changing the message, it could simply indicate that "getcmds" is available through one of the service bits. By doing so, the version message won't require any on-the-wire change.</summary>
