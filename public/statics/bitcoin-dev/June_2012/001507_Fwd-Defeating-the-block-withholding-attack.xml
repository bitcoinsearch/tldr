    <summary>Luke-Jr, a developer, proposed a new proof-of-work algorithm that aims to prevent attackers from harming a pool by intentionally not submitting shares that are also valid blocks. This attack is effective proportional to the ratio of the attacker's hashrate to the rest of the pool. The proposed solution involves accepting blocks at a lower difficulty N if they are submitted with a candidate for the next block and SHA256(SHA256(NewBlockHash + NextBlockCandidateHash)) meets difficulty M. This algorithm guarantees that every share has an equal chance of being a valid block at the time it is found. The proposal requires a hard-fork in the blockchain but existing miners, FPGAs, etc should work unmodified. Poolservers will need to adapt significantly.</summary>
