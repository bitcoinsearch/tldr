    <summary>The conversation between two developers, Gregory Maxwell and Gavin Andresen, on June 16th, 2012, centered around the use of 'hybrid' public keys. The topic at hand was whether to forbid their usage or not. While forbidding them would make implementation easier in the future, it was unclear whether changing network rules would be worth the hassle. Gavin suggested treating any transactions using these keys as 'non-standard,' meaning they wouldn't be relayed or mined automatically but could still be accepted in a block. He also agreed with Gregory that changing rules wasn't necessary currently, but making them non-standard now would make a rule change easier later. Gregory acknowledged this and expressed hope that no one would mine these before a rule change could be implemented; if they did, however, there wasn't much to be done. Additionally, the two developers discussed the potential rejection of OP_NOP, which they didn't see any legitimate reason for being on mainnet at that time. Luke expressed willingness to reject both hybrid public keys and OP_NOP if someone provided a patch that didn't depend on IsStandard being enforced.</summary>
