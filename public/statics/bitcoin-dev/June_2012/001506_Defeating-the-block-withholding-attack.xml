    <summary>Currently, all pools are vulnerable to an attack by an attacker who intentionally withholds shares that could also be valid blocks. A proposed solution is to accept blocks at a lower difficulty N if they are submitted with a candidate for the next block and SHA256(SHA256(NewBlockHash + NextBlockCandidateHash)) meets difficulty M. The relationship between M and N must be comparable to the normal network difficulty. This algorithm should guarantee that every share has an equal chance of being a valid block at the time it is found, and attackers have no way to identify which shares to withhold even while they have full knowledge of the shares/blocks themselves. This solution creates a hard-fork in the blockchain, but since mining continues to use a double-SHA256 on a fixed 80 byte header, existing miners, FPGAs, etc should work unmodified. Poolservers will need to adapt significantly. If this solution solves the block withholding risk, the community may approve a hard-fork to take place 1-2 years from consensus. However, rule changes are not likely to gain enough acceptance among the greater Bitcoin community due to the harm centralized pools can cause to the network's security.</summary>
