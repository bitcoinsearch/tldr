    <summary>The command "detachdb" is not visible in the help section as it has been placed under "pnp," which is not enabled in the current build. The issue needs to be fixed for all users. The code snippet provided shows the conditional compilation of the "-upnp" flag based on whether the Universal Plug and Play feature is enabled or not. Additionally, the "-detachdb" flag is mentioned, which detaches block and address databases, but it also increases shutdown time.</summary>
