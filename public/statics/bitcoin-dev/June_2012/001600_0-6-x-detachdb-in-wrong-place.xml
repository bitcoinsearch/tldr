    <summary>The context starts with a cautionary note to have good backups that never touched the new code as there had been bugs in master that would corrupt wallets. The suggestion is made for anyone offering bitcoin services to set up parallel toy versions of their sites on testnet. There is currently not enough testing activity on master. The writer then discusses the workflow between repositories, specifically the release tarballs on sourceforge, which all have tags in github but no tags in gitorious. There are also no 'x' branches on github, yet there is one release applicable branch on gitorious. The writer expects to see release tags laid down at some comfy point in time on the 'x' stable branches on gitorious since it was hinted by Luke that gitorious has the stable trees. However, there are no such tags. The releases/tags seem to magically appear from nowhere on github. A list of version numbers and branches for each repository is provided.</summary>
