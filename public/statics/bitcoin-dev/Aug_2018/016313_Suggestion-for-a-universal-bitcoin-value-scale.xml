    <summary>Martin Damgaard has made a suggestion to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He proposes a universal bitcoin value color scale to tackle the decimal problem identified in BIP 176 by Jimmy Song. Martin admits he is unfamiliar with normal BIP procedures but has provided his suggestion in three different formats (rtf, pdf, and docx) for the convenience of the recipients. The attached files are available for review and Martin hopes that the bitcoin-dev community will find his contribution useful.</summary>
