    <summary>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses a proposal by C++ &amp; Node.js developer Sumit Lahiri to create a new Bitcoin API that supports fast querying of Bitcoin blocks and transactions without the need for syncing with all previous nodes. Lahiri suggests a unified method of finding/querying the blockchain data with a standardized template containing minimal information about the actual mined block or transaction yet satisfies the need of what they want to query. They are working on making a template and a support mechanism on Node.js and want to propose it as an improvement (BIP). The discussion also mentions electrum servers which have the capability to quickly answer the queries of light clients. It is suggested that one could sync up an electrum server or use an existing public one and send queries to it with json-rpc. A link to the electrum protocol methods documentation is provided. Overall, this proposal aims to provide a more efficient way for web developers to access Bitcoin blockchain data.</summary>
