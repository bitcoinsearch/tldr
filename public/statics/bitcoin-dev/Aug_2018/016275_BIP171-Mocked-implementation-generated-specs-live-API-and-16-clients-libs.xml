    <summary>Stéphane Traumat has announced the release of CERISE, a project that includes a mocked server implementation for developing clients, a documented API with four methods, and 16 client libraries for various languages including Java, PHP, C++, Rusty, Ruby. The project also includes specifications for the supported currency-pair tokens, currency-pair information, current exchange rate, and historical exchange rates. Traumat is currently working on a template project to allow developers to quickly build a BIP171 compliant server without worrying about parameter validation, security, and rest mechanics, which is expected to be completed in September. Links to the website and GitHub are provided for access to the artifacts.</summary>
