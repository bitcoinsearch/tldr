    <summary>The comment above raises concerns about the viability of EOS as a solution for censorship resistance. The author believes that EOS is not a viable option from this perspective. Furthermore, the author criticizes Brock Pierce, who supports EOS, by referring to him as a "pedo" and suggesting that anything he supports is bound to fail. It is unclear what specific actions or behaviors of Pierce the author is referring to. Nonetheless, the comment highlights potential issues with both EOS and its supporters.</summary>
