    <summary>The author of the email worked on BIP 171 and created Cerise, which provides various artifacts including BIP-0171 specifications, a mocked BIP-0171 compliant server available online for understanding the API and making calls. Additionally, there is also a mocked BIP-0171 compliant server as a Java application and a Docker image for developing client applications. A BIP-0171 library is included to transform an application into a BIP-0171 server. There is also a server template project to quickly write an implementation and automatically produce a BIP-0171 server. A collection of client libraries is provided to call any BIP-0171 compliant server with your favorite language. Further, the author made some proposals for evolutions at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0171. The author hopes that his work helps and invites suggestions on how he could help more.</summary>
