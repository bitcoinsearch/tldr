    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list thread, Tim Ruffing raised questions about the unspecified encoding of public and private keys in a draft specification for 64-byte elliptic curve Schnorr signatures. Ruffing suggested that the encoding of the public key should be specified in the BIP, as it is part of the signature scheme. He also noted that this issue creates a discrepancy between the specification and the test vectors. Andrew Poelstra replied, stating that it was likely an oversight and proposed specifying the standard encoding from section 2.3 of http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf, with the exception of allowing only compressed public keys. The proposed BIP is a draft specification of the signature scheme itself, leaving other proposals to deal with consensus rules, aggregation, integration into Bitcoin, etc. If accepted, there will be more production-ready reference implementations and tests.</summary>
