    <summary>A developer has proposed creating a new Bitcoin API that supports fast querying of Bitcoin blocks and transactions without the need for syncing with all previous nodes. The proposal involves making a unified method of finding/querying blockchain data with a standardized template containing minimal information about the actual mined block or transaction, yet satisfies the need of what the developer wants to query. The developer is working on making a template and a support mechanism on Node.js and wants to propose it as an improvement (BIP). A Github link was provided, showcasing a Bitcoin indexing API server built using Node.js. Another Github link was also provided, which shows Electrum servers designed to quickly answer the queries of light clients.</summary>
