    <summary>The post is a warning against publishing a service that asks users for private keys, as it could result in server compromise. The author shares a web interface called peersm.com/wallet, which is the only online tool that converts bech32 addresses and decodes redeem scripts. However, the tool should not be used to access private keys as it is not an offline tool. The author also mentions that some users have reported invalid bech32 addresses from their Electrum wallet, after segwit, bech32 confusion. The author provides links to various projects they are involved in on GitHub.</summary>
