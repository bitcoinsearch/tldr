    <summary>Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, announced the release of a first draft library for doing BLS signatures. BLS signatures have the same aggregation feature as Schnorr signatures but can be done non-interactively with better aggregation at slower speeds. The library is based on a construction based on musig and is fully functional. Feedback, discussion, and usage are welcome. The announcement was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The library can be found on Github under the Chia-Network organization. A comparison to Shigeo's implementation was also mentioned in the thread.</summary>
