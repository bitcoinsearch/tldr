    <summary>Martin Damgaard, an individual who is unfamiliar with BIP procedures, has made a contribution to the Bitcoin community by suggesting a universal bitcoin value color scale in order to tackle the decimal problem identified by Jimmy Song's BIP 176 proposal. Adán Sánchez de Pedro Crespo suggested that Martin submit his work as a markdown document published somewhere with version control, such as GitHub, to make it easier for others to contribute. Martin has since created a GitHub version of his suggestion and collected the commons made to the first version in a remarks-file. He plans to create a new version incorporating the different commons and welcomes any help from interested contributors. All kinds of suggestions are welcome.</summary>
