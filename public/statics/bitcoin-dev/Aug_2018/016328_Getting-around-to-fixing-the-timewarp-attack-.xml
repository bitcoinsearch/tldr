    <summary>The difficulty calculation for timestamps on the blockchain could be restricted to prevent attacks such as powLimit and "unlimited" blocks in less than four weeks of &gt; 50% selfish mining. This would require a change in how timestamps are used, but it is unclear if this change would be backward compatible. LTC, BCH, and LTC have all experienced similar attacks in the past, but this solution may prevent future ones. Other solutions may not be effective against these types of attacks.</summary>
