    <summary>On August 6, 2018, Anthony Towns and Russell O'Connor had a discussion via email regarding a proposed change to the verification equation. O'Connor had revised his proposal to make the verification equation read as "R + sG + eP = 0" in light of certain considerations. Towns suggested that the equation "R + s(-G) + eP = 0" would also be equally good since -G is a constant. To this suggestion, Towns replied with agreement and withdrew his proposal.</summary>
