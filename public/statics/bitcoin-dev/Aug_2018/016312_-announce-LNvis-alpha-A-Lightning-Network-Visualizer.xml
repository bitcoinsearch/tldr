    <summary>A developer has released an alpha version of an OpenGL Lighting Network visualizer written in C. The visualizer is designed to parse c-lightning channels and node json, with support for LND currently being added. Currently only tested on Linux, the developer is seeking assistance to get it working on macOS and Windows. The Lightning Network channel gossip is rendered by the LNvis tool, which includes nodes and edges between those nodes. Channels are colored by the node that opened them, while channel widths are rendered proportionally to their capacity. Users can also filter the view to a specific node and its neighbors by right-clicking on the node. In addition, dragging a node in any view will focus on that node and its neighbors. The developer is looking for suggestions for future updates such as filter by alias/id in the UI, "Google Maps" mode for highlighting potential routes between nodes, and realtime channel updates from network gossip. Contributions are welcome.</summary>
