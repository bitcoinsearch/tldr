    <summary>The sender of the message is requesting information regarding the potential for a testnet reset in the next release or if there is any reason not to do so. This request comes as the current testnet has reached 1411795 blocks and a full sync is taking at least 48 hours. The sender is hoping for a faster onboarding process and lower disk overheads for testing purposes. The message is signed by Shiva S, CEO of Blockonomics, a company specializing in decentralized and permissionless payments. Links to their Telegram group and Welcome Guide are also provided.</summary>
