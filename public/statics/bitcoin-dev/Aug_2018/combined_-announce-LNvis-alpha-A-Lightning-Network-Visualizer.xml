    <summary>A developer has created an alpha version of an OpenGL Lighting Network visualizer written in C that can parse c-lightning channels and node json. The visualizer is able to render the Lightning Network channel gossip through the LNvis tool, which displays nodes and edges between them. Channels are colored according to the node that opened them and their widths are rendered proportionally to their capacity. Users can filter the view by right-clicking on a specific node to see its neighbors, and dragging a node will focus on it and its neighboring nodes. The visualizer has only been tested on Linux, and the developer is looking for assistance in getting it to work on macOS and Windows. The developer is also seeking suggestions for future updates to the visualizer such as a filter by alias/id in the UI, "Google Maps" mode for highlighting potential routes between nodes, and realtime channel updates from network gossip. Contributions are welcome.</summary>
