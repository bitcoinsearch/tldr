    <summary>A developer has proposed creating a Bitcoin API that allows for fast querying of blocks and transactions without the need to sync with all previous nodes. The developer, Sumit Lahiri, is working on a template and support mechanism using Node.js and hopes to propose it as an improvement (BIP). However, others have expressed concerns about centralisation and the need to trust third-party APIs rather than validating data independently. They argue that if everyone relied solely on bitcoind and did not centralise services, there would be no block explorers or secure light wallets. Nevertheless, block explorers and light wallets are deemed useful, so some form of API must provide these features, either centralised or decentralised. It is suggested that encouraging the latter is wise, rather than questioning the validity of a block explorer use case.</summary>
