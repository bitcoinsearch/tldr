    <summary>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user asked why there aren't multiple testnets available. Another user, Peter Todd, suggested that rather than resetting the current testnet, it would be better to have a larger blockchain for testing purposes. He also recommended using regtest as an alternative for testing, as private blockchains can be easily set up and controlled. The user had previously noted that the current testnet is over 1.4 million blocks long and takes at least 48 hours to fully sync.</summary>
