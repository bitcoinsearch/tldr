    <summary>In a recent conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jude Nelson raised concerns about whether miners can identify transactions coming from specific software and censor them. The response to this question involves the use of IPFS, a distributed file system. The hash of a file is deterministic and can be obtained using the `ipfs add` command whether or not the network is connected. However, files are not uploaded to IPFS until transactions have been settled with several confirmations. This means that miners cannot identify transactions by their hashes until after they have already been confirmed and added to the blockchain.</summary>
