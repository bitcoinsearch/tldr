    <title>Witness serialization in PSBT non-witness UTXOs</title>

    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed an update to the specification of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 174. The current version specifies that non-witness unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) should be serialized in network format. However, Wuille argues that this is ambiguous and unnecessary. He suggests that non-witness UTXOs should be serialized without witness, as witness data is immaterial to PSBT (partially signed bitcoin transactions). Additionally, he believes that specifying the serialization as "network format" risks breaking compatibility with existing signers if a new type of witness is introduced in the future. Andrew, another developer, agrees with Wuille's proposal and adds that specifying non-witness UTXOs as "witness or non-witness" serialization would maintain both backward and forward compatibility.</summary>
