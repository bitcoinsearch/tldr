    <summary>In a message from Lautaro Dragan via bitcoin-dev, the question was posed of whether or not the BIP process should be used to claim an op_return prefix. However, Christopher Allen recommended against using an op_return prefix due to its potential for transaction censorship. In fact, projects have been removing IPFS multihash prefix information in order to post a "bare" SHA256 hash in op_returns which would make it look like many other hashes being posted, thus minimizing the ability for a miner to identify the transaction. The idea of responsible ways to publish the hash has been considered for long term purposes, one of which would be to have the hash in the witness script data so that it can be easily purged from nodes that do not wish to preserve it and prevent block size bloat. However, there has not yet been a solid proposal for best practices in this area.</summary>
