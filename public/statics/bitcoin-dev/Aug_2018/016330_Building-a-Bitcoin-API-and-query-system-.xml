    <summary>A C++ and Node.js developer has proposed creating a new Bitcoin API that allows for fast querying of Bitcoin blocks and transactions without the need to sync with all previous nodes. The developer suggests that such APIs usually result in central validation, meaning users trust API services rather than validating their own data. This breaks some fundamental properties of Bitcoin that aim to avoid trusted third parties. Additionally, systems or applications depending on a fully indexed blockchain (and thus such an API) tend to scale poorly. The developer is working on creating a template and support mechanism on Node.js and proposes it as an improvement (BIP) to help future web developers who want to create similar systems. However, Jonas Schnelli raises concerns about the use of such APIs and asks for concrete use-cases for such block explorer-ish APIs.</summary>
