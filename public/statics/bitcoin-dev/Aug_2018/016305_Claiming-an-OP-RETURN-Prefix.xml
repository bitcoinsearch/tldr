    <summary>In a discussion about whether choosing not to mine transactions is censorship or not, Lautaro Dragan raised the question of whether it could be considered censorship if it was for political reasons rather than economical. Luke responded that miners have always had the right to choose transactions based on their own policies, and that the system is designed to have many miners with differing policies so that one miner's choice does not impact the overall ability to spend. He also noted that even if transaction fees were much higher than they currently are, no one has an obligation to accept payment for a service they don't want to provide.</summary>
