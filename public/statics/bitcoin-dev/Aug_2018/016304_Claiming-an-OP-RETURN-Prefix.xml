    <summary>On a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jude Nelson inquires if miners can identify which transactions come from a specific software and censor them. In response, Christopher Allen suggests that the latency required to inspect all hashes would likely impact the miner's ability to succeed in the block. However, Luke Dashjr disagrees, stating that choosing not to mine transactions is not considered censorship. He also notes that as long as all hashes look the same, and there are multiple content-addressable schemes that use hashes that have to be searched to know to censor, you have to censor all or none.</summary>
