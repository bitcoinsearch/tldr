    <title>Witness serialization in PSBT non-witness UTXOs</title>

    <summary>Pieter, a developer and contributor to BIP174, has raised concerns about the current specification that requires non-witness UTXOs to be serialized in network format. He argues that including the witness in these transactions is unnecessary for PSBT and that the term "network format" is ambiguous. He suggests updating the specification to state that non-witness UTXOs should be serialized without the witness. If it's too late for that, he proposes explicitly specifying whether the transaction should include or exclude the witness, but believes it's safe to drop the witness altogether. Pieter is seeking opinions on this matter.</summary>
