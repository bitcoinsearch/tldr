    <summary>The author of the email has worked on BIP 171 and created Cerise, which offers several artifacts, including BIP-0171 specifications. Cerise also provides a mocked BIP-0171 compliant server that is available online for understanding the API and making calls. Besides, there is also a mocked BIP-0171 compliant server as a Java application and a Docker image for developing client applications.Furthermore, a BIP-0171 library is included in Cerise to transform an application into a BIP-0171 server. A server template project is also available to help quickly write an implementation and automatically produce a BIP-0171 server. A collection of client libraries is provided to call any BIP-0171 compliant server with your favorite language.The author has made some proposals for evolutions at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0171. The author hopes that his work helps and invites suggestions on how he could help more.</summary>
