    <summary>The Tech Lead of Po.et, Lautaro Dragan, sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list seeking clarification on how to claim an OP_RETURN prefix. Po.et uses colored coins to store data on the Bitcoin blockchain with the prefix "POET." In response, Peter Todd suggested that using a prefix is unnecessary from a censorship resistance and anonymity perspective, and the application should not require a prefix for technical reasons. Todd also mentioned that there are no reserved prefixes enforced by the software, so anyone could create an output that uses the witness coinbase commitment prefix bytes, which would just be ignored unless it was in the coinbase and valid. It is better to avoid using a prefix at all. There is no formal or standard process to claim it, and there is no existing BIP claiming an OP_RETURN prefix.</summary>
