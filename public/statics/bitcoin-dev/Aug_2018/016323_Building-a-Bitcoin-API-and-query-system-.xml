    <summary>A Node.js based Bitcoin indexing API server named Bitcore with several modules including a block explorer and wallet module can be found at https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/tree/v8.0.0, according to Mat√≠as Alejo Garcia. A developer named Sumit Lahiri proposed making a new Bitcoin API that supports fast querying of Bitcoin blocks and transactions without the need for syncing with all previous nodes. The proposal involves a unified method of finding/querying the blockchain data with a standardized template containing minimal information about the actual mined block or transaction yet satisfies the need of what is required to query, making it easier for future web developers who want to create something similar. Electrum, which has many or possibly all of the features mentioned by Sumit Lahiri, could also be used since the Electrum servers are designed to quickly answer the queries of light clients.</summary>
