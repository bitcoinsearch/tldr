    <summary>The post discusses the issue of online services that ask for private keys and seeds, which poses a threat to user security if servers get compromised. The idea behind "Move your coins by yourself" is to avoid getting trapped by wallets or things that users don't have control over. An online tool called https://peersm.com/wallet has been created to provide an alternative, with private keys being optional and the tool outputting the command to use with bitcoin-transactions. The tool allows users to create transactions on their own and is the only online tool that converts bech32 addresses and decodes redeem scripts from any address. However, it is not advised to use private keys until it becomes an offline tool. Some Electrum wallet users have reported invalid bech32 addresses, which might be a result of bech32 confusion after segwit. The author provides links to other projects, including Bitcoin wallets made simple, Zcash wallets made simple, Peersm, torrent-live, node-Tor, and GitHub. Additionally, the email thread between Aymeric Vitte and Marcel Jamin discusses the issue of online services that ask for private keys and seeds to offer "free" coins. Jamin suggests that users should almost never publish a service that asks for private keys as the server might get compromised, and moving coins by oneself isn't even correct if the server is involved.Vitte responds with a warning that people can't refrain from putting their keys to get "free" coins and mentions his web interface tool for bitcoin-transactions, which allows users to move their coins without fees. He acknowledges that it is not advised to use private keys currently, but an offline tool would be ideal if there is some incentive to do so. The tool is supposedly the only online tool that converts bech32 addresses, decodes redeem scripts, and creates transactions on its own. Overall, Vitte believes that a safe and secure tool would be a welcome step in the right direction for mainstream bitcoin users who value efficiency and simplicity.</summary>
