    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin development mailing list, a user notes that the Testnet has now reached 1,411,795 blocks and that a full sync is taking at least 48 hours. They ask whether a reset is scheduled in the next release or if there is any reason not to do so. In response, another member of the mailing list advocates for keeping Testnet as a larger blockchain than mainnet to find size-related issues first. They also note that for testing purposes, regtest may be a better alternative and can be set up easily with good control over block creation. The email includes a signature attachment from Peter Todd.</summary>
