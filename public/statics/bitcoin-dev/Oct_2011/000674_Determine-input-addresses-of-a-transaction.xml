    <summary>In an email exchange between Jan Vornberger and Pieter Wuille, Vornberger proposed extending the 'gettransaction' call to include a new field called "inputaddresses" which would return a list of Bitcoin addresses associated with the inputs of the transaction. However, Wuille pointed out that Bitcoin transactions do not have input addresses but rather have optional addresses the input coins were last sent to. He also expressed concern that allowing for a 'from' address on a transaction could encourage using such addresses to identify transactions, which he believed was the wrong approach. In response to Vornberger's green transactions idea, Wuille suggested perhaps creating an interface to mark certain addresses as 'trusted', and having an RPC call to request all incoming transactions that originate from trusted sources.</summary>
