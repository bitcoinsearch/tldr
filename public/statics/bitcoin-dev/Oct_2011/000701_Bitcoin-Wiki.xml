    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Amir Taaki asked if a git repo can be used for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) as the wiki has been unreliable in the past. He also requested help in contacting MT to get the BIPs back online since there's a new one to be added and he hasn't finished copy-editing the existing ones. The email contained a promotional message about learning IT networking skills at Cisco, which was not related to the main subject of discussion.</summary>
