    <summary>The writer of the message argues in favor of strict adherence to the implementation standard of the Zen of Python. They believe that if a node incorrectly implements the standard, it should be shunned immediately for security reasons and long term compatibility between different implementations. While Gavin, an opponent, believes that being a bit lenient makes it easier for people working on other implementations, the writer argues that everything should be strict, explicit, unambiguous, and loud. To ensure the protocol's interaction is seamless, the writer proposes a new message type: "error," which includes a uint64_t error_code and var_str reason payload. Before disconnecting a node, one can send an error message containing an error code that specifies the main class of the error and reason string for context. Additionally, there are other possible fields like seriousness, action_taken, and more. The writer believes strict enforcement will reduce accumulated errors that lead to sudden disconnection.</summary>
