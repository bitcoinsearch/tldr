    <summary>In October 2011, Gavin Andresen discussed the potential issues with using the ExtractAddress() function for listtransactions. This is because fetching all previous inputs from disk to check if they are 'green' violates the "a feature shouldn't cost anything if it is not being used" design principle. Michael suggested that gettransaction could take an optional second argument includeinputaddresses which defaults to false to address this issue. It is unclear if there were any current users of gettransaction for whom this performance penalty would be problematic.</summary>
