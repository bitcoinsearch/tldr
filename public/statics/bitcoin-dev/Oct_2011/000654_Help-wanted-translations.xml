    <summary>On October 10, 2011, Mike Hearn announced that he would no longer be using bitcoind for Eligius and would instead write custom software designed to more efficiently create work. Bitcoind will still serve the purpose of peering with external nodes and picking out valid transactions to be accepted into blocks, but won't be involved in the primary operations of the pool. The custom software will handle incrementing the extraNonce, recalculating the merkle tree/root, and other operations. However, the hard part is implementing a stateless TCP/IP "stack" so it can ignore DDoS sanely. This direction was similar to what Steve was doing with poolserverj.</summary>
