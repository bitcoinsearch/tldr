    <summary>In a conversation with Gavin Andresen, the issue of how to know if a bitcoin transaction has occurred was raised. It was suggested that if one's address had been part of a transaction, it would pop up immediately in one's setup. The idea of moving away from bitcoin addresses as 'pay-to entity' and creating a payment infrastructure where people or organizations are paid instead, was also mentioned. However, this suggestion did not sit well with some because the semi-anonymous feature of bitcoin is one of its key features. Instead, it was suggested that in the short-term, a new type of bitcoin address built on top of OP_EVAL should be created because it will be very easy for all existing infrastructure to support. Nonetheless, there were concerns about the endless expansions of bitcoin addresses that each represent a specific script inside the OP_EVAL, and how it affects aesthetics.</summary>
