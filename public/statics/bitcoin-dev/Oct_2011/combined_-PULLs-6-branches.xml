    <summary>Several branches are ready for merging to mainline, which can be viewed at http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/w/bitcoind/luke-jr.git/heads. These branches include minfee_modes, a minor internal API change as a step toward allowing user-customizable fee schedules; qmake_system_crypto++, which allows building bitcoin-qt against system crypto++; sharedlibs, which builds bitcoind against shared libraries on 'unix'; signal_blk_notify, an option to send SIGUSR1 to a PID when there's a new best block used by basically every pool now; bugfix_qt_uri_amount_parser, which fixes the URI amount parser to accept exponents and hexadecimals; and base58_liberal_parsing, which accepts typos in base58 data.The bugfix_qt_uri_amount_parser branch has been a topic of debate between the pro- and anti-sides over multiple arguments, but it can be easily tolerated. It does not hurt the BTC-only URIs at all, and if nobody uses it for other units, it can always be removed later. The same best/worst case scenario logic applies to base58_liberal_parsing too, so long as typos aren't advertised as legitimate addresses.</summary>
