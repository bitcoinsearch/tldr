    <summary>Rob Meijer, a developer, has designed the specifications for MinorFs2 and believes that it could be a suitable fit for Bitcoin. However, he is open to suggestions from Bitcoin developers on what changes can be made to improve its compatibility. Rob proposes that 'process-Chain granularity' or 'Worker granularity' might be appropriate for Bitcoin, but possibly a more coarse granularity level may be required. He also mentions that MinorFs provides facilities to pick a granularity for 'object' more suitable for most lines of development where pseudo-persistent processes are an unnatural concept.Rob clarifies that MinorFs can complement wallet encryption by providing the pseudo-persistent process that private members provide to objects. He explains that all read and write operations will map directly to the underlying file-system and come with the same lack of guarantee that any file-system comes with once the underlying media becomes flaky. However, he also admits that he hasn't thought about proper ways to do backups.To accommodate Bitcoin developer needs, Rob has written down the initial set of specs for rewriting MinorFs and wants to get the next version of MinorFs to a level that code to use MinorFs where available can be added to Bitcoin. He asks Bitcoin developers to consider what attributes from the current granularity level (pseudo-persistent process) should be kept, dropped, and added to arrive at an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity of persistent private storage for Bitcoin. Rob hopes to accommodate Bitcoin developer needs and welcomes all input that helps him help Bitcoin developers.In addition to this email, there is another email promoting a free download of ArcSight Logger, a log management solution. The download comes with a "Love Thy Logs" t-shirt. Interested parties are directed to a link provided in the email which leads to a sign-up page. The email also includes a footer that advertises a Bitcoin-development mailing list and provides a link to subscribe to it.</summary>
