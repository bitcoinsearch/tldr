    <summary>Several branches are ready to be merged into the mainline of Bitcoin, as viewable at http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/w/bitcoind/luke-jr.git/heads. These branches include a minor internal API change that allows for user-customizable fee schedules, and an update that allows building bitcoin-qt against system crypto++ in order to build bitcoind against shared libraries on 'unix'. Another branch includes an option to send SIGUSR1 to a PID when there's a new best block, which is used by basically every pool now. There is also a bugfix that fixes URI amount parser to accept exponents and hexadecimals, which has caused arguments between pro- and anti-sides. However, it is deemed harmless if not beneficial as it doesn't hurt BTC-only URIs and can be removed later if nobody uses it. Lastly, base58_liberal_parsing accepts typos in base58 data with similar best/worst case scenarios as the URI parser. The reason why this hasn't been done before is unknown, but it is suspected most systems only have shared libs.</summary>
