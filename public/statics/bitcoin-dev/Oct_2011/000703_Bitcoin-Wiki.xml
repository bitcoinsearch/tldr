    <summary>In 2011, a discussion took place in the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the reliability of the wiki for storing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Nils Schneider suggested using Git as a backup since BIPs are important and the wiki had been unreliable before. Git can be used together with Markdown and Github Pages to automatically push git commits out to the website. Amir Taaki asked how to contact MT to get the wiki back online since there was a new BIP to be added and he still hadn't finished copy-editing the existing ones. The email also included an advertisement for a Learning at Cisco Self-Assessment that provides information about Cisco certifications, training, and career opportunities.</summary>
