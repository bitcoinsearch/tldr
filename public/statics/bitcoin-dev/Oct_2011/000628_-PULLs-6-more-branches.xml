    <summary>Luke-Jr has finished rebasing a larger batch of branches which are now ready for merging into the mainline. The branches include coinbaser, which allows customizing what addresses are paid by generation and adds the "setworkaux" JSON-RPC call to add arbitrary data to the coinbase. Txinfo adds "pooledtx", "currentblocktx", and "currentblocksize" to the output of the JSON-RPC 'getinfo' method. Force_send disables automatically adding "minimum" fees for JSON-RPC methods. Eligius_relay relays transactions that satisfy Eligius's minimum fee when it's lower than the default rules while eligius_sendfee allows sending the lower fee between default and Eligius. Finally, bugfix_CreateThread_ThreadSocketHandler_errReporting reports an error in debug.log. Eligius has tested coinbaser quite a bit under the 0.3.23 codebase and txinfo has been used since 0.3.21 without any issues. Users should be assumed to understand the risk of sending with insufficient fees when using force_send. Whether to merge or not is up to the users.</summary>
