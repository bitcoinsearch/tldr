    <summary>In an email conversation from 2011, Michael Grønager discussed the importance of being able to extract transactions to and from private keys. He argued that the information needed to author an address was already hidden within the private key. This feature is currently used in blockexplorer, bitcoin-js, and his own implementation for thin clients. If a standard multikey payment was introduced that hides or overly complicates the address, it would be a major problem for these projects. However, they would still be able to extract identifying information using the same procedure, just with additional bytes generated by the wallet holder included in the process. Grønager questioned why this would be a problem if the former method was not.</summary>
