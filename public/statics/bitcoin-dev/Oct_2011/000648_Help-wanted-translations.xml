    <summary>The author of this message is requesting that Coinbaser be merged for version 0.5 due to its extensive testing on Eligius, where it has received a lot of support for the new JSON-RPC method that was requested. The author has even gone through the effort of documenting it. They state that they will no longer be using bitcoind for Eligius soon, so they have little incentive to maintain/rebase coinbaser across a 0.6 development period. Overall, the author is advocating strongly for the inclusion of Coinbaser in the upcoming version of the software.</summary>
