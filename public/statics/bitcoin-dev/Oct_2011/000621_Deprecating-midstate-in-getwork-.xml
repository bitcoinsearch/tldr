    <summary>In this context, a discussion is taking place regarding the implementation of SHA2 in Bitcoin. One person suggests that it can be easily implemented without using a large library like OpenSSL. Another person points out that Bitcoin already depends on OpenSSL for ecdsa, bignum, and SSL for RPC. They advise against trying to re-implement these locally. The conversation shows that there are different opinions and approaches to implementing SHA2 in Bitcoin.</summary>
