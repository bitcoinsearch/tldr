    <summary>In an email exchange between Michael Grønager and Gavin Andresen, Grønager expressed the importance of being able to extract transactions only from private keys. Gavin Andresen asked why this was important, stating that if someone is sending bitcoins, they would need an address or public key from the recipient. OP_EVAL allows for a short address that represents multiple keys combined in various ways. Gregory argued that it doesn't matter whether the address is HASH(public key) or HASH(op_eval_script), as the issues are the same. Gavin Andresen suggested that perhaps Grønager was concerned that blockexplorer wouldn't know that coins sent to HASH(op_eval_script) were actually a complicated transaction until the coins were spent again. He considered this to be a feature, not a bug. Gavin Andresen also agreed with Alan that using OP_EVAL is not mandatory and proposed that CHECKMULTISIG become a standard transaction type.</summary>
