    <summary>The author of the context has a proposal and design for a new project built on bitcoin. The author is seeking advice on where to post their initial proposal and design to start a discussion. The project is of interest to Bitcoin enthusiasts as well as a wide range of others. The author wants to discuss it on this list if it's appropriate. The project is entirely built on bitcoind, so the author requires comments from the community.
