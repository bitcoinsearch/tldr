    <summary>The context is an email conversation between several individuals on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The discussion centers around using a Git repository as a backup for BIPs, which are considered important and have been unreliable on the wiki in the past. One individual suggests using Markdown and GitHub pages, which automatically push Git commits out to the website. Another individual asks how to contact MT about getting the BIPs back online, stating that there is a new one to be added and they still haven't finished copy-editing them. At the end of each email, there is a message promoting Cisco's Learning at Cisco Self-Assessment program and providing a link to learn about Cisco certifications, training, and career opportunities.</summary>
