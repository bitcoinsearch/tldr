    <summary>Gavin has tagged 0.5rc1, and as a result, the stable git tree has been tagged "v0.4.1rc1". The developer is requesting assistance from others to compile and test the software. Instructions on compiling can be found in the doc/build-*.txt files in the source tree. Binary releases for Unix and Mac will only be available if someone volunteers to create them. There are no major changes from version 0.4.0, only bug fixes. None of the features from 0.5 are supported, only those in 0.4. Those interested in viewing a complete list of changes should run: git shortlog --no-merges v0.4.0.. The developer expresses gratitude to everyone who is contributing.</summary>
