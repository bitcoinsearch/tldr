    <summary>On October 5, 2011, Gavin Andresen updated src/makefile.osx and doc/build-osx.txt, assuming that the MacPorts versions of dependencies will be used, and the -mt boost libraries will be used. He also modified makefile.unix and makefile.osx to auto-build dependencies using gcc's -MMD option. In response to this update, Douglas Huff suggested installing the newer 1.46 boost packages as there were some issues with the previous ones available on Macports. The email chain was a part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Additionally, the email contained a sponsored link for Splunk, which is a data analysis tool used to make sense of IT infrastructure data.</summary>
