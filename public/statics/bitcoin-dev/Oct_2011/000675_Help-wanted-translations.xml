    <summary>The conversation is about the translation of Bitcoin software into different languages. Geir Harald Hansen reports success in translating some strings, but also notes that he had to translate some exact same strings 2-3 times. Nils Schneider suggests using Transifex as a tool for translation and has exported all .ts files to it. Geir Harald Hansen offers to translate Norwegian Bokm√•l if it is added to Transifex. Chris points out that the same string may need to be translated differently depending on the context they appear in, which might be the cause for duplicate strings. The conversation ends with a link to a Cisco networking self-assessment and information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
