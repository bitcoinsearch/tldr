    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Brian McQueen asked about the unit tests for the Bitcoin QT framework. JS responded that there are no unit tests for the Qt GUI code itself at the moment. However, tests for the Bitcoin core still exist in src/tests and can be built with the makefile. JS also noted that qmake is currently only used for the GUI executable. This information was shared on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
