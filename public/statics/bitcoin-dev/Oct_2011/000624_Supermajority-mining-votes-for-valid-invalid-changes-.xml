    <summary>On October 03, 2011, Gregory Maxwell proposed a plan for upgrading nodes that involved several rules. The first rule was to never forward or mine a transaction that would be invalid under the new rule. The second rule was to apply the old behavior before height X unconditionally. The value of X was set in the future enough to get reasonable deployment by large miners. The third rule required 50% of the last Y blocks to contain a coinbase with an "I am upgraded" code before applying the new rule. The fourth rule stated that until the new rule is active, every block should contain an "I am upgraded" code. It was suggested that members of the bitcoin community intentionally transmit transactions that are invalid under the new rules once the software has been released. This would serve as a safeguard against possible attacks under the simplest deployment plan. It's unclear why legitimate community members would do this.</summary>
