    <summary>Rob Meijer, the author of MinorFs, has proposed an updated version suitable for use by Bitcoin on systems that support AppArmor. The purpose is to provide private but decomposable and delegatable piece of filesystem storage, which can protect user data such as Bitcoin wallets from malware running under the same UID as that user. Rob Meijer is seeking input from Bitcoin developers to create an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity of persistent private storage for bitcoin so that code to use MinorFs where available can be added to bitcoin. There are concerns about whether MinorFs can work without changes to Bitcoin and if not, what is the minimal amount of changes needed. Moreover, there are questions about whether MinorFs would help secure the wallet on a server, maybe even an insecure VPS.In response to Rob's announcement, one individual asked if it was necessary to rewrite the entire thing from scratch and questioned whether it could be compared to the Android model which uses a UID per application/user. In addition, Rob Meijer is trying to rewrite MinorFs in Python to make it easier and more natural for application developers who want to protect user data. Currently, only one perfect fit for MinorFs exists, but some close fits require lots of manual fiddling by the user to get working. Rob expects that Bitcoin, openssh, chrome, Firefox, or any other application that would benefit from what MinorFs provides will not be rewritten in E. Therefore, the next version of MinorFs should take an approach that better suits common development languages and practices, abandoning the purity of its least authority model.Rob is also developing a library named LibMinorFs, which would make the usage of MinorFs by applications like Bitcoin more convenient. He proposes the idea of incorporating this library into Bitcoin, making it use private storage when available. Although wallet encryption is a simpler solution for end-users, MinorFs could be considered complementary. Rob Meijer proposed an updated version of MinorFs, a filesystem that could be used by Bitcoin on systems that support AppArmor like Ubuntu and OpenSuse. The purpose is to protect user data such as Bitcoin wallets from malware running under the same UID as that user. However, there are concerns about whether MinorFs can work without changes to Bitcoin and if not, what is the minimal amount of changes needed. Rob Meijer is trying to get specifications together for rewriting MinorFs in Python that would make it easier and more natural for application developers who want to protect user data.Rob Meijer believes that the next version of MinorFs should take an approach that better suits common development languages and practices. He has created a set of initial specifications for the rewrite and seeks suggestions and feedback. The current granularity level of MinorFs is hard fixed to that of the 'pseudo persistent process', but facilities will be provided in the new version to pick a granularity for 'object' more suitable for most lines of development. In addition, Rob Meijer has started developing a library named LibMinorFs that would make the usage of MinorFs by applications like Bitcoin more convenient.In an email thread, Rob Meijer announced the initial set of specifications for a rewrite of MinorFS. Others in the thread expressed their interest in this update. One individual stated that more strict privilege separation between applications would be necessary for Ubuntu if they want to keep up with Android and MacOSX. They noted that this has been needed for a while and would be useful for any private data managed by applications running as the same user, such as SSH, browsers, and PGP. The discussion then turned to security measures, with one participant noting that wallet encryption is useful but not a substitute for OS-level protection. Rob Meijer emphasizes accommodating bitcoin developer needs in the next version of MinorFs to accommodate their needs to a level that code to use MinorFs where available can be added to Bitcoin. He asked Bitcoin developers to think about what attributes from the current granularity level should be kept, what attributes should be dropped, and what properties should be added to arrive at an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity of persistent private storage for Bitcoin. He also welcomes all input that helps him accommodate Bitcoin developer needs so that code to use MinorFs where available can be added to Bitcoin. Currently, wallet encryption is a simpler solution for end-users than MinorFs. However, the new version of MinorFs would make it easier and more natural for application developers who want to protect user data.In addition to this email, there is another email promoting a free download of ArcSight Logger, a log management solution. Interested parties are directed to a link provided in the email which leads to a sign-up page. The email also includes a footer that advertises a Bitcoin-development mailing list and provides a link to subscribe to it.</summary>
