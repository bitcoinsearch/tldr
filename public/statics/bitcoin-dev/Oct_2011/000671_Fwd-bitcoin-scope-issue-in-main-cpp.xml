    <summary>In programming, it is legally allowed for a scope to define variables with names that conflict with the names of variables in higher-level scopes. This means that a variable defined within a certain block of code can have the same name as a variable defined outside of that block. It is important to note that the two variables are distinct and separate entities despite having the same name. This concept is known as variable shadowing and can occur in many programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. Shadowing can be useful in situations where a developer wants to temporarily override the value of a higher-level variable without affecting its value outside of the current block of code. However, variable shadowing can also lead to confusion and errors if not used carefully. It is recommended that developers use clear and distinct variable names to avoid any potential conflicts or misunderstandings. Additionally, tools such as linters and IDEs can help identify shadowed variables and suggest alternative names. Overall, while variable shadowing can be a useful tool in programming, it is important to use it thoughtfully and with caution to avoid any negative consequences.</summary>
