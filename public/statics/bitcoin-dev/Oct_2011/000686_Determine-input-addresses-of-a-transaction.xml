    <summary>In an email thread, Jan Vornberger proposed two ideas to improve green address style transactions. The first idea was to detect the current green address style transactions quickly, even if it's a little bit of a hack. The second idea was to create and verify green transactions in a proper manner so that they can be merged at some point. Jan chose the first option because he believed that green transactions were too controversial to get included in the mainline.The controversy surrounding green transactions stems from criticism ranging from "unnecessary, as 0-confirmation transactions are fairly safe today" to "encourages too much centralization and therefore evil." Joel suggested creating a peer-sourced green address implementation where each user could individually decide to trust certain addresses as "green" and optionally publish their trust. Based on the published trust, the system could dynamically evaluate the trustworthiness of each green address that the user hasn't personally decided to trust. However, this implementation would require heavy statistical calculations.</summary>
