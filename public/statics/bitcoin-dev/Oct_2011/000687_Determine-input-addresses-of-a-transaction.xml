    <summary>The conversation begins with an interesting suggestion on the usage of green address in transactions. The suggestion proposed that the signature generated from signing the transaction can be done with a key of a green address. It clarifies that it wouldn't have to be an actual key used in the block chain. The response shows surprise at the idea as they always assumed doing anything 'non-standard' with the scripting language would create a number of knock-on problems. However, the reply assures that it won't break the IsStandard checks. The conversation continues with the proposal of creating something to detect current green address style transactions. It is suggested that it's fine if it is a little bit of a hack as long as it's safe. The bitcoin code could easily be changed to detect such transactions. The criticism regarding this proposal ranges from unnecessary as 0-confirmation transactions are fairly safe today to encouraging too much centralization and therefore evil.The conversation ends on a lighter note where the feedback given is termed as strong.</summary>
