    <summary>On October 28, 2011 Gavin Andresen requested assistance in debugging the 'gitian' cross-compile for Windows builds on Bitcoin's Github page. The issue was related to Ubuntu and Andresen suggested using an alternative. He also expressed his desire to have a .pro file to compile bitcoind as maintaining multiple makefiles is difficult and prone to errors. He suggested implementing a GUI=0/1 option until a better system is put in place, ideally automake/autoconf.</summary>
