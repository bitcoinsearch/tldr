    <summary>In October 2011, Gavin Andresen reposted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about a new version of Bitcoin-Qt. Although there is good news about the improved GUI, bad news is that all translations for the old wxWidgets Bitcoin are obsolete. Andresen requests help in writing new translations and coordinating translation efforts. Three translations already exist: German, Dutch, and Russian. The translations are stored in ".ts" files in the src/qt/locale folder, and the 'QT Linguist' tool can be used to create translations. An online tool like Transifex could also be used to crowd-source the work. Links to the references are provided in the email.</summary>
