    <summary>The Bitcoin QT is reported to work excellently on Mac as it is easy to use and install. The user was surprised by how quickly the new wallet popped up after a pull and compile. However, the user has encountered an issue of not being able to see the tests subdirectory. The user is questioning how the unit tests are handled within this QT framework. Despite this concern, the user recommends Kiva.org as an avenue for making a small loan that can make a big difference.</summary>
