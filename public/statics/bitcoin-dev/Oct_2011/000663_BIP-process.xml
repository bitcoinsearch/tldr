    <summary>The proposal is to have BIPs as wiki pages, with the author having the final say in case of editing conflicts. The suggestion is to use GitHub's Wiki feature for BIPs, as it supports MarkDown and enables easy creation of a repository with all finalised BIPs. This is easier than importing a mediawiki dump. It is also recommended that BIPs should only contain images when necessary. The proposal suggests Amir as the BIP editor, subject to his willingness. Rather than having a specialized mailing list for Bitcoin ideas, it is suggested that potential BIPs be discussed on either the bitcoin-dev mailing list or the current platform.</summary>
