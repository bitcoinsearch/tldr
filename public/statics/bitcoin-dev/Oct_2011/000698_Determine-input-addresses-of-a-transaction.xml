    <summary>In this email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Jan, they discuss the idea of creating an interface to mark certain Bitcoin addresses as "trusted" and having an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) call to request all incoming transactions that originate from trusted sources. Jan suggests that it would be better if they could query for a specific transaction ID to see if it comes from a trusted source and also from which trusted source. This would help keep track of the amount of unconfirmed funds being accepted from a specific source. However, Jan admits that this may be too involved for his level of familiarity with the Bitcoin source code and C++.</summary>
