    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin development mailing list posted about updating `makefile.osx` and `build-osx.txt`, assuming that MacPorts versions of dependencies would be used and `-mt boost` libraries would be used. He also mentioned modifying `makefile.unix` and `makefile.osx` to auto-build dependencies using `gcc's -MMD` option. Another member suggested installing the newer 1.46 version of Boost packages from Macports. However, the original poster found that they had to add `libz.a` to the `makefile.osx`, which was apparently coming from the crypto libraries. The email signature encouraged readers to check out Kiva.org to learn about making small loans with a big difference.</summary>
