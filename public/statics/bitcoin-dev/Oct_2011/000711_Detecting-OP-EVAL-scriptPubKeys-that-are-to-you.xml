    <summary>Gavin Andresen suggests making a "both of two" btc-addresses script transaction using OP_EVAL to buy him and Gregory a shared beer. However, this transaction won't show up in the bitcoin wallet as spendable bitcoins. Even if the wallet showed transactions involving the keys but not spendable, it would still not be possible to know that Gregory has public key XYZ unless mentioned by Gavin. Therefore, the long-term solution is to move away from bitcoin addresses and create an infrastructure for paying people or organizations; however, creating a new type of bitcoin address on top of OP_EVAL will be easy to support with existing infrastructure in the short term.</summary>
