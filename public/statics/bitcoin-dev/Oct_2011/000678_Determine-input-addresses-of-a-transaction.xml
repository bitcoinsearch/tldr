    <summary>The speaker is suggesting that green addresses could be implemented as a second signature in the scriptSig. This solution would address one of the issues with the green address idea - that there needs to be a trust aggregator to sign transactions. The trusted authority could verify that transactions are coming from the correct source, such as MtGox, then sign and broadcast them. This would provide more security for merchants using green addresses.</summary>
