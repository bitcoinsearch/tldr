    <summary>A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), BIP 0010, has been posted on GitHub by Alan. The proposal aims to create a standard method for proposing how to spend multi-signature transaction outputs and collecting signatures without having to understand the technical details of Bitcoin. Alan envisions that moderately-interested users will be able to figure out the process without needing a third-party service. However, an installed program that automatically detects .txdp files could make this functionality available to even more users. The proposal is open for discussion and improvement, with Gavin suggesting the use of Base64 instead of hex for block-encoding. Alan prefers Base58 as it's already in developers' codebases. Additionally, the separation of fields by underscore characters could be changed to spaces to make it easier for C++ to read them in using stream operators.</summary>
