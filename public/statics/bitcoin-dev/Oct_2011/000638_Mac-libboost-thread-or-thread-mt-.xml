    <summary>Brian McQueen had installed Boost using Mac ports but realized that it only had lobboost_thread-mt and not libboost_thread.a. He was wondering if he should modify the makefile or get a different version of Boost. The -mt suffix indicates that the library has been built in multithreading aware mode, however, this suffix was removed from Linux and Mac builds in version 1.42. It is unclear what this means for a threading library. If Brian is linking against version 1.42 or higher on Linux/Mac, adding or removing the -mt suffix would not make any difference according to Matt's response on StackOverflow.</summary>
