    <summary>Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, has shared an update on Bitcoin development. Wladimir has joined the core dev team and will be working on 0.5 release candidate 1 binaries. Network stability and wallet security are top priorities, with start-up experience for new users next on the list. Andresen is concerned about the lack of attention given to Amir's Bitcoin Improvement Process proposal, and plans to help improve it and write some BIPs. He has set up a public-write-only mailing list to report and discuss potential security or denial-of-service vulnerabilities in the bitcoin protocol. In terms of what he is working on or plans to work on soon, Andresen highlighted experimenting with multi-signature transactions, writing BIPs proposing OP_EVAL and standard multi-signature transactions, preventing denial-of-service attacks, testing infrastructure, tightening block-time rules, discouraging bad behavior from miners or nodes, and headers-only-for-initial-download. Longer term goals include rethinking/reworking transaction fees and creating a non-profit organization to pay core developers, testers, a PR person, and more.</summary>
