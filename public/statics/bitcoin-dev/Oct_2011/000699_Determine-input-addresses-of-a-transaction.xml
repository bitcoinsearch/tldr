    <summary>In an email thread dated October 24th, 2011, Gavin Andresen suggested a method to extract addresses from transaction inputs. Based on this idea, Jan created a patch and shared it in the thread. To prevent slowing down listtransactions or gettransaction, he created a separate RPC call called 'getorigins'. Jan also included a link to the patch on GitHub for review. He asked if there were any obvious mistakes made in the patch.</summary>
