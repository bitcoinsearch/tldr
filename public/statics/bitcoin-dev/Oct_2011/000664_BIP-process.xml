    <summary>The proposal suggests that Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be created as wiki pages, with the author having the final say in case of any editing disputes. Amir is suggested as a potential editor for the BIPs. The discussion regarding new potential BIPs can take place on either the current platform or the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. Gavin has started some proposals on GitHub's Wiki feature, and this direction is deemed appropriate. A separate repository for similar proposals could be maintained to keep them distinct from the core Bitcoin repository.</summary>
