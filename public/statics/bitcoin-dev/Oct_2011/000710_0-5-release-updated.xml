    <summary>The discussion is about implementing a GUI option to the bitcoin-qt.pro until a better build system is implemented. The idea of using qmake for daemon build was proposed but it was pointed out that qmake does not add anything for non-qt software, thus sticking with a makefile would be better. The suggestion of creating a bash script that wraps both builds and converts command line flags was also made. The ultimate goal is to make it easier for the user.</summary>
