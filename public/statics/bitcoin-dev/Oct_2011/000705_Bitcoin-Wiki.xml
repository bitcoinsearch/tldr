    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list thread from 2011, users discuss using Git as a backup for important information. Specifically, Nils Schneider asks if they can use a git repo or something more redundant for BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) since the wiki has been unreliable before. Daniel F responds with a +1 on git and suggests using Github pages, which automagically pushes git commits out to the website. Amir Taaki also chimes in, asking how to contact MT about getting the BIPs back online so he can finish copy-editing them and add a new one. Throughout the discussion, there are links to Github, Cisco Self-Assessment, and the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
