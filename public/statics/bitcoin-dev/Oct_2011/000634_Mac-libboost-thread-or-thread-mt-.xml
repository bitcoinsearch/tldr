    <summary>Brian reached out to Michael stating that he installed boost via the Mac ports, but he was missing libboost_thread.a. He was inquiring if he should modify the makefile or obtain a different version of boost. Michael replied that he had a similar issue with his cmake btc buildsystem and recommended that Brian change the name to -mt. In addition to their conversation, an advertisement for Kiva.org was included, which is a website where people can make small loans to make a big difference, and an advertisement for Splunk, which is a tool that makes sense of data generated in IT infrastructure. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
