    <summary>The Contracts wiki page discusses the creation, storage, and transmission of transactions in a P2P network. Transactions are passed around outside the P2P network and are not broadcasted right away. The page raises questions about how these transactions will be brought back into the P2P network once they are out. The context highlights the importance of understanding the process of transaction handling and emphasizes the need for further exploration on the topic. Additionally, the context provides a link to Kiva.org, a website focused on making a big difference through small loans.</summary>
