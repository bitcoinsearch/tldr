    <summary>The author has completed a larger batch of rebased branches that are ready to be merged to mainline. These branches can be viewed at http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/w/bitcoind/luke-jr.git/heads. The first branch, 'coinbaser', allows customization of which addresses are paid by generation and adds the "setworkaux" JSON-RPC call to add data to the coinbase which can be used for merged-mining. The second branch, 'txinfo', adds "pooledtx", "currentblocktx", and "currentblocksize" to the output of the JSON-RPC 'getinfo' method and adds "block_hash" and "block_index" to transactions shown by 'listtransactions' and similar JSON-RPC methods. The third branch, 'force_send', disables automatically adding minimum fees for JSON-RPC methods and instead returns an error or sends the transaction with the user-specified fee if the new second parameter "force" is set in the 'settxfee' JSON-RPC call. The fourth branch, 'eligius_relay', relays transactions that satisfy Eligius's minimum fee when it's lower than the default rules and 'eligius_sendfee' allows sending the lower fee between default and Eligius and adds relay.eligius.st to the DNS seed list. Finally, the fifth branch, 'bugfix_CreateThread_ThreadSocketHandler_errReporting', reports an error in debug.log. Eligius has tested the first branch quite a bit under the 0.3.23 codebase while the author has been using the second branch since 0.3.21 without issues. The author states that whether or not to merge the last two branches is up to those involved as they do not care either way.</summary>
