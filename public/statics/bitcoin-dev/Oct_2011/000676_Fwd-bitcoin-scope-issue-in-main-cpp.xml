    <summary>In an email conversation between John Smith and theymos, they discussed a bitcoin scope issue in main.cpp. Theymos mentioned that it is legal for a scope to define variables with names that conflict with the names of variables in higher-level scopes. John Smith acknowledged this fact but also noted that if all the 'This is legal in C++' tricks were pulled in the bitcoin source, it would make the code even less maintainable and readable than it already is. The email thread ended with a Cisco advertisement for IT networking professionals.</summary>
