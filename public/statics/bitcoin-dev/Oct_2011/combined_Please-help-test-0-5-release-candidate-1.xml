    <summary>Gavin Andresen announced the release of Bitcoin version 0.5.0rc1 on the forums, and requested compilation and testing from users who are able to do so. The INSTALL file at the top of the source tree provides instructions for compiling while binary releases should be available for unix and mac users in the next couple of days. However, there is a show-stopper bug on Windows and they would like help from people familiar with cross-compiling using mingw to update the Windows build process. There are major changes from version 0.4 including switching from wxWidgets for the GUI to Qt, using Wladimir J. van der Laan's bitcoin-qt. This was done because they did not have any wxWidgets programmers contributing fixes or improvements. New JSON-RPC commands were added which include getmemorypool, listsinceblock, signmessage/verifymessage, and public/private keypair. Deprecated JSON-RPC features include midstate data item from getwork requests, and deprecated JSON-RPC commands that have been removed include setlabel, getlabel, getaddressesbylabel, getamountreceived, getallreceived, getreceivedbylabel, and listreceivedbylabel. A complete list of changes can be obtained by running git shortlog --no-merges v0.4.0. Gavin also mentioned that the wallet does not relock on Win32. One user compiled this on Debian and tested it to encrypt their wallet (coming from v0.3) and changed the password a couple of times without problems. They reported that the new GUI looks nicer and more stylish than the previous one and that they like the notifications and system tray icon on the status bar. Finally, someone posted a link to version 0.5 binaries.</summary>
