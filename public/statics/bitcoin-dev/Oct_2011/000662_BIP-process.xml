    <summary>Amir has started the BIP process, which was created by him to make changes to bitcoin in a more formal way. The BIPs are used for changes that may affect every bitcoin implementation. The author proposes minor changes to the BIP process. The author suggests that BIPs should be wiki pages with the author having the final word in editing wars. It is proposed that Amir takes the role of BIP editor. The author also suggests that new potential BIPs be discussed on either the given mailing list or bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
