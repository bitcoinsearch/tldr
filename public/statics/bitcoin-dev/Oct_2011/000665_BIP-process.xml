    <summary>In this email thread from 2011, Alex Waters proposed that Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) be created as wiki pages, with the author having final say in case of editing disputes. Amir was suggested as the BIP editor and it was agreed upon. The discussion also touched on whether a specialized mailing list for bitcoin ideas was necessary or if potential BIPs should be discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. It was decided that posting them on the bitcoin-dev mailing list would be sufficient. Gavin Andresen had started proposals on using GitHub's Wiki feature, which was seen as a step in the right direction. Alex Waters also included an advertisement for a Learning at Cisco Self-Assessment for IT networking professionals.</summary>
