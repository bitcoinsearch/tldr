    <summary>In an email conversation on October 10, 2011, Mike Hearn and Luke-Jr discussed the use of bitcoind for Eligius. Luke-Jr mentioned that he would no longer be using bitcoind for Eligius soon. When asked about an alternative, Mike Hearn replied that he was writing custom software designed to create work more efficiently. However, he clarified that bitcoind would still serve the purpose of peering with external nodes and selecting valid transactions to be accepted into blocks, but it would not be involved in the primary operations of the pool.</summary>
