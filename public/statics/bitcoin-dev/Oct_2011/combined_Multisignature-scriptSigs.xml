    <summary>Gavin Andresen, in a conversation thread, discusses his proposal for increasing the number of signatures allowed for IsStandard() transactions. Currently, IsStandard() checks that the size of scriptSig is not above 200, but Andresen is proposing a maximum of three signatures for these transactions, which would result in a 600-byte scriptSig. The increase in the number of allowed signatures will occur once BIPS 11 and 12 are adopted. Additionally, Andresen suggests implementing green addresses as an extra signature on the first scriptSig in a transaction to avoid generating two separate transactions. Andresen acknowledges the temptation to increase the maximum number of signatures from three to eight or ten, but he recommends staying conservative about IsStandard() transaction size until bitcoin-qt gets smarter about downloading just block headers. He also proposes that miners should make policy decisions on minimum fee per kilobyte or ECDSA signature check, how many free transactions (if any) they'll include in the blocks they create, and transaction priority / maximum block size / free-transaction area / transaction fees that need to be reworked. Finally, Andresen suggests bitcoin clients should be smarter about looking at what transactions are and are not getting into the chain so they can suggest appropriate fees to users.</summary>
