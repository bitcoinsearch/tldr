    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a member of the Bitcoin community, proposed two potential changes to tighten up block-time rules and discourage blocks or transactions that are bad for the common good. However, these proposals were criticized as not effective in solving the problems they aimed to address. The first proposal was deemed unnecessary because the block-time rules were already strict enough for the two-week window. The second proposal was considered flawed because it could only be useful for extreme cases where miners intentionally create lots of 1 MB blocks of junk. Overall, the community did not find these proposals beneficial and advised against implementing them.</summary>
