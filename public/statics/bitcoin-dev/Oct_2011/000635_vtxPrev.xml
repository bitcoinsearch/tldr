    <summary>Michael is looking to enable a split between thin clients holding the wallet and servers holding blocks and transaction database. While trying to simplify WalletTx, he came across vtxPrev in the code. VtxPrev is used for resubmitting transactions in case they and their supporting transactions are lost due to invalid blocks. However, vtxPrev stores three transactions back, which is overkill since it guards against transactions more than 21 confirmations back. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the transaction owner will be online, and the money could have already been respent. Michael questions whether or not vtxPrev is needed at all.</summary>
