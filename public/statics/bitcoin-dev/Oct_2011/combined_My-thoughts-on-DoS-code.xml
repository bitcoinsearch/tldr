    <summary>The Zen of Python's principle of refusing to guess in the face of ambiguity is applicable to nodes that implement standards. Any node that does not comply with the standard should be immediately shunned. This will not only ensure long-term compatibility between different implementations but also enhance security. Gavin advocates leniency to make it easier for people working on other implementations, but the author argues that everything should be strict, explicit, unambiguous, and loud. The author proposes a new message type called "error," with a payload comprising a uint64_t error_code and var_str reason. Before disconnecting a node, an error message can be sent, and the error_code can be used as the main class of error. Other possible fields include seriousness (debug, info, warning, error, fatal) and action_taken (disconnect, blacklist, etc.).</summary>
