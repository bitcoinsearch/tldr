    <summary>The author of the message is highlighting an issue with bitcoind, which has been ongoing for several weeks. The problem is that bitcoind stops responding to RPC calls, but there are no other suspicious activities in the bitcoind log and CPU usage is low. This issue has been observed in both versions 0.8.2 and 0.8.5, and originally occurred only once or twice per day. However, on the day of writing, monitoring scripts had restarted bitcoind more than thirty times, leading the author to raise their concerns. They note that this issue is occurring across various backends, indicating that it is not a problem isolated to one specific node. The author is seeking input from others who may be experiencing a similar issue.</summary>
