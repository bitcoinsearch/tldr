    <summary>On September 10, 2013, slush sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list to announce the finalization of the draft and reference implementation of BIP39. The proposal aims to standardize algorithms across various clients and fix some design problems of existing but not yet standardized Electrum mnemonic algorithm. BIP39 is a nice complement to BIP32, which allows users to (paper) backup and share their wallet across multiple clients easily. The link to BIP39 is provided in the email. Additionally, the email includes an advertisement for ServiceNow, a platform that helps IT people transform IT departments by consolidating legacy IT systems, standardizing and globalizing service processes across IT, and implementing zero-touch automation to replace manual, redundant tasks.</summary>
