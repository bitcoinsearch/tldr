    <summary>The payment protocol provides an option for using signed certificates, but it is not mandatory. This has led to concerns about the lack of cryptographic proof of identity, making it possible for someone to use another person's name and face in payment requests. Without some form of verification, this could lead to fraudulent activity and potentially harm individuals or businesses. It is important to consider the security implications of using payment systems and take steps to protect against unauthorized access or use.</summary>
