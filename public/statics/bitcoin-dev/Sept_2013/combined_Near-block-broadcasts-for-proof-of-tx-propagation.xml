    <summary>The current system lacks a way for a node to know if a transaction has been broadcast successfully. This creates difficulties in determining whether a transaction failed to propagate or pay sufficient fees. Broadcasting blocks that almost met the difficulty target can provide clients with fast and honest proof about the hashing power mining their transaction. However, mempool-based fee estimation is limited by the ability of peers to lie, especially to SPV peers. Miners have the ability to conduct sybil attacks where they can lie about the average fees required to get transactions into blocks.Miner incentives to create near blocks include pre-propagating transactions, reducing block propagation times, and determining the majority side in the event of a fork. Near blocks should contain two types of information: transactions known to the miner but not included in the current block, and transactions the miner is attempting to mine. Transaction mutability complicates both types of information. Bandwidth usage is reasonable. An out-of-band fee payment service can use near-blocks to check that their fee offer has been accepted and miners are mining their transaction. Spot-check auditing can detect any withholding of valid bloom filter matches. However, proof-of-propagation and proof-of-mining allow miners to cheat, leading to an argument that miners need to prove they possess the UTXO set. Overall, there are several limitations and challenges in the current system, particularly in terms of transaction broadcasting and fee estimation. The use of near-blocks and spot-check auditing can help address some of these issues, though there is still room for improvement in the system.</summary>
