    <summary>The team behind BitcoinKit.framework has pushed out their first test release of Hive, an OS X wallet. The wallet is focused on usability and discovery, but the team warns that it still lacks many basic features, so it is not ready for serious use yet. However, the team wants to gather feedback and hopefully some assistance from the community as early as possible. The new version of BitcoinKit.framework was updated recently with bitcoinj support. If anyone is interested in including an app for their Bitcoin-supporting service in Hive, they can get in touch with the team through grabhive.com or twitter.com/grabhive.</summary>
