    <summary>In September 2013, a problem with the bitcoind software was reported on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The issue involved bitcoind stopping responses to RPC calls without any other suspicious activity in the log, low CPU usage or standard disk I/O. This issue was observed with versions 0.8.2 and 0.8.5 and occurred several times a day on various backends. A workaround for this issue was found on GitHub, where it was suggested that building with more RPC threads can resolve the issue. It was noted that 0.8.2 was the first version of Bitcoin to support RPC keepalive and with the four RPC thread limit, four keepalive connections would exhaust all four and prevent further connections.</summary>
