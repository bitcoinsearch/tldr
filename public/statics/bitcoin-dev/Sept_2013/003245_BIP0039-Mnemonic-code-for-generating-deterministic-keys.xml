    <summary>The author expresses a desire to combine a mnemonic code generator with an NLP engine to output a short, humorous story as a passphrase, with the key encoded in the story itself. The author also provides a link about the failures of unsanitized word lists, indicating that it can be problematic to get one of these things wrong. Following this, there is a conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Matthew Mitchell, where Mitchell expresses concern about potentially offensive or threatening words being generated by the tool. Maxwell suggests using mechanical turk to rate the words for potential offensiveness and threatening nature, and recommends using neutral nouns rather than place names which may have political complications.</summary>
