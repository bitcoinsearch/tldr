    <title>Payment Protocol: BIP 70, 71, 72</title>

    <summary>The discussion among Bitcoin developers revolves around saving space while ensuring the safety of transactions. One developer questions why a URI containing instructions for making a payment cannot include an HTTP request, as long as the URL is HTTPS or using a secured Bluetooth connection. However, another developer raises concerns about trust when scanning a QR code from a foreign phone and adding an HTTP request to it, as that can void the trust of the transaction. The possibility of implementing BIP70 to directly put the payment request into the QR code is mentioned. In terms of making QR codes more scannable, one developer suggests changing the "request" parameter in BIP72 to just "r" and Gavin Andresen approves, citing smaller QR codes as a good reason to do so. The email also includes information about free Intel webinars on accelerating application performance.</summary>
