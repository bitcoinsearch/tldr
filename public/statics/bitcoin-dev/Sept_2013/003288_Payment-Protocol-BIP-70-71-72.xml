    <summary>In a discussion on the security of Bitcoin URIs, Melvin Carvalho suggests that while government or large corporations may be able to carry out MITM attacks on HTTPS, the incentive for them to do so is probably not there. However, data loss prevention (DLP) products often have MITM capability to prevent proprietary information exfiltration and some companies use full packet capture policies. The technology is available and people buy and use it. While the incentive for MITM attacks in this specific case may be low, detecting transactions could be more useful to attackers than meddling with them. A list of companies offering such products can be found at http://bluecabinet.info/wiki/Blue_cabinet#List_of_companies.</summary>
