    <summary>In a post on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Mark Friedenbach discussed his desire to abstract out the UTXO and block databases so that a variety of key/value stores could be used as a backend, configured by a command line parameter. Friedenbach mentioned that it would be interesting for some server applications to support HyperDex which is basically a distributed, fault-tolerant version of LevelDB, and that he would like to support a Sophia backend by the same mechanism.  Mike Hearn responded to Friedenbach's post and noted that while LevelDB is fast, it isn't the last word in performance. He went on to mention that HyperLevelDB is a forked version of LevelDB with some changes, mostly, finer grained locking and changes to how compaction works. Sophia is a competitor to LevelDB, and according to Hearn, the website claims that in benchmarks it completely smokes LevelDB. However, Hearn did not explore how it does this or try to replicate their benchmarks himself. Random reads are of course the most interesting for UTXO lookups, and Sophias claims to be capable of doing 438,084 reads/sec whereas LevelDB can do 167,476 random reads per second.</summary>
