    <summary>In September 2013, a proposal was suggested on the Bitcoin-development mailing list to create a new payment type that would be unspendable and could be used to support embedding data in the blockchain as a hash. The idea was to separate this class of Bitcoin usage from normal Bitcoin addresses to improve the core Bitcoin payments system. The proposal suggests creating a script with a single 20 byte push data which would have optimization possibilities and avoid indexing in an address database Bitcoin addresses which are currently being used to index data. Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., provided the context for this proposal in his email response which included links to sources supporting the idea of embedding data in the blockchain as a hash.</summary>
