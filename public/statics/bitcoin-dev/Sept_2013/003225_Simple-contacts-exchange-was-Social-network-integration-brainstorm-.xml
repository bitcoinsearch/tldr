    <summary>In 2013, Wendell and his team were considering ways to exchange contact details between wallets in order to encourage the use of identifiable names and photos instead of long, hard-to-verify addresses. One version of this idea involved sending Bitcoin and inserting a data lookup hash into the transaction. When the recipient receives the Bitcoin, they can do a lookup using the hash and instead of seeing a dialogue with just the sender's address, they would see the sender's name and photo. The challenge was finding a decentralized way to store this data without relying on dedicated servers that could be coerced into giving data or altering the system. One suggestion was to encrypt the data so that only the recipient of the transaction could do the lookup. Additionally, they considered deleting the data after a certain amount of time had passed. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
