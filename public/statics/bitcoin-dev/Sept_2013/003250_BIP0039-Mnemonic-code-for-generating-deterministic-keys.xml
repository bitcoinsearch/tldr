    <summary>In an email conversation on 11/09/2013, Andreas Petersson suggested that using NLP (Natural Language Processing) can generate a grammatically correct sentence out of 128 random bits that humans could remember. He also stated that information can be encoded in the selection of words and the choice of syntax tree. This idea was explored further, but the problem was that it required a larger wordlist containing more obscure words which could increase complexity. Additionally, this scheme had to run on embedded devices, so any unnecessary complexity should be avoided.</summary>
