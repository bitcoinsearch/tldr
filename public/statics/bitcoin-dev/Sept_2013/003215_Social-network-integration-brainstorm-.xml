    <summary>Mike Hearn proposed watermarking images with Bitcoin addresses to connect social networking profiles without the need for API access. Although the process would be manual and undone every time a user changes their profile image, it could still be a helpful way to organize Bitcoin around people and organizations in a familiar way. Blockchain.info offers sending 'coin via Facebook, and Bitcoins With Friends is another option, but most other apps have vanished due to Facebook's lack of friendliness towards them. The thread is open for discussion on other ideas to make Bitcoin easier to use. The advantage of watermarking is that every social network supports profile pictures, and Facebook and Twitter allow querying of users' pictures without needing API or authentication. A library exists that can implement watermarking to survive social network recompression, but it is written in Java.</summary>
