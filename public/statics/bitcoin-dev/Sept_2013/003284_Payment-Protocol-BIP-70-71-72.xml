    <summary>In an email exchange on September 25, 2013, Mike Hearn and an unnamed recipient discussed the usability of QR codes in Bitcoin transactions. The recipient suggested using a specific protocol to generate QR codes for Bitcoin payments, but Hearn expressed concern about the size of the resulting URLs. They also discussed potential security risks associated with certificate authorities and MITM attacks, noting that HTTPS could protect against some attacks but not those involving scanning QR codes in person. They also briefly touched on the idea of using Bluetooth technology for ECDHE during payment protocol implementation.</summary>
