    <summary>The post announces the finalization of the draft and reference implementation of BIP39, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal aimed at standardizing the algorithm across various clients and fixing some design problems of the existing Electrum mnemonic algorithm. The proposal is now open for comments in accordance with rules stated in BIP0001. BIP39 is seen as a nice complement to BIP32, allowing users to (paper) backup and share their wallet across multiple clients easily. A link to BIP0039 is provided for further information.</summary>
