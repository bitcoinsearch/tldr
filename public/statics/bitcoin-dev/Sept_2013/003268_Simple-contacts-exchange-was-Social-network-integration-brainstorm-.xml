    <summary>In this conversation, Wendell is seeking feedback on a payment protocol for their wallet. They are unsure of why signed certificates are required and believe it could be an obstacle to adoption. Mike Hearn responds by suggesting that a BIP could be designed to solve this issue and extend the payment protocol to include information about the person who generated it. Wendell then brings up two points, including the need to verify uploaded keys and securely exchange metadata beyond the scope of Bitcoin. Overall, they aim to road-test something quickly for the sake of user experience in their own wallet before potentially contributing to a BIP.</summary>
