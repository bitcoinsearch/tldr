    <summary>The conversation between Andreas Schildbach and an unknown person discusses the issue of using HTTPS trust in Bitcoin protocol. The person argues that it is unnecessary to use a certificate if you see your partner in person. However, the SSL PKI is still being upgraded and there is a plan for handling governments and other entities subverting CA's called certificate transparency. When getting a QR code from the web, it is already served over HTTPS, but if an attacker can break a CA to steal money, then the user loses, as the QR code itself is MITMd. In the Bluetooth case, a custom security layer will be needed once the protocol begins reading data.</summary>
