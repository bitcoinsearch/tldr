    <summary>In an email exchange in 2013, Mike Hearn discussed the performance of LevelDB, stating that while it is fast, it's not the ultimate solution for performance. He had also looked into HyperLevelDB but found that its performance graphs suggested it would be slower for the database sizes they were using at the time. Hearn then asked if there was a competitor that specializes in being more robust to corruption.</summary>
