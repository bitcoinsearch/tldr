    <summary>In a discussion on September 7, 2013 at astutium.com, the need for an archival system for bitcoin protocol to avoid blockchain becoming too big to download was raised. While some people may want to download the entire blockchain, it was suggested that balance at point-in-time summaries (up until the penultimate difficulty adjustment) could be a simple solution. This would enable new-adopters to get up and running in minutes rather than days. Bitcoin-Qt 0.9 was expected to have Pieter's work incorporated to enable quick usability and background verification of the history. The question of consolidating addresses and wallets was also raised, but it was clarified that addresses are single-use destinations that point to a wallet, which is private and unknown to the network.</summary>
