    <summary>The author is considering ways to automatically exchange contact details between wallets to encourage identifiable names and photos instead of hard-to-verify addresses. The proposed method involves inserting a data lookup hash into the transaction, which would allow the recipient to see the sender's name and photo instead of their address. The author is looking for a decentralized way to implement this feature without relying on dedicated servers that could compromise user data. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome.</summary>
