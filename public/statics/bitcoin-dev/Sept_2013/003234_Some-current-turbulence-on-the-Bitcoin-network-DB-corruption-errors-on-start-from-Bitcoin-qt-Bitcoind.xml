    <summary>Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin developer, has announced that he has a patch available for review concerning the cryptocurrency's blockchain vulnerability. The patch is available at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2982 and more information will be provided once it has been fully reviewed by other developers. In the meantime, Maxwell recommends using the checklevel=2 workaround as an adequate solution. It is advised to wait until other developers have had a chance to review the patch before applying it.</summary>
