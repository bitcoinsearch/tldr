    <summary>In this email thread dated 29 September 2013, Neil Fincham expresses his desire to keep philosophy and tax evasion out of discussions related to Bitcoin development. Gavin Andresen agrees with him and suggests that the focus should be on technical issues that can be solved by writing code. Neil had presented a use case and wanted to know if it was technically feasible using smart contracts. In the end, Gavin signs off with information about October webinars on Code for Performance, which can help accelerate application performance. The email thread is part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge.net.</summary>
