    <summary>On September 25th, 2013, Mike Hearn initiated a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the size of QR codes and their scannability. He suggested that the BIP72 parameter should be changed to "r" instead of "request" to make QR codes smaller. Andreas Schildbach expressed concern about trust issues when scanning a QR code from an unknown phone and then adding an HTTP request. Hearn proposed that if the protocol part (https://) is missing, it is implied automatically. Gavin Andresen agreed with Hearn's suggestion and said that smaller QR codes are a good reason to change the BIP72 parameter. The discussion also touched upon the security of HTTPS and MITM attacks. Hearn argued that a large entity such as a government or corporation may be able to MITM HTTPS, but the incentive to do so is probably not there. The email thread ended with a link to free Intel webinars on optimizing application performance.</summary>
