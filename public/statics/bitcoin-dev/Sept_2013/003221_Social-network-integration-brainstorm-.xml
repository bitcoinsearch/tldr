    <summary>The Trsst project aims to enable content monetization through micro payments of digital crypto-currency. Each user account on the platform is a digital wallet, and authors can receive payments each time their content is consumed, shared or liked. Wendell, who is interested in making Bitcoin easier to use, suggests watermarking addresses into social network profile pictures to link them to personal profiles. With this approach, users can send Bitcoin to any Facebook user who has configured their profile correctly. A library that implements watermarking that can survive social network recompression exists, but it is written in Java. While most apps have vanished due to Facebook's lack of support for them, Blockchain.info offers sending 'coin via Facebook and Bitcoins With Friends is also available.</summary>
