    <summary>In an email exchange dated 10/09/13 at 23:03, Matthew Mitchell suggested to Pavol Rusnak that their wordlist may have been better without the use of aggressive words. In response, Rusnak revisited the wordlist and replaced approximately 67 words that could be found offensive in certain contexts. The changes made were aimed at improving the list's overall tone and sensitivity towards different audiences.</summary>
