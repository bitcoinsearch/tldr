    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol requires an archival system to ensure that the blockchain does not become too large to download. One solution to this problem could be a balance at point-in-time summary, which would allow new adopters to get up and running in minutes instead of days. To implement this solution, consolidation of addresses and wallets, as well as formal discarding of addresses, would need to be addressed.</summary>
