    <summary>The discussion is regarding QR codes and BIP70 implementation. The issue of trust arises while scanning QR codes from foreign phones as it requires trust that the phone is owned by the intended recipient. Adding an HTTP request voids this trust. The conversation then shifts to making QR codes more scannable. Mike Hearn suggests that if the protocol part (https://) is missing, it is automatically implied. He also suggests using “r” instead of “request” to make the QR code smaller. Gavin Andresen agrees, stating that smaller QR codes are a good reason to make the change. The email concludes with information about upcoming Intel webinars on accelerating application performance.</summary>
