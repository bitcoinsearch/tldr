    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol requires an archival system to prevent the blockchain from becoming too large to download. The blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that contains all transactions made with bitcoins. It is continuously growing as new transactions are added, making it increasingly difficult for new nodes to download and verify the entire blockchain. To solve this issue, an archival system is needed to store old blocks, reducing the size of the active blockchain. An archival node is one that stores the entire blockchain history, enabling new nodes to download and verify only recent blocks. By implementing an archival system, the Bitcoin network can maintain decentralization and accessibility for all participants.</summary>
