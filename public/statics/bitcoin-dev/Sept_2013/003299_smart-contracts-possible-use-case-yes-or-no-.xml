    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark suggests that providing external audits of customer accounts without revealing private data could be useful beyond taxation. Adam Back responds by noting that there are examples in taxation where anonymity is accepted, such as with certain types of investments in Swiss banks. He suggests that such methods could also be possible for Bitcoin and recommends discussing this topic on the Bitcoin Talk forum instead.</summary>
