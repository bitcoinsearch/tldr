    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol requires an archival system to prevent the blockchain from becoming too large to download. The blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that contains all transactions made with bitcoins, making it increasingly difficult for new nodes to download and verify the entire blockchain. An archival node is one that stores the entire blockchain history, enabling new nodes to download and verify only recent blocks. By implementing an archival system, the Bitcoin network can maintain decentralization and accessibility for all participants.In a discussion on September 7, 2013, at astutium.com, the need for an archival system for bitcoin protocol to avoid blockchain becoming too big to download was raised. While some people may want to download the entire blockchain, it was suggested that balance at point-in-time summaries (up until the penultimate difficulty adjustment) could be a simple solution. This would enable new-adopters to get up and running in minutes rather than days.The email thread discusses the concept of trust-free solutions in Bitcoin. The sender argues that balance-at-point-in-time can solve the issue of being completely trust-free and reduce storage requirements. However, Jeff Garzik points out that it still requires bootstrapping into trust by an earlier dataset, creating a chain that is not entirely trust-free. There are discussions on UTXO snapshotting, which is somewhat like balance-at-point-in-time but not deemed trust-free. To have a completely trust-free solution, one must verify all data from genesis through $now.The discussion also covers the need for Bitcoin to grow beyond an interesting experiment into global everyday use, taking the average punter into account. The sender suggests that having the ability to specify the address to send from is essential and a missing feature of the QT client. Intra-wallet transfers with an "also discard the sending address" would be a way of stopping any further use of that address. When balance-at-point-in-time is implemented, this could shrink the storage for all other Bitcoin users who choose not to have a full transaction set.The sender also touches upon the need to verify the ability to send Bitcoin using balance-at-point-in-time efficiently. To do so, it's only necessary to know that the sender has the specified amount of Bitcoin, not all previous transactions that led to that state. This will increase efficiency as Bitcoin grows. The question of consolidating addresses and wallets was also raised, but it was clarified that addresses are single-use destinations that point to a wallet, which is private and unknown to the network. A family wallet would mean that when on holiday, they could rent quad-bikes using just the balance in their family wallet. If there were no transactions on the balance at that point, it would need to know about the previous transactions.It took 140 hours to download and process the blockchain when moving to a new netbook, while a client had to wait for over 9 days before it had caught up. If all that was downloaded were the transactions since the last difficulty change (as one example of a fixed point), it would have been much quicker and not slowed down the hard drive. The email thread ends with Jeff Garzik's signature.</summary>
