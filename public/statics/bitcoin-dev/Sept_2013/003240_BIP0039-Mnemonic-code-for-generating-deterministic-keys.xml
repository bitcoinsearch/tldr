    <summary>On September 10, 2013, slush finalized the draft and reference implementation of BIP39. The proposal aimed to standardize the algorithm across various clients and fix some design problems of an existing Electrum mnemonic algorithm that had not yet been standardized. BIP39 was a nice complement to BIP32, which allowed users to (paper) backup and share their wallet across multiple clients easily. The link to BIP is provided in the email. Matthew expressed like for this, though sometimes rude word combinations come out. The email also included an advertisement for ServiceNow, which helps IT people transform IT departments by consolidating legacy IT systems to a single system of record, standardizing and globalizing service processes across IT, and implementing zero-touch automation to replace manual, redundant tasks. The email concluded with information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
