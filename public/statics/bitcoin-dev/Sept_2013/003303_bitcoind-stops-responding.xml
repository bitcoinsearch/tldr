    <summary>A user on a Bitcoin development mailing list reported that their bitcoind stops responding to RPC calls when they attempt to send transactions every 20 seconds or less. They asked if anyone knew of a solution, fix, or workaround for this issue. Another member of the list suggested that the problem could be related to the four RPC thread limit in version 0.8.2 and later versions of Bitcoin supporting RPC keepalive. This issue can be resolved by building with more RPC threads. Additionally, another member of the list reported observing similar problems with bitcoind stopping responding to RPC calls without any suspicious activity in the log, low CPU usage, or standard disk I/O. This issue has been observed on various backends, suggesting it is not specific to one node. Finally, the email signature of the user who posted the message is included at the end of the email.</summary>
