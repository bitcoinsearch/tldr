    <summary>On Sep 5, 2013, Mike Hearn and Wendell discussed the idea of using assurance contracts to fund a public good. They referenced the 5-step model for assurance contracts described on the Bitcoin wiki and used the example of "Facebook contact synchronization" with a target of 50 BTC. However, they had no experience with the scripting language required for this method. Wendell asked for an example and clarification on whether donors needed to do anything esoteric, to which Hearn responded that it was a bit complicated and required software development. He also joked that the best way to fund complex projects would be through assurance contracts.</summary>
