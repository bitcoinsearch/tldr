    <summary>The email thread discusses embedding data in the blockchain as a hash, which has been made possible by services like Proof of Existence and sx-embed-addr. The author suggests creating a new payment type that is unspendable to support this, called "embed_hash." This would have optimization possibilities and avoid indexing Bitcoin addresses that are currently being used to index data but will never be spent. By separating this class of Bitcoin usage, it can improve the core Bitcoin payments system. The email ends with an unrelated advertisement for ServiceNow's IT transformation services.</summary>
