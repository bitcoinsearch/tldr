    <summary>The latest version of Bitcoin-Qt, version 0.8.5, has been released and can be downloaded from SourceForge. It is strongly recommended for all users to upgrade to this version as it includes a critical bug fix that affected all users. The bug caused transactions with version numbers larger than 0x7fffffff to be relayed and included in blocks incorrectly. Moreover, it caused the code that checks for LevelDB database inconsistencies at startup to suggest reindexing of the database even though there was no corruption. This release also includes a non-critical fix to the code that enforces BIP 34 (block height in the coinbase transaction).Users are encouraged to report any bugs they find using the issue tracker on Github. Special thanks were given to Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille for quickly identifying and fixing the transaction version number bug. It is important for users to keep their Bitcoin-Qt up to date and to download the latest version to avoid any potential issues.</summary>
