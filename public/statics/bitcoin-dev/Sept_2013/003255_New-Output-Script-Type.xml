    <summary>There are websites like www.proofofexistence.com and code repositories like https://github.com/spesmilo/sx/blob/master/src/sx-embed-addr that allow embedding data in the blockchain as a hash. The author suggests creating an unspendable payment type called "embed_hash" to support this feature. This new payment type would include a script with a single 20 byte push data, which offers optimization possibilities and avoids indexing Bitcoin addresses used for data indexing. By separating this usage from the core Bitcoin payment system, it could be improved.</summary>
