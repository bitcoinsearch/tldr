    <summary>BitPay has experimented with QR codes under low light and restaurant conditions. These conditions make it difficult to use QR codes, even at 100 characters. On the merchant side, a short URL is preferred for payments via bitcoin clients that will work smoothly if scanned by a phone without bitcoin support. The URL will redirect users to a BitPay invoice page for a standard browser. Andreas Schildbach and Mike Hearn have discussed QR code usage, HTTPS security, and the implementation of payment protocols. Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, signed off on the email.</summary>
