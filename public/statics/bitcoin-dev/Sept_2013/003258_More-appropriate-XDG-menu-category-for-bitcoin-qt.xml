    <summary>In a mailing list post, Kip Warner proposed refining the "Office" category in bitcoin-qt application's XDG desktop integration to "Finance," citing that XDG's menu specification allows for it. He suggested the line in bitcoin-qt.desktop should be modified to read "Categories=Office;Finance;" but mentioned his weak knowledge of Git and did not provide a patch himself. In response, Matt announced the pull request at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2999 which includes the new category. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
