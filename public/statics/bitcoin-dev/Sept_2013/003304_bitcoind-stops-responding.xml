    <summary>A new member of a Bitcoin mailing list, Fatima Castiglione Maldonado 发, was having an issue with their transactions not being accepted when using "sendToAddress" in bitcoind. According to them, the program would only accept between one and three transactions per minute depending on the machine being used. Attempting to send a transaction every 20 seconds or less resulted in bitcoind no longer responding to RPC calls. The issue was unrelated to a previous question from Slush. Furthermore, there is an exponential complexity associated with IsConfirmed/Ismine that can take tens of seconds when dealing with a chain of unconfirmed transactions. Some patches exist to address this issue, but as the network will only average about seven transactions per second, building chains of unconfirmed transactions may indicate an error in the process. The poster suggested that Fatima Castiglione Maldonado 发 try using sendmany instead.</summary>
