    <summary>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, the topic of QR code payments was being debated. Andreas Schildbach brought up concerns over trust when using an HTTP request in a QR code payment instead of relying solely on scanning a QR code from a phone. Mike Hearn suggested that the use of HTTPS is necessary to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, but Andreas countered that HTTPS trust is broken and suggested waiting for a BIP70 implementation to directly put the payment request into the QR code. Gavin Andresen agreed with Mike's suggestion to change the BIP72 parameter from "request" to "r" to help reduce the size of QR codes. The discussion also included an announcement for free Intel webinars on accelerating application performance.</summary>
