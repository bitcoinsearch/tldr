    <summary>There is a discussion about the reason why BerkleyDB is maintained for the wallet and whether it's necessary to get rid of the libdb4.8++-dev dependency that makes bitcoind harder to compile on Debian and Ubuntu. Mike Hearn shared his knowledge on some alternatives to LevelDB, such as HyperLevelDB and Sophia, which are claimed to be much faster than LevelDB in benchmarks. The differences between them are discussed, including finer-grained locking and changes to how compaction works. Sophia is written in C and BSD licensed, capable of doing 438,084 reads per second on their SSD based machine, while HyperLevelDB appears to be able to do random writes faster than Sophia.</summary>
