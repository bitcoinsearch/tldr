    <summary>The Hive team is working on an ethical and decentralized Bitcoin application platform. They plan to release everything as free software under a GPL license, including the app store and the apps themselves. They will be using bitcoinj with an integrated VM for the time being due to SPV. The team hopes to sustain themselves via small fees on transactions within the app platform. Wendell proposed a new approach to monetizing apps where businesses would need to have an affiliate scheme in place to be placed in the apps section. This would allow app developers to earn referral bonuses from businesses when they refer users to them through their app. Another alternative funding model suggested was allowing users to bid on assurance contracts for feature development. To use Bitcoin for managing pledges, people can either use a dedicated app or a wallet with the right features. There are pros and cons to each option. However, bitcoinj makes it easy to bring up a new GUI wallet app if written in Java. Thus, having a dedicated app for pledge management is quite straightforward.A v1 API has been released for an idea presented on the BitcoinTalk forum. The announcement was made by Wendell, who stated that there are currently no fees and only basic features available. Mike Hearn responded to the announcement, expressing interest in the idea. Contact information for grabhive.com, Twitter, and a GPG key were also provided.In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient, they discuss various aspects of an app store for Bitcoin. Mike suggests that it would be simpler to think of the app store as a set of affiliate schemes, where businesses must have an affiliate scheme in place to be placed into the apps section. Users who refer a lot of users to that business will receive referral bonuses. The apps do not have to be offline and should be online so businesses can retain control of their features and brand. However, Hive also plans to have a submission/review process to ensure user experience continuity and monitor potential exploits. One downside is that technical judgement may be distorted if projects push certain businesses heavily because their income depends on it. Mike also suggests another alternative funding model, allowing users to bid on assurance contracts for feature development.The conversation then shifts to the potential burden on users if the Bitcoin network were to start relaying blocks. It is pointed out that mobile and tablet devices have different capabilities and limitations compared to desktop computers and laptops. The team wants to support the network more via something like Peter Todd's partial UTXO sets idea, but they note that any schemes that rely on random end users donating lots of CPU time or bandwidth to the network may not be feasible as it ultimately utilizes the user's resources.On Sep 5, 2013, Mike Hearn and Wendell discussed the idea of using assurance contracts to fund a public good. They referenced the 5-step model for assurance contracts described on the Bitcoin wiki and used the example of "Facebook contact synchronization" with a target of 50 BTC. However, they had no experience with the scripting language required for this method. He also joked that the best way to fund complex projects would be through assurance contracts.</summary>
