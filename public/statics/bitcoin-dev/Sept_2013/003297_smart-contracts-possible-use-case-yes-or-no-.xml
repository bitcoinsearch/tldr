    <summary>On September 29th, 2013, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding taxation and donations in regards to bitcoin development. Neil Fincham expressed his desire to keep philosophy and tax evasion topics out of the discussion. Another member brought up concerns about the uncertain regulatory environment and whether or not taxes needed to be paid on capital gains or sales tax. The idea of voluntary donations to government for bitcoin service providers was proposed, but it was pointed out that most people are not satisfied with how their donations are spent, with 80% being spent on administration instead of the intended purpose. The topic of tax being voluntary or a donation was also discussed, with one member suggesting giving post-tax profits to the fire department as an example of controlling where the money goes. Overall, the discussion centered around the role of taxation and donations in bitcoin development and the dissatisfaction with how these funds are typically spent.</summary>
