    <summary>Low light conditions can make QR codes difficult to use, especially for printed codes. BitPay prefers short URLs that speak payment protocol, but it will still work if scanned by a phone with no Bitcoin support, redirecting the user to a BitPay invoice page. However, this may not be useful if a Bitcoin app is not installed on the device. The effect of scanning a QR code with a standalone scanner app is different from scanning it inside the wallet, which is unlike all other uses of QR codes known. The writer suggests that QR codes should always contain bitcoin URIs. Jeff Garzik expresses that BitPay experimented with QR codes in low light and restaurant conditions and found difficulties in using them even at 100 chars.</summary>
