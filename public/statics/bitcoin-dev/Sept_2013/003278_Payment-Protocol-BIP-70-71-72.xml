    <summary>In this conversation between Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, they discuss changing the BIP 72 parameter to make QR codes more scannable. Hearn suggests changing the new parameter from "request" to just "r" to save space in the QR code. Andresen agrees that smaller QR codes are a good reason for the change and there are no objections. Additionally, it is mentioned that if the protocol part (https://) is missing from a Bitcoin address, it is implied automatically. The conversation also includes an example of a small Bitcoin address without re-using the pubkey as a token in the URL.</summary>
