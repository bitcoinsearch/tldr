    <summary>The context discusses the use of NLP to generate a gramatically correct sentence out of 128 random bits that are easier to remember than bip 39 mnemonics. The author suggests using information encoding in both word selection and syntax tree choice to create a passphrase that is memorable yet secure. This idea was proposed previously, and the author notes that it would be an excellent project if they had enough spare time. Another individual expressed interest in combining an NLP engine with a mnemonic code generator to output a short story as a passphrase, with the key encoded within the story itself. The goal is to make passphrases more memorable while maintaining security.</summary>
