    <summary>In an email exchange, Wendell proposed a new approach to monetizing apps in which businesses would need to have an affiliate scheme in place to be placed in the apps section. This would allow app developers to earn referral bonuses from businesses when they refer users to them through their app. While this funding model is compatible with the ideals of openness, it can distort technical judgment as projects may push certain businesses heavily due to their income depending on it. Another alternative funding model suggested was allowing users to bid on assurance contracts for feature development, which would allow the community to direct development and feel directly involved.In another part of the email exchange, the use of bitcoinj with integrated VM was discussed, with the main draw being SPV (Simplified Payment Verification). However, it was noted that any schemes that rely on random end users donating lots of CPU time or bandwidth to the network may not be feasible as it ultimately utilizes the user's resources. It was suggested that Bitcoin will become more like Tor where relays are run on dedicated servers by people who have some modicum of knowledge and community involvement.</summary>
