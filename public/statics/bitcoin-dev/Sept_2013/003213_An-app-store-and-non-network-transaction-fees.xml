    <summary>The OS X wallet Hive has an integrated application platform that allows new users to discover Bitcoin businesses such as exchanges, merchants, and games. The locally hosted HTML/JS applications feature stripped-down UIs displayed in a mobile-proportioned WebKit frame inside of Hive itself. Transaction requests within apps trigger native Cocoa dialogue boxes, providing a nicely integrated and secure experience. The team hopes to one day sustain themselves via an aggregate of very small fees on transactions within the app platform, but they recognize that it is a kind of obligatory middleman. They are open-minded about their business model but want to be as ethical and decentralized as possible.The team is hesitant to use two brain-dead approaches: tracking user behavior and sending a bill or having each user send a micro-transaction to some address of their choosing. The first approach is messy and essentially makes them spyware, while the second approach is technically difficult, making a mess of transaction history, balances, and possibly in-app price listings. The team wants to explore fresher ideas before making a decision, prioritizing being ethical and decentralized.The team plans to release everything as free software under a GPL license, including the app store and the apps themselves. Although their BitcoinKit.framework supports both bitcoind and bitcoinj, they will be using bitcoinj with an integrated VM for the time being due to SPV. They would prefer to support the network more via something like Peter Todd's partial UTXO sets idea. Finally, the team will be attending a conference in Amsterdam on the 27th of this month if anyone wants to meet and discuss.</summary>
