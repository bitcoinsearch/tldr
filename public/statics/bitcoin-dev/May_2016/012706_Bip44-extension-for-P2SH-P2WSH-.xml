    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jonas Schnelli stated his opinion that importing a bip32 wallet is still an expert job. However, Pavol "stick" Rusnak disagreed with the statement and argued that all reasonable wallets now use BIP39 mnemonic for this purpose. Rusnak emphasized that these wallets are user-oriented and therefore, importing a bip32 wallet is no longer an expert job. Rusnak works at SatoshiLabs.com which is known for producing the hardware wallet Trezor.</summary>
