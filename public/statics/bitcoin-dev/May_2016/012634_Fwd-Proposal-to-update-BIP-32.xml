    <summary>The email thread is about a proposal to update BIP-32, primarily to provide a similar method for different curves where a collision is much more likely. BIPs are usually not updated with new ideas, only remarks, links, typos, clarifications, etc., so that their numbers can unambiguously be used to refer to an idea. The suggestion is to write a new BIP that overrides parts of BIP32 and put a note in BIP32 that a better mechanism is available that is unlikely to change things in reality for the secp256k1 curve. The proposed change in the algorithm suggests changing the last step of the private to private derivation function. The chance for failure is higher than 1 in 2^128 for high values of p. An alternative that always converges is to retry with an appended iteration count.</summary>
