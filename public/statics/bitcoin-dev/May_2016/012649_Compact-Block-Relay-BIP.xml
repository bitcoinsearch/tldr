    <summary>On May 9th, 2016, Peter R via bitcoin-dev wrote to Greg Maxwell. He was trying to understand the collision attack that Maxwell was explaining to Tom Zander. Peter stated that he followed up to a point where he found out that there is a good chance that a pair of transactions from a set of 2^32 will have a collision in the first 64 bits. However, he was perplexed about how to find that pair from within a large set. He explained that the only way he could think of was to check if the first 64-bits are equal for every possible pair until it is found. Peter then calculated the number of possible pairs there would be in a set of 2^32 transactions. He used the formula m! / [n! (m-n)!] and got the result as (2^32)! / [2! (2^32 - 2)!] ~ 2^63. This meant that there were approximately 2^63 comparisons required to identify which pair of transactions are the two that collide. Later on, on the same day (May 9th, 2016), at 6:40 PDT, Peter shared an update with those interested in the hash collision attack discussion. He mentioned that there is a faster way to scan your set of transactions to find the collision. He suggested keeping a sorted list of hashes for each transaction generated and then using binary search to check that list for a collision for each new transaction randomly generated. He mentioned that performing these operations could probably be reduced to N lg N complexity, which is doable for N ~2^32. Peter now agreed that the attack was feasible.</summary>
