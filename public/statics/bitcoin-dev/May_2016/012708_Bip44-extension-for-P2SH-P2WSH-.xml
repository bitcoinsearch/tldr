    <summary>The topic being discussed in this email thread is whether importing a BIP32 wallet is still an expert job. One person argues that it is not, as all reasonable wallets now use BIP39 mnemonic for this purpose. However, others point out several potential problems with the process. For example, some wallets may not support cross-wallet imports using BIP39, and there are concerns about what happens if the old wallet has used more than 1000 addresses or if most wallets do not offer moving funds to a new seed. Additionally, importing a BIP39 mnemonic into a hardware wallet could bypass some of the security that the hardware wallet provides, reducing the overall security of the wallet. Links are provided to various wallet issues on Github related to these concerns. Ultimately, the discussion suggests that importing a wallet, especially cross-wallet imports, is still a tricky step that may require expertise and further improvements.</summary>
