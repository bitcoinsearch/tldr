    <summary>In a discussion about TXO commitments, Peter Todd describes the proposal for a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR), which is an indexable and insertion ordered merkle tree. The MMR allows new items to be appended to the tree with minimal storage requirements, and once an output is added to the TXO MMR, it is never removed. The state of a specific item in the MMR and the validity of changes to items can be proven with log2(n) sized proofs consisting of a merkle path to the tip of the tree. Another participant in the discussion questions the cost of updating a leaf from unspent to spent in this tree and suggests having both an append-only TXO and an append-only STXO (with all spent outputs, not only the latest ones like in the "STXO" proposal).</summary>
