    <summary>In a conversation between Tom and Gregory Maxwell, they discuss the implementation of a new networking protocol for Bitcoin. Tom argues that the current protocol requires nodes to predict which node will have the best data in the future, while Gregory counters that this is not necessary for the proposed compact block relay. Tom also expresses concerns about the amount of unsolicited data being sent by nodes, but Gregory suggests using a "high bandwidth" mode to address this issue. They also discuss the use of service bits and UTF-8 encoding within the protocol. Finally, they debate the use of salting hashes versus truncated hashes, with Gregory arguing that salting is necessary to prevent collision attacks.</summary>
