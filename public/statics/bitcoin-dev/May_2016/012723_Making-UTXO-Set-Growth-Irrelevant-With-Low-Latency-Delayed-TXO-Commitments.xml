    <summary>In a conversation between Peter Todd and an unknown person, Todd explains that updating a leaf from a tree is just as expensive as adding a new one. The unknown person suggests having both an append-only transaction output (TXO) and an append-only spent transaction output (STXO), but Todd argues against it because indexing the STXO is more difficult due to the random position of new STXOs. However, if the STXO was indexed by txout creation order, it would be similar to Todd's proposed insertion-ordered TXO commitment. Todd notes that an insertion-order indexed Merkle tree is almost identical to a modified Merkle Mountain Range (MMR). The unknown person suggests having two separate MMRs, one for TXO and one for STXO, which Todd does not see the benefit in but is willing to discuss further.</summary>
