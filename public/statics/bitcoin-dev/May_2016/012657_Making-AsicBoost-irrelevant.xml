    <summary>Peter Todd, a contributor to the Bitcoin development community, proposed a hard fork in the HK agreement to render patented AsicBoost optimization useless. This move aims to prevent similar optimizations from being used as well. However, some members of the community pointed out that all changes to the protocol should be discussed publicly before implementation. The proposal was linked to a Medium article discussing the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus. Another link provided was an email thread discussing the use of AsicBoost technology in mining. To prevent future similar optimizations, Todd suggested switching to EquiHash.</summary>
