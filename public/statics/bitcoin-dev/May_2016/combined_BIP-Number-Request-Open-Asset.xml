    <summary>The Open Asset Protocol (OAP/1.0) is a well-known colored coin protocol used for creating and transferring assets on top of the Bitcoin protocol. The protocol has been in existence for over two years and uses OP_RETURN to store the color of the coin. Colored coins can be traded using transactions that preserve the quantity of every asset. The Open Assets Protocol allows outputs to encapsulate a quantity of a user-defined asset on top of the Bitcoin amount.The email conversation discusses a proposal for asset issuance on Bitcoin blockchain called Open Assets Protocol (OAP). It was originally proposed by Flavien Charlon, and it uses the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of the output script referenced by the first input of the transaction that initially issued that asset as the ID of an asset. An issuer can reissue more of an already existing asset as long as they retain the private key for that asset ID. The Open Asset protocol has been used in the wild since 2014 and cannot be easily modified. However, a new OA2.0 protocol can be created to address existing issues while ensuring that upgraded wallets continue to support both versions.The discussion also touches on the fact that there are other colored coin protocols in existence or being developed. ChromaWay is willing to replace EPOBC with something better and can support multiple different kernels, so adding a new protocol is not a big deal for them. Core developers may not be interested in colored coins, but Blockstream is developing a sidechain with user-defined assets that could be a preferred way of doing things. Investors do not need to install multiple wallets to deal with varying implementations since a wallet supporting multiple protocols can be implemented.The Open Assets (OA) protocol is being considered as a potential Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) since it has become stable and is already being used by many companies in the industry. The idea of creating a new colored coin protocol that merges features of different implementations has failed in the past due to different assumptions and tradeoffs taken by each protocol for different use cases. However, other colored coin protocols such as EPOBC and Colu are still useful. ChromaWay is willing to replace EPOBC with something better and can support multiple different kernels. One idea is to decouple input-output mapping/multiplexing from coloring, enabling advanced protocols with smart contracts that are compatible with old ones to a certain extent. While core developers may not be interested in colored coins, Blockstream is developing a sidechain with user-defined assets that could be a preferred way of doing things.The Open Assets Protocol (OAP/1.0) is being discussed as a potential BIP, with no objections raised so far. The original author, Flavien Charlon, has moved onto a private blockchain project known as OpenChain, and while others still use OpenAssets, the protocol cannot be altered. Nicolas Dorier is proposing the BIP on behalf of Flavien Charlon, who will ACK as needed, but Nicolas will drive the discussions. On May 26, 2016, Luke Dashjr reached out to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to inquire about the status of the BIP proposed by Flavien Charlon. Peter Todd's signature was included in the email as an attachment, but no further information was provided regarding the content of the BIP or its potential impact on the Bitcoin community.In the past, an attempt was made to create an RFC-style standard "multiple-colored-coin-protocol" with representatives from all major protocols, but the effort failed due to lack of interest in collaboration, and each company only cared about its own product. Colu asked for requirements but developed a new protocol entirely on their own without taking anyone's input. Merging the protocols may not make sense as some value simplicity, and a combined protocol cannot have this feature. There is little interest in a merged colored coin protocol now, and ChromaWay would not mind replacing EPOBC with something better and is open to adding a new protocol.To address the issue of investors having to install multiple wallets to deal with varying implementations, it would be beneficial for major protocols to collaborate and develop a meta-specification that merges the features of existing implementations while avoiding potential issues. This could lead to a more streamlined process for investors and benefit the community as a whole. Core developers generally dislike things like colored coins, so getting their help is unlikely.</summary>
