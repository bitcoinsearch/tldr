    <summary>A group consisting of Andrew Clifford, Andrew Stone, @sickpig, Peter Tschipper and an unnamed author conducted a study on block propagation using Xthin over the normal P2P network and across the Great Firewall of China. The group used six Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) nodes to collect data on transmission and reception for more than nine thousand blocks. They have released the methodology of their testing in Part 1 of a five-part article series which can be found at the provided link. They thank Jihan Wu from AntPool for the block source within Mainland China and @cypherdoc for funding.</summary>
