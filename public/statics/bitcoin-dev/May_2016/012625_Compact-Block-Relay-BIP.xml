    <summary>In May 2016, Matt Corallo posted a BIP-formatted design spec for compact block relay on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The purpose of the design was to limit on wire bytes during block relay. The latest version of the document can be found on GitHub. A user who had been testing the design for a couple of weeks reported over 96% reduction in block-bytes sent and a significant decrease in bandwidth spikes. The largest blocktxn message observed on a node that had been up for at least a day was 475736 bytes. In opportunistic mode, the user's measurements showed that 73% of blocks were transferred with 0.5 RTT even without prediction, 87% if up to 4 additional transactions were predicted, and 91% for 30 transactions. These figures were based on the user's rough estimate for the 10k maximum prediction suggested in the BIP.</summary>
