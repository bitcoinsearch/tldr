    <summary>On May 11, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner posted on bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding his proposed modification to the Bitcoin block header design. He referred to a blog post from March 2014 where he suggested putting a 4-byte hash of the second 64-byte chunk in the first 64 bytes. This design would allow for increased nonce space in the first 64 bytes. Later, he corrected himself and stated that the idea is to include a 4-byte hash of the first chunk in the second 64-byte chunk. Another member named Luke then asked if XORing bytes 64 to 76 with the first 12 bytes of the SHA2 midstate would work as an alternate solution.</summary>
