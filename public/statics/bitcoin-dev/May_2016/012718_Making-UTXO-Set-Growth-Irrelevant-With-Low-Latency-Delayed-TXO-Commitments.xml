    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion on 5/17/16, Eric Lombrozo expressed enthusiasm for a proposed change related to the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. However, another participant questioned why this change was "so desperately needed," pointing out that the UTXO set is currently only 1.5 GB and most modern computers have at least 8GB of RAM. The post also noted that the blocksize limit remains at 1MB, which limits the growth of the UTXO set. The poster suggested that it could take 30-40 years for the UTXO set to grow to a point where it would cause issues with memory capacity.</summary>
