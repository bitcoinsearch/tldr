    <summary>The discussion between two individuals includes feedback on the encryption of messages in BIP, including the use of public keys for cold-storage key revocation, and the implementation of chacha20-poly1305 for AEAD. They also discuss the use of multiple keys to prevent implementation errors and handling failed authentication attempts. The format for encrypted messages is specified, with a suggestion to allow for unencrypted messages containing the 4 byte network magic to avoid collisions. The issue of unauthenticated buffering is addressed, with a proposal to reduce the length field to decrease buffer requirements while allowing for larger message sizes. Finally, re-keying is discussed, with recommendations for resetting the message count and implementing bi-directional re-keying.</summary>
