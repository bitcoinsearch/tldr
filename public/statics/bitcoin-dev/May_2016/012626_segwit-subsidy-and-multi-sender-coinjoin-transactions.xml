    <summary>Kristov Atlas, a developer, has posted a sample of 16 transaction IDs from the BitcoinTalk thread on JoinMarket, showing an average ratio of 1.38 outputs to inputs. He explains that this is an unsustainable situation as at some point that change needs to be combined again or UTXOs will not get spent. Meanwhile, segwit discount is an advantage for CoinJoin as it makes spending UTXOs cheaper and recovers funds that would otherwise get lost to dust.</summary>
