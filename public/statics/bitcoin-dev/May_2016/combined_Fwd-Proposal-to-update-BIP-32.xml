    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposal to update BIP-32, which aims to provide a similar method for different curves where a collision is much more likely. BIPs are usually not updated with new ideas, but only with remarks, links, typos, clarifications, etc., so that their numbers can unambiguously be used to refer to an idea.The suggestion put forward is to write a new BIP that overrides parts of BIP32 and put a note in BIP32 that a better mechanism is available that is unlikely to change things in reality for the secp256k1 curve. This proposed change in the algorithm involves changing the last step of the private to private derivation function. However, the chance for failure is higher than 1 in 2^128 for high values of p.To address this issue, an alternative method is proposed, which always converges by retrying with an appended iteration count. Overall, the email thread presents an interesting discussion on improving the BIP-32 proposal and addressing potential issues with the current algorithm.</summary>
