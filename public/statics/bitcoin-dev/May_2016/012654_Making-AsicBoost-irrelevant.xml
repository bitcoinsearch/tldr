    <summary>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo proposed several changes that could be made during a hardfork to render ASICBoost useless. The changes include fixing the version field so it is a static constant, making the merkle root the hash of the real block header, swapping the first two bytes of the merkle root with the timestamp's two high-order bits, and swapping the next four bytes of the merkle root with the difficulty field. Corallo believes these changes would be compatible with all existing ASICs, aside from some 21 Inc hardware. Additionally, Tier Nolan commented on the thread with his own proposal to improve Bitcoinâ€™s security by splitting the merkle root into two pieces. Peter Todd, an expert in blockchain technology, commented on Corallo's proposal, asking how best to implement the changes while maintaining SPV compatibility and without requiring changes to existing mining hardware.</summary>
