    <summary>Timo Hanke, a developer who claims to have patented a method of reducing the amount of power consumed by Bitcoin mining equipment has accused the Bitcoin Core developers of attempting to "fork" the blockchain and undermine his work. However, Bitcoin's core developer Peter Todd has pointed out that there is no way to determine from a block whether it was mined using Hanke's AsicBoost technology or not. Todd suggests that "miners can support such a change (assuming of course the economic majority approves it as well) chang[ing] the negotiation position re: licensing fees; the actual outcome may simply be you guys make the patent 100% public for all to use at a much reduced price, given your lack of negotiation strength."</summary>
