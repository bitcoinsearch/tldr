    <summary>Russell O'Connor, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, questioned the significance of one particular patent over others in relation to design and manufacturing processes for power-efficient ASICs. He asked why this patent is causing concern regarding ideal computation between pen and paper calculation. In response, it was noted that if other significant patents were discovered, they would also be considered for legal action. The communication was signed with a PGP signature.</summary>
