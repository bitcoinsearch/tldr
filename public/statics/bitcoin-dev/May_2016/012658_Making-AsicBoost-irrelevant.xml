    <title>Making AsicBoost irrelevant</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion, it was proposed to make the patented AsicBoost optimization useless as part of the hard-fork proposed in the HK agreement. However, Sergio Demian Lerner raised concern that the link provided in support of this proposal did not discuss ASIC improvements or patents. Instead, the linked paper discusses avoiding patents that impact Bitcoin and are not freely licensed. The paper also mentions that the AsicBoost optimization is patent-pending. Lerner suggested that all changes to the protocol should be publicly discussed, and if further similar optimizations are to be made useless, a switch to EquiHash should be proposed. Both the HK agreement and the AsicBoost optimization were previously discussed in the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus, which is linked in the original post.</summary>
