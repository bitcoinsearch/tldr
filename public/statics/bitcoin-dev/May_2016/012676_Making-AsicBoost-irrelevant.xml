    <title>Making AsicBoost irrelevant</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing the patented AsicBoost optimisation, with a view to making it useless and similar optimisations as well. However, the issue lies in the fact that there is no way to tell from a block if it was mined with AsicBoost or not. This means there is no guarantee that hardware will be able to switch over to the majority chain even if it wants to. In fact, it would lead to two co-existing Bitcoin blockchains. Chip manufacturers will not reveal which optimizations they use, so it is unclear what "existing mining hardware" is. The only way out is to embrace as many optimizations as possible to the point where there are no more left to do.</summary>
