    <summary>In a discussion thread, Nick ODell asked what would happen if two people create transactions from outputs within the same MMR tree tip at the same time. Peter Todd responded that the MMR proofs provided by transactions aren't proofs of how the MMR should be changed; they're just proofs that the MMR is in a certain state right now. He explained that this situation is an example of a double-spend, which miners have to detect if they don't want to create invalid blocks. If a miner receives transactions A and B and tries to put both into a block without access to the outputs that were pruned, they will be rejected by the STXO set.</summary>
