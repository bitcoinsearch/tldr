    <summary>In a message sent to bitcoin-dev on May 11, 2016, Peter Todd proposed two solutions to address the issue of AsicBoost. Firstly, he suggested that the consensus Proof of Work (PoW) allow blocks to be mined using both the existing PoW algorithm and a slightly tweaked version where AsicBoost provides no advantage. This would eliminate the incentive to implement AsicBoost without making any hardware obsolete. Secondly, Todd suggested that the old PoW could continue to be accepted but with a 20% target penalty, or vice versa, with the new PoW having a 20% target boost. By implementing either of these solutions, the issue of AsicBoost could be resolved without causing any major disruptions in the mining process.</summary>
