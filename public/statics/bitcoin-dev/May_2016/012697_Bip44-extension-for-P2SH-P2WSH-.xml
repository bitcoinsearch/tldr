    <summary>The discussion on the default BIP32 wallet layout in BIP43 as purpose "0" suggests having 4 chains below the "account" level, the original 0 and 1 for receive and change addresses, and then 0x40000000 and 0x40000001 for P2WPKH-in-P2SH versions of receive and change addresses. The idea of specifying the type of address as a bit field flag is liked to avoid checking multiple address types for each key. Using 0x40000000 would be compatible with existing accounts and wallet layouts. However, trying to recover on non-segwit software will miss segwit receives. A new derivation path parallel to Bip44 can also be defined to let users choose which account they want to add ("Normal account", "Witness account"). Pavol Rusnak, SatoshiLabs.com, suggested that option #2 is better, and they plan to implement this way in myTREZOR. There is something in the pipeline for BIP44 compliant wallets, but no visible results yet.</summary>
