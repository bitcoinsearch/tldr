    <summary>In a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr proposed replacing the first 4 bytes of the second chunk of a Bitcoin block header with an XOR of those bytes and the first 4 bytes of the SHA2 midstate. Sergio Demian Lerner responded that this would only add another computational step before checking for a collision in those 4 bytes, making it only marginally harder to find a collision. Lerner had previously suggested including a 4-byte hash of the first chunk in the second 64-byte chunk of the block header, which would allow for increased nonce space in the first 64 bytes. The design is explained in greater detail in a blog post by Lerner.</summary>
