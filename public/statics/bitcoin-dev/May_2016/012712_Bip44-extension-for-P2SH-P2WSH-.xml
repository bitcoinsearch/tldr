    <summary>On May 14, 2016, Jonas Schnelli sent an email inquiring about the lack of BIP39 import support in wallets such as Schildbachs android wallet, Electrum and Breadwallet. Pavol Rusnak from SatoshiLabs.com responded confirming that these wallets are not BIP44 compatible, which was the topic of the thread. The discussion then shifted to the issue of importing a bip39 mnemonic into a hardware wallet and the potential security risks involved, particularly when it comes to cold storage. Despite this, it is still recommended to send all coins to the new seed.</summary>
