    <title>Making AsicBoost irrelevant</title>

    <summary>The discussions about "ASICs" being bad have been ongoing for years, with some even starting "ASIC unfriendly" altcoins. However, the ASIC industry is still twisted even without AsicBoost. Therefore, there seems little reason to change rules just because of a 10% edge. Changing the rules has potential danger for the health of the network and no one can know in advance what will be broken. It is like opening Pandora's box. Disclaimer: There is no stake in any ASIC company/facility.</summary>
