    <summary>During a Zurich meeting, the Bitcoin Core team discussed and documented many topics, including segwit, segwit code review, error-correcting codes for future address types, encryption for the p2p network protocol, compact block relay, Schnorr signatures and signature aggregation, networking library, encrypted transactions, UTXO commitments, MAST stuff, and many other topics. The meeting notes provide highly useful reading material for those interested in these areas. The transcript is available in both HTML and TXT formats. It is important to note that there may be errors in transcription due to the difficulty of capturing everything accurately in real-time, as well as multiple parallel conversations occurring during the meeting. Bryan, who provided the link to the meeting notes, emphasizes that the collaboration of many colleagues should not be overlooked in the creation of this material.</summary>
