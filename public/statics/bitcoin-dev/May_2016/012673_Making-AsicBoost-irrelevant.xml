    <summary>The discussion revolves around the idea of modifying the Bitcoin block header to increase nonce space, where Luke suggested XORing bytes 64-76 with the first 12 bytes of the SHA2 midstate. However, Timo Hanke pointed out that it does not work and only adds another computational step before checking for a collision in those 4 bytes. If all 12 bytes are used, finding a collision becomes substantially harder but it is recommended to restrict oneself to 10 bytes as timestamp rolling on-chip by hardware may occur. Additionally, messing around with the version bits can create an incentive, which needs fixing. Sergio Demian Lerner shared the original idea of putting a 4-byte hash of the second chunk in the first 64 bytes, allowing increased nonce space.</summary>
