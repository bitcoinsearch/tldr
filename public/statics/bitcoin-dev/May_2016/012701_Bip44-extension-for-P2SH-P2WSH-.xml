    <summary>In an email exchange between Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet, and Pavol Rusnak, a developer at SatoshiLabs, Rusnak expressed concerns about the compatibility of wallets conforming to different BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). Specifically, he brought up the issue of whether a BIP44 wallet supports SegWit or not. Voisine responded by explaining that in order to recover funds from a wallet conforming to a certain BIP, one must have wallet software that handles that BIP. He also proposed using the chain index instead of overloading the account index to indicate the type of address, which would work with not only BIP44 but also any other BIP43 purpose/layout. However, Rusnak still felt that having another BIP specifically for SegWit would be beneficial for clarity in wallet compatibility.</summary>
