    <summary>Rune Kjær Svendsen has developed a protocol for payment channels that aims to standardize the operations of opening, paying, and closing. The author has written up a specification of how it operates and shared it on bitcoin-dev. In the past, refund Bitcoin transactions depended on another unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction, making the setup of payment channels risky. However, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY now allows payment channel setup to be risk-free.Rusty encourages people to take advantage of this feature, especially with Segregated Witness expected soon. This feature will enable users to lock in a transaction until a certain time, which reduces the risks associated with payment channels. By offering a standard protocol for payment channels, Rune Kjær Svendsen is improving the usability and security of Bitcoin.</summary>
