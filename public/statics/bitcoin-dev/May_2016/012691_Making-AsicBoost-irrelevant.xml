    <summary>In an email sent on May 11, 2016 by Peter Todd, it was mentioned that the idea of setting a precedent for mining optimization patents and risking retaliatory consensus changes is unrealistic. The optimization has been independently discovered two or three times by Spondoolies and maybe Bitmain. Encoded dependency on the insane patent systems of the world into the protocol development process would result from such a precedent.</summary>
