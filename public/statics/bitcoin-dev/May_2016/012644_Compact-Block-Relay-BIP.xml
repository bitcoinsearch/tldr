    <summary>In an email thread on May 9, 2016, Tom raised concerns about the moderators' failure to catch an aggressive tone in a post that was moderated for being too aggressive. However, another member of the thread reminded Tom that he had previously been informed by moderators that he had canceled his email from the moderation queue. The conversation then turned towards the topic being off-topic and recommended that further posts on the subject should be sent to either bitcoin-discuss at lists.linuxfoundation.org or bitcoin-dev-owners at lists.linuxfoundation.org instead of the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
