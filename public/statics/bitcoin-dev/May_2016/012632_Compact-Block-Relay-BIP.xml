    <summary>To provide historical context, the relay protocol in question was designed to optimize propagation time rather than bandwidth. However, bandwidth is a crucial factor that needs optimization for nodes. Two other proposals, xthin block and ILBT, have been introduced as potential solutions to decrease bandwidth usage. The specifics of how these proposals compare to the relay protocol are not known and further information is requested.</summary>
