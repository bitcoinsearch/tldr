    <summary>In an email thread dated May 13, 2016, Aaron Voisine suggested using a bit field flag to specify the type of address. He proposed using 0x40000000 since 0x80000000 is already used to indicate hardened derivation. Pavol Rusnak questioned the advantages of this optimization and noted that the discussion was off-topic as they were discussing multiple-accounts per wallet layout, not one-account-per-wallet design.</summary>
