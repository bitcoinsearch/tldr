    <title>Making AsicBoost irrelevant</title>

    <summary>On May 11, 2016, Timo Hanke via bitcoin-dev expressed concerns over forking out AsicBoost miners as there is no way to tell from a block if it was mined with AsicBoost or not. A GUARANTEED chain fork would occur after changing the block mining algorithm, meaning that some percentage of hardware will no longer be able to produce valid blocks and two co-existing bitcoin blockchains will exist. However, assuming AsicBoost miners are in the minority, their chain will constantly get overtaken and AsicBoost blocks will continue to be ignored until they stop making them. Despite this, the hardware cannot "switch over" to the majority chain even if it wanted to. They will continually "switch over" to the majority but are unable to extend that majority chain themselves.</summary>
