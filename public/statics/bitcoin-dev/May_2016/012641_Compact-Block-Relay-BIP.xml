    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Gregory Maxwell and Tom Zander debated over the compact block relay. Maxwell argued that predicting which node will have the best data in the future is required for the network to use the compact block relay. He also said that testing on actual nodes in the actual network was necessary to increase robustness during less optimal situations. Meanwhile, Zander countered that nodes send a much larger amount of unsolicited data to peers in the form of thin-block compared to normal inv or header-first data. He suggested adding a second service bits field of message instead of using service bits as a mechanism for negating optional peer-local parameters. The two also discussed variable length encoding and collision attacks. Maxwell believes that salting the hash eliminates the issue of a trivial collision attack while Zander argued that the issue would be better eliminated by not allowing nodes to send uninvited large messages. Overall, they did not agree on the design.</summary>
