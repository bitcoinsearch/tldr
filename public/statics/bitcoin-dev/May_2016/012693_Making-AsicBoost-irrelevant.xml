    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding responded to Sergio Demian Lerner's suggestion that changing the protocol would send a message to keep ASIC optimizations secret. Harding argued that the issue was not the optimization itself, but rather the fact that it was discovered and implemented without being kept secret. He added that if this particular optimization had been kept secret, there would be no need for discussion as there are countless other optimizations that are also kept secret.</summary>
