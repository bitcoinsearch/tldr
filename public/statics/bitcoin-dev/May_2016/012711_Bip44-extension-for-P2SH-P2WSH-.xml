    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list in May 2016, Jonas Schnelli stated that Bip39 import is not supported by Electrum. This statement was confirmed by Electrum's developer who gave reasons behind this decision. One of the reasons cited was that BIP39 seed phrases don't include a version number which is needed for maintaining backward compatibility every time address derivation changes. As Electrum decided to allocate a new version number for seed phrases derived to segwit addresses, BIP39 designers will have to change the semantics of their checksum bits to encode a version number for segwit.</summary>
