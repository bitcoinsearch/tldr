    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread on May 13, 2016, Daniel Weigl suggests two options for improving the wallet experience. The second option involves defining a new derivation path parallel to Bip44 but with a different purpose, allowing users to choose which account they want to add (normal or witness). The team agreed that option #2 would be better and plans to implement it in myTREZOR. A BIP that supports P2WPKH may only need one address per public key, but P2WSH should probably be handled by another account type and BIP. Pavol "stick" Rusnak from SatoshiLabs.com confirms that they have a project in the pipeline but no visible results yet.</summary>
