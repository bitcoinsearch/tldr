    <summary>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, proposed a solution to announce new blocks in a different way than how CNodes keep their state and talk to remote nodes. However, Corallo was criticized by Tom Zander who said that the solution is too complicated and creates a fragile system that will only work under laboratory conditions. Moreover, Zander argued that the announcement of a new block to all nodes equally, followed by individual nodes responding with a request for either a compact or normal block, is much more in line with the current design. In response, Corallo said that service bits and protocol versions are not well-suited for this purpose and suggested using variable-length integers instead. Additionally, Zander advised Corallo to use existing standards when possible, such as UTF-8. Furthermore, Zander questioned Corallo's proposal regarding short transaction IDs, saying that it is unnecessary and suggested using only the first eight bytes of a sha256 hash instead.</summary>
