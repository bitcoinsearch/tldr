    <summary>On May 11, 2016, Tom Harding via bitcoin-dev responded to a statement made by Sergio Demian Lerner regarding changes to the protocol and the message it sends to the ecosystem. Lerner had suggested that changing the protocol would indicate that ASIC optimizations should be kept secret. Harding added to this point by saying that if the optimization in question had been kept secret, no one would be discussing any changes to the protocol. The optimization in question has been independently discovered two or three times by companies such as Spondoolies and Bitmain.</summary>
