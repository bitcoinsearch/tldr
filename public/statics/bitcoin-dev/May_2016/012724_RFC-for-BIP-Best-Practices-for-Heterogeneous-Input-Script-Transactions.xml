    <summary>This document proposes a set of best practice guidelines to minimize the adverse privacy consequences of creating transactions with inputs composed from different scripts. The proposed guidelines aim to maximize the effectiveness of protection protocols, minimize the negative consequences of unavoidable heterogeneous input transactions (HITs), and limit the effect on the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set growth. The document defines terms like HITs and provides standard and alternate form rules for creating HITs. The standard form HIT must adhere to specific rules like having equal numbers of unique input/output scripts, all output scripts must be unique, at least one pair of outputs must have equal value, and the largest output in the transaction must be a member of a set containing at least two identically-sized outputs. If a user can't create a transaction compliant with this procedure, they can't create a non-compliant heterogeneous input script transaction.</summary>
