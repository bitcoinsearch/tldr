    <summary>In an email exchange on May 12, 2016, Timo Hanke argued that forking out existing hardware would inevitably lead to the creation of an altcoin, as both chains would survive due to the fact that the hardware cannot be used for anything else. He compared this scenario to a contentious hardfork that does not fork out any hardware, which is suspected to lead to the permanent existence of two chains. However, another participant in the discussion disagreed, stating that whether or not two chains survive in parallel depends solely on whether both chains maintain demand. The participant suggested moving the discussion to bitcoin-discuss, as it was more philosophical than technical.</summary>
