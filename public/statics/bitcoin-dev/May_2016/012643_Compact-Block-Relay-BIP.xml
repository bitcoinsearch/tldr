    <summary>On May 9, 2016, Peter Todd wrote a message to which someone responded with a personal attack. The recipient of the attack moved it out because it had no place in the technical discussion. This person initially asked the attacker to avoid personal attacks but later edited their reply to "ehm..." instead. However, the moderators failed to catch the aggressive tone while moderating the post. They believe that their message will not be allowed through either as it is off-topic. This situation has made them certain that this list is not a suitable place for all the different stakeholders to talk on a level playing field. They urge anyone who agrees to replace the entire moderation team with a new one as it would be the least painful solution for everyone.</summary>
