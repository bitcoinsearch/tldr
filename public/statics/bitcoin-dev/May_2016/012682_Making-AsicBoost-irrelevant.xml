    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Simon Liu expressed concerns over giving one manufacturer/licenser a huge influence in the market. He suggested that the market should decide winners and losers, rather than central planning. In response, Peter Todd explained that the market is currently being asked to decide and any actual hard-fork to make AsicBoost irrelevant would be voted on by miners themselves and the economic majority. This would allow the market to collectively decide.</summary>
