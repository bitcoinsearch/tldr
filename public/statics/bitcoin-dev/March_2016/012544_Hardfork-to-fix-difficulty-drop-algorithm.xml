    <summary>In an email thread on March 9, 2016, Henning Kopp via bitcoin-dev expressed his thoughts on the community's process for making decisions regarding Bitcoin. He believed that the community should demonstrate a good process for making such decisions and show that they can separate meaningful underlying principles, such as the coin limit and overall inflation rate from what is considered more like an implementation detail, such as the large-step reward reduction. In response, another individual disagreed with Kopp's statement that the coin limit was a meaningful underlying principle that should not be touched while mining reward halving was an implementation detail. According to them, the two are unrelated, and the halving of mining rewards could be modified with a soft fork. They provide a link to a post by Dr. Back, who had been pointing this out for some time.</summary>
