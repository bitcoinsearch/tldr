    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, G. Andrew Stone expressed satisfaction with their own process and sees this mailing list and the BIP process as very Core specific for reasons that are too numerous to describe. One advantage of the BIP process is that there are hashlocked descriptions of the specs available for people to implement against. It is not a veto-based process. If one writes the BIP and it doesn't have any serious technical problems, then it will be accepted into the BIP repo. On the other hand, the BIP git repository is hosted on the /bitcoin github site, so in that context, it can be seen as linked with core. Stone proposed a process for claiming service bits, which can be useful to claim a bit in advance of actually finalizing the feature. The proposed process includes claiming a bit with a reasonable justification, having a finalized description of the feature within three months that lets other clients implement it, having working software that deploys the feature within six months, and locking the bit after six months of it being in active use. An expiry process could be applied if it ends up not being used after all. Requiring a public description of the feature seems like a reasonable requirement in exchange for the community assigning the service bit.</summary>
