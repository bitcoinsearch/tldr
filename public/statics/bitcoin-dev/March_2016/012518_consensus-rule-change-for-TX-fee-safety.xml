    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has raised a question about whether to prohibit someone from rewarding whoever mines their transaction. Alice Wonder proposed adding protections to prevent typo blunders in transactions, citing an example of a 15 BTC transaction fee which was probably either a typo or client bug. She suggested that the fee rule should be implemented as a safety mechanism in the client, and proposed two possible solutions: (A) TX fee may not be larger than the sum of outputs, or (B) TX fee per byte may not be larger than 4X largest fee per byte in previous block. Henning Kopp agreed with the idea of implementing the rule as a safety mechanism in the client, rather than doing a hard fork. Jorge Tim√≥n also suggested that such a check already exists, but it can be improved, and it may be more appropriate to implement it at the wallet layer. The discussion raised concerns about protecting others by prohibiting behavior that may seem foolish, while hurting the best of us.</summary>
