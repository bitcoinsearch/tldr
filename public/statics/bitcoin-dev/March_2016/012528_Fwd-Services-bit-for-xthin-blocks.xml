    <summary>In an email thread from March 8th, 2016, Dave Scotese suggested the idea of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) but expressed concern about making such specific proposals. Instead, he proposed a more general approach of using bit(s?) 4(-5?) as user-agent. However, he also noted that this approach would be useless for discovery as it is not communicated in address messages. He suggested that any feature that could use this approach could instead utilize the BIP130 approach.</summary>
