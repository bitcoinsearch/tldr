    <summary>David Manheim, who is an economist and game theorist, has suggested a potential solution to the halving-difficulty-drop problem in Bitcoin. However, there is a split in the discussion about the costs and benefits of this proposal on the list. Lukejr suggested that the emergency solution should only be activated if there was a stall after the halving. On the other hand, Paul Sztorc disagreed and stated that this issue could get disastrous with some bad luck very quickly. As a result, many altcoins' smooth/dynamic retargeting methods are not suitable since people didn't sign up for them, and there are stability issues.Manheim's proposal is for a temporary dynamic difficulty retargeting after the halving which will allow for a fix while making it clear that the original rules of Bitcoin shouldn't be discarded. He suggests using the remaining 1344 blocks of the 2016 blocks after the halving for a dynamic retarget without changing the schedule otherwise. The initial retarget difficulty would be half of the previous one, but it would quickly stabilize at the appropriate level using any dynamic method. However, the probability of orphaned blocks increases for a couple of blocks. At block 421344, the system reverts to using the current method, which can use the entire last 2016 blocks to smooth out the lower difficulty adjustment that occurred.The proposal could be used for the three halvings after this one with correspondingly shorter retarget windows since 210000 isn't divisible by 2016 until we're down to the 1.25btc coinbase reward, with 336 blocks until the next retarget. The only remaining question is what temporary retargeting method should they use? Smooth difficulty readjustment methods have been implemented by many altcoins, such as Kimoto Gravity Well (KGW) and Digishield. Heavycoin's temporal retargeting is another such method.</summary>
