    <summary>A member of the bitcoin community, Jonas Schnelli, suggested using an encrypted channel in combination with a trusted full node to create secure Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) communication. However, another member questioned why one would use peer-to-peer connections at all and suggested making private connections out-of-band instead. Additionally, concerns were raised about the vulnerability to statistical attacks if identical copies of encrypted data are being sent to multiple nodes at the same time.</summary>
