    <summary>Bitcoin Core has announced that it will be implementing a soft fork using consensus-enforced sequence numbers, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, and median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations. This move follows the release of BIP 113 logic as a standardness rule in version 0.11.2, while BIP 68 and BIP 112 have been merged into master. However, testing still needs to be completed before the code can be backported to supported releases. The rollout mechanism is being finalized but will be coordinated with the community. It should be noted that the BIP 68 and BIP 112 logic will only be enforced when the transaction version is greater than or equal to 2, which will become standard with the release of the soft fork code. The implementation of this new protocol will bring changes to Bitcoin's lock-time calculations, which are used to determine when transactions can be spent. The use of consensus-enforced sequence numbers and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY will provide more flexibility in setting transaction times, while the median time-past will ensure accurate time-stamping. The implementation of this soft fork is expected to improve the efficiency and security of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core's announcement confirms that they are ready to move forward with the implementation and that there are no outstanding concerns. However, the testing process must be completed before the code can be backported to supported releases, and the rollout mechanism is still being finalized. The community will be involved in coordinating the rollout, and the new protocol will only be enforced when the transaction version is greater than or equal to 2.</summary>
