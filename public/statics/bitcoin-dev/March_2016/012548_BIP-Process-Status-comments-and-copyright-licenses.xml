    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are currently overseen by whoever controls the mailing list, which could lead to centralized control. A proposal has been made to replace references to the mailing list with a "public discussion medium," such as forums or conferences. Luke Dashjr has created a draft BIP that provides clarifications on the Status field for BIPs, adds the ability for public comments, and expands the list of allowable BIP licenses. Gavin Andresen responded positively to the concrete definitions of the various statuses, but expressed concern that the definition of "consensus" gives too much control to those who control the mailing list and wiki.</summary>
