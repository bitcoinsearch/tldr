    <summary>Bitcoin is not eventually consistent as it guarantees strong consistency, according to a post on Hacking Distributed. The author of the post suggests that the idea of eventual consistency has become a bad meme and should be laid to rest. The definition of eventually consistent means that a computer system is running continuously and does not have a final state. Therefore, the system must be able to describe behavior when it may give responses to queries across time that are either perfectly consistent or not. However, Bitcoin by default does not ignore the contents of the last X blocks. A Bitcoin node being queried about the current blockchain state will give inconsistent answers when there are block rearrangements, indicating no strong consistency. Additionally, Bitcoin provides probabilistic accumulative probability, not perfect probability, which drops exponentially but is not exactly 0, similar to hash collisions, on which Bitcoin relies for its correctness. The concept of eventual consistency is used in distributed computing to ensure high availability by ensuring that all accesses to a given data item will eventually return its last updated value if no new updates are made. Regarding Bitcoin, the reference client's listreceivedbyaddress returns the number of confirmations by default, and getbalance and getreceivedbyaddress take a number of confirmations as an argument to shield the application from suffix reorgs. While there may be a difference between 0 probability and epsilon probability, practically, little difference exists due to hardware errors. Therefore, one can select an omega such that the chance of processor mis-execution is higher than observing a reorganization. Overall, the author hopes to dispel this false perception of eventual consistency in Bitcoin and lay the bad meme to rest.</summary>
