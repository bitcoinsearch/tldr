    <summary>There is a proposal to change the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE consensus rule in Bitcoin, which would allow the maximum block size to increase or decrease based on actual network usage. The proposal was submitted by Chris Kleeschulte and is available on GitHub. The purpose of this change is to allow the network's capacity to adjust to changes in user demand and scaling advancements while still being protected from denial of service attacks. Using floating point calculations in consensus code is not recommended, so very large integers are used instead. The get median function could use an array of integers instead of floating point calculations. It's suggested that adding a second limiter to the growth rate could help gain acceptance, such as making it so that the size isn't allowed to more than double every year, similar to the 1MB limit on the lower end. The graphs likely understate the growth rate since the 1MB limit inherently restricts things to 1MB.</summary>
