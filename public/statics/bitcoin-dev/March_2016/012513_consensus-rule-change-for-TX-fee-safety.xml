    <summary>In this context, a user is discussing the possibility of a client not adjusting the transaction fee and needing to manually set it in order to get the transaction into a block. They suggest that there should be limitations on the size of the transaction fee, either by not allowing it to be larger than the sum of outputs or by limiting the fee per byte to 4 times the largest fee per byte in the previous block. The user disagrees with this idea, stating that such checks should be done by transaction creation clients or that nodes could have the option to not accept transactions with high fees into their mempool based on policy. They also state that these limitations should not be part of the consensus layer.</summary>
