    <summary>On March 18th, 2016, a discussion took place between Btc Drak and Luke Dashjr regarding the use of external sources for BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) comments. Luke Dashjr argued that BIP comments are not part of the BIP itself and can be kept external as these comments are merely post-completion notes from various external parties. However, Btc Drak objected to using external sources for commentary in BIP2 and suggested using the Wiki feature at bitcoin/bips. Luke Dashjr clarified that the reason why BIP process was moved to GitHub was that stronger moderation was needed. But such moderation is unnecessary for BIP Comments and would be an outright nuisance. He also mentioned that the Bitcoin Wiki has been shown to stand the test of time and is less likely to move than the GitHub repository. However, Btc Drak still strongly objected to using the Bitcoin Wiki or any external source for commentary in BIP2.Further, Luke Dashjr recommended moving non-reference implementation lists/links to BIP Comments rather than revising the BIPs with them constantly. Regardless, it seems that the discussion ended without reaching a resolution.</summary>
