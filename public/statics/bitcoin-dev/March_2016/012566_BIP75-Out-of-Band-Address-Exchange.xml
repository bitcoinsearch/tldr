    <title>BIP75 - Out of Band Address Exchange</title>

    <summary>The BIP75 proposal, officially proposed on March 1, has tentatively been assigned number 75 and the title has been changed to "Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption". The proposal includes adding optional fields to the BIP70 paymentDetails message such as subtractable fee, fee per kb, and replace by fee. James MacWhyte suggests that these extensions should be included in the new BIP since it is a general modernization of BIP70. However, Andreas Schildbach via bitcoin-dev argues that it is a bad idea to pollute the original idea of this BIP with other extensions and proposes that other extensions should go to separate BIPs. Justin Newton, Founder/CEO of Netki, Inc., is open to either leaving the extensions in or doing a separate BIP. In response to the fee part of BIP75, Schildbach suggests an absolute amount that the payee is willing to cover should be declared instead of letting the payee define a fee rate. To avoid disputes, he also suggests deducting the amount from the BIP70 payment message amount already and displaying only the exceeding amount if it exceeds the existing fee policies. Finally, the BIP70 field extensions have been removed from this BIP for another time and a pull request to add the documentation to the main repo has been submitted.</summary>
