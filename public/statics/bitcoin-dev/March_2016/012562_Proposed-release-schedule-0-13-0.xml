    <summary>The proposed release schedule for the 0.13.0 version of a certain software has been outlined. The schedule involves several stages, with different deadlines and objectives to be met. The first deadline is May 1st, 2015, which marks the start of the translation process for the new version. Transifex will be opened for translations, but there will be a "soft" translation string freeze, meaning no significant changes to the strings will be allowed until the release. Additionally, translations for the previous version, 0.11, will be finalized and closed.The next deadline is May 15th, 2015, which marks the feature freeze for the 0.13.0 version. After this date, only bug fixes will be accepted until the final release. Furthermore, there will be a complete translation string freeze, and no more changes to the source language will be permitted until the release.On June 6th, 2016, the 0.13 branch will be split off from the master branch. This marks the beginning of the Release Candidate cycle, and the first RC for version 0.13.0 will be tagged and released. Additionally, merging for version 0.14 will begin on the master branch.Finally, the aim is to release the 0.13.0 final version on July 1st, 2016.</summary>
