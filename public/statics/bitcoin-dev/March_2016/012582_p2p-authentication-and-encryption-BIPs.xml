    <summary>In this conversation, the speaker expresses gratitude to Jonas for working on something they have been interested in. They mention that they haven't had a chance to read the BIPs yet but will do so soon and comment. They also suggest that connecting an SPV wallet to a full node is a good use case, which would make it easy to connect an Android bitcoin-wallet to a personal node. The speaker has previously attempted to connect their .onion node to the wallet but found it to be slow. If basic encryption and authentication were implemented, this could be viable.The speaker then suggests that bloom filtering in bitcoinj is currently broken but could be fixed by creating a single filter and filling it with 1000 addresses. However, restoring from seed would not be possible using this method, meaning users would have to rely on the current bitcoinj method and compromise their privacy. The speaker proposes that an encrypted connection to a trusted node during restoration would allow users to maintain their privacy. The conversation ends with a mailing list message from Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev.</summary>
