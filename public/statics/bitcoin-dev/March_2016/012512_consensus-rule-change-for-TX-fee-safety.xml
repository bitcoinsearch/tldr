    <summary>Alice Wonder, an active member of bitcoin-dev mailing list, suggested implementing a safety rule for transaction fees in the next hard fork. She cited an incident where a user mistakenly paid a transaction fee of 15 BTC due to a probable typo or client bug. Two proposed solutions were given to prevent such incidents: A) TX fee may not be larger than the sum of outputs, and B) TX fee per byte may not be larger than 4X largest fee per byte in the previous block. Alice also suggested that adding protections could give users confidence and cited the four-byte checksum used in public addresses as an example. Henning Kopp, another member of the mailing list, responded that rather than a hard fork, the safety mechanism should be implemented in the client, and a warning can pop up if one of the conditions A) or B) is met.</summary>
