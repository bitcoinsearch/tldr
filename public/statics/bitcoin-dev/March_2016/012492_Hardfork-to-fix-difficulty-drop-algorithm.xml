    <summary>In an email conversation dated March 2, 2016, developers discussed the possibility of a longer block interval leading to a higher per-block transaction volume and potentially hitting the block size limit sooner than expected. However, they noted that the exchange rate of the coin is not significantly influenced by these factors and historically, difficulty has followed value rather than the other way around. If the block size limit is hit earlier than expected, the local fee market may develop and fees will increase, which could bring more miners back to the game along with an expected higher exchange rate. The hashrate drop and tolerance for higher fees are unknown variables at this time. Nonetheless, having code prepared for negative scenarios in case of an emergency seems reasonable to some developers, even if it is not ultimately needed.</summary>
