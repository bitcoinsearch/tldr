    <summary>In an email sent on March 2, 2016 by Luke Dashjr to bitcoin-dev, he discussed the possibility of having a proposal ready in time to be deployed alongside SegWit. However, he later acknowledged that it may not be a practical timeframe for deployment unless there is an emergency situation. If the code were bundled with SegWit, it would need some way to avoid its early activation outside of an emergency. This could possibly be detected in the code.</summary>
