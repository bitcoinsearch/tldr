    <summary>On March 21, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner reported a minor error in BIP147 to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The BIP147 defines that "Sigop cost" is the cost of a sigop in traditional script (4) and the cost of a sigop in a witness program (1). The new rule states that the total sigop cost should be no more than 80,000. However, the code implements the rule differently, with the condition that if (nSigOps + (nWitSigOps + 3)/4 &gt; MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS), then there will be an error. This implementation is not the same as what was defined in the BIP147. Lerner provided an example to show how this is an error by the implemented code but not by the BIP definition. He stated that nSigOps = 1 and nWitSigOps = 79999, which does not violate the BIP147 definition but does cause an error in the implemented code.</summary>
