    <summary>On March 23, 2016, Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev wrote a draft version of two BIPs that he had recently written. The proposed authentication scheme takes care of identity-management and prevents MITM attacks, which would not detect sending/receiving encrypted data from/to a MITM. SPV is the most known use-case for per-message encryption. Responding peers must ignore the requesting peer after one false try to avoid resource attacks. To ensure that no message was dropped or blocked, the complete communication must be hashed using SHA256. Both peers keep the SHA256 context of the encryption session. Before sending an enc command, the sha256 context will be copied and finalized. However, the BIP should specify the actual algorithm to create an implementation. It may be a good time to ask why per-message encryption is necessary, as practically every single popular end-to-end encryption uses one approach or another were it just encrypts as another layer.</summary>
