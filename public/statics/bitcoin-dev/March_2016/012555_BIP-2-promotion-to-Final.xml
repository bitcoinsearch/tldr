    <summary>In an email conversation, Mustafa Al-Bassam wrote that preventing a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) from being attacked is easy, but because of the sheer number of users, it's guaranteed that someone will attack it. He argues that expecting any hard fork, even an uncontroversial one, to be adopted by every person in the ecosystem is wishful thinking, and suggests that soft forks have had similar problems in the past. However, he fails to see the harm caused by such attacks, and believes that the attacker will eventually get bored and stop.</summary>
