    <summary>A draft BIP proposes changing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE consensus rule based on the median block size over the last three months, as a function of actual network usage. This would allow the capacity of the network to increase or decrease based on scaling advancements and user demand while still being protected from denial of service attacks. The proposal is available on GitHub and was submitted by Chris Kleeschulte.</summary>
