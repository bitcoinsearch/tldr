    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, BtcDrak claimed to have tested code for an altcoin that could potentially help mitigate the issue of block size limit being hit sooner than expected. However, it is still unclear which altcoin he is referring to. When Pavel Janik raised concerns about a longer block interval and higher per-block transaction volume, Luke Dashjr argued that historically, difficulty has followed value rather than the exchange rate being influenced by these factors. While there is no clear consensus on how to address this issue, having prepared code for negative scenarios in case of an emergency seems reasonable. It remains to be seen how the local fee market will develop and whether higher fees will attract more miners back to the game.</summary>
