    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion group, G. Andrew Stone proposed the implementation of a services bit in the Bitcoin Unlimited client to indicate that the node is able to communicate thin blocks. The proposal suggests using bit 4 for this purpose since bit 3 is already designated for Segregated Witness. It was questioned whether or not this would change peer selection, with the preferred signaling mechanism being the one in BIP 130. The discussion then turned to the standard method for obtaining numbers, with some suggesting that it requires writing a BIP documenting the usage. However, it was uncertain whether this is intentional or simply how things have been done in the past, and there were no strong opinions on the matter.</summary>
