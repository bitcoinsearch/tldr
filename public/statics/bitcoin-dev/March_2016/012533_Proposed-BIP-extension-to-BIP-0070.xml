    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposed update to the Payment Protocol, with the goal of creating a permissioned and encrypted exchange of payment information between two parties. This would allow for automated creation of off blockchain transaction logs that are human readable and contain information on who was transacted with. The proposed update includes three main goals: ensuring payment details are only visible to transaction participants, allowing for store and forward servers to enable mobile wallets to sign and serve Payment Requests, and allowing senders of funds to share their identity with the receiver for various purposes such as making bitcoin logs more human readable or allowing regulated financial entities to meet regulatory requirements. The protocol is designed to be flexible and allow developers to build different types of schemes while keeping standard messages that can be forwarded between services if needed. The thread also discusses whether a user could upload a set of PaymentRequests authenticated by his key to an untrusted server which then encrypts and passes them on in response to InvoiceRequests.</summary>
