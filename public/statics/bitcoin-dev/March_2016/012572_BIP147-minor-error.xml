    <summary>The BIP147 defines the cost of a sigop in traditional script as 4, while the cost of a sigop in witness program is 1. The new rule stipulates that the total sigop cost must be less than or equal to 80,000. However, the implemented code does not reflect this rule accurately as it uses a different formula to calculate sigops. This discrepancy can lead to errors, such as nSigOps = 1 and nWitSigOps = 79999, which would not be considered an error according to the BIP definition, but would be flagged as an error by the implemented code.</summary>
