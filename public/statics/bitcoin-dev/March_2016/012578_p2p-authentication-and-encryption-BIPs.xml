    <summary>In this email thread, members of the bitcoin-dev community discussed various aspects of encryption and communication protocols for Bitcoin. The discussion covered topics such as allowing encryption on non-pre-approved connections, implementing encryption without OpenSSL, using P2P code to connect a wallet to a node, and the need for per-message encryption. The participants also talked about resource attacks and messaging reliability, with some suggesting that denial of service protection can be more flexible than just banning an IP address after 5 unsuccessful authentication attempts. Finally, there was a suggestion to explain how hashing works specifically in terms of messaging reliability. Overall, the thread provides insights into the complexities of developing secure communication protocols for decentralized systems like Bitcoin.</summary>
