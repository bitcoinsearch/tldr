    <summary>According to Pavel Janik, if the blockchain network experiences a significantly longer block interval, it could result in a higher per-block transaction volume. This could also cause the block size limit to be reached sooner than expected. However, if the exchange rate of the coin can accommodate such an expectation, the local fee market will develop and fees will increase. The raised fees would complement mined coins and attract more miners back to the game, along with an expected higher exchange rate.</summary>
