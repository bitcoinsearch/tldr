    <summary>The proposed update to the Payment Protocol aims to allow two parties to exchange payment information in a permissioned and encrypted way, enabling automated communication of wallet addresses. The extension also allows for the requestor of a PaymentRequest to supply a certificate and signature to facilitate identification for address release, enabling automated creation of off-blockchain transaction logs that are human-readable. The motivations for this extension are to ensure that payment details are only visible to transaction participants, enhance the Payment Protocol by allowing for store and forward servers, and allow senders to share their identity with receivers. The draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 70 Payment Protocol extension proposal enables two parties to exchange payment information in an encrypted manner, allowing wallet address communication to become automated while ensuring payment details can only be seen by participants and not third parties. It also allows for off-blockchain transaction logs that are human-readable, including who was transacted with. The motivation behind this extension is to enable users to decide who to release payment details to, make bitcoin logs more human-readable, ensure donors match regulatory and legal requirements, and provide a way for regulated financial entities to meet regulatory requirements.In addition, the proposed update includes three main goals: ensuring payment details are only visible to transaction participants, allowing for store and forward servers to enable mobile wallets to sign and serve Payment Requests, and allowing senders of funds to share their identity with the receiver. The protocol is designed to be flexible and allow developers to build different types of schemes while keeping standard messages that can be forwarded between services if needed. Justin W. Newton, Founder/CEO of Netki, Inc., has shared the full proposal on GitHub and is seeking feedback.</summary>
