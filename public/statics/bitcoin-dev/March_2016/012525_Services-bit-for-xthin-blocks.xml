    <summary>The email thread is discussing the proposal made by G. Andrew Stone via bitcoin-dev to use bit 4 as a services bit for indicating that the node is capable of communicating thin blocks in the Bitcoin Unlimited client. However, Gregory Maxwell raises a question about whether this functionality will change peer selection or not. If it does not, he suggests using the signaling mechanism proposed in BIP 130. If it does, then he recommends writing a BIP to document the usage. The conversation ends there without any further discussion on the matter.</summary>
