    <summary>A proposal has been made by G. Andrew Stone to use a services bit to communicate whether or not thin block communication messages are supported. The preferred signaling mechanism is probably the one in BIP 130. The Bitcoin Unlimited client requires a services bit to indicate its capability of processing thin blocks. The proposal suggests using bit 4 as bit 3 is already reserved for Segregated Witness. However, Gregory Maxwell raises a question about whether this functionality will change peer selection or not. If it does not, he suggests using the signaling mechanism proposed in BIP 130. If it does, then he recommends writing a BIP to document the usage.Furthermore, Luke Dashjr clarifies that the BIP process was created by Amir Taaki, who was a libbitcoin developer, and is not affiliated with Core at all. He encourages Bitcoin Unlimited to use the BIP process for cross-implementation standards. However, in response to a proposal made by Bitcoin Unlimited, G. Andrew Stone states that they are happy with their existing process and view the mailing list and BIP process as very Core specific. In another email thread, Stone expressed satisfaction with their own process and sees this mailing list and the BIP process as very Core specific but proposes a process for claiming service bits. It includes claiming a bit with a reasonable justification, having a finalized description of the feature within three months that lets other clients implement it, and having working software that deploys the feature within six months. The discussion also touches upon the standard method for obtaining numbers, with some suggesting that it requires writing a BIP documenting the usage. However, it was uncertain whether this is intentional or simply how things have been done in the past, and there were no strong opinions on the matter.Luke Dashjr encourages Bitcoin Unlimited to use the BIP process for cross-implementation standards to benefit from peer review from the wider Bitcoin development community and have a common repository for these standards. He also clarifies that the BIP process was actually created by Amir Taaki and is not affiliated with Core at all. Before claiming a bit, it is necessary to prove its usefulness and that it will have actual users. A BIP has been sent to Luke jr for discussion on the mailing list to document the extreme thin block protocol. It would be redundant for Bitcoin Unlimited to adhere to the "Core" engineer's process and they encourage interested engineers to join their uncensored forum. G. Andrew Stone offers his tech services for free, and he owns Litmocracy and Meme Racing. He's the webmaster for The Voluntaryist, which accepts Bitcoin, and he codes for The Dollar Vigilante. In summary, there are discussions regarding the need for a services bit to indicate that a node can communicate thin blocks, and the proposal suggests using bit 4 as bit 3 is already reserved for Segregated Witness. While some suggest using the signaling mechanism proposed in BIP 130, others recommend writing a BIP to document the usage if it changes peer selection. Luke Dashjr encourages Bitcoin Unlimited to use the BIP process for cross-implementation standards. Before claiming a bit, it is necessary to prove its usefulness and that it will have actual users.</summary>
