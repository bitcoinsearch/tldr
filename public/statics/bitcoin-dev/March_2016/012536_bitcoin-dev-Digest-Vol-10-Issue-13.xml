    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Daniele Pinna suggested that instead of implementing a proposal for real-time hash rate rebalancing, the difficulty adjustment could be adjusted at each new block using the current method. However, this would result in oscillation between blocks, even if miners were switching hardware on and off. To prevent this, Pinna suggested performing a weighted average of the previous 2016 blocks to find an optimal weighting based on historical interblock timing data. Pinna noted that the optimal solution is the critically damped oscillator. Mike Wozniak highlighted that Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets must also calculate retargeting but stated that it is a simple calculation that would not affect the runtime of SPV wallets.</summary>
