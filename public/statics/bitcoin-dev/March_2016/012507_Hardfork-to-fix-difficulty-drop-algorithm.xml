    <summary>The discussion began regarding the predictability of Bitcoin's inflation model and how it affects capital investments. Eric Voskuil stated that all capital investments are based on expectations of future returns, which can be factored in perfectly to make inflation a cost, not a tax. The conversation then shifted to the concept of hard forks being altcoins and the ability to create an altcoin with a 22-million-coin limit and a smooth inflation schedule. It was agreed upon that if miners choose to mine this altcoin en-mass, it's our choice whether or not we buy those coins. However, it is unlikely to happen, so the discussion remains academic.</summary>
