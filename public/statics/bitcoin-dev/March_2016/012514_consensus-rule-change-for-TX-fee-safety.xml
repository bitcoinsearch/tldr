    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Henning Kopp proposes that a safety mechanism be implemented in the client to warn users if certain conditions are met, rather than doing a hardfork. In response, Peter Todd points out that the current version of Bitcoin Core already implements a safety limit with the "absurd fee" limit of 10,000 times the minimum relay fee. This limit is active in both the wallet and the sendrawtransaction RPC call, with the wallet also having a user configurable -maxtxfee option to limit fees set by the wallet, which currently defaults to 0.1 BTC.</summary>
