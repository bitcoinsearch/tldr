    <summary>On March 8th, 2016, G. Andrew Stone wrote to bitcoin-dev regarding the documentation and discussion of cross-implementation standards. Bitcoin Unlimited has their own process for this and encourages interested engineers to join their uncensored forum. Luke Dashjr replied, stating that Bitcoin-dev and the BIP process are not affiliated with Core and suggested that Bitcoin Unlimited use the BIP process for peer review from the wider Bitcoin development community. Dashjr also offered to assign BIP numbers to the current BUIPs (Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposals) if they meet the basic requirements. He requested links to each of the BUIPs and stated that discussions may occur on other forums besides the mailing list.</summary>
