    <summary>Jonas, a contributor to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) on Github, has submitted two draft versions of BIPs that tackle the issue of decoupling wallets/clients from nodes while assuming that the user or group knows the remote peer. Authentication would be required to selectively allow bloom filtering of transactions, encryption or any other node service that might lead to fingerprinting or resource attacks. Encryption is highly recommended when connecting an SPV node to a trusted node, and authentication would allow accessing private p2p extensions from a remote SPV peer for fee estimation purposes. Jonas acknowledges other methods to increase privacy and integrity such as Tor, VPN, stunnel, etc., but believes that authentication and basic communication encryption should be part of the protocol and its setup should be completely hassle-free. Feedback is welcome.</summary>
