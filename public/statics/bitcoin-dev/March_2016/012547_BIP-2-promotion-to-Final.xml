    <summary>The soft-fork proposed in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 2 can only become final if there is no hard-fork with potentially-majority support or at most three months have passed. However, the definition of "potentially-majority" is unclear and raises questions about a possible shop owner vetoing a hard-fork, which is expected to be adopted by the entire Bitcoin economy, including those who sell goods and services for bitcoin payments, as well as holders who would spend their bitcoins differently. Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev has opened a pull request for moving BIP 2 to Final Status, applying its criteria to itself, which requires rough consensus on the mailing list and an address of all objections. The reference implementation is included in the mentioned PR. If there are no outstanding objections by April 9th, 2016, the draft BIP will be considered to have reached rough consensus and updated to Final Status.</summary>
