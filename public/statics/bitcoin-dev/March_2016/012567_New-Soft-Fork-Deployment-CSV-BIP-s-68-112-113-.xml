    <summary>The message announces a new soft fork to be deployed using BIP 9 version bits. The deployment is referred to as CSV (CheckSequenceVerify) and will activate three BIPs as consensus rules - Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, and Median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations. These BIPs have been updated with the deployment information stating start and end times for both mainnet and testnet. Bitcoin Core will release 0.11.3 and 0.12.1 software which implements these soft forks in the near future.</summary>
