    <summary>A proposal for BIP75, "Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption," has been tentatively assigned number 75 and includes adding optional fields to the paymentDetails message. The proposed new fields are subtractable fee, fee per kb, and replace by fee. While these extensions have nothing to do with encryption, James MacWhyte sees this as an opportunity for a general modernization of BIP70. Andreas Schildbach disagrees, stating that other extensions should go to separate BIPs. The discussion continues on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
