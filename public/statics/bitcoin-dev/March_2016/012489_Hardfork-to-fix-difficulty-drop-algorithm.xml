    <summary>The upcoming subsidy halving in July has raised concerns that a significant number of miners could drop off the network, leading to a longer block interval and a higher per-block transaction volume. This could cause the block size limit to be hit sooner than expected. To alleviate this risk, a hardfork to the difficulty adjustment algorithm has been proposed so it can adapt quicker to such a significant drop in mining rate. BtcDrak has well-tested code for this in his altcoin, which could be ready in time to be deployed alongside SegWit. If not, it may be reasonable to push for at least code-readiness before July. The proposal is not expected to be controversial, and other ideas or concerns are welcome.</summary>
