    <summary>The author has submitted two BIPs for review that have been updated based on feedback and IRC discussions. The first BIP includes changes to the encryption process, including no message wrapping, MAC implementation, independent ECDH negotiation and optimized message format. The second BIP focuses on p2p authentication with simplified processes and encrypted channels. The proposed changes are backward compatible, allowing peers supporting the extension to interact with older peers. While there are concerns about fingerprinting and potential attacks, the current p2p implementation ignores unknown commands.</summary>
