    <summary>Luke, a member of the bitcoin community, has opened a pull request to move BIP 2 to final status. The current requirement for this is that "the reference implementation is complete and accepted by the community". However, given the vagueness of this criteria, Luke intends to apply BIP 2's more specific criteria to itself, which states that a process BIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. This proposal should have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be given in such circumstances. Furthermore, there is a reference implementation in the mentioned PR.Luke has requested the community to review the latest draft BIP and provide any objections ASAP. If there are no outstanding objections on 2016 April 9th, Luke will consider the current draft to have reached rough consensus and update its Status to Final by merging the PR.</summary>
