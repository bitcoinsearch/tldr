    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alice Wonder suggested adding safety rules for transaction fees to prevent mistakes. She referenced a transaction with an absurdly high fee of 15 BTC and proposed two possible solutions: A) limiting the fee to the sum of outputs or B) limiting the fee per byte to four times the largest fee per byte in the previous block. Some participants in the discussion disagreed with implementing this as a hardfork, suggesting instead that it should be implemented as a safety mechanism in the client, such as a warning pop-up. Alice Wonder argued that adding protections could help increase confidence in using bitcoin and prevent typo blunders. The discussion concluded with no clear consensus on how to proceed.</summary>
