    <summary>The topic of discussion in this context is about the forum used for comments and its accessibility. In an email sent by Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev on March 16, 2016 at 22:24:30, he stated that the forum used for comments should have a low barrier of use. He compared two forums; the Bitcoin Wiki and the GitHub wiki. He explained that the Bitcoin Wiki only requires a request for editing privileges while the GitHub wiki requires reading and agreeing to a lengthy Terms of Service contract.However, Luke Dashjr argued that neither of those two forums qualifies in that case. BTCDraks seconded the objection. The importance of having a low barrier of use for forums used for comments cannot be overemphasized as it allows for more participation and input from users.</summary>
