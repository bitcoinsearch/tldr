    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Tom raises concerns about the resource consumption involved in signing every message due to the protocols lacking MACs. Tom also questions Jonas Schnelli's draft version of two BIPs regarding encryption on non-pre-approved connections, implementation of encryption without openSSL, using p2p code to connect a wallet to a node, and the per-message encryption scheme. Tom also points out issues with implementing a policy to ignore requesting peers after 5 unsuccessfully authentication tries to avoid resource attacks. Finally, Tom suggests that Jonas Schnelli needs to explain how the complete communication is hashed specifically since every message has a hash of the state until it reaches that point.</summary>
