    <summary>In a conversation between Luke Dashjr and Mustafa Al-Bassam on March 10, 2016, they discussed the wording of a soft-fork that does not become final as long as a hard-fork has potentially-majority support or at most three months. Dashjr defined "potentially-majority" as a group that is large enough to potentially constitute a majority. Al-Bassam raised a concern about the requirement for adoption from the entire Bitcoin economy for a hard-fork BIP, including those selling desirable goods and services in exchange for bitcoin payments and holders who wish to spend or sell their bitcoins differently after a hard-fork. He questioned what would happen if one shop owner out of thousands did not adapt to the hard-fork, but Dashjr clarified that one shop cannot operate in a vacuum and they will soon find themselves no longer selling in exchange for bitcoin payments. Dashjr added that if this situation happens, they will cease to meet the criteria enabling their veto. Dashjr agreed with the definition of a hard-fork becoming active but also recognized that someone could try to point to one instance of one buyer and one seller using the blockchain to buy and sell from each other or set one up.</summary>
