    <summary>A draft version of two BIPs addressing the issue of decoupling wallets/clients from nodes, while assuming a user or group knows the remote peer, has been submitted to Github by Jonas Schnelli. Authentication, encryption and certificate-free encryption-handshakes are recommended for connecting a SPV node to a trusted node and accessing private p2p extensions from a remote SPV peer, to reduce privacy and integrity risks. Other methods such as Tor, VPNs and Stunnel can also be used to increase privacy and integrity. However, authentication and basic communication encryption should be part of the protocol and its setup should be complete hassle-free. The BIPs have been reviewed and suggestions made.</summary>
