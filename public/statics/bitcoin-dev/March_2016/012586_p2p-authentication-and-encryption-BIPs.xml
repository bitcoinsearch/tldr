    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread on March 24th, 2016, user Chris suggested that connecting an SPV wallet to a full node would be a useful application. He had previously modified the Android bitcoin-wallet to connect to his .onion node, but found it to be slow and borderline unusable. He proposed using an interface similar to JSON or zeroMQ to solve this problem, suggesting that this would not replace a full-node-connection but rather supplement it with the ability to ask authenticated questions over the channel. This would provide a better separation of concerns.</summary>
