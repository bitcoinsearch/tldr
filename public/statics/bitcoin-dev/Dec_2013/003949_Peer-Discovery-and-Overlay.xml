    <summary>In an email thread from December 2013, Jeremy Spilman asked about past instances of applications hijacking or abusing the 'getaddr' functionality in Bitcoin's peer-to-peer messaging system. He also asked if there were any guidelines on this matter. In response, it was suggested that a BIP by Stefan Thomas for adding custom services to the protocol could be helpful for network discovery, but noted that it should not be used in a hostile manner. The email includes links to two relevant BIPs, one on custom services and sub-commands, and another on network discovery guidelines.</summary>
