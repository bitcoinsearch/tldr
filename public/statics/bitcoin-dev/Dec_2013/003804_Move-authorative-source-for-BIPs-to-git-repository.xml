    <summary>In December 2013, Wladimir proposed a new repository for storing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) which was deemed more secure than having them on the wiki. The repository was set up at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips. To avoid confusion, it was suggested that BIPs on the wiki should be replaced with links to the github documents and notices that any changes should be proposed on github or mailed to the BIP editor (gmaxwell). However, Luke felt that this would stifle active BIP draft editing and make it harder for some developers to write BIPs for their proposals. He didn't think bigger hurdles should be put in place.</summary>
