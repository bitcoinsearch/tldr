    <summary>The author of the post talks about using a modified version of Gavin's fee estimation framework for bitcoind. The post provides estimates for confirming transactions within different numbers of blocks based on a certain number of samples taken, along with median and 10th percentile fees paid per kilobyte and median priority for free transactions. The data provided shows that there is missing data in some cases where no samples were taken. The maximum number of samples taken was 1000. The estimates range from transactions that require confirmation within 0 blocks to those that require confirmation within 55 blocks.</summary>
