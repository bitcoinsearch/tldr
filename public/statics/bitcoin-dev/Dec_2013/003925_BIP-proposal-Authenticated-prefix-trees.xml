    <title>BIP proposal: Authenticated prefix trees</title>

    <summary>The context discusses the proposal of introducing additional BIPs that describe the use of the data structure for stateless validation and mining, UBC address index for "SPV+" operating modes, document timestamping, and merged mining. The author ponders whether the BIP can stand alone without specific changes to the protocol or end-user accessible features defined within it, as BIPs are meant to define interoperability rather than implementation details. They suggest that unless the tree itself becomes part of the protocol, its specification, test vectors, and reference implementation can live elsewhere. However, they express interest in reading about BIPs that use this tree to achieve scalability or security benefits.</summary>
