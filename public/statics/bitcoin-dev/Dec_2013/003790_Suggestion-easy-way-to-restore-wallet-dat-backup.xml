    <summary>The bitcoin-qt client allows users to easily make a backup of their wallet.dat file, but restoring it is a more complicated process. To restore the backup, the user must copy the file to the correct folder and execute "bitcoin-qt -rescan". The author suggests that the bitcoin-qt developers could implement an easier way to restore the wallet, such as adding an option in the File menu called "Restore Wallet" or "Recover Wallet". This would show a dialog asking for the backup file and everything would be done automatically, making the process less manual and more user-friendly. The author believes that if we want more people to use bitcoin, these operations should be made as easy as possible. The author's message was originally posted on bitcoin-user, but received no replies.</summary>
