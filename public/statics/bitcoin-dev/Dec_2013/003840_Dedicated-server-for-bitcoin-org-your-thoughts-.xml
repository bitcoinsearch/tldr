    <summary>The bitcoin.org domain is registered under an anonymous registration, making it difficult to determine who owns it. The original registrant was Satoshi, and the domain is now controlled by someone named Sirius, who is no longer active in the project. This lack of transparency has raised concerns about trusting an unidentified party. The recent bitcointalk fiasco has also brought attention to the security of the current registrar. It is suggested that the current registrar may not be very secure, highlighting the potential risks associated with anonymity in domain registration.</summary>
