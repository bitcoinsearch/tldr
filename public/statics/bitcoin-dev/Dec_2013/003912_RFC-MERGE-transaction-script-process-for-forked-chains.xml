    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing whether a “merge” block is necessary for trading transactions offline. Transactions can be traded offline as long as there are no secretly double-spending coins that are sent to the Blockchain. When the connection to the Bitcoin network is re-established, transactions are transmitted, while any transactions that derive from the double-spent one become invalid. If any merge conflict arises, it would require human interaction, and bob and his friends broadcast a MERGE request with a transaction fee sufficient to cover reconciling the double-spends, and incentivize a miner to do some extra work to merge. There is no need for a "merge" block, as transactions can be traded offline and then transmitted when the connection to the Bitcoin network is restored.</summary>
