    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn proposed the idea of the payment protocol needing a notion of fee or the ability for recipients to specify inputs and outputs. This detail was noticed by BitPay last week when some transactions were not reaching their bitcoind border routers due to low or no fees. As a result, there was a discussion on all things fee-related including SPV fees and getting child-pays-for-parent in some form out to miners. The need for a smart and dynamic fee market was also emphasized. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, was part of this conversation.</summary>
