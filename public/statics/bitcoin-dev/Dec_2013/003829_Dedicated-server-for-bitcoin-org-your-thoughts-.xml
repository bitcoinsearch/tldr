    <summary>In December 2013, Mike Hearn suggested that Sirius, who owned the DNS for bitcoin.org at the time, should pass it on to someone who is actually still involved with the project. Gregory Maxwell opposed the idea of the Bitcoin Foundation having control of bitcoin.org and thinks it would be foolish of them to accept it if offered. Drak suggested handing the keys to the Bitcoin project lead, or giving admin rights to those who have proven they can be trusted with the code projects such as Github, Sourceforge, and the mailing list. The discussion revolved around finding a trustworthy entity to control bitcoin.org.</summary>
