    <summary>The discussion in this email thread revolves around the issue of accidental high fees paid by Bitcoin users. Drak suggests implementing a confirmation box for unusually high fees, while Jim discusses other scenarios where users may lose their Bitcoins due to mistakes such as deleting change addresses or importing private keys. Jim also mentions changes being made in MultiBit to reduce the possibility of Bitcoin loss, such as hiding the ability to delete wallets and sending change to a separate address. The discussion highlights the importance of wallet authors taking measures to protect users from making costly errors, whether through accidental high fees or other mistakes.</summary>
