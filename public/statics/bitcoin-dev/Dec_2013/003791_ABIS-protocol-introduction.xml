    <summary>The ABIS protocol is a concept that has been developed over many years and is now being presented as a basic idea. It has been sent for review and possible consideration, with further additions expected in the near future. The GitHub link provided gives more information on the ABIS protocol, which is designed to be a blockchain-based identity system that allows users to securely store and share their personal information. The protocol also includes features such as multi-factor authentication and flexible access controls. The creators of ABIS are seeking feedback and contributions from interested parties.</summary>
