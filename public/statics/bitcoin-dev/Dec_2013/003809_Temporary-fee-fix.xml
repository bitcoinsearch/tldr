    <title>Temporary fee fix</title>

    <summary>The author acknowledges the need for a new fee market but points out that until it is established, users will continue to complain about the high "fixed" fee of 0.1 mBTC, with some even comparing it unfavorably to bank fees. The author suggests lowering the minimum relay fee per kilobyte to alleviate these concerns in the interim, suggesting an amount of 0.01 mBTC without any concrete reasoning behind this number. This proposal is made in light of recent negative reviews of Mycelium on the Google Play Store, many of which mention the high fees.</summary>
