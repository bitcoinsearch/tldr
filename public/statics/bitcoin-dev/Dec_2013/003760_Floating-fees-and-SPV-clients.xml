    <summary>Bitcoin's limited capacity means that transactions may not confirm in a reasonable amount of time due to high demand or DoS attacks. However, in the case of mobile wallets for everyday transactions and small purchases, Bitcoin should be able to scale to handle them. Transactions that would be affected by sudden capacity crunches are those involving very small micropayments or "optional" internal transactions like wallet mixing, which would not show up in a mobile wallet UI. Regarding merchants paying transaction fees, child-pays-for-parent is currently inefficient, but it is unclear whether this is a fundamental issue or simply the result of how the code has been written. Further exploration is needed to determine if any fixes are possible.</summary>
