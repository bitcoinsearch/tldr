    <summary>The bitcoin-qt client allows users to easily backup wallet.dat but restoring it requires copying the file to the correct folder and executing "bitcoin-qt -rescan". The author believes that this is part of a larger UX problem with bitcoin-qt and suggests a document-oriented approach to wallets. This would make users select a location to store their wallet, open the most recent wallet when running the program, and allow opening a wallet by double-clicking it directly in the OS. While this may bring other considerations such as multiple wallets being open at the same time, moving wallet files while open, and needing to backup wallets periodically, it would be a big enough usability win to consider. Additionally, adopting BIP 32 style deterministically derived private keys from a single seed would eliminate some of these issues.</summary>
