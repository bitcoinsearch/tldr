    <summary>A new peer-to-peer microblogging platform called Twister has been created using Bitcoin and Libtorrent. The creator of the project expressed gratitude to the developers of both codes for their work while also apologizing for merging them together. The main site for Twister can be found at http://twister.net.co, and a white-paper detailing the project can be accessed at http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152. Twister offers users the ability to create an account with a unique public and private key pair. Users can discover and follow other users, and post short messages that are encrypted and sent directly to their followers. In addition to the standard features of a microblogging platform, Twister also includes a distributed file storage system that allows users to share files securely.The use of Bitcoin technology in Twister allows for decentralized registration and authentication of user accounts. This means that users do not have to rely on a central authority to manage their accounts, and their personal information is kept private. Additionally, the use of Libtorrent technology enables faster download and upload speeds for shared files.Bitcoin and Libtorrent developers have been offered write-access to the repository for those who want it. This provides an opportunity for interested parties to contribute to the development of Twister and improve its functionality. Overall, Twister offers a unique and secure alternative to traditional microblogging platforms.</summary>
