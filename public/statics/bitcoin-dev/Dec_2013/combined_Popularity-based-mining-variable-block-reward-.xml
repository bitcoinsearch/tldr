    <summary>The proposal for variable block rewards based on popularity has been put forth by the author, who suggests it could bring more exchange rate stability to a new coin. The author believes Bitcoin lacks some basic features of money and has noticed volatility in its exchange rate that does not seem to go away. The proposed mining scheme would grow or decrease block rewards with the popularity of the coin, making the exchange rate more stable since greater interest would not result in a higher coin price. The proposed system would have no reliance on external data, as each network node would determine popularity based on factors such as coin valuation/exchange rate and number of transactions, and come up with its own block reward value. If a new block were mined with such a reward value, it would be included in the node's chain. There would be a percentage of tolerance for block reward value to prevent system collapse. This idea was previously proposed by Jan Kučera in 2013, where he suggested that each network node would determine the popularity of the reward on its own. Jameson Lopp, a software engineer at Bronto Software, was skeptical of this proposal due to the dependence on various factors like coin valuation/exchange rate. The topic has been discussed many times before on Bitcointalk. The author acknowledges that they may be wrong about their idea and seeks feedback from developers on whether it has been spoken about before and what opinions developers have on the proposal.</summary>
