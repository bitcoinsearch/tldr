    <summary>In December 2013, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, wrote an email discussing the recent Bitcointalk fiasco. He raised concerns about the security of the registrar controlling the domains, stating that it was likely not secure. Garzik had originally registered bitcointalk.org but passed on control to Sirius. However, he was disappointed with how Sirius handled it, as he did not change the registrar credentials for months despite repeated urging. It is suggested that both domains are not registered and controlled in the same way.</summary>
