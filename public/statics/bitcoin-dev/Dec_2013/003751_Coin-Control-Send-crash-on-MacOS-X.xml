    <summary>Warren has been backporting patches from master and Litecoin to create a Bitcoin client 0.8 with more features, which works well on Linux and Win32. However, today they discovered a rare crash that can happen on MacOS X involving SendCoinsEntry::clear(). Toffoo and coblee were able to reproduce the issue on MacOS X 10.9 and Warren on 10.6.8. The build was made with Xcode 3.2.6 on MacOS X with MacPorts qt4-mac qt-4.8.4, meant to approximate Gavin's build environment for the 0.8.x releases. Warren has been unsuccessful at building master due to an unfamiliar build environment and is trying qt-4.8.5 next, but it will be difficult to reproduce the crash.</summary>
