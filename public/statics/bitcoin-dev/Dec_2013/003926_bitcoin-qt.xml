    <summary>In an email chain dated December 20, 2013, Chris Evans requested that the bitcoin.conf settings be editable within the app rather than using an external editor and for it to be easier to enable rpc server mode. Wladimir responded by suggesting that testing Diapolo's pull request to add a few options to the options dialog (and improve the dialog in general) would help both him and Diapolo. However, he warned against making it too easy to shoot oneself in the foot with RPC settings. The pull request did not include RPC settings.</summary>
