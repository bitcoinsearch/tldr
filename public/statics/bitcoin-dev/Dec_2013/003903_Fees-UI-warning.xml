    <summary>In a communication dated December 16, 2013, Jim wrote to Pieter indicating that the import of individual private keys was being removed from the HD version of MultiBit. The focus of this change was primarily for safety reasons. It is not clear what these safety reasons are; however, it can be assumed that this decision was made to prevent unauthorized access to funds stored in the wallet. Pieter further inquired whether this change meant that the reuse of change addresses would no longer be possible. It is not stated why Pieter asked this question, but it can be inferred that the reuse of change addresses could have been a potential security issue. Overall, the email exchange between Jim and Pieter indicates that there were changes being made to the HD version of MultiBit to improve its security. The removal of the import of individual private keys and a potential ban on the reuse of change addresses suggest that the developers of MultiBit were taking steps to ensure that users' funds were safe and secure.</summary>
