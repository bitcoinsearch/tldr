    <summary>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Ryan Carboni on December 9, 2013, the topic of how exchanges are kept track of in Bitcoin was discussed. Carboni suggested that exchanges could be hard-coded into the system or left up to miners to choose, but Andresen pushed back, comparing it to saying we need a way to travel around the world quickly without focusing on the difficult problem that needs to be solved for it to work. The conversation took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list sponsored by Intel XDK.</summary>
