    <summary>In an email thread from 2013, Troy Benjegerdes expressed his interest in receiving feedback on distributed version control systems. He specifically mentioned the usefulness of being able to merge two different forks. However, it was noted that the system already automatically merges forks by pulling in all novel non-conflicting transactions and including them in the next blocks. The context does not provide any further information on this automatic process or the specific version control system being referred to.</summary>
