    <summary>In an email dated December 31, 2013, Drak expressed concern that the NSA has the ability to change every download of bitcoin-qt. However, another individual responded, stating that the downloads are already protected by something stronger than SSL and that actual signatures of the downloads with offline keys provide a chance against the NSA. The responder also criticized the use of SSL, stating that it produces an entirely false sense of security. The responder pointed out that the NSA can easily compromise an HTTPS download site and has unparalleled access to exploits, and even government-run CAs certificate authorities issue CA certs to random governments and corporations for dataloss prevention purposes.</summary>
