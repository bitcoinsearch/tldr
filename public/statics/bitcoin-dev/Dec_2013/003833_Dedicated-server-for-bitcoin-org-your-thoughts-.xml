    <summary>In a discussion thread started by Luke-Jr on December 8, 2013, the question of who has admin rights to code projects was raised. Drak suggested that those who have already proven their trustworthiness should be given admin rights. However, Luke-Jr argued that it's not just about trust but also about robustness - if something were to happen to the current admin, others need to be able to step in and take over. Therefore, he suggests that control over the domain should be with more than one person, specifically those who have control over the software project at sf.github.</summary>
