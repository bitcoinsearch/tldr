    <summary>The discussion is about the use of GitHub versus the wiki for storing BIP documents. Jeff Garzik argues that using GitHub would be better than the wiki due to its primary source status, and mentions a process for submitting and editing BIPs via email or pull requests on GitHub. Luke-Jr disagrees with the idea of replacing the BIPs on the wiki with links to GitHub documents because it could discourage active editing of drafts. The discussion ends without a consensus, but the repository for BIP documents on GitHub remains active.</summary>
