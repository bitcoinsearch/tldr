    <summary>In an email exchange on December 4, 2013, developer Mike Hearn requested that the thread at hand not be derailed. He stated that his comments were factually correct and encouraged those who wished to discuss different methods to start a new thread. Another participant in the conversation responded by stating that the concept of replace-by-fee was no less speculative than Hearn's original proposals, and argued that Hearn himself was attempting to convince others that fees should work differently. The exchange took place on a public mailing list and included an attached digital signature.</summary>
