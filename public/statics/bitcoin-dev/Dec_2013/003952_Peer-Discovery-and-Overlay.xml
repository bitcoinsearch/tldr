    <summary>In this context, Warren Togami Jr. expresses concern about the issue of node addresses being a service and sponsored BlueMatt to implement an address database for bitcoinj as a solution. This will make it less reliant on what DNS tells it. Peter Todd explains that DNS seeds are currently used for this purpose, but they can easily compromise clients in various ways. The implementation of the address database is not only about decentralization, but also scalability, as it is a prerequisite for chain pruning. The developers are looking forward to reviewing and merging the changes.</summary>
