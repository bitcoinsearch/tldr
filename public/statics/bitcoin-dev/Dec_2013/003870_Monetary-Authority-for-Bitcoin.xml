    <summary>Bitcoin is a complex system that was not developed simultaneously. A conversation between Gavin Andresen and Ryan Carboni on December 9th, 2013 discussed the possibility of hard coding exchanges into Bitcoin or allowing miners to choose them. However, Andresen pointed out that this proposal ignores the difficult problem that would have to be solved for it to work. He compared it to saying "We need a way to travel around the world quickly. There will be an anti-gravity technology; how this works is not something I'm personally focused on."</summary>
