    <summary>In a conversation between Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik on December 12, 2013, the topic of address reuse came up. Specifically, they discussed the use case where an individual provides the Bitcoin Foundation with a PaymentRequest that includes multiple Outputs each having a different xpubkey. Andresen suggests that the Foundation's wallet software should take care of iterating in this situation. Garzik agrees and adds that rotating through multiple outputs is a useful stopgap solution to address reuse, but HD wallets will ultimately solve this problem more effectively.</summary>
