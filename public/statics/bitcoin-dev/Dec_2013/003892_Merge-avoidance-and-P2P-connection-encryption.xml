    <summary>In this email conversation between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen, they discuss the integration of BIP32 and BIP70. They suggest specifying output scripts for backwards compatibility and allowing each output to have an additional xpubkey and iteration count field. Gavin asks why there would be an iteration count, suggesting that the payer should handle it. He proposes a use case where the Foundation is given a PaymentRequest with different xpubkeys for each output, and suggests that the Foundation's wallet software should take care of iterating by saving state or using the number of months from the date in the original payment request.</summary>
