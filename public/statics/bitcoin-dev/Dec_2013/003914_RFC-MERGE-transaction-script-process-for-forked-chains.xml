    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin mailing list, Troy Benjegerdes sought feedback on merging different forks using distributed version control systems. However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that Bitcoin already automatically merges forks by pulling in novel non-conflicting transactions contained in the fork and including them in the next blocks. The conversation then turned to the hard upper limit for the number of coins in Bitcoin, which raises issues for miners who try to support an islanded network. A potential solution is using freicoin-like demurrage, which would impact new coinbase based on the percentage of hashing power on the other side of the fork. This proposal is complex and not as secure or reliable as initially imagined.</summary>
