    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin transaction fees, Gavin Andresen proposed an extension to the PPv1 protocol that would allow up to a specified number of satoshis to be deducted from the amount paid and used to pay network transaction fees. Fees are calculated per byte of tx data, so the proposal suggests calling it "allowfeeperkb" or "requirefeeperkb" to avoid wasting fees for child-pays-for-parent transactions. The merchant would like to limit total fees deducted, but only in conjunction with specifying fee-per-kb requirements. The proposal is not intended to show anything in the default case, but rather to explain to users why they have to pay extra when spending a large amount of dust.</summary>
