    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen on December 3, 2013, they discussed adding a fee feature to PPv1. The suggestion was made to create a merchant-pays-fee extension that would allow users to deduct up to a certain amount of satoshis to pay Bitcoin network transaction fees. The rationale behind this was to prevent wallet software from giving users discounts and to allow users to pay more in fees if necessary. Additionally, there was consensus to shorten the BIP72 request=... to just r=... to save characters in QR codes. Gavin Andresen planned on making these changes unless someone objected.</summary>
