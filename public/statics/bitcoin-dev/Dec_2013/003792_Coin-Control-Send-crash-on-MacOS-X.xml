    <summary>In December 2013, Warren Togami Jr. backported patches from master and Litecoin to make a Bitcoin 0.8 client with more features. The backported patches were working well on Linux and Win32. However, a rare crash was discovered on MacOS X. It seemed to be some kind of race condition involving SendCoinsEntry::clear(). Wladimir suggested that the setFocus should not be in clear() and instead moved to a separate function "focusPayTo". After removing both setFocus() calls that happen after Send is clicked, it caused another crash within qt. Warren continued trying other things to fix the issue.</summary>
