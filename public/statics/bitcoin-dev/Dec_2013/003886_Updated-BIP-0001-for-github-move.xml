    <summary>In the context given, Wladimir highlights changes made to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Github is mentioned as the platform used instead of wiki. Markdown format is now allowed. Weirdnesses such as "A BIP editor must subscribe to the gmaxwell at gmail.com list" have been fixed. A new section has been created to list the BIP editors, which currently only includes gmaxwell. Wladimir prefers discussions on mailing lists instead of forums. These changes are part of a cleanup and change for the Github move and do not affect jgarzik's proposed process. The pull request can be found on Github.</summary>
