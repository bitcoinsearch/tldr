    <summary>In this context, a developer named Ryan Carboni proposed a change in the Bitcoin network topology. He suggested that if only four blocks have been mined and time is more than three days, then difficulty should be adjusted downwards. This suggestion was met with skepticism from Mark Friedenbach who believed that such adjustments introduce security risks. If a low-hashpower attacker isolates someone from the main chain, it would be difficult to notice network block generation has stalled. In his opinion, there are fast-acting alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms being explored by some alts. Gavin, another developer, advised Ryan to test his idea on bitcointalk.org or provide more technical substance before engaging with the forum. Developers tend to prefer dealing with numbers known to be either 1 or 0, not a variable set of possible values depending on non-technical factors.</summary>
