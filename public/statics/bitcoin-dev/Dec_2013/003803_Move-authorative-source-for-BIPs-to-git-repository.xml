    <summary>Recently, a repository was created to store the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) documents, as it is considered a more secure solution than having them on the wiki. The BIPs can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips. The next step is to replace the BIPs on the wiki with links to the Github documents and include a notice that changes should be proposed on Github or mailed to the BIP editor, gmaxwell. This will help prevent confusion among users. Wladimir encourages agreement on this approach.</summary>
