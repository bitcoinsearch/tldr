    <summary>In this email thread, Peter Todd questions the validity of replace-by-fee and how it is not any less speculative than the original proposals. He also mentions that there are discussions about how to handle fees in requests using the payment protocol, which is not currently used anywhere, so doing things differently is not possible. Additionally, he points out that the original proposal for handling fees has not received comments, implying it is uncontroversial. However, he notes that Todd's suggestion of a fundamental change to the behavior of all Bitcoin nodes is off-topic for the thread at hand. Finally, he asks Todd to keep his comments specific to managing floating fees by SPV wallets or negotiating fees when using the payment protocol.</summary>
