    <summary>In this email correspondence, Mike suggests splitting multi-sig and multi-factor authentication into two separate categories. He believes that multi-factor user authentication is very valuable and not the same as multi-factor signing, which is a second level of complexity. Mike proposes that wallets should use multi-factor authentication before authorizing access to a wallet and must use multi-factor authentication before signing a transaction. In terms of multi-factor signing, he notes that it may be too early to define, but suggests that wallets should not create two keys on a single host or device and provide a way to import external public keys which can be used as part of a P2SH address.Mike also mentions a small word-choice nit, explaining that he had to look up the meaning of "SHALL" (which he now knows is the same as MUST). Additionally, in an unrelated topic, Drak mentions that Linus advises against signing each commit and suggests incorporating his recommendation for signing tags with `git tag -s` into the spec as a MUST.</summary>
