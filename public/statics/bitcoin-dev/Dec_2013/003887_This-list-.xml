    <summary>The topic of discussion seems to be derailed due to the presence of trolls in the conversation. The author feels that the list is becoming similar to Bitcointalk, which is known for its abundance of internet trolls. It appears that the author would like to steer the conversation back to its original purpose and avoid the distractions caused by trolls. It is important to maintain a respectful and productive dialogue in order to achieve the desired outcome of the discussion.</summary>
