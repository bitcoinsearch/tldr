    <summary>In a discussion regarding Bitcoin address re-use problems, generating fresh addresses from public extended keys was suggested as a solution that would also enhance the privacy of users. The exchange of extended public keys instead of single addresses could also benefit non-merchant use of Payment Protocol. However, the challenge is how to push the extended public key down to the wallet itself. Services could be developed to facilitate this exchange or wallet software could communicate directly via PGP-encrypted files in Payment Protocol format through various channels such as Bluetooth, AirDrop, email, BitMessage, etc. The idea of using extended public keys from bip 32 to share multiple addresses in one go was also mentioned to enable regular payments without asking for further addresses, and to assist with P2SH where the public key is needed. Overall, these ideas have potential to improve the efficiency and security of Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
