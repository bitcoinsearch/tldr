    <summary>Saïvann is seeking feedback on the idea of moving bitcoin.org to a dedicated server with an SSL certificate. The move is being considered more seriously, but Saïvann wants to gather opinions before proceeding. Bitcoin.org is a website that provides information about the digital currency and offers resources for those interested in using it. A dedicated server would provide more control over the website's hosting, while an SSL certificate would improve its security.</summary>
