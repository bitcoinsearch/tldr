    <summary>The bitcoin.org website is currently in need of funding, and the question of who will pay for it must be addressed. While the Bitcoin Foundation seems like an obvious choice to fund the website, there may be concerns about the foundation's involvement. The issue of anti-DoS protection is also raised, as well as the question of who will administer the website. It is suggested that the server should be owned by a trusted individual with SSH access for all core developers. Additionally, the control of the DNS for the website is uncertain, and it is unclear whether or not it can be transferred to the core developers.</summary>
