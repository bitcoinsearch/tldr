    <summary>Gregory Maxwell posted some questions on the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding a proposal for improving the data structure of bitcoin. Maxwell asked about the structure of VARCHAR(), the middle position of extradata, and the possibility of using SHA-512/256 instead of SHA-256^2. Maxwell also raised concerns about the performance cost of validating the structure under a zero-knowledge proof, adding that the cost would be expensive if there is any place where data from children will be combined with a variable offset. However, he suggested that hash function performance is not a significant cost in the near term. The proposed structure includes level compression and updatable proofs for the validation and wallet indexes, which allows composable proofs to keep proof sizes small.</summary>
