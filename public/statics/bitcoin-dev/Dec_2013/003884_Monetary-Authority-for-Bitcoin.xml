    <summary>Bitcoin's volatility is a result of the collective knowledge of its future acceptance, rather than its architecture. This knowledge is currently based on volatile sources such as the opinions of politicians and government policies. However, as time goes on, laws and regulations will start to form, making it harder to change earlier confirmations. This stability will add value to Bitcoin between $0.0001 and $100,000 per coin, regardless of whether rulings are positive or negative. There have been many proposals for "stablecoins" in Bitcointalk and other forums, but it has been deemed impossible to implement in a secure and P2P system. Jorge Tim√≥n explains that Ryan Carboni's proposal is unfeasible and off-topic for the forum.</summary>
