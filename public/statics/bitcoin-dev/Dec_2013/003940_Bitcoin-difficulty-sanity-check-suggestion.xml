    <summary>In this message, a concern is raised by an individual named Ryan Carboni regarding the security risks associated with adjustments made to Bitcoin. Carboni suggests that a sanity check be implemented, wherein after three days of only four blocks being mined, difficulty should be adjusted downwards. He projects a Bitcoin mining bubble and warns of the importance of having alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms in place, such as those explored by some alts, including a 9-block interval, 144-block window, and Parks-McClellan FIR filter used by Freicoin to recover from just such a mining bubble. The concern is that if the network block generation were to stall due to a low-hashpower attacker, it could go unnoticed for three days, after which the block rate would appear normal but be completely controlled by the attacker in isolation from the mainnet. Carboni's message highlights the importance of ensuring the security of Bitcoin and having safeguards in place to protect against potential threats.</summary>
