    <summary>After testing macos leveldb parts for six days, there have been no complaints of new corruption from OMG and LTC users. Therefore, it is time to release version 0.8.6. However, on December 8, 2013, Warren Togami Jr. found a tiny error in version 0.8.6rc1. The leveldb subtree merge was done incorrectly, leaving an errant db/ directory in the base of bitcoin instead of src/leveldb. Gavin Andresen noted that this bug was not a showstopper and given that there have been hundreds of downloads with no reports of insanity, they decided to tag v0.8.6 and ship it.</summary>
