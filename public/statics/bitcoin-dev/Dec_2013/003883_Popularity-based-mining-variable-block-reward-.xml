    <summary>On a mailing list of the Bitcoin-development group, Jan Kučera proposed a new system for determining block rewards. According to the proposal, each network node would determine the popularity of the reward on its own, depending on various factors such as coin valuation/exchange rate and number of transactions. This would result in no reliance on external data, and every node would be free to decide the reward height. Jameson Lopp, a software engineer at Bronto Software, was skeptical of this proposal. He expressed his concern over the dependence on various factors like coin valuation/exchange rate. The topic has been discussed many times before on Bitcointalk. The email was sent by Jorge Timón, who is affiliated with freico.in.</summary>
