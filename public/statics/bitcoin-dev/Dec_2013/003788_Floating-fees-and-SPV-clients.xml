    <summary>Rises in sales tax are not unique to a specific location, as merchants tend to raise their prices when VAT increases. This is often the case globally, with few exceptions. However, the US system of taxation can be a complete headache for consumers, as they are often unaware of the exact amount they need to pay unless they are aware of the local rate and can perform the calculation themselves. This system is not widely used in many parts of the world economy, and can cause confusion and frustration among those who encounter it.Despite the challenges of navigating varying sender fees and UI implementations in wallets, there are solutions available for those willing to explore them. While some may struggle to find an intuitive GUI for this purpose, there are other wallets that have already implemented effective approaches that could be adopted by other wallet authors. By sharing information and collaborating on best practices, wallet creators can work together to make the user experience smoother and more intuitive for all.</summary>
