    <summary>Ryan Carboni expresses his belief in the possibility of changing the economic parameters of Bitcoin, stating that although deflation will still be possible under his proposal, Austrian-defined inflation is occurring within Bitcoin at a faster rate than desired. He suggests those who disagree with him read up on how the system works and why the argument from authority is rejected. Carboni's comments were made on a mailing list not intended for political discussions and he was advised to take his proposal to a proper venue, such as the bitcointalk.org forums where similar proposals have been discussed.</summary>
