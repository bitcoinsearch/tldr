    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen on December 3, 2013, the topic of transaction fees in Bitcoin was discussed. Andresen suggested that if a user wants to pay with a large transaction, they should cover the cost as allowing users to pay merchants with transactions full of dust would enable "bleed-the-merchant-dry attacks." Hearn argued that merchants could always refuse payment and refund it if necessary but acknowledged that refunds in this situation would be problematic since someone would have to pay the fee. Ultimately, both agreed that avoiding such situations was crucial.</summary>
