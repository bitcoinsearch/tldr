    <summary>The post on Reddit suggests that it could be possible to avert accidental payment of huge fees if wallets implemented a confirmation box when the fee amount seems unreasonable. The example given is if the fee is over 10 times what the default fee should be or if it's greater than x% of the sending amount. This would give users a second chance to confirm whether they really want to pay such a high fee. Recent stories about people accidentally paying huge fees have been reported, including one case where someone paid a 20.14BTC fee for a 0.05 BTC transaction, and another where someone paid a fee of about 200BTC which was refunded by the pool operator. Although the details of how this solution should work with flexible fees need to be fleshed out, it seems like a simple way to prevent such accidents.</summary>
