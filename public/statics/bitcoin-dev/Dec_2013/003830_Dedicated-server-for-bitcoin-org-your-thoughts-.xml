    <summary>In a discussion thread on December 8, 2013, Drak asked who had admin rights to code projects on platforms such as Github, SourceForge, and the mailing list. Drak also mentioned that those individuals who have admin rights have proven themselves to be trustworthy so far. Luke then asked if anyone could explain how Sirius, presumably a member of the discussion group, has proven to be untrustworthy.</summary>
