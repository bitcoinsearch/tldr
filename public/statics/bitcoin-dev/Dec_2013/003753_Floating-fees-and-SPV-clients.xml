    <summary>In an email sent on 12/01/2013 at 12:51 PM, Mike Hearn proposed a plan regarding a wallet's response to rejected transactions. He asked what should happen if a wallet receives a rejection message for a transaction with a fee that was deemed acceptable by its own estimates. Additionally, he questioned what should be done if only certain nodes report the rejection while others do not. In response, it was suggested that as long as the transaction is not confirmed through a broadcast, the application could offer to increase the fee slightly.</summary>
