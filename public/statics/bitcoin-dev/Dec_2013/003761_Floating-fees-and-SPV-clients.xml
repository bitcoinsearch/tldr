    <summary>In this email conversation, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd discuss the limitations of Bitcoin's capacity and its ability to handle everyday transactions, particularly in mobile wallets. While Hearn believes that Bitcoin should be able to scale to handle ordinary transactions, Todd argues that the system's entire capacity is limited, making it difficult to predict demand and fees. The inefficiency in child-pays-for-parent transactions is also discussed, with Todd stating that the existing code uses good algorithms but requires a second transaction, leading to bloating of the blockchain and higher fees.</summary>
