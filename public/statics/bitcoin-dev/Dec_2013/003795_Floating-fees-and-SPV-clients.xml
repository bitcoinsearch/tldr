    <summary>The Bitcoin developer community discusses the implementation of a new feature called "allowfee", which would allow merchants to give an allowance against the purchase price for network fees. The sender's software would still be responsible for getting the fees right, and sometimes the sender would need to pay more fees than allowed, while other times they would need to pay less. This feature aims to be useful occasionally and cause no harm the rest of the time. It is also suggested that clever senders could use this to defragment their wallets.Gavin Andresen proposes a "merchant-pays-fee" extension in response to Mike Hearn's comment that PPv1 does not have any notion of fee. The proposed specification would allow up to "allowfee" satoshis to be deducted from the amount paid to be used to pay Bitcoin network transaction fees. Wallet software must not reduce the amount paid for fees more than allowfee, and transaction fees must be equal to or greater than the amount reduced. The rationale behind this proposal is to prevent wallet software from giving users discounts and to allow users to pay more in fees if they need to, such as in the case of a fragmented wallet or a big CoinJoin transaction. In addition to the discussion on allowfee, Gavin Andresen also suggests shortening the BIP72 request parameter from "request=..." to just "r=..." to save 6 characters in QR codes. The Bitcoin developer community appears to reach consensus on both proposals.</summary>
