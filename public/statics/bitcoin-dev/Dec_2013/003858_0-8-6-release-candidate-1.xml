    <summary>In an email thread dated December 9th, 2013, Drak suggests that no files should be uploaded online unless they are the official release to avoid any potential issues. However, Wladimir responds by stating that once files are uploaded, they become the official release and waiting for extra gitian builds may help with confidence in announcing the release on forums, but it's not necessary since the downloads themselves don't change anymore. He also adds that it doesn't matter in which order different places are updated as long as the news is propagated within a reasonable time-span of a day, otherwise requiring a certain order would require unnecessary coordination. Wladimir concludes by saying that there are enough actual issues, so there's no need to create more problems where they don't exist.</summary>
