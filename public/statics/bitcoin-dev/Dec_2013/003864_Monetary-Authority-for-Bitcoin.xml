    <summary>In an email exchange on December 10, 2013, Ryan Carboni proposed a solution for tracking exchanges in Bitcoin. He suggested that the exchanges could be hard-coded into the system or left up to the miner's choice. Gavin Andresen responded with a comparison to wanting a fast way to travel around the world without focusing on the difficult problem that needs to be solved for it to work. In other words, Carboni was ignoring the challenging aspect of his proposal that needed attention.</summary>
