    <summary>A startup is looking for one or two experienced C++ programmers who are familiar with Bitcoin internals to work on a unique merge-mined altcoin project. The specific details of the project will be shared after signing a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement. The coin will provide a useful service to the entire crypto-coin ecosystem. Any previous experience in adding features to Bitcoin or related technologies is considered a bonus and should be included in the application. The interested candidates can email eduffield82@gmail.com with their work experience description, and the company will share their plans if they find the applications suitable. The startup is Hawk Financial Group, LLC, and the founders are Evan and Kyle.</summary>
