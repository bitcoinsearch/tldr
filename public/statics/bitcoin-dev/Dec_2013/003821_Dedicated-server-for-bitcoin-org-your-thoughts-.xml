    <summary>In an email exchange on December 8, 2013, Sa√Øvann Carignan asked Wladimir about his thoughts on moving bitcoin.org to a dedicated server with an SSL certificate. Wladimir responded positively, stating that not using https is a red flag for sites that are not taking security seriously. This suggests that moving the website to a dedicated server with an SSL certificate would be a good idea to ensure the security of the site and maintain its credibility.</summary>
