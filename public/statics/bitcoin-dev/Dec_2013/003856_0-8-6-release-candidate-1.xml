    <summary>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Drak on December 9, 2013, Drak claimed that the Bitcoin version 0.8.6 was already released and available for download at sourceforge.net. However, Maxwell responded by saying that it had not been officially released yet and was only queued for announcement. He further explained that they were waiting for another independent gitian build before sending out the announcement. Drak expressed concern about the release workflow, stating that there needed to be a better process in place as people were already downloading the 0.8.6 files and creating buzz around it within the community. He suggested that no files should be placed online unless they were the official release.</summary>
