    <summary>The discussion is around the idea of users being able to pay merchants with huge transactions and whether they should cover the cost or not. Gavin Andresen suggests that if a user decides to pay with a huge transaction, they should cover the cost instead of expecting merchants to eat the cost. Additionally, he suggests that there doesn't need to be One True Answer when it comes to hiding or showing fees. Instead, wallets can experiment with either option and the best user experience will ultimately win.</summary>
