    <summary>The high "fixed" fee of 0.1 mBTC on Bitcoin has been a source of complaint from users, who have compared it unfavorably to bank fees. While acknowledging the need for a new fee market, the author suggests lowering the minimum relay fee per kilobyte to alleviate concerns in the interim. The proposed amount is 0.01 mBTC, but no concrete reasoning is given for this number. This proposal comes in response to recent negative reviews of Mycelium on the Google Play Store, which mention the high fees.On December 6, 2013, Andreas Petersson suggested lowering the minimum relay fee per kb to something less than the current fixed fee of 0.1 mBTC until a new fee market is established. However, this proposal was deemed too risky for version 0.8.6 of Bitcoin and will be implemented in version 0.9, unless the full floating fee implementation is ready and considered safe by then. Users have criticized the current high fixed fee, and some Play Store reviews of Mycelium have cited it as a negative aspect. It has also been noted that banks sometimes have lower fees than Bitcoin's current fee structure.</summary>
