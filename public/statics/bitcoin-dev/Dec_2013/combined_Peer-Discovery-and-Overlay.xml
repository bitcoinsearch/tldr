    <summary>In December 2013, concerns were raised by Peter Todd about the reliance on DNS seeds for Bitcoin node addresses. In response to this issue, Warren sponsored BlueMatt to implement an address database for bitcoinj. There were worries that bitcoinj clients heavily depended on DNS seeds and were susceptible to compromise. An email thread from December 2013 saw Jeremy Spilman asking about past instances of applications hijacking or abusing the 'getaddr' functionality in Bitcoin's peer-to-peer messaging system. He also asked if there were any guidelines on this matter. It was suggested that a BIP by Stefan Thomas for adding custom services to the protocol could be helpful for network discovery, but noted that it should not be used in a hostile manner. The email includes links to two relevant BIPs, one on custom services and sub-commands, and another on network discovery guidelines.Efforts are being made to map and analyze the Bitcoin P2P network. However, it is unclear how clients are expected to select 'far-apart' peers, or if this process even attempts to achieve that. The speed of discovering the entire network of peers may have both pros and cons. It is also worth considering how existing Bitcoin node relations and the ease at which peers can be discovered may become a vulnerability or even a service in itself. The conversation then moves onto the topic of existing bitcoin node relations and the ease at which peers can be discovered becoming a service in itself or possibly a vulnerability. Another vulnerability is that getaddr data is best effort and there is currently no mechanism to ensure that nodes are operated by separate individuals. Finally, the discussion touches upon node addresses being a service wherein the DNS seeds are used to provide this service. Bitcoinj clients heavily depend on these seeds and can be easily compromised in various ways by them. Warren Togami Jr. expresses concern about the issue of node addresses being a service and sponsored BlueMatt to implement an address database for bitcoinj as a solution. This will make it less reliant on what DNS tells it. Peter Todd explains that DNS seeds are currently used for this purpose, but they can easily compromise clients in various ways. The implementation of the address database is not only about decentralization, but also scalability, as it is a prerequisite for chain pruning. The developers are looking forward to reviewing and merging the changes.</summary>
