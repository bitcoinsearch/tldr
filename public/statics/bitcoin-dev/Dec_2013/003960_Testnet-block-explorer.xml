    <summary>Eric Lombrozo built a shell around the bitcoind JSON-RPC, with a websockets server that provides real-time transaction and block feeds. The shell can be used with bitcoin mainnet and testnet as well as any of the alt chains. The layout is similar to blockchain.info with bootstrap look-and-feel. Eric apologized to Ben for lifting the css, stating he was not a graphic designer and offered to collaborate with anyone who could help make the styling original. One of the goals of this project was simplicity in deployment to a new server. The JSON-RPC is missing address indexing and an "unspent" API, so these things are still missing from this shell. Melvin Carvalho had mentioned there were other testnet explorers such as http://testnet.btclook.com/ and http://test.webbtc.com/, but mentioned they are not fully functional with creating transactions because there is no "unspent" API for getting the unspent values for an address. Mike Hearn also mentioned a new block explorer for testnet at https://www.biteasy.com/testnet/blocks. He noted that the coinbase tx doesn't necessarily come first in the listing (it's sorted by "time received"). The site is built using bitcoinj and the author can be contacted on IRC sometimes using the nick damethos.</summary>
