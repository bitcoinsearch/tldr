    <summary>Ryan Carboni argued that the increase in Bitcoin's value in relation to other currencies is the reason why people invest in it, not because of its fixed money supply. He also noted that most people who use Bitcoin as a currency in exchange for goods use exchanges. However, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, mocked Ryan's proposal and said it was met with widespread laughter. Jeff Garzik works at BitPay, Inc., a platform that enables businesses to accept payments in Bitcoin.</summary>
