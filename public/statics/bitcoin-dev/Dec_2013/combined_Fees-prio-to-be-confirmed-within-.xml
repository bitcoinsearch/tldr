    <summary>The post discusses the use of a modified version of Gavin's fee estimation framework for bitcoind. The author provides estimates for confirming transactions within different numbers of blocks based on a certain number of samples taken. The data presented includes median and 10th percentile fees paid per kilobyte and median priority for free transactions.It is mentioned that there is missing data in some cases where no samples were taken. The maximum number of samples taken was 1000. The estimates range from transactions that require confirmation within 0 blocks to those that require confirmation within 55 blocks.Overall, the post provides valuable insights into estimating transaction fees for different block confirmations using this modified version of Gavin's framework. However, it is important to note that the missing data may impact the accuracy of the estimates in some cases.</summary>
