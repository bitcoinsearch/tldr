    <summary>On December 5, 2013, Wladimir expressed concern that using github could hinder the editing process of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Luke-Jr questioned why using github would be a hurdle, as it allows for easy collaboration through pull requests and web interfaces. He also noted that creating a github account is easier than paying for and waiting to activate a wiki account. Wladimir clarified that his concern was mainly for already accepted BIPs, which should not be edited without discussion, whereas drafts could still be submitted to the wiki if desired.</summary>
