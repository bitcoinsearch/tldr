    <summary>Harry and David suggested adding support for *secp256k1* in the browser Named Curve dictionary to the crypto group. This curve has seen increased deployment over the last year, particularly in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The API currently exposes what exists in NSS, but adding support for this curve could help many people who already work with cryptocurrencies in the browser. The NamedCurve enum in the WebCryptoAPI's EcKeyGenParams dictionary currently includes NIST recommended curves P-256, P-384, and P-521. For more information on the Koblitz curve used by bitcoin, see the provided link to a bitcointalk.org forum post.</summary>
