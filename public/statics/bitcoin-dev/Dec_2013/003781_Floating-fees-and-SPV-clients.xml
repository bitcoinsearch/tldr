    <summary>When a user makes a payment with bitcoin-qt, the transaction is broadcast on the network and merchants are notified. Refusing payment and refunding it is not possible for merchants. Allowing cancellations would make implementation harder and create issues if CoinJoin or CoinJoin-like transactions were used as payment. Bitcoin-Qt currently allows multiple PaymentRequests to be paid with one transaction, but handling cases where one merchant gives a PaymentACK and another gives a PaymentNACK is difficult.</summary>
