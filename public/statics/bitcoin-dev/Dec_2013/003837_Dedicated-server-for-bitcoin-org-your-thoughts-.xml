    <summary>The bitcoin.org domain is registered under an anonymous identity using WhoisGuard. As a result, it is unclear who controls the domain and if the domain is in safe hands. Despite nothing bad happening so far, it would make more sense to move the domain to core developers as originally intended. However, it is unknown whether this is possible or not. The lack of transparency regarding the ownership of the domain raises questions about trust and accountability.</summary>
