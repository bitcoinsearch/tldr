    <summary>In an email exchange on December 9, 2013, Ryan Carboni argued that increasing the Bitcoin money supply would not violate the trust of those holding the currency, as many people had bought Bitcoin with the hope that its value in relation to other currencies would increase. Carboni also noted that the majority of people using Bitcoin as a currency for real goods are using exchanges. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, responded by stating that Carboni's proposal had been met with widespread laughter and that if he were not ill with the flu, mockery would ensue as well.</summary>
