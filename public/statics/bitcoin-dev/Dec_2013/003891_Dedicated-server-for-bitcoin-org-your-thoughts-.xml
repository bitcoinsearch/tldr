    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell argues against Drak's assertion that SSL provides no protection against BGP redirection. He notes that SSL does provide protection against an attacker who intercepts traffic to the server, but acknowledges that PGP signatures are also necessary for complete protection. However, he points out that people often fail to check these signatures. In response, Adam adds that SSL can protect users from ARP or DNS poisoning. He also raises concerns about the weakness of the PGP web of trust surrounding Bitcoin and OS-related ISOs, noting that it can be difficult to verify keys and fingerprints. The conversation ends with a sponsored message from Intel XDK.</summary>
