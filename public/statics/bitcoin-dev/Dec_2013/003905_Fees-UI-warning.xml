    <summary>Hive Wallet is focused on providing users with a great user experience by constantly thinking about how to make their platform more user-friendly. They prioritize removing extraneous UI and functionality that can be automated. For example, they still don't have a Preferences dialog because smart defaults should be an important aspect of design decisions. Hive Wallet aims to detect the use of an address and automatically rotate it away from the user for privacy's sake. The new Bitstamp app for Hive also makes intelligent event-driven decisions and pre-populates the "send bitcoins" dialog with the deposit address and requested amount when the user clicks the deposit button.Hive Wallet urges software developers to consider UX when developing applications, automate what can be automated, and make best guesses when necessary. In the case of fees, developers should consider what their application tries to accomplish and how it can do so without getting in the way too much. Lastly, Hive Wallet is considering an approach once floating fees are feasible, which Mike Hearn asked about in a previous thread.</summary>
