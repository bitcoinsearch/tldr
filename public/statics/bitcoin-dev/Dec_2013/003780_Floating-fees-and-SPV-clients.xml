    <summary>On December 3, 2013, Gavin Andresen wrote in an email that users should cover the costs of transactions if they want to pay with a large amount, rather than expecting merchants to accept payments filled with dust and bear the cost. However, a merchant can refuse payment and refund it if necessary, but it would be up to the wallet developers to ensure that their app does not do anything obnoxious or unacceptable that would result in people hating to receive money from it. In response to a question about hiding or showing fees, Andresen suggested that wallets should be allowed to experiment with both options and let the best user experience win. It is expected that there will be experimentation in this regard.</summary>
