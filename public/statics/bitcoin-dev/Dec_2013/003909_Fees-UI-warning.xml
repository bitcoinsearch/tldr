    <summary>In an email conversation on December 16, 2013, Mike Hearn expresses his concern about the potential danger of badly designed software that appears to be appealing. He admits that he does not know how to solve this problem. One suggestion that he offers is to explicitly warn against certain services. For instance, he suggests adding a warning to the "Choose your wallet" page of bitcoin.org.</summary>
