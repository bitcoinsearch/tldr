    <summary>In 2013, an email conversation between Ryan Carboni and Mark Friedenbach took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The initial proposal put forward by Ryan was to implement a sanity check in Bitcoin, where the difficulty of mining would be adjusted downwards if only four blocks had been mined after three days. He projected a Bitcoin mining bubble, which could make his proposal important in the near future.However, Mark raised concerns that such adjustments could introduce security risks. If a low-hashpower attacker isolated a user from the main chain for three days without them noticing that network block generation had stalled, they could completely control the block rate. To address this, Mark suggested alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms being explored by some alts, such as the 9-block interval, 144-block window, Parks-McClellan FIR filter used by Freicoin to recover from just such a mining bubble.Ryan responded by saying that he believes Mark misunderstood his statement. In theory, one would have to isolate roughly one percent of the Bitcoin network's hashing power to do so, which would indicate an attack by a state actor as opposed to anything else. Arguably, the safest way to run Bitcoin is through a proprietary dial-up network.Allen Piscitello also weighed in on the conversation, questioning why Ryan continues to try to correct people who clearly have put more thought into this than him. He also accused Carboni of having trouble comprehending why his ideas are terrible. In response to Mark's suggestion, Robin R Chauhan asked for resources to help understand blockchain security and proof-of-work schemes and to reason clearly about such proposals before bringing them to the list or a senior dev. He notes that there is often a wide gulf between those few people who can reason about it and those who have trouble with it, and ideally wants resources to illustrate past proposals, explain why they would and wouldn't work, and build up some fundamental concepts, like a "Newtons laws of blockchain security" that would help us evaluate such ideas on our own.Gavin, another developer, advised Ryan to test his idea on bitcointalk.org or provide more technical substance before engaging with the forum. Developers tend to prefer dealing with numbers known to be either 1 or 0, not a variable set of possible values depending on non-technical factors.The email thread highlights the importance of ensuring the security of Bitcoin and having safeguards in place to protect against potential threats. The main concern raised by Ryan Carboni is the security risks associated with adjustments made to Bitcoin. It also emphasizes the need for resources to help understand blockchain security and proof-of-work schemes, as well as the importance of providing technical substance when proposing changes.</summary>
