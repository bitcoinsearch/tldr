    <summary>In a discussion about the ownership and administration of bitcoin.org, Gavin Andresen suggests that it is important for the server to be owned by someone who can be trusted with ssh access for all core developers. However, another participant points out that not having a clear answer on who administers it could lead to confusion and negligence in terms of security. Andresen declines taking responsibility for keeping the site safe and secure, stating that it is better suited for the Bitcoin Foundation or another organization to manage. The discussion leads to an agreement that someone must be assigned to the task in order to maintain security, but it is also suggested that the Foundation funding and securing the server infrastructure would be a better long-term strategy. Additionally, it is agreed that the domain and website content should remain independently owned and managed. If no consensus is reached, the participants agree to move on and focus on bigger priorities.</summary>
