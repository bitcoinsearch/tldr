    <summary>On December 9th, 2013, a discussion was held regarding the release of a new project on Bitcointalk and Reddit. However, according to an email from someone named Drak, the project had not actually been released yet. Instead, it was still waiting for an independent gitian build before an announcement could be made. This information contradicts the previous claim that the project had already been released and was circulating online. It is unclear what the project was or if it ever did end up being announced or released.</summary>
