    <summary>A new peer-to-peer microblogging platform, called Twister, has been created using Bitcoin and Libtorrent. The creator of the project has expressed gratitude to the developers of both codes for their work, but also apologies for merging them together. The main site for Twister can be found at http://twister.net.co, and a white-paper detailing the project can be accessed at http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152. Bitcoin and Libtorrent developers have been offered write-access to the repository for those who want it.</summary>
