    <summary>In an email exchange on December 3, 2013, Mike Hearn and Taylor Gerring discussed the concept of fees for Bitcoin transactions. Hearn argued that many people are accustomed to paying the sticker price for items and may not be receptive to paying additional fees for using credit cards or other forms of payment. He suggested creating new terminology to distinguish between interior fees, which are included in the price and paid by the receiver, and exterior fees, which are excluded from the price and paid by the sender. Gerring countered that fee structures are culturally dependent and suggested focusing on calculating reasonable fees for reliable service rather than changing the fee structure. They also discussed the need for intuitive user interfaces to inform users about fees and allow them to make informed decisions.</summary>
