    <summary>Mike Hearn, on December 13, 2013, wrote about a use case he hopes will become common in the next year. He proposed the idea of pastebin style hosting sites for payment requests, where regular end-users can upload a payment request to payr.com, with an iteration count on each download and can be possibly signed. Mark replied that having fields completely unsigned by anyone leaves him a little nervous. Alternatively, the user-signed payment request without iteration count is enclosed within a payr.com-signed envelope that contains the iteration count.</summary>
