    <summary>Drak has requested an update to the bitcoin.org website, which still points downloads to version 0.8.5. It is unclear whether version 0.8.6 has been released yet or not. There has been no announcement regarding its release and it may be possible that release candidates are not promoted on the website. Sponsored by Intel(R) XDK, this development mailing list provides a platform for discussions related to Bitcoin's development.</summary>
