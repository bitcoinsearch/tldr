    <summary>For a long time, the original blockexplorer.com has been the only available block explorer for testnet. However, it is often broken, behind, and slow while not being maintained anymore. Fortunately, there is now a new block explorer at biteasy.com/testnet/blocks, which also offers a REST/JSON API. It is important to note that the coinbase transaction may not come first in the listing as it is sorted by "time received". Additionally, the site is built using bitcoinj, and the author can be contacted on IRC with the nickname damethos.</summary>
