    <summary>The email exchange dated December 20, 2013 on the Bitcoin-Development mailing list is about authenticated prefix trees and its variations. The BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) describe the application of authenticated prefix trees to committed indices, document time-stamping, and merged mining. For document time-stamping, the key can be the hash of the document and for merged mining, the key is the hash of the genesis block of the altchain, and the value is the hash of the aux-pow. The advantage over the direction-based system is discussed, and Mark Friedenbach mentions that it adds 43 bytes to the coinbase transaction. Peter Todd suggests leaving Unicode out of the code examples as many editors and shells still don't copy-and-paste it nicely. Mark agrees with Peter's feedback and mentions that he will rework it. The example provided by Mark is in Python, so Peter suggests using escape sequences and explicitly binary strings for py3 compatibility.</summary>
