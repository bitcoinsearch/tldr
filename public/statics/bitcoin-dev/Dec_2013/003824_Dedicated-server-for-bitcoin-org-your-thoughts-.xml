    <summary>In a 2013 email exchange, Drak expressed concern over the reality of BGP redirection and its potential for exploitation. However, another individual argued against SSL as a solution to this issue, stating that it only provides protection against active interception of traffic to the server and therefore creates a false sense of security. They suggested that PGP signatures could offer more effective protection, but acknowledged that their implementation is not widespread due to low usage rates. Despite this, they did not argue against the use of PGP signatures, but urged caution in claiming that SSL can fully protect against threats it does not address.</summary>
