    <summary>Mark Friedenbach proposed a BIP that explains the authenticated prefix tree and its variations in serialized representation. Several other BIPs describe its application in committed indices, document time-stamping, and merged mining. The authenticated prefix tree can be used for time-stamping by encoding the document's hash value into the tree. This allows anyone to verify whether the document existed at a specific time. In merged mining, a miner can simultaneously mine multiple blockchains with minimal extra computational cost. An example of using an authenticated prefix tree is provided, where unicode is used in the code examples which may not be compatible with some editors and shells.</summary>
