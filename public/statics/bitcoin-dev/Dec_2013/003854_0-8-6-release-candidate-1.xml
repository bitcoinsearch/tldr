    <summary>On December 9th, 2013, a user named Drak pointed out that the bitcoin.org website was still pointing to version 0.8.5 for downloads and suggested that it should be updated. Roy Badami responded by suggesting that perhaps version 0.8.6 had not yet been released or announced, and that it would make sense not to promote release candidates on bitcoin.org. However, it was then mentioned that version 0.8.6 had indeed been released and was being discussed on bitcointalk and reddit.</summary>
