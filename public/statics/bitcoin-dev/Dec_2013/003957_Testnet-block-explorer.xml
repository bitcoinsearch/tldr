    <summary>A new block explorer has been introduced for testnet, which is built using bitcoinj and provides a REST/JSON API. The author of the site can be contacted on IRC sometimes using the nick damethos. The coinbase tx does not necessarily come first in the listing as it's sorted by "time received". The previous block explorer for testnet was often broken, slow and not really maintained anymore. There is another block explorer available at http://testnet.btclook.com/, which provides a different view as well.</summary>
