    <summary>In an email conversation between Wladimir and Drak on December 9, 2013, the issue of premature online file sharing was discussed. Drak suggested that no files should be placed online unless they are officially released to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings. However, Wladimir argued that once the files are uploaded, they become official releases despite any additional builds or announcements. The conversation also noted that public availability of files cannot be stopped, leading to discussions and posts like the sticky post at bitcointalk.org.</summary>
