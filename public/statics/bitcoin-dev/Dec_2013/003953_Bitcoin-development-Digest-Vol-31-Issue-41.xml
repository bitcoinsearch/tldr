    <summary>The author of the email claims that their idea is valid and that the person they are corresponding with has ignored their point. They argue that the only way for a man in the middle attack to occur with such a large percentage of hash power would be to either attack a pool or a large number of nodes, which would be noticeable. Additionally, the attacker would need to have at least 1% of the hash power and be diverting it to attack one single person. They claim that very few people even have a hundredth of a percent of the total hash power, demonstrating the network's security. The author concedes that reducing difficulty by 80% if only four blocks were mined in three days would provide sufficient margin against these proposed man in the middle attacks. However, they feel that their points are not being understood and they have nothing more to add. The email ends with a comment about the holidays.</summary>
