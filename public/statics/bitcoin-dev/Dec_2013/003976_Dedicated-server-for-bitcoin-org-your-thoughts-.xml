    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell responded to Drak's concern about the NSA changing every download of bitcoin-qt, stating that downloads are already protected by something stronger than SSL - actual signatures of the downloads with offline keys. He also criticized SSL for producing an entirely false sense of security which is entirely unjustified. In another discussion on BitDNS, Satoshi suggested that IP records don't need to be in the chain, just do registrar function not DNS, solving the CA problem. Meanwhile, ICANN is selling out the global public namespace, and a guy on the Cayman Islands is now the largest holder of TLD's.</summary>
