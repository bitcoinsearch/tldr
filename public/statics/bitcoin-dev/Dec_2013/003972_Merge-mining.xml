    <summary>The author is questioning whether not supporting merge-mining with GPUs is any better in terms of security. They suggest that with so much "dry powder" out there, or GPUs that can be used for mining, a 51% attack on an alt-coin may not cost the attacker much beyond a short-term diversion from profitable mining. However, by supporting merged mining, more miners are likely to support multiple coin types, making it less straightforward for an individual or group to execute a 51% attack. The author concludes that the rational decision for a non-scam altcoin is to take advantage of merged mining to maximize security.</summary>
