    <summary>The discussion revolves around the security implications of signing data explicitly in a 1-of-1 multisig system. If some vulnerability is found, someone who signed a single sig xpub whitelist will not be exposed. The conversation also touches upon the use of a value of 1 for 'm' in the scheme and the suggestion to require m=1 for single-sig case and use 0 as an indicator that there are serial numbers following it. It is noted that this information is available in per-output redeem/witness script, and the signer can distinguish between multisig/single-sig by looking at this script. They only need to know the total number of keys participating in the signing and check that this number matches the particulars of redeem/witness script.</summary>
