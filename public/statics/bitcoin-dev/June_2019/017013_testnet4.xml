    <summary>Emil Engler, a Bitcoin developer, recently shared his experience of using the Bitcoin testnet. According to him, it took around one hour for him to sync the blockchain with approximately 1.5 million blocks. He opined that this was too much time especially considering the fact that the blockchain size was around 26GB. As a solution, Emil suggested resetting the testnet with a new genesis block. This would facilitate quicker synchronization with the blockchain and reduce the size of the blockchain. Additionally, he proposed setting up a fixed cycle for resetting the testnet, like every first of January. Overall, Emil's suggestion could prove beneficial for Bitcoin developers who use the testnet for their development work. It would help in saving time and resources while carrying out various tests and experiments on the network.</summary>
