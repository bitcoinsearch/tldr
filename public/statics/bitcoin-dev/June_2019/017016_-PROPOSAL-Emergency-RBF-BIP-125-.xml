    <summary>Matt Corallo has raised concerns over the implementation of a Bitcoin proposal related to child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) for replacing-by-fee (RBF). He pointed out that it needs improvement in motivation and description. Corallo requested calculations for various aspects such as evicted transactions not allowed to be in the next block range, worst-case free relay, and benchmarks for DoS attack. He also raised issues over vague protections for time-critical transactions, which makes it harder to reason about. Rusty Russell, the author of the proposal, clarified that if miners have a conflicting tx in the top 4MSipa, there would be no problem.</summary>
