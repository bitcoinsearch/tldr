    <title>[PROPOSAL] Emergency RBF (BIP 125)</title>

    <summary>In a proposal to modify rules 3, 4 and 5 of BIP 125, Rusty Russell suggests adding an emergency RBF rule. The new rule states that if the original transaction was not in the first 4,000,000 weight units of the fee-ordered mempool and the replacement transaction is, then rules 3, 4 and 5 do not apply. This would allow RBF to be used in adversarial conditions such as lightning unilateral closes where the adversary has another valid transaction and can use it to block yours. The proposal does not open any significant new ability for RBF spam, as it can usually only be used once, and it makes RBF miner-incentive compatible. However, Rusty hasn't found time to code this up in bitcoin yet.</summary>
