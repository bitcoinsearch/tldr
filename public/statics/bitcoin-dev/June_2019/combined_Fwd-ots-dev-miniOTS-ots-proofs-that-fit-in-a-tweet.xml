    <summary>William Casarin, part of the OTS development team, has designed a compressed version of the standard OTS format called miniOTS. The new format allows attestations to fit into a tweet and was created with the goal of having small enough proofs so that the stamp of the previous message can be replied to a tweet instead of relying on external sites such as @otsproofbot. The current format is 210 bytes and 288 bytes base58-encoded. However, stripping out additional attestations in the standard format only gets it down to just above 280 bytes when base58 encoded, which is still too much for a tweet. As a solution, the creator rolled out a custom format that is a bit more efficient with attestation and op tags. Currently, there is no OTS decoder yet available for this format. More information about miniOTS can be obtained by visiting the provided links.</summary>
