    <summary>In this context, there is a discussion about the P2P rules and the Unserialize code. The specific lines of code being discussed are located in compat/assumptions.h, serialize.h and other Unserialize_impl implementations. The conversation highlights that the encoding being discussed is unsupported/invalid rather than equivalent/non-canonical. It is noted that MAX_SIZE equals 0x02000000 which is approximately 33.5M and that ReadCompactSize throws "size too large" if the return value is greater than this value. The individual who made the initial comment thanks the person who provided the correction and admits to missing the MAX_SIZE value during their review of the code.</summary>
