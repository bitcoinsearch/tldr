    <summary>Emil Engler inquired about the possibility of resetting the Bitcoin testnet with a new genesis block, citing the long time it took to sync the blockchain and its large size. Bryan, responding on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, expressed doubt that this would happen but suggested using Signet, which provides an alternative for configuring multiple separate private and public testing networks. He referred to recent discussions on the topic and provided a link to the transcript.</summary>
