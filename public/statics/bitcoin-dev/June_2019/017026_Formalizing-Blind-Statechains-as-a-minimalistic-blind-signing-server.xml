    <summary>The email conversation between Ruben and ZmnSCPxj discusses the problems with channel factories and how they can be fixed using `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` for all unilateral paths. They also discuss the potential privacy concerns if `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` requires a chaperone signature. Adding scripting is not preferred as it would defeat the purpose of the system being blinded, but a separate smart contracting layer like Smart Contracts Unchained (SCU) could be added. The main observation is that anything that can be done with a UTXO on-chain can also be done off-chain via any updateable offchain cryptocurrency system, including Statechains, Spillman, Decker-Wattenhofer, Poon-Dryja, or Decker-Russell-Osuntokun. Furthermore, any updateable offchain system worth its salt would have a way of unilaterally dropping transactions onchain and creating new UTXOs that can be spent by further transactions.</summary>
