    <summary>On May 31, 2019, Jeremy via bitcoin-dev announced that OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY is being retracted in favor of OP_SECURETHEBAG*. A suggestion was made to generalize the naming of the opcode to fit with existing opcode naming by calling it "OP_CHECKTXDIGESTVERIFY". The new opcode would pull a 33-byte value from the stack consisting of a sha256 hash and a sighash-byte. A new sighash value would also be added corresponding to the set of information to include in the hash such as "SIGHASH_EXACTLY_ONE_INPUT | SIGHASH_ALL". However, there seems to be no reason to complicate the specification in order to ensure the digest is precommitted as part of the opcode.</summary>
