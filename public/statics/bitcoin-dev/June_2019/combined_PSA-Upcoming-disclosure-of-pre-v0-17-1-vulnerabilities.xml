    <summary>Two vulnerabilities have been identified in Bitcoin Core software. The first vulnerability, CVE-2017-18350, affects all versions released until the fix was included in v0.15.1 and no versions prior to v0.15.1 are expected to be fixed. The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-20586, affects all versions released until the fix was included in v0.17.1 and the fix has not been backported to older versions as of now. It is important to note that the fixes for these vulnerabilities have not been made to the git branches at this time.While a dedicated release is not expected for the second vulnerability due to its minor severity, it may be included in future releases of v0.15.3 and v0.16.4. As these vulnerabilities pose a potential risk to users, it is recommended that they upgrade to a fixed version no later than August 1st.</summary>
