    <summary>The proposed OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY has been retracted in favor of a new proposal, OP_SECURETHEBAG. The new proposal fixes malleability issues and lifts the single output restriction to a known number of inputs restriction. The previous proposal had some issues with malleability of version and locktime. OP_SECURETHEBAG commits to both of these values and also lifts the restriction that OP_CHECKOUTPUTSVERIFY had to be spent as only a single input, and instead just commits to the number of inputs. This allows for more flexibility but keeps it easy to get the same single output restriction. A useful topic of discussion is how best to eliminate the PUSHDATA and treat OP_SECURETHEBAG like a pushdata directly. The implementation details and BIP can be found at https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bips/blob/op-secure-the-bag/bip-secure-the-bag.mediawiki and https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/secure_the_bag respectively.</summary>
