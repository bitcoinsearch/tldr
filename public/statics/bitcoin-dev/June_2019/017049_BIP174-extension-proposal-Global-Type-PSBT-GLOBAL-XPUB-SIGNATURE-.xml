    <summary>Jonathan Underwood, the Chief Bitcoin Officer at Bitbank proposed an idea for extending PSBT to solve the problem of verifying that an address is not a hacker's address that was swapped between unsigned transaction creation and first signature. He suggested a rough draft of the proposed key value specification which can verify an xpub that is not accessible via derivation from cold keys. Dmitry Petukhov responded to the proposal with concerns about handling multisig and partial compromise of keys in a multisig warm wallet. He suggested signing the whole 'xpub package' of the multisig wallet or using an auxiliary message that would be signed along with the 'xpub package'. He also suggested dealing with the issue outside of PSBT as 'PSBT metainformation', or using some form of 'vendor-specific', or 'metainformation-specific' PSBT field.</summary>
