    <summary>Jonathan Underwood raised a question regarding the use of the 'unused' value of 1 for 'm' in the scheme and suggested requiring m=1 for single-sig case. He proposed using 0 as an indicator when there is a serial number following it. However, the response to this suggestion was that 0x00 is single sig or OP_CHECKSIG, while 0x01 is multisig or 1-of-3, 1-of-2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG. The information about whether a redeem/witness script is multisig or single-sig is available in per-output redeem/witness script. Signers can differentiate between multisig/single-sig by looking at the script. They only need to know the total number of keys involved in signing and ensure that this number matches the specifics of the redeem/witness script.</summary>
