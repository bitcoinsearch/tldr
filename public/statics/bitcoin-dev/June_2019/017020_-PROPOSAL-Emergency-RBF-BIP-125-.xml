    <summary>Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo has expressed concerns over a proposal to replace Bitcoin’s current relay fee system with an alternative. The relaying mechanism is used to broadcast transactions across the Bitcoin network. Corallo was specifically concerned that the proposed rule could lead to a worst-case scenario of “very, very bad” results. However, Rusty Russell, another bitcoin developer, replied that in reality, the new rule would actually reduce costs for attackers by 90% compared to the existing transaction pinning issue. Russell also noted that it would save 95% of bandwidth per node.</summary>
