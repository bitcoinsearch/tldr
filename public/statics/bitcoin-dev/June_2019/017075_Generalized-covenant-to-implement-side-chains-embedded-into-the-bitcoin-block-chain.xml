    <summary>In an email to ZmnSCPxj, Tamas Blummer admitted making an error in proposing the new covenant and suggested the original example should remain unchanged. Blummer stated that the exit could be automatic allowing to exit a stalling unchained platform. He also noted that there remains the question of why the rightful owner is not enforcing the covenant instead of having it enforced by on-chain consensus. Blummer admitted that he does not have a good answer for that yet. In response to ZmnSCPxj's suggestion of unchained execution of transfers with cut-through exit transaction, Blummer acknowledged how it made the example much stronger. The covenant needed for this is: 'covenant or(_ covenant transitive, and(pkExit, _) covenant drop)'.</summary>
