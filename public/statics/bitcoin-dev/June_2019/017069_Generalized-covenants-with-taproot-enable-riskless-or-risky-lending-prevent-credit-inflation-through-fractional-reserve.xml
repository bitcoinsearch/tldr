    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email, Tamas Blummer discusses the proof of control of coins until maturity. Alice is limited to issuing promissory notes within her own capital or borrowed capital, eliminating coin inflation and fractional reserve and reducing credit risk for Charlie. Dave suggests that these goals are achievable without consensus changes, as Bob can use CLTV or CSV in a script tied to an output to track debt using colored coins. These colored coins have no value themselves but can be traded trustlessly between parties. RGB working group aims to make trustless colored coin protocols more efficient on top of Bitcoin. Peter Todd's concept of single-use seals may also be an option to consider. Links to both the RGB working group and Peter Todd's concept are provided for further investigation.</summary>
