    <summary>In an email conversation on October 23, 2013 at 9:42:14 PM, Allen Piscitello discussed a "huge chicken and egg problem" in relation to cryptocurrency. There is reluctance to move off the reference client since it could lead to working on a forked chain as a miner or having bad data as a client. However, miners are incentivized to run one of every widespread node to ensure their blocks are accepted by the network. Eloipool already supports cross-referencing block templates between multiple clients and using the one that is accepted by most/all. It also logs any discrepancies with coredump-like details. Luke was part of this conversation.</summary>
