    <summary>In an email thread on October 23, 2013, Peter Todd clarified that the reference implementation serves as the true specification for Bitcoin, while the "specification" on the wiki is more like a summary or study guide. He warns that those who don't understand this nuance may mistakenly assume that the protocol is unchanging and fixed in stone, which is not entirely accurate although it's close to the truth. Martin questions whether this means that the notes are intentionally confusing to force people to consult the source code.</summary>
