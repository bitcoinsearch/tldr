    <summary>In a communication dated October 27, 2013, Mike Hearn explains that there is a steady stream of bug reports received by bitcoinj library of the form "my transaction did not propagate". This happens because the library picks one peer to send the transaction to and waits for it to spread across the network. However, if that chosen peer refuses the tx for any reason, then it won't be propagated, and there's no timeout to retry with another node. Luke points out that the actual bug is that BitcoinJ depends on good behavior from other nodes, and it should not assume that any random node isn't hostile. The system should be able to handle a peer that doesn't relay a transaction for any reason, including if they lie about having done so.</summary>
