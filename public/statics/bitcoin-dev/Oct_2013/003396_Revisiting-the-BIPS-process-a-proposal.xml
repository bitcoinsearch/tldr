    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2013, Luke-Jr suggested that a better solution for the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process would be to use a GitLab clone that sits on top of the Git repo, allowing for custom code around the BIP process. This platform could enable assurance contracts to kickstart BIP developments or Bitcoin extensions (public infrastructure which is not part of the core, such as open-sourced exchanges). Additionally, people who donate Bitcoins to a proposal can receive some percentage of the bounty when somebody actually implements the BIP, while some percent goes to the Bitcoin foundation. When asked if the protocol specification page should also be codified into BIP(s), Luke-Jr replied that it probably wouldn't hurt but it would likely need a rewrite in a more modular and formal form. He suggested keeping the current wiki pages up there, maybe with a link to the git repo on the main BIP index wiki page. Finally, when asked if BIP 50, a hardforking protocol change, should be considered a BIP, Luke-Jr responded affirmatively.</summary>
