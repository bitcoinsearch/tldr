    <summary>The email conversation revolves around Bitcoin Improvement Proposals(BIP) and the process of submitting them. Jean-Paul Kogelman expresses concern about the lack of information in some proposals and suggests that enforcement should be more uniform. He highlights BIP 38, which is gaining more acceptance among the community but still missing from the BIP list. The authors of BIP 38 prioritize community acceptance over BIP numbers. The suggestion is made for BIPs to be done as a Github repository to make it easier to archive, update, and keep a log of what and why they were updated. Writing working code is suggested to improve the chances of acceptance for a proposal. It is mentioned that Peter Todd has support from most of the dev team for his draft NODE_BLOOM BIP but hasn't pushed hard for an official BIP number. Jean-Paul Kogelman shares that he is developing his own client with the code up and running and unit tests but is not ready to release it yet. He asks whether putting contact information there so people can ask for the relevant code be sufficient until he has his client up on Github. It is suggested that he put the client up on Github instead and make it hard to use for people who shouldn't be using it. The email ends with Peter Todd sharing an example of Pond not making binaries available.</summary>
