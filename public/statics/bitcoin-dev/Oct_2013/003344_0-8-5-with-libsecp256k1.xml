    <summary>Warren Togami Jr. shared a link to sipa's secp256k1, an optimized ecdsa which is significantly faster than OpenSSL, on Bitcoin-dev mailing list. He mentioned that Litecoin has been using secp256k1 for several months now and someone asked for Bitcoin 0.8.5 with the same. Warren quickly created a branch of Bitcoin 0.8.5 with secp256k1 which should theoretically work for Linux, win32 gitian and mac builds. However, he warned that the untested win32 gitian build is not recommended for production wallet or mining uses. The code commits are rather ugly because it was thrown together just to make it build with the old 0.8 makefiles without intent for production code merge. Cfields is working on autotoolizing it as one of the prerequisites prior to inclusion into bitcoin master where it will be an option disabled by default.</summary>
