    <summary>When encoding public and private keys, the words 'public', 'private' and 'secret' can be confusing. Words that could look similar when written down should also be avoided. Words that only differ by the letters c &amp; e, g &amp; y, u &amp; v were found to be car ear, cat eat, gear year, value valve respectively. Other letter combinations could potentially be problematic depending on handwriting style. A search utility has been included to check for similarities between words. The code includes a word list of 2048 English words and checks each word for similarity against every other word.</summary>
