    <summary>On October 19, 2013, Jean-Paul Kogelman responded to a post by Luke-Jr on the topic of the protocol for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Luke-Jr had suggested that proposals should be first sent to a mailing list, which Kogelman agreed with. However, Kogelman noted that although there were few responses to the proposal in question, most of them were positive. He also stated that he had made revisions to the proposal based on feedback. Another responder to the thread, Peter Todd, weighed in on the issue of BIPs and their status as official proposals. He explained that having a proposal on the BIP page does make it more official, as this is how proposals are filtered by support and controversy. However, he also noted that having a BIP number assigned is not necessary for a proposal to be considered legitimate. Todd further suggested that creating working code would increase the likelihood of a proposal being accepted, and encouraged the original poster to become more involved in wallet development. Overall, the thread discussed the process for submitting proposals and the importance of feedback and involvement in the community.</summary>
