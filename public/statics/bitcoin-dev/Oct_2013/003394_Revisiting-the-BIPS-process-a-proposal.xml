    <summary>Jeff Garzik suggested improvements to the protocol specification process in an email sent on October 21, 2013. He proposed codifying the protocol specification page into BIPs and ensuring that the current wiki pages were either taken down or updated from the git repo. Additionally, he questioned whether BIP 50 should be considered a BIP despite its valuable information. The ultimate aim was to improve the process, hash-seal the specifications, and allow for greater participation from anyone with at least an email address.</summary>
