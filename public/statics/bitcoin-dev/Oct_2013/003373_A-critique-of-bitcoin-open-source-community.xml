    <summary>The discussion is about the official status of proposals on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) page. One person believes that having a proposal on the BIP page does not make it more official, while another thinks it does because the page filters out proposals with little support. The person who started the discussion wrote a proposal because there were no other proposals covering the same area. They also noted that some proposals with allocated numbers are empty and have no references to development or discussion. The second person mentioned that they have support from most of the development team for their own proposal but have not pushed for an official BIP number yet because it is still a controversial idea. In response to the first person's proposal, the second person suggested writing working code as it would increase the chances of the proposal being accepted. The first person has developed their own client but is not ready to release it yet and asked if putting contact information on the proposal would be sufficient until the client is up on GitHub.</summary>
