    <summary>In an email exchange on October 28, 2013, Warren Togami Jr. suggested using rejection codes to notify users that they have been rate-limited. Peter Todd acknowledged the suggestion but noted that the "too-low-fees" rejection codes already cover rejection messages. However, Todd indicated that a rate-limiting rejection code would be useful for requests like getblock and other similar requests. The email exchange was signed with a digital signature.</summary>
