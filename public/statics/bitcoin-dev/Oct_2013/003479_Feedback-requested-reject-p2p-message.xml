    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of HTTP codes in the Bitcoin protocol for success messages. The suggestion was made to use actual HTTP codes since there aren't any major deficiencies found in them. It was suggested that they could extend the HTTP scheme on their own if needed. The issue of using a string or varstring was also raised, with a varint being preferred as it only requires 16 bits. Gavin Andresen added a one-byte machine-readable HTTP-like status code and asked for feedback on whether a 32-bit status code, varint or three-character numeric string would be more suitable.It was noted that if anyone has strong feelings about what the reject categories should be, then they should write a specific list. A link to a webinar on Code for Performance by Intel was also provided.</summary>
