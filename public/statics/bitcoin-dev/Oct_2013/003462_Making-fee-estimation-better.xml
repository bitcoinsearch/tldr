    <summary>In an email thread dated October 26, 2013, Gavin Andresen expressed his thoughts on the discussion surrounding theoretical scenarios regarding Bitcoin transactions. Another participant in the thread, identified only as 'Peter,' responded by bringing up issues with a pull-request, stating that he was willing to merge it once bugs were fixed. Peter added that the wallet code needed both lower and upper bounds for fees in order to ensure safe merging. He suggested that 'training wheels' could be relaxed in later versions of the software after gaining real-world experience with the estimation system. A digital signature is also included in the email.</summary>
