    <summary>The Bitcoin community needs to consider the entire ecosystem of wallets involved in handling double-spends in order to make transaction replacements user-friendly. However, constantly monitoring transaction propagation and recreating transactions with different fees can create inconvenience for certain use cases. This includes half-offline Bluetooth transactions, users with unstable connections, battery power loss, and power concerns on hardware wallets on the Bitcoin card. Therefore, it is important to inform people about this upcoming change and its potential implications. Ultimately, the goal should be to ensure that all wallets can handle double-spends gracefully.</summary>
