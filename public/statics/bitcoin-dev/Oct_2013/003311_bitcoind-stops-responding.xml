    <summary>The context of this conversation is regarding an issue of "RPC stops working". One process is calling getinfo every second as a fallback to possibly misconfigured blocknotify and it also calls getblocktemplate every 30 seconds. The second process is calling getinfo once a minute to check if bitcoind is working. If it does not receive a response in a minute, it kills bitcoind and starts it again. The OS being used is Debian. Jeff Garzik asked for more details about the precise RPC usage, whether it was getwork, getblocktemplate or any other calls, and also enquired about the OS being used.</summary>
