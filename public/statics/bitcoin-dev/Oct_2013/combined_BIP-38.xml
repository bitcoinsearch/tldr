    <summary>In 2012, Mike Caldwell proposed BIP 0038 (Password-Protected Private Key) which recently underwent a change on the Wiki. Caldwell noticed this change and assumed that Gregory Maxwell made it without any discussion or assigning a number. Gregory responded that he had no prior knowledge of the proposal until he attempted to assign the number to something else and noticed that something already existed. He assumed that Caldwell had created the BIP document without public discussion as he had done before with "BIP 22". However, after someone complained about bitcoin-qt not confirming with BIP38, Gregory moved the document out but later moved it back after hearing from Caldwell that it had been assigned/announced. Mike Caldwell, who proposed the "Password-protected private key proposal," also known as BIP 38 in late 2012, has requested that the identity of his original proposal be maintained. He has stated that the improvements made by Kogelman to his proposal may be sufficient to supersede what he originally proposed. However, he wants BIP 38 to still be recognized as an existing proposal, so as not to confuse those who call it by its name and who have already chosen to do something with it. Caldwell has also mentioned that if he were to do BIP 38 over again, there are some shortcomings he would like to address in another iteration. These include outsourcing the computationally expensive step to another service with minimized risks to the user, special-purpose "encrypted minikeys," and a typo check with better privacy. Meanwhile, Gregory Maxwell, in response to Caldwell's request, has clarified that prior messages about Caldwell's proposal have never made it to the list, and no mention of the assignment had been made in the wiki. Maxwell had previously created BIP documents without public discussion, and he assumed that Caldwell had done something similar here. He moved the document out after someone complained about bitcoin-qt "not confirming with BIP38" to him. Jean-Paul Kogelman has a draft proposal based on Caldwell's work, though the encoding scheme is different, having been revised in response to public discussion. Maxwell suggests that efforts here can be combined.In an email to Mike Caldwell, Wladimir mentions some issues he faced while implementing BIP 0038 in Python. He brings up the fact that the BIP does not describe how flag 0x04 (lotsequence_present) should be used in decoding and suggests that it be clarified. Additionally, Wladimir points out an error in the encryption process mentioned in the BIP where it says "Split the result into two 16-byte halves and call them derivedhalf1 and derivedhalf2." It should actually be two 32-byte halves as the result is 64 bytes.The author of BIP 0038 is seeking help to confirm a recent change made on the Wiki regarding their proposal. The change suggests that the number was never assigned and there has been no discussion regarding the proposal on this list; however, the author states that they had the number assigned in November of 2012. They are asking for confirmation that their messages are getting through to the list and if not, requesting help to push forward the proposal. BIP 0038 allows people to create private keys protected by a password and is seeing real-world use including implementation by BitAddress.org, Bit2Factor.org and Mycelium. The author believes it would be confusing to reassign the number after already having an established meaning for the better part of a year, particularly on procedural grounds.</summary>
