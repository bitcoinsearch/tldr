    <summary>In an email conversation, Gavin Andresen and another participant talked about the issue of incentivizing code review for open-source software projects. They discussed the potential use of better tools to help with incentivization but expressed concerns over making the pool of reviewers even smaller if the tools are too difficult to use. The conversation also involved whether or not to thank only people who significantly helped test or review other people's code in the "Thank you" section for future releases or to have a separate section for those who helped review above the current section. They ultimately decided it would be unfair not to credit occasional contributors who fixed bugs or maintained something important but didn't review complicated changes to the core.</summary>
