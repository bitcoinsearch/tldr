    <summary>On October 25, 2013, Gavin Andresen discussed a proposal by Mike Hearn to include an "error" message in the Bitcoin p2p protocol. The proposal had been brought up multiple times since the implementation of code to mitigate denial-of-service attacks. The proposal resurfaced again during discussions about proposed "smartfee" changes that would drop low-priority or low-fee transactions. The discussion also raised questions about the use of fixed-length strings or enums in the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
