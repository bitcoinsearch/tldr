    <summary>In a mailing list conversation dated September 30, 2013, Fatima Castiglione Maldonado asked for help about bitcoind's "sendToAddress" transactions that stop responding to RPC calls when sent every 20 seconds or less. Greg Maxwell replied to her question, stating that it was unrelated to Slush's question and that the complexity of IsConfirmed/Ismine is exponential and starts taking tens of seconds at a chain of a dozen unconfirmed transactions. He also suggested using sendmany instead. Fatima then replied, acknowledging that she was not aware of sendmany and that this was her first time managing bulk transactions. She thanked him for the help and said that she leads a group of developers who are trying to help the Bitcoin community as a whole. The context ends with her signature and contact details.</summary>
