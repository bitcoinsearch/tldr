    <summary>The context discusses the concept of a soft fork in the Bitcoin network. The writer questions the use of the term and explains that it refers to an upgrade designed to appear valid to old nodes. If users do not upgrade, they rely on the majority of miners to return to normalcy. However, the code mentioned in the post will not be helpful during a soft-forking upgrade as the client will not reject a block, even if it is invalid or nonsensical. The alerting code will only trigger during a hard fork when changes in serialization format, script language, or SIGHASH rules cause rejection by old clients. The alerting code triggering during a hard fork is correct and should happen.</summary>
