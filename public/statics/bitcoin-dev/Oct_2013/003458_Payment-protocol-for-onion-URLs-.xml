    <summary>In an email correspondence on October 26, 2013, Gregory Maxwell suggests a fully supported option that would be completely CA free. He notes that it would only work for tor sites, but those concerned about CA treachery are likely to want to use Tor anyway. Gavin Andresen responds, stating that from an engineering priority perspective, his initial reaction is that it is not worth it as only a tiny number of people would use it. However, he believes that it could be a demonstration of the flexibility of the payment protocol and a nifty idea that will give lots of people warm fuzzies.</summary>
