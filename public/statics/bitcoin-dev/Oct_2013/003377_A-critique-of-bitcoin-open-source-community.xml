    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik on October 20, 2013, Todd proposed that Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be done as a Github repository for transparency purposes. He suggested that using Github would make it easier to archive, update, and keep track of BIPs. Todd also recommended using markdown format since it is similar to the wiki and supports images. Garzik agreed with Todd's proposal and nominated him to do the conversion. The plan was to put the repository at github.com/bitcoin/bips.git. Garzik is a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
