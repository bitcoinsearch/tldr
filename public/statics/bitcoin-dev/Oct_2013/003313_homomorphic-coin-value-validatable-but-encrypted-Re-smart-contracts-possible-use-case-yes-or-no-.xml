    <summary>Mark Friedenbach has suggested providing external audits of customer accounts without revealing private data, which would be useful beyond taxation. As a result, Adam has been researching this for a few months and moved the topic to bitcointalk. He mentions that the efficient version is approximately 2x cost of the current in terms of coin size and coin verification cost. Furthermore, necessary changes to schnorr (EC version of Schnorr based proofs) allow n of n multiparty sigs, or k of n multiparty sigs for the verification cost and signature size of one pair of ECS signatures, for n &gt; 2 it's a space and efficiency improvement over current bitcoin.</summary>
