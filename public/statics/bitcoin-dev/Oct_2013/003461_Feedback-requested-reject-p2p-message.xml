    <summary>The HTTP status code system is a numeric code that is machine-readable and also has a freeform text note for humans. This system was designed to not account for every possible error, but instead give the most useful information to the other node. The codes can provide information such as "try again later", or "that is just plain wrong and it will still be wrong next time too, so don't bother to retry". Humans can decipher the meaning of the codes, such as "403: values of txid gives rise to dom!". Gavin suggests not using enums or fixed-length strings as this would make it harder to extend, for no benefit. He also mentions upcoming Intel webinars about accelerating application performance.</summary>
