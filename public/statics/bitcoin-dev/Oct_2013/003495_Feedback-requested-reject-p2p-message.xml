    <summary>In an email exchange from October 30, 2013, Mark Friedenbach discussed fork alerts with an unknown recipient. When asked about rejecting blocks, Friedenbach clarified that his previous comment was not related to that topic. Instead, he was referring to the fork alerts that Matt had implemented. These alerts would notify users if an upgrade had been missed.</summary>
