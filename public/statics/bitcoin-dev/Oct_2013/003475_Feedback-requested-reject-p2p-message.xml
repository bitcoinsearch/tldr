    <summary>In an email conversation between Pieter and Gavin Andresen, they discuss the reject categories for Bitcoin transactions. Pieter outlines three categories that make sense to him: protocol related problems such as failed transaction deserialization, core principle violations such as script evaluation failure where only the owner is allowed to spend and outputs larger than inputs which does not create new money, and policy rules such as non-standard transactions. Gavin agrees to add a one-byte machine-readable HTTP-like status code for reject categories but asks for a specific list from anyone who has strong feelings about it. The conversation ends with a link to Intel webinars on accelerating application performance.</summary>
