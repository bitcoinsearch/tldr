    <summary>On October 24, 2013, thomasV1 at gmx.de proposed a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to replace BIP0039. However, it should be noted that BIP0039 was still in draft form at the time. The suggestion was made to revise the existing proposal rather than replace it entirely. It is unclear what specific changes were proposed or if they were implemented in the final version of BIP0039. It is recommended that any proposed revisions to BIPs be directed to the author(s) for consideration.</summary>
