    <summary>On October 21, 2013, Jeff Garzik volunteered to be the BIPS editor. He suggested that there should be backups with commit access to bips.git in case the BIPS editor is not available due to any reason. Jeff proposed some core devs, Andreas, Michael G, Alan R, and others working on non-Satoshi clients as possible backups. Another person accepted the nomination as a backup. The duty of the BIPS editor is merging pull requests and/or proxying between email and git for those who do not use git.</summary>
