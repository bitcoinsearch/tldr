    <summary>The discussion is about whether it's better to have a long chain of commits on a feature branch that are compressed into one big diff or to have the individual and accurate messages preserved in the individual commits. The first option throws away information and doesn't allow for easy reviewing, while the second option preserves advantages like easier merges and bisects. However, the reviewer argues that reviewing lots of small commits is hard and prefers to review large diffs. The writer suggests not throwing away the small commits, as they can be useful in isolating specific changes. The writer personally works hard to create well-described commits and believes that collapsing them all would be a waste of effort.</summary>
