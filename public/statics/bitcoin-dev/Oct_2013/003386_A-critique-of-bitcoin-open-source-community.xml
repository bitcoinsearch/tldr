    <summary>Melvin Carvalho, a follower of free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS) projects, expressed his admiration for the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. He believes that this process is an agile one that strikes a balance between necessary features and documentation, which will help maintain the momentum of Bitcoin in the short to medium term. The BIP process is also used in other systems such as Python. Other enhancement proposal processes similar to BIP are used in XMPP and BitTorrent. Links to these processes can be found on their respective websites.</summary>
