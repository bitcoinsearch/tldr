    <summary>On October 19, 2013, Jean-Paul Kogelman wrote an email to Luke Dashjr asking about the process for obtaining a BIP number. Kogelman had written a BIP for base 58 encoding/encryption of BIP 32 root keys but was uncertain about adding it to the list himself. The BIP page states that proposals should be sent to this mailing list first, and Kogelman had contacted Dashjr a couple of times on Bitcointalk for a BIP number but had not received a response. Dashjr responded by directing Kogelman to BIP 1 which outlines the proposal process.</summary>
