    <summary>The context is a discussion about identifying similar words in a wordlist to avoid confusion when written down. A new unit test called test_similarity() was pushed to Github to find such similar words. The test currently identifies approximately 90 similar pairs in the current wordlist, and the wordlist will be updated the following day to pass this test. In addition, a participant in the discussion suggested avoiding words that could look similar when written down, citing examples of words that only differ by certain letters (c &amp; e, g &amp; y, u &amp; v). Other letter combinations like ft, ao, ij, vy, and possibly even lt and il were also mentioned as potentially problematic depending on handwriting style.</summary>
