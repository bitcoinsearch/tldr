    <summary>Currently, the BIPS process is disorganized as it moved to the wiki and became editable. However, there was an incident where someone started arbitrarily editing an existing standard. Therefore, the suggestion is that BIPS should move back to git and standards should be hash-sealed against corruption to prevent such incidents. But some people on IRC pointed out that requiring a git pull request may discourage contributors. Hence, a new process is proposed.The new process consists of four steps: 1) Anyone can submit a BIP draft related to Bitcoin, formatted in markdown or any community-preferred format via Git pull request or email.2) Time passes while the software for BIP drafts is developed, tested, published, and publicly discussed in an open-source manner. 3) If interest and use cases remain strong, a BIP number can be requested, and the BIP draft is moved to the main directory of git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git.4) If there is general consensus that the BIP should be adopted, the BIP status is changed to "accepted." There is no specified time limit for this process, as it varies depending on the feature's complexity and impact. The proposed process is modeled after IETF drafts, and it is expected to be more organized than the current one.</summary>
