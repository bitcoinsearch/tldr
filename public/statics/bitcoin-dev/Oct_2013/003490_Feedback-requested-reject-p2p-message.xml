    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Mike Hearn on October 29, 2013, the topic of using nVersion as a soft-forking mechanism was discussed. Hearn suggested that there should be a separate code for blocks that claim to be v2 or v3 to prevent people from using nVersion for nonsense. However, Todd argued that rejecting blocks with nVersions that are not expected would cause a hard fork. Todd also expressed his belief that the whole soft-fork mechanism is wrong and should not be used because it undermines Bitcoin's security model. He emphasized that if the rules change, nodes are supposed to end up on a chain fork and trigger an alert.</summary>
