    <summary>In an email exchange on October 22, 2013, Martin Sustrik mentioned the Security Considerations part in every Request for Comments (RFC) that is relevant to Bitcoin. This section discusses how inconsistent behavior in the consensus critical parts of the protocol could lead to disastrous consequences. Thus, conforming or non-conforming with this specification may be required for security. Sustrik suggested that a Bitcoin protocol RFC would be an ideal place to use RFC 6919 keywords. This RFC provides guidelines on using specific keywords to convey different levels of importance and requirement in standards documents. Using these keywords in the Bitcoin protocol RFC could help make it more clear and consistent.</summary>
