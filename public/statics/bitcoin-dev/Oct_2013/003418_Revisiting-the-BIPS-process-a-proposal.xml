    <summary>During a conversation in 2013, Martin Sustrik and Pieter Wuille discussed the importance of consistency in Bitcoin's documentation. Wuille believed that documentation should accurately describe the rules of the system but carry a strong notice that it is descriptive rather than normative. Sustrik suggested that extensive documentation of the source code may be a middle ground, citing Knuth's literate programming as an example. Several people expressed interest in the topic, and Sustrik decided to give it a try to see how it fares. Jeff Garzik, a Senior Software Engineer, and open-source evangelist at Bitpay, Inc. shared this conversation.</summary>
