    <summary>In an email conversation on Oct 20, 2013, Jean-Paul Kogelman asked if it would be possible to create an area for proposals like NODE_BLOOM and BIP 38. The response from 'peter' was positive, suggesting the idea of a specific drafts/ directory within the repository or even a rejected/ folder. In any case, since it's all in git, people can be directed to the bips fork. A signature.asc attachment was also included in the email.</summary>
