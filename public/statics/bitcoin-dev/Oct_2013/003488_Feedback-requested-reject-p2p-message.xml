    <summary>In an email conversation on October 29th, 2013, Mike Hearn raised concerns about losing the nVersion field to people using it for nonsense if a separate code was created for "block is from the future" regarding block 0x11. However, doing so would prevent nVersion from being used as a soft-forking mechanism. Peter Todd responded to the email thread, stating his agreement with Hearn's point and signed off with his email signature. No further information or context is provided in the given text.</summary>
