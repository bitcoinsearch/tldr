    <summary>Mike Hearn has been advocating for an "error" message in the Bitcoin p2p protocol to help interoperability between different implementations and provide feedback when transactions are rejected due to insufficient priority or fees. This issue was raised again with proposed "smartfee" changes that would drop low-priority or low-fee transactions. Gavin Andresen is seeking feedback on his plan to implement this error message before returning to complete the 'smart fee' work. Details can be found on the GitHub gist provided in the context.</summary>
