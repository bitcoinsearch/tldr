    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin code review took place in October 2013. The use of Git, while effective for creating long series of commits towards achieving some useful goal, is not ideal for code review. It can be challenging to keep track of changes made in later commits, making it harder to review code that uses new APIs or behavior changes introduced earlier. To address this issue, the author suggests either submitting large pieces of work as one giant squashed change or keeping commits logically clean and separated.Additionally, the author highlights Github's lack of focus on basic improvements for code review and suggests using Review Board, an open-source code review tool with git integration and various features such as side by side diffs and the ability to attach screenshots to reviews. However, there are concerns about making the pool of reviewers even smaller if the tools are too difficult to use.When submitting large, complex pieces of work for review, it is recommended to either submit them as one giant squashed change or keep commits logically clean and separated. Each commit is two things: what source code has changed and a message explaining why the change was made. Therefore, it is important to put oneself in fellow coders' shoes and explain the best way to accomplish the task. It is crucial not to make commits that don't compile, and everything should be refactored to the point where the commit as a whole "works."In a discussion about code review on Bitcoin, Peter Todd highlighted the issue of rebasing pull requests multiple times until they are accepted, which can result in earlier code reviews becoming irrelevant. He also mentioned the risk of malicious code being introduced into the Bitcoin codebase. Arto Bendiken noted an example from 2003 where a missing character was used to backdoor the Linux kernel, emphasizing the need for careful review. Peter suggested a system where code review discussions could be PGP signed and combined with git's per-commit signature mechanism to ensure safety.It is suggested to review patches by looking at both individual commits to understand why someone wanted to make a change and all merged commits into one diff for a "what actually changed here?" review. While many people strive for neat collections of easy-to-understand and review commits, this can be difficult in practice. One solution is to use squashed commits, but this can still be challenging when reviewing large pull requests.In an email exchange between Peter Todd and another contributor, Todd expressed his preference for using the "Files Changed" tab on GitHub when reviewing multiple commit pull-requests as it allows him to see every change made. The other contributor mentioned that comments on the files changed tab have disappeared in the past, leading to a loss of trust in doing reviews that way. However, they acknowledged that it does make things easier to read. The conversation then shifted towards the advantages of using GitHub as an independent third party for code review.Mike Hearn suggested the use of Review Board - a dedicated open source code review tool with git[hub] integration and many neat features such as the ability to attach screenshots to reviews, side by side diffs and the submission of branches as single reviews. However, one advantage of using Github is that they are an independent third party and there may be risks associated with moving the code review to a server that is controlled with explicit review groups.In conclusion, proper code review is important for Bitcoin development in order to avoid malicious code being introduced into the codebase. Different tools can be used for code review, including GitHub's "Files Changed" tab or Review Board, but it is important to carefully examine the code that goes into the master branch. It is crucial to keep commits logically clean and separated when submitting large, complex pieces of work for review. There is no hard and fast rule for how many commits to make, but it is best to put oneself in the shoes of fellow coders and consider what the best way to explain the changes is.</summary>
