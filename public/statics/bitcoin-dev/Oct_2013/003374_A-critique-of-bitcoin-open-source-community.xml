    <summary>In an email exchange dated October 20, 2013, Wladimir van der Laan discussed the behavior of Bitcoin developers on various forums. In response to Gregory Maxwell's technical review post on a forum, Wladimir expressed frustration with the unfriendly and unhelpful behavior of some Bitcoin developers on forums. He cautioned against sending people to these forums and emphasized that they are not endorsed by the developer community. However, he also noted that the core developer community is relatively small and that reviewing and testing proposals can take time, leading to frustration for some users.</summary>
