    <summary>The author expresses his agreement to move BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) to GitHub. He also agrees with the states-to-directories mapping and mentions that Git manages moved files well. In an email conversation between Jean-Paul Kogelman and Arto Bendiken, they discuss the similarities between Bitcoin's BIP process and Python's PEP process. They quote from BIP 1's history and mention that the document was derived heavily from Python's PEP-0001. The author's website is also provided.</summary>
