    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent developer in the Bitcoin community, has cautioned other developers about potential issues with private key creation in the Bitcoin SCI library. He recommended that users of the library review how their software handles private key creation, as there are concerns over the security of keys generated by the library. The library had been using the Mersenne Twister PRNG or the GMP library's PRNG directly to generate private keys, which was somewhat resolved in the most recent version. However, only the createNewMiniKey() function has been updated. Developers who do not use this library are also advised to check their own key generation functions if they do not interface directly with bitcoind.It is unclear if there are other libraries affected, but Gavin Andresen was only able to make contact with one other library besides the Bitcoin SCI library, and it is recommended that developers take caution regardless. There are concerns over the issue because affected keys have 32bits of entropy, potentially allowing GPU-based attacks on keys in the lower ranges. It is unknown how many keys have been created using either function.In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Andres Home in 2013, it was warned that the Bitcoin SCI library had weak key generation. Although there were only two libraries detected with this issue, one being Bitcoin SCI, it was advised for developers to review how their software handles private key creation. The email contained links to the MiniKey function and PrivKey function where the weak functions were mirrored since there was no source control. The Bitcoin SCI library can be found at http://bitfreak.info/index.php?page=tools&amp;t=bitsci.</summary>
