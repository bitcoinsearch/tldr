    <summary>The author questions the effectiveness of removing offensive words from mnemonics, arguing that these words are more memorable due to their emotional impact. They propose that using generally offensive words, especially when combined with each other, could optimize the "maximum unforgettableness" criterion. The author acknowledges that this idea is unlikely to be popular, but suggests that it may be a better solution in terms of human memory. This proposal was made in response to a BIP39 wordlist that had been revised to remove offensive words and resolve duplicities. The BIP39 wordlist is used to generate seed phrases for wallet recovery and has undergone several rounds of community feedback. Slush, a developer involved in the project, expressed satisfaction with the new list and requested constructive feedback for the final round. In addition to the wordlist, the implementation includes password protection and seed hardening using Rijndael cipher. Slush emphasized the need to finalize this project as soon as possible for use in Trezor, a hardware wallet, and by other developers who want to implement this algorithm into clients to be compatible with Trezor. Earlier in the email thread, Matthew Mitchell removed some offensive words from the wordlist, but did not replace enough back in. Pavol Rusnak revised the list further by replacing around 67 words that can be found offensive in some context. The author's proposal to use generally offensive words goes against the trend of removing such words and may not be well-received by users.</summary>
