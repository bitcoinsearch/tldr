    <summary>On October 28, 2013, Gavin Andresen sent an email thanking everyone for their feedback on a GitHub gist about Bitcoin reject message codes. The categories included Protocol syntax errors, Protocol semantic errors, and Server policy rule. He explained that they would not use a varint because they were unlikely to run out of reject codes, and they would not use HTTP codes directly because it would not fit the system. The email thread discussed the possibility of adding rejection codes to notify users of rate limiting. Finally, the email contained a link to a white paper on secure code signing practices for Android apps.</summary>
