    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen on October 29, 2013, they discussed the use of soft-forks in Bitcoin. Hearn expressed his belief that the mechanism was flawed and should not be utilized, as it undermines the security model of Bitcoin. However, Andresen pointed out that recent versions of the reference implementation will alert users if they are being soft-forked. If more than half of the last 100 blocks are up-version, a warning will be issued. The block.version, which is part of the block header, can also be used by SPV clients to issue warnings. Additionally, there are warnings for those who are forked and for those who are on a high-work alternative fork.</summary>
