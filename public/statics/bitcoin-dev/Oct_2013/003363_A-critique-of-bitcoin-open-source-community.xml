    <summary>In this email correspondence, Mitar is thanking Gregory Maxwell for his time and answers and sharing two previous articles to clarify Nick's perspective. Gregory responds by addressing specific complaints from the article and offering explanations and solutions. He mentions that editing en.bitcoin.it requires paying an anti-spam fee but is unsure if it's a terrible policy. Gregory also highlights that many long-standing pull requests are created by people with direct commit access and the need for better introductory materials on Bitcoin development.</summary>
