    <summary>In an email thread from October 19, 2013, Gregory Maxwell and Luke-Jr discuss proposals being sent to a Bitcoin mailing list. Maxwell notes that a proposal was posted to the mailing list previously but received an underwhelming response. However, most of the discussion took place on bitcointalk, with positive feedback overall. The proposal has undergone revisions to incorporate suggestions, although it is not yet final, particularly in regards to key derivation functions. Maxwell agrees that having the proposal on the BIP page increases exposure and encourages further discussion.</summary>
