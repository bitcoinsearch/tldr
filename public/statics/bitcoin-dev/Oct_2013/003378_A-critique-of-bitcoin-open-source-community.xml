    <summary>In 2013, Jeff Garzik proposed that Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be done as a GitHub repository to allow for transparent handling. Peter Todd agreed and suggested using markdown format which supports tables, images, and math. Todd was nominated to do the conversion and it can now be found at https://github.com/petertodd/bips/. The conversion was done by directly copying from the bitcoin.it wiki which is supported by MediaWiki. GitHub also allows users to edit their pull-req's or create new ones by forking the repository. Currently, formatting may not be perfect and submission guideline text in BIP 1 has not been changed yet.</summary>
