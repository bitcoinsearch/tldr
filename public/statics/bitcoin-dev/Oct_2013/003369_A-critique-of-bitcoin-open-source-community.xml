    <summary>On July 19, 2003, a proposal was submitted to the mailing list. On October 19, 2013, Jean-Paul Kogelman asked Luke-Jr about obtaining a BIP number for his proposal regarding base 58 encoding/encryption of BIP 32 root keys. The BIP page stated that requests for BIP numbers should be directed towards Luke-Jr. Luke-Jr responded by directing Kogelman to refer to BIP 1 for the process and stating that proposals go to the mailing list first.</summary>
