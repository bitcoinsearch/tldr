    <summary>The pull-tester has been experiencing issues since the autotools merge, leading to some features being turned off until fixes can be implemented. At present, the pull-tester is capable of cross-compiling windows binaries, compiling linux binaries, and running unit tests using binaries compiled on linux. However, it is unable to carry out other tasks such as running unit tests under wine with cross-compiled windows binaries, running the block-chain-compatibility tester, and computing code coverage.In the medium-term, upgrades will need to be made to the pull-tester environment in order to resolve these issues. Gavin Andresen suggests upgrading the pull-tester machine from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 or creating a new 12.04 virtual machine and migrating the pull-tester over to it. Upgrades to compilers/dependencies will also be necessary to align with what will be used for the 0.9 release. In addition, there needs to be an effort to unify the pull-tester and gitian build processes. One possible solution is having the pull-tester run gitian builds to create binaries that are tested against the blockchain tester, or alternatively, having the pull-tester scripts be gitian scripts that are run inside an LXC container by the pull-tester machine.</summary>
