    <summary>MacWallet is a tiny and integrated thin client wallet app for Mac OSX based on bitcoinj. The main focus of the app is to provide a small and integrated wallet for Mac OSX, with low memory and CPU footprint, that can be run in the background without causing any inconvenience. The app uses Mac OSX keychain as a wallet store, which is encrypted by default with login credentials. The user interface is simple and straightforward, with the status menu serving as the main entry point. Currently, the app is in its early development stage. Screenshots of the app can be viewed on the Github page, and more information can be found on the bitcointalk post.</summary>
