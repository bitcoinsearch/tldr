    <summary>In 2012, Mike Caldwell proposed BIP 0038 (Password-Protected Private Key) which recently underwent a change on the Wiki. Caldwell noticed this change and assumed that Gregory Maxwell made it without any discussion or assigning a number. Gregory responded that he had no prior knowledge of the proposal until he attempted to assign the number to something else and noticed that something already existed. He assumed that Caldwell had created the BIP document without public discussion as he had done before with "BIP 22". However, after someone complained about bitcoin-qt not confirming with BIP38, Gregory moved the document out but later moved it back after hearing from Caldwell that it had been assigned/announced. Gregory believes that having a wallet that can only support a single address is poor form and suggests combining efforts with Jean-Paul Kogelman's draft proposal which is based on Caldwell's BIP38 work but has a different encoding scheme revised in response to public discussion.</summary>
