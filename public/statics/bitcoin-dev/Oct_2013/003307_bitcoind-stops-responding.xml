    <summary>Slush reported observing frequent issues with bitcoind where it stops responding to RPC calls, however, there is no other suspicious activity in the bitcoind log and CPU usage is low. This problem was first observed with version 0.8.2 and it persists with version 0.8.5. Slush noticed this issue happening one or twice per day but it has now increased to over 30 times per day, which is alarming. The problem occurs on various backends, so it is not specific to one node. Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open-source evangelist at BitPay Inc. responded to slush's query and asked for more details regarding the precise RPC usage, OS, and other calls being made.</summary>
