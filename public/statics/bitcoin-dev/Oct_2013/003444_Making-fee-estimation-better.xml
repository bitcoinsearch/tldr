    <summary>In an email conversation from October 25, 2013, Andreas Petersson discussed the possible inconvenience of constantly monitoring transaction propagation and recreating transactions with different fees for wallets. This could create issues for half-offline Bluetooth transactions, users with unstable connections or lost battery power, and hardware wallets on the bitcoincard due to power concerns. However, he acknowledged the necessity of combining fee estimation with some form of transaction replacement to give users a way to recover from bad estimates. The payment protocol is designed for the sender to give the receiver a copy of every transaction they make so the receiver can be held responsible for getting them mined, utilizing child-pays-for-parent, out-of-band fee payment, or adding inputs to the transaction.</summary>
