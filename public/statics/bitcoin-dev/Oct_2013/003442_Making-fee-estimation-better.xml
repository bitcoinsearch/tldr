    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of wallets creating and signing three transactions with different fees at once. The latter two would be broadcasted only when needed. Andreas Petersson raises concerns about the impact on the ecosystem of wallets, which would have to handle double-spends gracefully to make transaction replacement user-friendly. He argues that this feature could be inconvenient for many use cases, such as half-offline Bluetooth transactions, users with unstable connections or power concerns on hardware wallets. In addition, he promotes a free Intel webinar that provides tips for MPI, OpenMP, advanced profiling, and more to help accelerate application performance. The email thread is part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
