    <summary>In an email conversation from October 2013 between developers, concerns were raised regarding the compatibility of BIP0039 with Electrum and the lack of version number information in the seed encoding. The proposal was made to allocate a few bits of the mnemonic for a version number to encode both seed encoding and wallet structure information, with the latter being important for Electrum's ability to recover an entire wallet from its mnemonic with no extra information. The dictionary proposed in BIP0039 was also criticized for containing too many short words that are difficult to memorize. While localized dictionaries with non-colliding word lists were suggested, it was acknowledged that achieving this may be difficult due to common words across languages. A dictionary-independent solution was recommended to allow developers to define new dictionaries adapted to specific needs. One suggestion involved using a one-way algorithm to convert a mnemonic to a seed, but concerns were raised about the benefit of the "mining" part of the proposal and potential loss of entropy. The discussion highlighted the need for flexibility in defining dictionaries and addressing compatibility issues when implementing new proposals.</summary>
