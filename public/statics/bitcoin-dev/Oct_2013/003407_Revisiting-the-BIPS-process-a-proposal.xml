    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeff Garzik suggested that a distributed approach be taken to avoid adding burdensome processes that might discourage BIP writing. He encouraged anyone who feels a draft needs more sections or better language to submit a pull request and help community-edit the document. Martin expressed his willingness to do so but was hesitant due to Peter Todd's comments about the spec being deliberately vague to force compatibility with the reference implementation rather than with a document. He explained that this kind of compatibility-via-obscurity may not work in the long run but can prevent proliferation of implementations, giving the protocol more space and flexibility to evolve. However, if his impression was wrong, he was happy to give it a try.</summary>
