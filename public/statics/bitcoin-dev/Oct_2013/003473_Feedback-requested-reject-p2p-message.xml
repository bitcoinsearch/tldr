    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, the topic of using HTTP-like status codes was brought up. The question was raised as to whether there were any major deficiencies in actual HTTP codes that would prevent their use. It was suggested that most of the codes wouldn't apply to their situation, but they could extend the scheme if necessary. The issue of how to represent the status codes was also discussed, with a suggestion to use either 16 bits or a varint. While arguments could be made for both options, it was ultimately decided to use a varint. Gavin Andresen, who was leading the discussion, offered to add a one-byte machine-readable HTTP-like status code, but was open to other suggestions. He also requested a specific list of reject categories from anyone with strong feelings on the matter.</summary>
