    <summary>Gregory Maxwell shared a link to a search utility he used on his word list visual.py. Pavol Rusnak responded by stating that posting links to tools on the internet is not helpful and sending pull requests with particular changesets with explanation is more effective. He also believes it's no longer wise to introduce changes to the word list, especially since there are 50 people with 51 different opinions on the topic.</summary>
