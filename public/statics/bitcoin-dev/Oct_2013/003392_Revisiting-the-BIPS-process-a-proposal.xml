    <summary>In an email exchange on October 21, 2013, Andreas Schildbach accepted a nomination as a backup. The position entails merging pull requests and assigning BIP numbers while acting as a proxy between email and git for those who do not use git. Although the role is intended to be administrative, tensions may arise when gauging consensus and review for drafts to advance to BIP/proposed status and promoting numbered BIPs to final/accepted status. Jeff Garzik, a senior software engineer at BitPay, Inc., was involved in the email exchange.</summary>
