    <summary>A developer in the Bitcoin community has requested for Bitcoin 0.8.5 with sipa's secp256k1, an optimized elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). Litecoin has already been using secp256k1 for several months and so a branch of Bitcoin 0.8.5 with secp256k1 was created by wtogami. The branch should work on Linux, win32 gitian and Mac builds, but is not recommended for production wallet or mining uses. The commits are rather ugly as it was created just to make it build with the old 0.8 makefiles without intent for production code merge. Cfields is working on autotoolizing it as one of the prerequisites prior to inclusion into bitcoin master where it will be an option disabled by default.</summary>
