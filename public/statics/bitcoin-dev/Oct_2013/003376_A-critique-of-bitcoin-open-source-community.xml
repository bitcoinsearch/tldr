    <summary>Peter Todd suggests that BIPs should have been done as a GitHub repository rather than the wiki, which would allow them to be dealt with transparently as a pull-request and make it easy to archive, update, and keep a log of them. He points out that markdown format is pretty much feature equivalent to the wiki now that markdown supports images. However, he acknowledges that people found the repository inconvenient and used the wiki instead. Peter finds it pathetic for standards but admits that it wouldn't be the first time he has seen strong resistance to using revision control. He suggests using git submodules or subtrees, which would allow the individual BIP owners to make changes frequently until they are happy and might have more social acceptance.</summary>
