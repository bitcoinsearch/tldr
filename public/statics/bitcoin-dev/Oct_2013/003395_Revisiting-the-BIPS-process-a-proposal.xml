    <summary>Jean-Paul Kogelman, a member of the Bitcoin community, raised three questions on Monday, October 21, 2013. The first question was whether the protocol specification page should be codified into BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). In response to this, it was suggested that although it wouldn't hurt to do so, the page would require rewriting in a more modular and formal form. The second question raised by Kogelman was whether the current wiki pages should be taken down or forwarded to the git repo, or alternatively, whether they should be auto-updated from the git repo. It was recommended that the pages be kept up there since it is the same format, with a link to the git repository on the main BIP index wiki page.Finally, Kogelman asked whether BIP 50, despite containing valuable information, should really be considered a BIP. Since this proposal entails a hardforking protocol change, it was deemed appropriate to classify it as a BIP.</summary>
