    <summary>In this email conversation from 2013, Gavin Andresen points out that the discussion about transaction fees and prioritization seems to be too focused on theoretical scenarios and mentions that there may be better mechanisms for estimating fees. Peter Todd responds by suggesting that having a backup is a good thing, and provides a 4BTC bounty for a mempool implementation similar to what he did for replace-by-fee. He asks for an increasetxfee RPC command and an erasewallettx RPC command to deal with duplicates, and suggests that getting pools to use it will be easy enough. He also includes a bitcoind decodescript and a PGP signature.</summary>
