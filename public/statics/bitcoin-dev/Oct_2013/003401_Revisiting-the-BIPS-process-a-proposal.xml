    <summary>In an email thread dated October 22, 2013, Gregory Maxwell expressed concerns about the incompleteness of the Bitcoin wiki's protocol specification. Jean-Paul Kogelman had shared the link to the wiki with Maxwell, who found that it lacked a proper introduction and description of the problem at hand. In contrast, Maxwell cited RFCs as an example of well-written documents that provide an overview of the solution before diving into technical details. He also pointed out the importance of a Security Considerations section in such documents. Maxwell offered to help write a more comprehensive protocol specification for Bitcoin, but emphasized the need for assistance from core developers in answering questions and reviewing the document. Martin was included in the email thread as a potential collaborator.</summary>
