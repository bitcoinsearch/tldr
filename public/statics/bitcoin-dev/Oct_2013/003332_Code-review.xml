    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and another contributor, Todd expressed his preference for using the "Files Changed" tab on GitHub when reviewing multiple commit pull-requests as it allows him to see every change made. The other contributor mentioned that comments on the files changed tab have disappeared in the past, leading to a loss of trust in doing reviews that way. However, they acknowledged that it does make things easier to read. The conversation then shifted towards the advantages of using GitHub as an independent third party for code review. They discussed the risks of moving the code review process to a server controlled by the Bitcoin development team, potentially creating an impression of a closed process. The possibility of allowing anyone to sign up and comment was also raised.</summary>
