    <summary>The discussion revolves around decentralized naming systems and their feasibility. The namecoin system requires the entire blockchain to resolve names without trust, making it expensive in terms of resources. A simpler system is proposed, which strips out the meaningfulness and transferability of names and instead focuses on a spam-killing system that scales on any device. The proposed system involves generating short, readable and memorable names using phonemes, with 3 phonemes encoding the location of a transaction in the blockchain. This can be used as a unique identifier for users in an identity protocol being developed by Jeff Garzik. The sacrifice transaction in the protocol could be uniquely described with a short name generated using phonemes. Lightweight clients can verify the validity of a sacrifice transaction by checking its merkle path and verifying its short name using only the information they already have. The proposed phoneme system is inspired by urbit.org and bitcoin's identity protocol v1.</summary>
