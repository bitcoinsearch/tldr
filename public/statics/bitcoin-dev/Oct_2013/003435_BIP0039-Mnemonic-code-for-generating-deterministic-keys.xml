    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n raised a concern regarding the use of mnemonics, which aims to easily remember information. He believes that removing offensive words from the list is counterproductive as these words have a greater emotional impact on human moral psyches. He suggested that if the aim is to optimize the "maximum unforgettableness" criterion, then the most generally offensive words in the list should be preferred, especially if they can combine with each other to produce more offensive results. He cited an example that "legalize murder dirty jew" is much easier to remember than "sandwich house yellow cauliflower." While Slush suggested that a swearword dictionary could be added to bip39, it may not gain popularity.</summary>
