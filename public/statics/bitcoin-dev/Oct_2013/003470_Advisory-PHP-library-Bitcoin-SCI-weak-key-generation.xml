    <summary>It seems that Gavin Andresen, a well-known developer in the Bitcoin community, warned other developers about potential issues with private key creation in the Bitcoin SCI library. He specifically advised those who use the library to review how their software handles private key creation. It is unclear if there are other libraries affected, but he was only able to make contact with one other library besides the Bitcoin SCI library, and it is recommended that developers take caution regardless. The Bitcoin SCI library can be found at http://bitfreak.info/index.php?page=tools&amp;t=bitsci.</summary>
