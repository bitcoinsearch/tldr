    <summary>In an email conversation, Gregory Maxwell expresses confusion over a statement made about not being allowed to edit the Bitcoin wiki. He clarifies that editing is open to anyone willing to pay the 0.01 anti-spam fee, and that it is not a policy set by the Bitcoin development community. He believes that this policy is at least open to anyone with Bitcoin and has paid the fee on behalf of other users. In a separate inquiry, jp questions Gregory about the process for obtaining a BIP number for their proposal on base 58 encoding/encryption of BIP 32 root keys. The BIP page states that one should contact Gregory for a BIP number instead of adding to the list themselves. jp mentions having attempted to contact Gregory on Bitcointalk but received no response, asking if requests must be sent via email instead. They provide a link to their proposal for reference.</summary>
