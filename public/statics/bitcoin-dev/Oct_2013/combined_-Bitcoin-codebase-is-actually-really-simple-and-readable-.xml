    <summary>The Bitcoin codebase is described as simple and readable, but the implications of the code are complex. There is a fear that C++ is brittle and one change could bring down the entire system, which has hindered documentation and globally searched replacements for obscure names of important items. Reviewing changes for accidentally or maliciously added exploits takes time and effort, emphasizing the need to intentionally write code so that it can be easily understood by others. However, the difficulty with C++ is that things are designed to be hidden, making readability hard to attain. A developer has proposed writing an RFC document to help newcomers understand the complexities of Bitcoin, but there are concerns about doing so due to the consensus nature of the currency. The current information available on Bitcoin is incomplete and difficult to decipher for those without prior knowledge. While the reference client's code is simpler and easier to read than OpenSSL's source-code, expressing ideas in the code is still difficult due to C++. Understanding what the code does is much easier than understanding what the effect of the code is on the system as a whole.</summary>
