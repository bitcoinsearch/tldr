    <summary>On October 31, 2013, slush revealed that with the help of Timo Hanke, he developed a method to prove that the seed generated by Trezor was created using computer-provided entropy and device-provided entropy, making the device blackbox-testable and fully deterministic. This is crucial as seed generation is currently the only operation which uses any source of RNG. A user named Peter commended this move, saying that it made him more confident in Trezor's security and that purchasing the device was money well spent.</summary>
