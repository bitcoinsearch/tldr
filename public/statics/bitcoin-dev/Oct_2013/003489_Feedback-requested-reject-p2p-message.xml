    <summary>In this context, Mike Hearn is discussing the possibility of using a separate code for "block is from the future" in order to prevent people from using nVersion field for nonsense. Peter Todd suggests that rejecting blocks with unexpected nVersions would prevent them from using nVersion as a soft-forking mechanism. However, he notes that it's not going far enough and that rejecting blocks with nVersions that are not expected results in a hard fork. The context ends with a PGP signature.</summary>
