    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, raised concerns about the practice of rebasing pull-requests over and over again until they are accepted, which can result in earlier code reviews becoming irrelevant. Bitcoin is a high-profile and high-profit target for attackers looking to introduce malicious code into the codebase. Todd referenced a 2003 example of an attempt to backdoor the Linux kernel, where a single missing character was overlooked by reviewers. Though compromising a Bitcoin implementation may not be as easy, it seems only a matter of time until there's an attempt at it. The discussion on code review continues with interest.</summary>
