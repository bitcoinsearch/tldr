    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin protocol, Peter Todd emphasized that the reference implementation should be considered as the real specification, and the "specification" on the Wiki is more like a set of notes. He mentions that people who are familiar with source code do not use the Wiki much. However, he believes that the openness and transparency of the protocol is essential to trusting the system and should be well-documented. Todd agrees that alternate implementations are likely inevitable and that accurately describing the rules should carry a strong notice about it being descriptive rather than normative. He offers his help to anyone willing to work on that.</summary>
