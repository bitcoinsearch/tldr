    <summary>In an email exchange from October 25, 2013, Gavin Andresen discussed the potential for out-of-band (OOB) fee payments to disrupt fee estimation code. He listed several reasons why he believed this wouldn't be a problem. Andresen and Peter Todd also talked about very aggressive mempool expiration, where transactions would expire after as little as one or two blocks if they weren't mined, and the need for a way to modify fees and rebroadcast transactions. Todd had already written relaying/mempool code for transaction replacement and replace-by-fee, but wallet code was the hard part that he hadn't done. They discussed how wallets would have to handle double-spends gracefully to make transaction replacement user-friendly. Password-using wallets could sign multiple versions of a transaction in advance and release the higher fee versions only later if needed.</summary>
