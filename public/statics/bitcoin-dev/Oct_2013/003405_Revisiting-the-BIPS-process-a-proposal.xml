    <summary>The email thread discusses the need for a well-written, comprehensive Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) document. Martin Sustrik suggests that a well-written Request For Comments (RFC)-style document might be helpful. Jeff Garzik suggests a distributed approach to editing BIPs that would avoid processes that might discourage their creation. Gregory Maxwell warns against using the incomplete information found in the Bitcoin wiki for this purpose. Meanwhile, Intel is hosting webinars on "Code for Performance". The email was sent by Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay.</summary>
