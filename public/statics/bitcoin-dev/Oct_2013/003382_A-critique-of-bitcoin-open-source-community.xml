    <summary>In a discussion thread between Martin Sustrik and Jean-Paul Kogelman, the latter proposed organizing a list into subdirectories that correspond to the status of BIP 1 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The proposed subdirectories include Accepted, Active, Draft, Deferred, Final, Rejected, Replaced, and Withdrawn. Martin suggested considering using IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) for this process, noting their extensive experience in handling over 7000 RFCs through a hardened process developed over 40 years. No further information or follow-up was provided in the context.</summary>
