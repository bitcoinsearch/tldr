    <summary>The author expresses dissatisfaction with Gmail and transitions to discussing the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. They note that not all drafts will make it to BIPS status, but this is normal and healthy. The author then volunteers as the BIPS editor and suggests having backups in case of emergencies. The backups should include core developers as well as individuals not associated with Satoshi-client development, such as Andreas, Michael G, and Alan R. The author's name is Jeff Garzik, and he works at BitPay as a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist.</summary>
