    <summary>A proposal for a superior system to the one being proposed in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP39) was suggested by Pieter a year ago. The scheme has built-in configurable difficulty and checksums, so the word set being used doesn't need to function for checking anymore. Any dictionary/language/text generator can be used and fed into the system, as the software on the other side doesn't need to use the same dictionary. However, it cannot encode arbitrary data, but it does have some theoretical advantages. Slush, in response to community comments, made changes to the BIP39 wordlist, removing many theoretically offensive words and implementing an algorithm for detecting words with similar characters. He also added password protection of seed and seed hardening (against bruteforcing) using Rijndael cipher. Additionally, he mentioned the possibility of plausible deniability allowing users to have one mnemonic and generate different BIP32 wallets using different passwords. Pavol Rusnak replaced around 67 words that can be found offensive in some context.</summary>
