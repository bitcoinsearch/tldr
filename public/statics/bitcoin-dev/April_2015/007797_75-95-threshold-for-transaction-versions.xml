    <summary>In an email exchange, s7r and Pieter Wuille discuss the issue of transaction malleability in Bitcoin. S7r mentions his intention to build a Bitcoin contract that depends on non-malleable transactions through coinjoin, pre-signed transactions with nLockTime, and Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH). He expresses confusion about who has the ability to alter a txid without invalidating the transaction and whether the three pieces of the Bitcoin protocol he mentioned will be supported in any future transaction or block version. Pieter responds by asking what problem s7r is trying to solve, as BIP62's opt-in approach to protecting v1 transactions from malleability means that every wallet software would need to be changed if v3 transactions were forced. Ultimately, s7r acknowledges that his suggestion may only complicate things and that there might be a very good reason why BIP62 does not touch v1 anyway.</summary>
