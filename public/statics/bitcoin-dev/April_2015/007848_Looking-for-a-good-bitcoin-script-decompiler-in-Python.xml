    <summary>The sender of an email in the Bitcoin-development mailing list on April 29, 2015, asked for recommendations for a Python script that could take the hash of the locking and unlocking tx scripts and output the actual op codes. The email did not provide any context for why this was needed. However, the founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc., Richard Moore, responded to the email providing a link to his library, pycoind, which he believed might be useful for the request. The library can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/ricmoo/pycoind. Moore also provided an example of how to use the library, which involved importing pycoind and using the Tokenizer function. The example outputted the op codes for a given hex string. Lastly, the email included an advertisement for server and application monitoring software.</summary>
