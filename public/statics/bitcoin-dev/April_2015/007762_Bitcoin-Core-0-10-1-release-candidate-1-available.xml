    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.10.1rc1 is now available for testing via binaries or source code. This release candidate contains bug fixes and translation updates, with release candidates being test runs for releases. Users can report bugs through Github's issue tracker. Those running older versions of Bitcoin Core should shut down their current version prior to upgrading. Additionally, it is important to note that the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software. While this does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility, those who want to downgrade smoothly should make a backup of their entire data directory. There are no notable changes in this minor release, but notable changes in version 0.10 can be found in the release notes on Github. The release includes various updates including RPC, network code, validation, build system, GUI, tests and miscellaneous items. The credits go out to everyone who contributed to this release.</summary>
