    <summary>In this email conversation, Kalle Rosenbaum explains that Proof of Payment is used to prove credentials for a certain transaction, regardless of where it is in the blockchain. The conversation then moves on to discuss various use cases, including authorized pickup and contingent services, which highlight the power of reusing the transaction data structure. Additionally, there is discussion around the possibility of using Proof of Payment to prove that a transaction could be created, beyond actual payments. However, there are concerns around security issues with 0-confirmation transactions and potential interception of PoPs. Suggestions are made to make proofs permanently invalid transactions to remove such risks. Finally, Kalle agrees that Proof of Payment seems complementary to BIP70.</summary>
