    <summary>Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, responded to a question regarding slow transaction verification speed. He explained that slower propagation across the network would occur, node workloads would increase, and there would be greater opportunities for algorithmic attacks, races and other shenanigans by attackers. Peter Todd, another Bitcoin core developer, suggested that part of the soft-fork could be to make the hash operations in the new CHECKSIG mechanism consume sigops. He also proposed a more general mechanism with easy to test modular opcodes that would result in a much easier and simpler to test CHECKSIG facility than a dozen new flags.</summary>
