    <summary>In this email exchange, Martin and Kalle discuss the idea of standardized proof of payment (PoP), including a protocol for requesting/sending them as an extension of BIP-70. Martin suggests adding other identifying information than a txid and proposes using a prefix that determines how the rest of the records should be interpreted. Kalle agrees with the suggestion of having a POP_TYPE field in which 0x01 is used for the "standard" version, which would mean that the payload contains a txid. They also discussed the length of the POP_NONCE field and Kalle suggests that if they drop POP_PREFIX, they could allow for 2 bytes version and 6 bytes nonce or 1 byte version and 7 bytes nonce. In addition, Martin informs Kalle that the 40-byte limitation on OP_RETURN's "data" will be increased to 80 bytes. The two agree that with versioning, the format of PoPs may change in the future.</summary>
