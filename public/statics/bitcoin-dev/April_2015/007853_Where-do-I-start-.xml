    <summary>If you're looking to learn Java while also learning about Bitcoin, the github page for bitcoinj may be a good place to start. Additionally, there is an android bitcoin wallet based on bitcoinj that could be useful. The getting started page on the bitcoinj github provides further information. Other potentially useful links include those to bitcoin.org's pages on bitcoin for developers and developer documentation. In response to a question from a beginner on how to understand the Bitcoin protocol and become a good developer, suggestions were made to improve tests or documentation while reading code, but ultimately what to work on depends on personal interests. While some of the highest priority tasks in Bitcoin Core are complicated, there are other more straightforward projects available, particularly those involving wallet apps.</summary>
