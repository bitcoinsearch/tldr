    <summary>In an email thread from 2015, Adrian Macneil discussed with Coinbase the impact of the then recently-proposed Replace-by-Fee (RBF) protocol and its potential to make it difficult to pitch Bitcoin as a viable alternative to credit card payments to large merchants. Macneil asked several questions of Coinbase, including whether they were contractually obliged to accept zeroconf transactions with existing customers, what their double-spend losses to date had been, and what their short, medium, and long-term plans were to move away from dependency on "first-seen" mempool policy. There were also questions about what Coinbase would do if a mining pool adopted RBF or broke zeroconf, and whether they would take legal action against such a pool.</summary>
