    <summary>Joseph Poon, a Bitcoin Core developer, discussed the current problems with the SIGHASH_NORMALIZED_TXID and how it would be implemented in the Lightning Network on April 26th, 2015. SIGHASH_NORMALIZED_TXID does not permit chained transactions two levels deep, which is necessary for Lightning as well. Poon suggested that a functional SIGHASH_NORMALIZED which permits chained transactions requires the parent transaction's sigScript AND txid to be stripped when determining the parent's normalized txid. SIGHASH_NORMALIZED creates significant complexities with the need for an additional hash with every UTXO, almost doubling the UTXO set size, and with nodes which already have UTXO pruning enabled, it'll require downloading the entire blockchain. It was suggested to keep P3SH conservative and use script versions within P3SH to enable future soft-forks.</summary>
