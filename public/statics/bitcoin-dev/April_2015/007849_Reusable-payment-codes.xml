    <summary>The proposal is to have a 1:1 relationship between a payment code owner and their identity. The payment code will be strongly tied to the identity, making the notification address strongly tied to the user. An SPV client connecting to a full node with a list of notification addresses can tie an identity to a bloom filter and connecting IP. To provide for alternate methods of notification in addition to notification transactions, the sender is freed from constantly monitoring an address known to be associated with their identity although they should check it periodically since not all senders are capable of using every type of alternate notification method. The proposal defines Bitmessage notification as an example; more can be added if required. The details of the proposal can be found at https://github.com/justusranvier/rfc/blob/payment_code/bips/bip-pc01.mediawiki.</summary>
