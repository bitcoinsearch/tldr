    <summary>A potential Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) called "Multi-Currency Hierarchy For Use In Multisignature Deterministic Wallets" has been submitted for discussion. The proposal seeks to create a new hierarchical structure for multi-currency wallets based on multisig. The motivation section of the proposal is slightly amended for clarification, although William Swanson suggests the inclusion of a "cosigner_index" branch similar to BIP-0045, which Kefkius should consider for the multisignature use-case. Jona agrees that it is an appropriate proposal given BIP-0044's description of a multi-currency hierarchy; however, he disagrees that this idea improves Bitcoin and therefore questions if it is suitable as a BIP. William also questions whether this proposal offers any advantages over BIP-44's existing hierarchical structure, but concedes there may be a need for more explanation in the motivation section.</summary>
