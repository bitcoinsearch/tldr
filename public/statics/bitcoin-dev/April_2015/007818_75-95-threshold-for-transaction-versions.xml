    <summary>In this context, Stephen suggests a solution to the issue of transaction malleability. He prefers a proposal that completely solves the problem with a simple and obvious change, as opposed to the BIP 62 approach which is more like a game of wac-a-mole. However, he notes that the two proposals are complementary rather than competing. While BIP 62 prevents non-signers from mutating transactions, the 'Build your own nHashType' proposal enables chained transactions even in the face of signers mutating the transaction. Stephen believes that integrating both proposals will provide the best defense against transaction malleability and enable more complicated uses of chained transactions such as micropayment channels.</summary>
