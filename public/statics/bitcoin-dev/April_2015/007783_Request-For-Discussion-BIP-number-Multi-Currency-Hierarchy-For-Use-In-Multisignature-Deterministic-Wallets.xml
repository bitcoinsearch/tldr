    <summary>In this email exchange, William is discussing the scheme proposed by Alan for multi-signature wallets. William seems to like BIP45's approach of giving each field its own dedicated purpose and asks about the motivation behind flattening the hierarchy in Alan's scheme. He is curious because his company, Airbitz, will be adding multi-sig at some point in the future and they need to figure out what kind of HD tree structure they will be using. He suggests that their ideal structure would be BIP44 plus some no-collision logic. If Kefkius adds similar no-collision logic, his proposal is pretty close to their ideal. Alan responds by stating that he had originally proposed a "no-collision" scheme for multi-signature wallets, which doesn't require modifying the key tree structure at all, except for adding new internal and external chains (2*N chains). All siblings watch all chains, but only generate receiving and change addresses on their two chains. He provides a link to the original document which might be educational for understanding precisely the problem that needs a solution. Alan prefers not adding even more levels to the key tree and suggests that it makes more sense to add more chains to the wallet instead of adding a new tree level.</summary>
