    <summary>A potential Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been suggested by Kefkius, "Multi-Currency Hierarchy For Use In Multisignature Deterministic Wallets." The proposal has been uploaded to Github for discussion and the possibility of assignment of a BIP number. William Swanson has questioned the benefits of the proposal and suggests that BIP 44 should be used instead. Swanson proposes that the same wallet would be used in each supported currency, and that it is not clear how the new proposal is an improvement over BIP 44. Jona questions whether the proposal is relevant for a BIP since its purpose is to improve altcoin usability rather than Bitcoin.</summary>
