    <summary>The proposed schedule for the release of version 0.11 has been shared with the community, with a deadline of May 1st set for soft translation string freeze, opening Transifex translations for 0.11 and finalizing and closing translation for 0.9. The feature and string freeze will take place on May 15th, with the split off of the 0.11 branch, tag and release of 0.11.0rc1 and start merging for 0.12 on master branch scheduled for June 1st. The aim is to release 0.11.0 final on July 1st. The intention is to be more strict about the dates, although last-minute critical issues could interfere with the planning. The release will not be held up for features, though, and anything that does not make it to 0.11 will be postponed to the next release scheduled for the end of the year.</summary>
