    <summary>A new type of Bitcoin address called a "payment code" has been proposed in an RFC available at the provided link. Payment codes are considered SPV-friendly alternatives to DarkWallet-style stealth addresses and offer features such as positively identifying senders to recipients and providing for transaction refunds automatically. Additionally, payment codes can be publicly advertised and associated with a real-life identity without causing a loss of financial privacy. Compared to stealth addresses, payment codes require less blockchain data storage, requiring only 65 bytes of OP_RETURN data per sender-recipient pair versus 40 bytes per transaction for stealth addresses.</summary>
