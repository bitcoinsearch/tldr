    <summary>In an email exchange dated April 27, 2015, Peter Todd discussed edge cases in a multisig environment where any of the key holders can mutate transactions. He suggests adding requirements for RFC6979 signatures to mitigate this issue. However, multiple signers can still mutate transaction by choosing a different set (but not the order) of signatures or when a single signer has multiple participating keys. Todd also raises concerns about mutation by non-signers and asks if there are any edge cases not covered by BIP62 that could lead to non-signer mutations. He suggests a more robust approach than "whack-a-mole" to work around mutability, such as using normalized tx ids.</summary>
