    <summary>In this context, the discussion revolves around the use of x co-ordinate instead of hash of the secret while computing Diffie Hellman secret as an alternative to DarkWallet-style stealth addresses. The author suggests that using the x value directly avoids the need for a check to make sure that the hash is valid for secp256k1. The link shared in the email contains an RFC for a new type of Bitcoin address called a "payment code", which provides useful features such as positively identifying senders to recipients and automatically providing for transaction refunds. Payment codes can be publicly advertised and associated with a real-life identity without causing a loss of financial privacy. Compared to stealth addresses, payment codes require less blockchain data storage, requiring 65 bytes of OP_RETURN data per sender-recipient pair, while stealth addresses require 40 bytes per transaction.</summary>
