    <summary>In this message, Mike Hearn discusses the concept of identity in relation to payment codes. He explains that these codes are not linked to government or real name identities, but they may eventually become associated with them by businesses who collect that kind of information from customers. Hearn argues that this mapping should be limited to the application layer rather than the blockchain/network layer, as it would provide resistance to graph analysis and make transaction-level censorship more difficult. The message includes a PGP signature and a non-text attachment containing public key information.</summary>
