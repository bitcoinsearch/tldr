    <summary>The email conversation discusses the idea of adding a consensus rule for transaction versions in Bitcoin. The proposed rule would mark previous transaction versions as non-standard or invalid if at least 75% or 95% of the latest 1000 blocks contain a certain version. Currently, there is no enforcement related to transaction versions in the network. BIP62 adds a newer optional transaction version but does not mark previous v1 versions as non-standard or invalid. This means bitcoin core treats both v1 and v2/v3 transactions as standard and relays/mines them with the same priority, regardless of the tx version. The discussion also touches on the possibility of skipping version 2 and jumping directly to version 3 for transactions and blocks. The link provided leads to a Bitcoin StackExchange post about BIP62 and its implementation status.</summary>
