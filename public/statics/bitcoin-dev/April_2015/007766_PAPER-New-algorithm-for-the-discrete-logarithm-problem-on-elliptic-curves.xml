    <summary>On April 7, 2015, Jean-Paul Kogelman sent an email stating that it was a false alarm and apologized for spamming. Prior to this, on the same day, Gregory Maxwell had shared a link about a new algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem in Bitcoin-related discussion on Reddit. However, the situation turned out to be "easy" and no further information was given regarding the false alarm. In addition to this, an email signature promoting BPM Camp, a free virtual workshop to learn process modeling best practices with Bonita BPM through live exercises, was included at the end of the email thread. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge.</summary>
