    <summary>The email conversation between s7r and Pieter Wuille discusses the issue of malleable transactions on the Bitcoin network. s7r is trying to build a Bitcoin contract that relies on coinjoin, pre-signed transactions with nLockTime, and P2SH. However, he is concerned about the malleability of transactions on the network and who can alter a txid without invalidating the transaction. He also asks whether these three pieces of the Bitcoin protocol will be supported in any future transaction version or block version, regardless of changes made to Bitcoin core. Pieter Wuille explains that BIP62 does not make v1 transactions invalid because it is opt-in, and forcing v3 transactions would require every piece of wallet software to be changed.</summary>
