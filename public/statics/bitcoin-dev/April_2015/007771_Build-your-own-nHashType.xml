    <summary>A proposal has been made to allow a transaction signer to explicitly specify what is to be serialized for the signature hash. The aim of this proposal is to make nHashType general enough so that new sighash flags won't be needed every time a new use case arises. If implemented into Bitcoin via a soft fork, malleability would almost become a non-issue and hardware wallets could sign securely without having to download or process each transaction it spends from. This proposal can be found on Github at https://github.com/scmorse/bitcoin-misc/blob/master/sighash_proposal.md and feedback on it is welcome.</summary>
