    <summary>In an email dated April 28, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan proposed a schedule for the release of version 0.11, with a soft translation string freeze on May 1, a feature and string freeze on May 15, and the aim of releasing version 0.11.0 final on July 1. The email also stated that the release would not be held up for features, but instead postponed to the next release scheduled for the end of the year. In another email, the author pointed out that the soonest we'll see CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY implemented on Bitcoin will be around summer 2016 because it was already adopted on Viacoin and a few other alts whose names they forget. The author suggested that the shortest path to adoption would be to release a v0.12 with just a CLTV soft-fork as soon as the BIP66 softfork triggers. The main reason to accelerate CLTV, according to the author, is scalability. Payment channel schemes can start off with Jeremy Spilman's scheme first and go to CLTV later, but that is a lot of extra code to be written and later depreciated.</summary>
