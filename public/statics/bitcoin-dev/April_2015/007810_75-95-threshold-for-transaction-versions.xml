    <summary>In an email thread, a proposal was made to address transaction malleability in Bitcoin. The approach involves signing the transaction in such a way that input txids can change without invalidating signatures. This would make it easier to adjust and re-broadcast transactions in case of malleability. The proposal is available on Github, and discussion on the topic can be found in the "Build your own nHashType" thread on the mailing list. The author of the email personally prefers this solution over the BIP 62 approach as it completely solves the problem with one simple change, unlike the latter which is likened to a game of whac-a-mole.</summary>
