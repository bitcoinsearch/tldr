    <summary>Alan proposed a "no-collision" scheme for multi-signature wallets, which does not require modifying the key tree structure. He suggests adding 2*N chains to the wallet to generate receiving and change addresses on their two chains. The original document can be found here. William Swanson explained that the "cosigner_index" branch in BIP-0045 solves a problem when two people sharing a multi-sig wallet want to accept payment from different sources but generate the same address. Cosigner_index ensures that they always use a different value for the cosigner_index, adding privacy without any cost. XPUB's generated from the wallet would then be compatible with XPUB's generated by other multi-sig wallets like CoPay, since the (cosigner_index / change / address_index) structure stays the same.</summary>
