    <summary>William Swanson responded to a potential BIP proposed by Kefkius called "Multi-Currency Hierarchy For Use In Multisignature Deterministic Wallets" and questioned its necessity. Swanson argued that the existing BIP 44 hierarchy could be used with additional conventions to support multiple currencies. Additionally, he claimed that Kefkius' proposal did not address the multisignature use-case and lacked clear motivation. Kefkius requested further discussion on the topic and provided a link to the proposal on github. The email exchange was posted in a Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
