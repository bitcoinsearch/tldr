    <summary>In an email thread, Jorge Timón proposed a new softfork rule to enforce setting the nHeight of CTxIn to the correct height in which its corresponding prevout got into the chain. This would eliminate the need for the TxOutputGetter parameter in bitcoinconsensus_verify_script. However, Timón noted that the proposed rule is not reorg safe and has "other ugly implementation details." Later in the thread, Peter Todd suggested implementing CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) as-is in a soft-fork, citing its simplicity and easy-to-audit implementation. Todd also mentioned that Pieter Wuille has been working on a new way to handle soft-fork upgrades in the block nVersion field, so this would be a good opportunity to test the mechanism while ensuring that another version bit is not burned.</summary>
