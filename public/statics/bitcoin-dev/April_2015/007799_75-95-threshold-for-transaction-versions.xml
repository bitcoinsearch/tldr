    <summary>A user on the Bitcoin-development mailing list raised a concern about the malleability of transactions, expressing uncertainty about who can alter a txid and whether this can be done easily. The user also sought clarification on whether certain features of the Bitcoin protocol - namely, multi-user coinjoin/txes, pre-signed txes with nLockTime, and P2SH - will be supported in any future transaction version or block version, regardless of changes made to the Bitcoin Core. Another user responded, suggesting that making all transactions non-malleable by default would not necessarily fix anything and might only complicate things, and explaining that the reason why BIP62 does not make v1 transactions invalid is because it is opt-in. The creator of a transaction must agree to protect it from malleability, subjecting him to extra rules in the creation. Forcing v3 transactions would require every piece of wallet software to be changed.</summary>
