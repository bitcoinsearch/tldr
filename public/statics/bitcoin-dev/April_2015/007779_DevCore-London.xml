    <summary>On April 15th, Gavin, Wladimir, Corey, and an unnamed individual will be attending DevCore London. The event is open to the public and takes place at etc.venues St Paul's. In the afternoon, the unnamed individual will be running a hackathon/workshop event with a focus on contracts but is open to other topics as well. Additionally, they will be doing a live coding event, demonstrating how to write a decentralized cross-platform Tor supporting document timestamping app that uses OP_RETURN outputs and has a nice GUI in just 30 minutes on stage. This event aims to prove how writing contract apps has become much easier in recent years. Overall, this event promises to be more than just a talking shop for real developers.</summary>
