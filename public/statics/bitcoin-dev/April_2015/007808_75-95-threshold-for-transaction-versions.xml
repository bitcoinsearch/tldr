    <summary>The email thread starts with Jorge Timón suggesting a video explaining the aspects of malleability to s7r. S7r then asks how far they are from BIP62 and if non-malleable tx can be sent by enforcing additional rules. S7r also mentions about building a bitcoin contract that relies on coinjoin, pre-signed txes with nLockTime and P2SH. S7r is concerned about whether these three pieces of the bitcoin protocol will be supported in any future transaction version or block version regardless of changes made to bitcoin core. Pieter Wuille explains that anyone can alter the txid without invalidating it, without mining power and without access to the sender's private keys. After BIP62, senders will optionally be able to protect others from malleation.</summary>
