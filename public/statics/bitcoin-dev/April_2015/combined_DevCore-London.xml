    <summary>A group of developers including Gavin, Wladimir, Corey and an unnamed individual will be attending DevCore London on April 15th at etc.venues St Paul's. The event is open to the public and promises to be more than just a talking shop for real developers. In the afternoon, the unnamed individual will be running a hackathon/workshop event with a focus on contracts but also open to other topics. They will also conduct a live coding event, demonstrating how to write a decentralized cross-platform Tor supporting document timestamping app that uses OP_RETURN outputs and has a nice GUI in just 30 minutes on stage. This event aims to prove how writing contract apps has become much easier in recent years.Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer, has announced that the tutorial talk he gave at DevCore 2015 on "How to build a timestamping smart contracts app in 30 minutes" is now available on the website. The tutorial covers various aspects such as customizing the wallet-template app, constructing a complex multi-stage SPV proof of blockchain inclusion, saving and verifying proof files, binding transaction confidence state to the user interface, and creating a Mac DMG bundle with a custom icon. Hearn will also be present at DevCore London, where he will conduct a live coding event to create a decentralized cross-platform Tor supporting document timestamping app using OP_RETURN outputs and has a nice GUI in just 30 minutes on stage.</summary>
