    <summary>The email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Justus Ranvier discusses the proposal for a notification transaction that sends the same payment code to every recipient, while obscuring the identity of the sender from third party blockchain observers. The shared secret is used to achieve this, and the sender's public key used for ECDH can't be one derived from the payment code since the recipient doesn't yet know the payment code. The notification transaction needs to communicate the 65 byte payment code along with one ephemeral public key used for ECDH. The proposal optimizes for non-reliance on third party services. Exchanges could restrict bitcoin withdrawals to a single payment code known to be associated with their identified customer in some jurisdictions where proving withdrawals are sent to a positively-identified party might move Bitcoin businesses out of money transmitter territory into less onerous regulatory situations. However, this mandates horrible key management practices and care should be taken that a tortured dance for confused regulatory cargo-cult reasons doesn't mandate people not engage in sound practices like periodic key rotation.</summary>
