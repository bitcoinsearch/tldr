    <summary>In an email thread, a user named "s7r" asked about marking previous transaction versions as non-standard or invalid based on the percentage of recent transactions using version 'n'. The purpose of this proposal is to address malleability, which is when a third party can modify a transaction without changing its effect. While BIP62 does not currently make v1 transactions invalid, it requires creators to opt-in to protect against malleability and follow extra rules. Forcing v3 transactions would require significant changes to wallet software.</summary>
