    <summary>In an email exchange, Kefkius shares his thoughts on a proposal and expresses confusion over the benefits of a "cosigner_index" branch. The proposal involves a multi-sig wallet that allows separate payment addresses for different parties without mixing incoming funds or revealing any relationships between the parties. However, in cases where parties cannot communicate, the cosigner_index solves this problem by ensuring that Alice and Bob agree to always use a different value for the cosigner_index, thereby adding privacy at no additional cost. This structure allows XPUB's generated from the wallet to remain compatible with XPUB's generated by other multi-sig wallets like CoPay since the (cosigner_index / change / address_index) structure remains consistent.</summary>
