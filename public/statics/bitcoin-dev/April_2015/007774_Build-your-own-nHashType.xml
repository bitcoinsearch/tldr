    <summary>In a conversation between Mike and Stephen, they discuss the proposal of changing sighash flags for Bitcoin transactions. Stephen suggests that some flags may not make sense and that eliminating them would reduce the total number to 17. He also expresses concern about the potential danger of some combinations, such as creating a blank cheque that could be used by anyone if not signed properly. However, he believes that with good documentation and careful thought, developers can use the standard set of sighash flag combinations for their standard use cases. The conversation then shifts to the need for a change in sighash calculation to prevent hashing data repeatedly without a good reason. Stephen states that it is hard because different data needs to be signed for each input. He suggests signing inputs with SIGHASH_WITHOUT_PREV_SCRIPTPUBKEY, SIGHASH_WITHOUT_PREV_VALUE, and the equivalent of SIGHASH_ALL to obtain the same hash for all inputs. Another possibility would be to put the previous scriptPubKey and output value at the end of the serialized transaction. However, it seems messy. They also discuss whether hashing transaction data once for each input is a significant bottleneck, particularly for mobile devices.</summary>
