    <summary>The first article discusses the concept of time in relation to block header hashes, temperature, and entropy. Miners of Bitcoin act similarly to Maxwell's Demon by rejecting candidate blocks whose block header hashes are not "cold enough" and only allowing "cold" block headers to be broadcast over the blockchain. The article also talks about the idea of a Cryptographic Relay as a device trusted to do what it claims to do. It suggests that by making a generic component, we can dispose of the blockchain and implement an unforgeable proof-of-time-passing. Furthermore, the author argues against blockchain proliferation due to their massive bandwidth consumption. Instead, it advocates for the standardization of Cryptographic Relays and encourages multiple manufacturers to follow the same standard. It also proposes the practical deployment of Cryptographic Relays for smart devices that can recognize their owner and be used only by the owner and its delegated operators.On the other hand, the second context talks about an illegal activity related to stealing and hotwiring an electric car. The author mentions that they can easily hotwire the car by connecting the battery pack, inverter, motor, and ignition. After stealing the car and taking it to their own location, they can splice wires across the cryptographic relays of other components at their leisure. However, it is important to note that such activities are highly illegal and should not be encouraged. It is important for individuals to follow ethical and legal practices while driving or dealing with cars.</summary>
