    <title>Hiding CoinSwap Makers Among Custodial Services</title>

    <summary>In an email exchange, ZmnSCPxj and Chris discussed the potential benefits of using batching in CoinSwap operations. By slowing down the process, CoinSwappers could pretend to be a service provider and improve privacy. Additionally, by taking longer, takers could save on miner fees. However, ZmnSCPxj realized later that the same kind of batching could also be done by the taker. By contacting two makers in parallel, each CoinSwap operation would look like an ordinary pay-to-someone-and-get-back-change transaction. This method could potentially provide extra privacy and reduced cost for the taker, but it is uncertain how effective it would be.</summary>
