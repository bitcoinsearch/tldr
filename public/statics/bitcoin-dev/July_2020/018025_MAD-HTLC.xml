    <summary>The email exchange between ZmnSCPxj and Tejaswi Peesapati centers around the vulnerability of off-chain multiparticipant cryptocurrency systems to a bribe attack, as described in the MAD-HTLC paper. The authors suggest using a gradual scorched-earth policy to mitigate this attack, gradually increasing fees until the transaction confirms while retaining the default `to_self_delay` of 144. However, they admit that they ignored the base fee in their calculations, which could be much lower than the typical 1% channel balance.The authors clarify that the MAD-HTLC argument applies not only to HTLCs but also to all current off-chain channel mechanisms, making these systems vulnerable to the attack even if HTLCs are not used. ZmnSCPxj goes on to describe the Spilman channel, a unidirectional single-funded channel, which uses a SegWit-based malleation-safe version of the original idea presented pre-SegWit.The article discusses the MAD-HTLC argument, which is used to bribe miners into publishing old states of Lightning Networks. The article then goes on to detail three different mechanisms that use timelocks: Poon-Dryja channels, Decker-Wattenhofer decrementing-`nSequence`, and Decker-Russell-Osuntokun. These mechanisms are analyzed in detail, with a focus on their security and how they can be affected by the MAD-HTLC argument.The article concludes by emphasizing the need for further investigation into the MAD-HTLC argument and its potential impact on these mechanisms, as well as future proposed mechanisms such as sidechains. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of understanding the vulnerabilities of off-chain cryptocurrency systems and implementing robust security measures to protect against attacks.</summary>
