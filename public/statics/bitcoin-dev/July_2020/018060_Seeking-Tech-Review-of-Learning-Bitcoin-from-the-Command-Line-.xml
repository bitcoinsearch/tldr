    <summary>Blockchain Commons has requested assistance from Bitcoin experts to review and provide feedback on their popular course, Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line, which provides an intermediate level of understanding between introductory courses and more intense workshops. The course teaches fundamental RPC commands for interacting with Bitcoin Core using bitcoin-cli command line and other programming languages via RPC. Blockchain Commons has updated the course with new sections on descriptors, Segwit, P2WPKH, Segwit Scripting, PSBTs, HWI, and Tor. They are seeking fact-checking, comments, corrections, and financial support through Github sponsorship starting at $20/month or one-time Bitcoin contributions directly at their BTCPay server.</summary>
