    <summary>In an email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and another individual, the topic of timelocked bribes was discussed. The conversation centered around the idea that wherever watchtowers are required, a timelocked bribe might be possible. However, the other individual proposed a better heuristic: if the logic of the construction assumes "transaction with earlier locktime supersedes transaction with later locktime", then it is timelocked-bribery-vulnerable. Despite this difference in opinion, both parties agreed that timelocked bribes are only possible when there are timelocks involved. The conversation ended on a lighthearted note, with one party acknowledging that their initial point was merely an "indirect clue" and not a definitive rule.</summary>
