    <summary>In a recent conversation, Hilda questioned the synchronization of the Bitcoin system, including mempools. While there is no way to limit the number of transactions someone can push at you, heuristics can help with this issue. However, these heuristics can also create desynchronization between mempools, causing potential problems. Thankfully, since the blockchain itself is what is synchronized, it is impossible to spam blocks without doing the work of grinding towards the difficulty target. It is essential to note that consensus rules should only refer to data inside blocks and not in mempools, as mempools are ephemeral and not synchronized across all nodes.</summary>
