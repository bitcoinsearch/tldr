    <summary>The author sent an email to the lightning-dev mailing list apologizing if their questions have already been answered. They are seeking clarification on how the Lightning Network works with regards to HTLCs and settlements on the blockchain. Specifically, they are concerned about losing money if their HTLC does not get confirmed or if an older HTLC gets confirmed first. They outline three potential scenarios where this could happen: if the blockchain is saturated with transactions, if there is competition from a different conflicting HTLC, or if there is a denial of service attack on the lightning router preventing settlement HTLCs from being sent.The author also mentions a recent attack technique called "flood and loot" that may be similar to their concerns. They admit to not fully understanding the Lightning Network but are working to grasp the idea. They ask whether channel factories would be better and eliminate their concerns.The author notes that they cannot see lightning-dev emails as Google Recaptcha blocks them from subscribing. They request that anyone who replies CC them so they can read it.</summary>
