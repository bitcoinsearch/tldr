    <title>BIP 118 and SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT</title>

    <summary>A draft PR has been opened by AJ Towns to update BIP 118 with the ANYPREVOUT bip. It was concluded after discussing with Christina that it made more sense to update the BIP to the latest thinking rather than having a new BIP number. The new BIP text can be found on Github and it does not come with tested code at this point. Some significant changes since previous discussion include complete lack of chaperone signatures or anything like it, and that ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT no longer commits to the value. AJ Towns believes it is better to have the text available for discussion than nothing.</summary>
