    <summary>In a recent proposal circulating on IRC and supported by gmax and roconnor, it is suggested to deploy a BIP8 `lockinontimeout=true` `lockin=+42 months` at the next release. If it is not activated within a year after `starttime`, then discussion will take place to either enforce the BIP8 bit with a reduced-threshold 80% through BIP91 or deploy an abort which disallows transaction outputs with `OP_1` `scriptPubKey`. This proposal aligns with aj's suggestion of deploying a BIP8 `lockinontimeout=true` that ends +42 months after the first countdown, along with an abort that is equivalent to not deploying Taproot after the 6-month discussion period. The advantage of this proposal is that it allows for quick deployment of a simple BIP8 `locktimeontimeout=true`, while continuing debates on various details. This enables users to start deploying it and provides better gauges on how well Taproot is supported.</summary>
