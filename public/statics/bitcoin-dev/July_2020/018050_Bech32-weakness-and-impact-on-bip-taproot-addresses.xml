    <summary>The discussion on amending BIP173 has been ongoing, with Russell O'Connor proposing to restrict "bc" and "tb" segwit address formats to require witness programs be of size 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36, or 40. According to O'Connor, it is sensible to allow the maximum witness program size allowed by BIP 141, which is 40 bytes. However, he suggests excluding witness programs of other sizes, such as shorter ones, from the segwit address format due to their lack of entropy. O'Connor's proposal is in response to Pieter Wuille's point that there is no need to do this right now. In addition, Greg Sanders asked for clarification on the meaning of bold vs not-bold numbers in the context of witness program lengths and address lengths. The proposed witness program length for segwit v1 that corresponds to a taproot (BIP-341) program is also 32 bytes, which needs to be covered in the proposed amendment.</summary>
