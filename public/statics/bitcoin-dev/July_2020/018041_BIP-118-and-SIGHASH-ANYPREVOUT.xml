    <summary>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Anthony Towns referred to a conversation he had with Christina, which led to a response from Christina herself. However, she clarified that her name is actually Christian Decker and jokingly added some other nicknames like "Dr Bitcoin" and "Snyke". The email thread included links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and the Linux Foundation, which hosts the mailing list.</summary>
