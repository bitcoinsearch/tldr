    <summary>Several wallets have been found to be unable to handle the scenario of reverted transactions at zero confirmations. This has resulted in an increased balance being shown to users without decreasing it when a transaction is replaced and also causing users to be unable to spend other valid coins. A new tool, available on Github, allows users to test the behavior of their own wallet and read more about the issue. The tool is called big-spender and is developed by KZen-networks.</summary>
