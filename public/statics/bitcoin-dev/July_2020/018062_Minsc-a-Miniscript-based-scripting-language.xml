    <summary>Minsc is a high-level scripting language for expressing Bitcoin Script spending conditions with a user-friendly syntax. Based on the Miniscript Policy language, Minsc also offers additional features and syntactic sugar such as variables, functions, infix notation, and human-readable times. A live compiler and documentation are available on the website, while the source code can be found on Github. The website also provides example Minsc scripts that showcase its capabilities, including traditional preimage-based HTLC, Liquid-like federated pegin with emergency recovery keys, and 2FA setups. Minsc allows for experimenting with bare policies through its web code editor UI, which includes syntax highlighting, real-time compilation, and error reporting. Feedback is appreciated by the developer, Nadav.</summary>
