    <summary>In an email conversation, Itay Tsabary noted that the required token amount for the collateral contract is low and independent of the required deposit tokens. He states that only a relatively small incentive is required to make "acting honestly" Bob's preferred choice. However, this does create slightly larger transactions with another UTXO. In response, the recipient asked about the size of the collateral and whether it has to be at least the same size as the deposit. The concern was that if Bob had less to lose, he could threaten Alice with an HTLC bribery attack.</summary>
