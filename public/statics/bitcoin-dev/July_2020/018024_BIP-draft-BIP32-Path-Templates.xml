    <summary>The author proposes a standard format for describing constraints on BIP32 paths. The proposal is in the form of a BIP draft that specifies "path templates" for BIP32 paths. These templates allow easy distinction between valid and invalid paths based on their adherence to constraints. The proposal includes examples of such templates, and a formal specification of a finite state machine that implements the parser. A python implementation of template parsing and matching already exists. BIP32 derivation path format is universal and allows the implementation of custom derivation schemes for specific purposes. However, unrestricted usage of derivation paths can be unsafe in certain contexts. The simplistic approach of hard-coding checks for well-known paths into software and firmware leads to reduced interoperability. Therefore, the author proposes a flexible approach of defining standard notation for "BIP32 path templates" that succinctly describes constraints to impose on the derivation path.Wide support for these path templates will increase interoperability and flexibility of solutions, allowing vendors and developers to define their own custom restrictions easily. Having standardized formats for custom path templates will enable a common approach to be developed for the enforcement of application-specific path restrictions in devices and applications. One example of such an approach might involve devices allowing the installation of application-specific profiles with path templates and custom parameters. Care must be taken to prevent accidental installation of malicious or incorrect profiles.</summary>
