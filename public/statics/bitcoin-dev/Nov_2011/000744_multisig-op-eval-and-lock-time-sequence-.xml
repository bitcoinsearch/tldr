    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and M, they discuss the validity of "half" transactions up until the lock_time. They consider adding a constraint that would limit the lock_time to within 30 minutes to avoid incomplete transactions. However, introducing other protocols raises concerns about them not becoming standard. If it is part of the p2p network, it will be easy for everyone to use across different clients. One issue with allowing partially-signed transactions on the main Bitcoin P2P network is that it could lead to spamming bogus transactions. Formats and protocols for gathering signatures are in the TODO category, and Alan's BIP10 is the next piece of the puzzle. A standardized RESTful API, HTTP/JSON, protocol buffers, or raw sockets could be built on top of that.</summary>
