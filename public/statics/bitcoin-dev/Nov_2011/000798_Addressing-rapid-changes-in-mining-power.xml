    <summary>In a conversation between Andy Parkins and Gavin Andresen, the issue of the "I got lucky and found an extremely hard block" problem in Bitcoin was discussed. Gavin explained that Bitcoin's difficulty TARGET is used to compute chain difficulty, not the actual hashes found, so there is no such problem. Andy acknowledged Gavin's point and indicated he had no response to it. However, Joel suggested that setting an upper bound on the difficulty a block is accepted to have could solve the issue, for example by using the median or average of the past 2016 blocks and not valuing any new block for more than maybe 4 times as difficult as that. Despite initially abandoning this suggestion, Andy may reconsider it after Joel's comment.</summary>
