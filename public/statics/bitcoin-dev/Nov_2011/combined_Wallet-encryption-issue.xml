    <summary>The author of the post admits to posting their concerns on the wrong platform, and instead should have posted it on the dev list. The post discusses a potential issue with plaintext private keys that may still be present in some files due to BSDDB sometimes overwriting data by simply discarding a pointer to the old data and writing the replacement in a new location within the file. This would not be detectable by examining the file with a BSDDB library tool. Instead, the raw binary file would need to be examined. The post provides instructions for verifying whether this is a real problem or not. The author also suggests removing the post until a remediation plan is in place, as it is best to disclose such problems after they have been fixed.</summary>
