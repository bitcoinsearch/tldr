    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, Pieter Wuille suggested the possibility of allowing short intervals for multiple-of-2016 blocks instead of fixed values. Luke-Jr reminded that there is already a short interval allowed for blocks in general but only in chains where no timejacking attack is going on. During a timejacking attack, most timestamps are low and only those of multiple-of-2016-blocks correspond to the current time. Therefore, fixing the timestamp to the maximum rather than the median could prevent such time lapses. The updated proposed rule would limit the timestamp of multiple-of-2016-blocks to [max(past 11 timestamps)+1 ... current_time+7200]. This measure is believed to be sufficient in preventing the attack.</summary>
