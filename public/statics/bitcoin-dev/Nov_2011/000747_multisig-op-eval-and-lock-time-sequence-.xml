    <summary>Joel suggested creating a separate peer-to-peer (p2p) network for off-band information instead of involving the blockchain with it. Gavin Andresen added that miners could potentially remove extra scriptSig information before including the transaction in their blocks, but they would still receive the full transaction fee and the block would be accepted by everyone else. Additionally, if a node relaying transactions wanted to save bandwidth costs or cause annoyance, they could strip off the extra information before forwarding it. Therefore, using this method as a reliable communication mechanism is not recommended. Instead, it is better to use another protocol to gather signatures.</summary>
