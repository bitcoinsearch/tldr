    <summary>In a recent conversation, it was revealed that most of the icons with license issues in Bitcoin-Qt have been replaced. However, the ones created by the individual being addressed were intentionally left untouched, with the assumption that they would be willing to relicense them under the MIT or similar license. As such, the speaker is requesting that the individual commit to a license change for these icons, ideally before 0.5.0 final.</summary>
