    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, wrote a post discussing his thoughts on several issues related to the cryptocurrency. He congratulated Wladimir for doing a great job with the new GUI of Bitcoin 0.5 and talked about the embarrassment caused by the wallet encryption bug. Gavin mentioned that he is spending time thinking about how to avoid major bugs slipping into releases and proposed hiring professional QA people to create test plans and execute them.He also expressed interest in finding funding for open source projects and working on BIPs and code cleanup. Furthermore, Gavin outlined some high priority tasks he is planning to work on such as creating a pull request for OP_EVAL/multisignature transactions, back-porting OP_EVAL/multisig to 0.3/0.4 and working on the 'headers-only' branch. Finally, Gavin mentioned that he wants to start doing some internal re-architecting and get back to the cross-platform testing infrastructure tool.In an email, Gavin Andresen asks for someone with experience finding funding for open source projects to help him. He mentions that he would rather focus on coding and technical issues instead of figuring out ways to get more testing resources for the project. Andresen also mentions a non-profit organization forming to handle Bitcoin PR and marketing. The BIP process is working well, with good proposals, and discussions.The email then lists high priority tasks that Andresen is not planning on working on such as implementing BIP 14 and reworking wallet handling. He also lists high priority tasks that he plans on working on, including creating a pull request for OP_EVAL/multisignature transactions and working on the headers-only branch. Lastly, he mentions wanting to start internal re-architecting and getting back to the cross-platform testing infrastructure tool. Andresen concludes by asking anyone attending the conference in Prague to figure out the hard questions and report back.</summary>
