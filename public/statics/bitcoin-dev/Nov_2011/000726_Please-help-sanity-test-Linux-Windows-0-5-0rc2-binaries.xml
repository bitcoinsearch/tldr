    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has removed the bitcoin-0.5.0rc2-linux.tar.gz because it is not sane. He believes that the Qt build needs to be taught to statically link dependencies. Once these issues are fixed, he expects a release candidate 3 to be available for Mac and Linux users. The removal of the file has caused some concern among those in the Bitcoin community, but Andresen remains confident that the necessary changes will be made. The Bitcoin-0.5.0rc2 update was released in May 2011 and contained several significant improvements over its predecessor.</summary>
