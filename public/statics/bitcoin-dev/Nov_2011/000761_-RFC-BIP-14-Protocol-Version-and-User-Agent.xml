    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Amir Taaki on November 12, 2011, they discussed BIP 14, which laid out the protocol version and user agent for Bitcoin. Taaki thanked Gavin Andresen and Patrick Strateman for their contributions to the proposal. Hearn responded that he found the proposal reasonable and would update BitcoinJ accordingly if Gavin changed the mainline client. They also noted that some changes still needed to be made before the next version, 0.6, could be released. The email ends with a promotion for RSA(R) Conference 2012 and a link to register.</summary>
