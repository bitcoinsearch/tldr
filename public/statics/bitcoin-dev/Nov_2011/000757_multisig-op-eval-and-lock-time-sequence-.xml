    <summary>The context discusses Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and their different types, namely "standards track," "informational," and "process." The author argues that a credible standards track BIP cannot be created until it has been implemented end-to-end. Designing technical decisions in isolation can lead to bizarre user experiences that are difficult to reverse. A working implementation provides the confidence to say that this is how it should work, backed by a demo that shows it works well and clean code.The author suggests that informational BIPs may not be useful as they only summarize the author's views on things. It is easier to write an email or forum post instead of creating an informational BIP. However, if someone finds it useful to write their thoughts in the framework of a BIP, it is okay, but implementors should not follow what is written there just because it is a BIP. It does not carry any more weight than any other document would.</summary>
