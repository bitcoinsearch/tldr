    <summary>Currently, there is a delay in the release of version 0.5.0/0.4.1 due to reports of crashes on startup when re-encrypting previously encrypted wallets on Linux64 systems. While the issue hasn't been able to be reproduced on Ubuntu 10.10 server, other users have reported experiencing this problem. Gavin Andresen requests assistance in figuring out the root cause of the issue and whether it's limited to bitcoin-qt or if other Linux variations are affected as well.</summary>
