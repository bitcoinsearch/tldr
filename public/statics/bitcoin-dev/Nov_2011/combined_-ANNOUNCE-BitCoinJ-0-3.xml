    <summary>BitCoinJ, a leading Java implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, has released version 0.3 with many bug fixes, robustness, and test suite improvements. The release includes major optimizations that reduce parsing overhead, new APIs to make writing Bitcoin apps easier and a new PeerGroup API that handles multiple peer connections. BitCoinJ is a widely used library that forms the foundation of various projects like Android Bitcoin Wallet, p2p network status graphs, MultiBit, PoolServerJ and more. To get the library, users can visit their Maven repository or download section of the website. The release would not have been possible without contributions from Steve Coughlan, who contributed many parsing improvements and optimizations, Miron Cuperman, who did significant work on the PeerGroup API, Andreas Schildbach, developer of the Android wallet, reported many bugs and useful suggestions for improvement, while Gary Rowe and Jonny Hegheim set up the continuous build and Maven infrastructure. The next release will focus on fixing bugs and filling out missing features so that projects using the library do not feel the need to patch their local copy. By popular demand, the library will switch from Subversion to git. They plan to introduce a stable wallet format that isn't dependent on Java serialization and timestamp key creation to resolve issues with clients that ship block chain copies. Finally, whatever is contributed by the community will also be included in the next release.</summary>
