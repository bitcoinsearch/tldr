    <summary>A new format for Bitcoin transactions, BIP 0014, was proposed by Amir Taaki in November 2011. The format, which uses a hierarchical structure, was suggested by Patrick Strateman and includes clarifications suggested by Gavin Andresen. Although the timeline is written in the past tense, as BIPs are intended to be readable in the future, it is noted that the next version (0.6) should be the protocol version that becomes peeled off from the current client. There are still some changes migrating into the protocol that need to be completed. If Gavin changes the mainline client to use this format, BitcoinJ will also change, but the API will need some work to ensure clients set it up properly.</summary>
