    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2011, Mike Hearn suggested that BitCoinJ already sets the subversion field to its name and version. In response to this, an individual named Gavin Andresen shared that on BitDroid, he had stopped updating the protocol version at 31700 and set the string to be both Version and Client, just like BitcoinJ. The email thread also included a promotion for the RSA Conference 2012 and a link to register.</summary>
