    <summary>The idea of putting arbitrary content in the scriptSig of a Bitcoin transaction is discussed by Gavin Andresen. However, he raises concerns about this approach as miners could opt to remove the extra information before adding the transaction to their blocks. This would not impact the transaction fee or validation and thus still be accepted by the network. Additionally, nodes relaying transactions could also strip off the extra information resulting in a loss of reliability for communication. In conclusion, it's suggested that another protocol should be used to gather signatures instead of relying on this method.</summary>
