    <summary>Thiago reported to Gavin Andresen that he attempted to reproduce an error by deleting Bitcoin and then opening a newer version. He encrypted his wallet, closed the 0.4.0 version, and opened version 0.5.0rc7, which automatically upgraded the wallet without crashing. Gavin Andresen is seeking help in identifying an issue holding up the final release of versions 0.5.0/0.4.1, which involves crashes on startup when re-encrypting previously encrypted wallets on Linux64 systems. He has tried to reproduce the error on Ubuntu 10.10 server but was successful, so he needs assistance to determine what is causing these crashes. The email also includes a message from Splunk, a software company that makes sense of data generated in IT infrastructure.</summary>
