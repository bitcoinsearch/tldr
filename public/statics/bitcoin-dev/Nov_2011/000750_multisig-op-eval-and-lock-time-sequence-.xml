    <summary>In an email discussion between Alan Reiner and Michael Gronager, the two discussed BIP0010, which was created to encourage a standard that developers want to adopt. The purpose of the BIP is to offer a solution to multi-sig tx exchanges before developers have started asking questions about it. Reiner believes that the problem BIP 0010 seeks to solve is fairly straightforward, and there is not much variety in the solutions that could compete against it. He thinks that BIP 0010 is optimal as a building block for higher-level protocols. However, Gronager is unsure about the introduction of other protocols as they may never be standard. They also discuss the likes and dislikes of the BIP, including the inclusion of prevout txout scripts and the format used. Gronager suggests adding a link to the wiki or removing all bip links from the wiki to avoid having two places for BIPs. He also mentions that although it is good to have this proposal, ways to communicate it might radically steer how a format should look.</summary>
