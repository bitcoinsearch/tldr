    <summary>During the testing of version 0.5.0 in Linux, a user named Martinx noticed strange behavior in which the blockchain stopped downloading at 10% and did not progress even after 30 minutes. Upon closing and reopening the qt-client, the blockchain started again from 0%. The download eventually resumed and reached 15%, but the cause of this issue has yet to be determined. Another user, Michael, also reported experiencing this problem with previous versions. The number of connections using new Bitcoin-QT can be found by hovering over the signal icon in the lower right corner, which displays a tooltip. Fixing this issue would be beneficial for those who are downloading the blockchain for the first time.</summary>
