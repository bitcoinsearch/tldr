    <summary>The email by a tester suggested that it is natural user behaviour to encrypt wallet, backup, perform some activity and then restore the backup which can result in a disaster. Agreeing with this feedback, the writer decided to rework on wallet encrypt/rewrite code and create release candidate 6. In the previous attempt, invalidating keypool, writing new keypool and unlocking resulted in unencrypted private keys. Hence, the writer plans to invalidate old keypool keys, write new keypool keys, encrypt all keys in the old wallet, rewrite the old wallet to create a new wallet and shutdown/restart. The writer also requested for help regarding a mysterious problem with bdb throwing an exception during shutdown.</summary>
