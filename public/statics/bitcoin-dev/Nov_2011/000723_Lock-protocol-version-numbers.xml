    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, there was a discussion about what to call the mainline client independently from the GUI. Amir Taaki suggested calling it the "Satoshi" client as a homage to the person who made the original client reference protocol. However, Luke-Jr pointed out that the "Satoshi client" was the wxWidgets client, which was retired by 0.5. The decision of what to call the client ultimately lies with the maintainers. In addition, the email contained an advertisement for RSA(R) Conference 2012 and a link to register while saving $700 before November 18th.</summary>
