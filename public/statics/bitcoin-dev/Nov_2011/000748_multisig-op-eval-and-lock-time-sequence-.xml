    <summary>The author suggests that requiring direct-connection negotiation is best for most cases, as more complicated schemes are likely to fail. They propose using the IP transactions protocol. In the future, they imagine users of ultra-lightweight clients will connect to a new P2P network built on top of the core Bitcoin network to receive block headers and info about sent/received transactions without leeching off of the few full nodes. This network could also be used for indirect transaction negotiation. Gavin Andresen noted that a nValue=0 transaction can be considered 'immediately spent'. However, the author believes it's possible to spend a 0-value output, so they cannot be considered automatically spent.</summary>
