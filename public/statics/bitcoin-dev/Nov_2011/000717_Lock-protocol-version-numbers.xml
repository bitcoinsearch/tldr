    <summary>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Amir Taaki, they discuss locking protocol version numbers for Bitcoin development. Amir suggests using the sub_version_num field and revision number for individual builds instead of locking them into the popular major.minor system. He argues that different projects would have different release scheduling schemes, and it would be restrictive to lock people into a certain format. Gavin agrees that this is a good idea and suggests creating a BIP for it. The current Bitcoin would have to parse the number from the string "Satoshi 0.5" to find out the version number of other clients if needed. However, there would be little reason for this with a sensible protocol versioning scheme.</summary>
