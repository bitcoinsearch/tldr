    <summary>On November 4, 2011, Gavin Andresen posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list stating that he removed the bitcoin-0.5.0rc2-linux.tar.gz because it was not sane and needed to teach the Qt build to statically link dependencies. He also mentioned that once the Mac and Linux deployment issues are fixed, a release candidate 3 can be expected. Douglas Huff then replied to this post asking about the mac build and mentioned that he had built without any issues on 10.7. The email thread also included a signature.asc file attached to it. Additionally, the post contained a link to register for the RSA(R) Conference 2012 with a discount of $700 if registered by November 18.</summary>
