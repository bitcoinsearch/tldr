    <summary>Alan published BIP 0010 on the wiki to receive feedback on it and improve it. He has also implemented it in his client software and is planning to use TxDPs in offline wallet transactions. However, he acknowledges that no one else is adopting it yet except for himself. Mike Hearn points out that BIPs are either "standards track", "informational" or "process". He advises against designing things in isolation and says that a working implementation gives confidence that the code works well. If the BIP is informational, there is no problem; however, there is not much point in them as it is easier to write an email or forum post summarizing one's views.</summary>
