    <summary>A conversation between Bitcoin developers took place on November 2, 2011, regarding locking the version numbers to be the protocol version and using the sub_version_num field plus revision number for individual builds. Amir Taaki suggested that different projects could have different release scheduling schemes; therefore, it would be restrictive to lock people into the popular major.minor system. Gavin Andresen agreed with Taaki's idea and suggested it was perfect for a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Christian Decker added his support for using sub_version_num as a Client and Version identifier. The discussion resulted in a useless pull request fixing two variables, which can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/63.</summary>
