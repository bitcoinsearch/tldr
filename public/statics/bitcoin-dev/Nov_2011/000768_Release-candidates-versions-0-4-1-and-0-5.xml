    <summary>The context describes a situation where the user starts using Bitcoin version 0.5.0 without a wallet.dat file, which creates 100 new keys that are subsequently encrypted for security and backed up. When the user clicks "new address," the program generates a new batch of addresses instead of using the old 2-100 addresses, which it assumes have been leaked. The user receives funds to their new, second address, which is not backed up, and loses the new wallet. The question posed is whether or not the bitcoins are lost forever. Additionally, Gavin Andresen requests help sanity testing Bitcoin versions 0.4.1 and 0.5.0.</summary>
