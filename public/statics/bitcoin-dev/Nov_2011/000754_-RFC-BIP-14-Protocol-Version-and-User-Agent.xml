    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0014 is a proposal for a hierarchical deterministic wallet structure that allows for multiple addresses to be generated from a single, user-generated seed. The proposal was suggested by Mike Hearn and has undergone proofreading and clarifications by Gavin Andresen with input from Patrick Strateman. BIPs are written in the past tense to serve as a record of decision-making for future historians. Version 0.6 of the protocol is expected to become separated from the current client, but there are still some changes being migrated into the protocol that need to be completed.</summary>
