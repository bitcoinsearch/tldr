    <summary>The author of the message is proposing a solution for client functionality related to multisig/op_eval BIPs (11/12). The proposed solution involves a 2 of 3 multisig scenario, where a transaction containing one of the signatures is issued from client1 with a locktime and sequence. Client2 modifies the transaction to include the second signature, changes the sequence to 0xFFFFFFFF=final, and retransmits the transaction. The transaction would be valid and final and approved by miners. However, the setup requires enabling the replacement of transactions in the client. The author is asking if anyone is working on this or if an alternative protocol should be used for sending transactions between clients.</summary>
