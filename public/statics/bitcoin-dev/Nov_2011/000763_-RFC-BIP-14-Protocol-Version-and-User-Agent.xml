    <summary>This is a thread of emails from the Bitcoin-development mailing list discussing BIP 14, a proposed protocol version and user agent for Bitcoin. The author, Amir Taaki, thanks Gavin Andresen and Patrick Strateman for their contributions to the proposal. Mike Hearn expresses his support and willingness to make changes to BitcoinJ if the mainline client adopts the new format. There is also discussion about the upcoming version 0.6 of Bitcoin protocol, which will include several changes. The email thread includes links to the BIP 14 proposal and a registration page for the RSA(R) Conference 2012.</summary>
