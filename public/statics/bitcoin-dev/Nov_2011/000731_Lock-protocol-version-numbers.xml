    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin development, a suggestion was made to use user-agent strings as a starting point for protocol choices. However, one member argued against this approach, stating that it could lead developers to make communication choices based on client type, and that user-agents in HTTP are only useful if the clients do not adhere to a well-defined behavior. Instead, the member suggests keeping it simple with just a simple string, without any further meaning. Another member proposes a hierarchy from protocol, variant, gui, flavour, build using examples such as /Satoshi:314700/bitcoin-qt:0.4/ and /BitcoinJ:0.2/AndroidBuild:0.8/. A discussion ensues about whether a freely defined comments field is necessary, with examples such as /BitcoinJ:0.2[iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1]/AndroidBuild:0.8/ and /Satoshi:314700/bitcoin-qt:0.4[Ubuntu Oneiric]/ being given. The BitCoinJ subver field is noted to already be set to its name and version.</summary>
