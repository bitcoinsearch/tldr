    <summary>A user reported that the Bitcoin icon was missing from the DesktopPager in bidcoin-qt for Linux, but noted that it was a cosmetic change. Another user reported strange behavior when testing version 0.5.0 on Linux, including blockchain downloads stopping at 10% and restarting at 0% upon reopening the client. The user also asked where to find the number of connections using the new Bitcoin-QT. Gavin Andresen requested help sanity testing versions 0.4.1 and 0.5.0 of Bitcoin.</summary>
