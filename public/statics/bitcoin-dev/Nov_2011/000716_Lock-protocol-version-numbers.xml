    <summary>In this email exchange, Amir Taaki proposes locking the version numbers of the Bitcoin protocol to the sub_version_num field and revision number for individual builds, in order to avoid constantly bumping up the version numbers with each client release. Chris questions the purpose and practicality of such a move, arguing that it will slow down the evolution of the protocol while clients continue to release at a similar pace. He also notes that it took a long time to decouple the protocol version from being bumped with each client release, and doing the opposite now makes no sense. The email ends with a message about registering for the RSA Conference 2012 and a link to the Bitcoin development mailing list.</summary>
