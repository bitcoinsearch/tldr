    <summary>The developer of BitCoinJ, a widely used library for Bitcoin protocol, has announced version 0.3 of the implementation. The update brings many bug fixes and test suite improvements, major optimizations to reduce parsing overheads, new APIs to make writing Bitcoin apps easier and introduces a new PeerGroup API that handles the management of multiple peer connections. In addition, the software has switched to using Maven for the build process and removed the bundled Bouncy Castle as a result. Developers can now depend on BitCoinJ using Maven if they do not need any special patches. The next release will focus on fixing bugs and filling out missing features so projects using the library do not feel any need to patch their local copy of the library. By popular request, the company will be switching from Subversion to Git.</summary>
