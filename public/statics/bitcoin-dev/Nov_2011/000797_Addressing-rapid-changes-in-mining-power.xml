    <summary>On November 23, 2011, Gavin Andresen wrote in response to a suggestion about Bitcoin's "I got lucky and found an extremely hard block" problem. He stated that Bitcoin doesn't have this issue because the difficulty target is used to compute chain difficulty and not actual hashes found. Despite seeing the "I got lucky" result as a benefit, as it made it harder to fork the chain, he ultimately abandoned the suggestion because it would not work. He thanked everyone for their feedback.</summary>
