    <summary>In November 2011, there was a discussion about the "Satoshi" client on the Bitcoin development mailing list. The term "Satoshi" referred to the mainline client of Bitcoin that was started by Satoshi Nakamoto and was actively being distributed through Github and Bitcoin.org downloads. Although some people liked the name "Satoshi" as a homage, it was ultimately up to the maintainers to make a decision. Jeff Garzik, who was working for exMULTI, Inc. at the time, explained that changing to the QT client wouldn't affect the use of the term "Satoshi" client.</summary>
