    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin's block generation, Christian Decker raised concerns about the use of synchronized time windows and selecting the hardest block, as synchronization is not possible in distributed systems. The delay in propagation would also cause forks. However, the timestamp is merely a convenience for the block, with block difficulty acting as a measure of time. The hardest chain always wins, whether a miner tries to replace the top block or append to the current hardest chain. Miners compete to win the one block reward available every ten minutes, and peers will reject blocks with timestamps that are lies.</summary>
