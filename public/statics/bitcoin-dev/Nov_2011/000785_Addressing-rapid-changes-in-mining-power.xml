    <summary>On November 23rd, 2011, Jorge Tim√≥n proposed a new idea for block generation in Bitcoin. Instead of having nodes aim for a target difficulty, every node would generate the most difficult block it can, while simultaneously listening for "the most difficult block generated before time T," with T being picked to be the block generation rate (10 minutes). However, Andy Parkins pointed out that a miner could try to obtain more difficulty out of time and cheat its reported datetime (T), similar to the current system. The defence against this would be to check the timestamp of a received block against the node's own clock and averaged network clock, rejecting blocks outside of that band.</summary>
