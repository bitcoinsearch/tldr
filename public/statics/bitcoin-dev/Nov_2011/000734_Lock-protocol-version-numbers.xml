    <summary>The author agrees with Amir's points on adhering strictly to protocols and rejecting clients who don't comply. The reported client and version should be ignored altogether in financial transactions. Developers should have the liberty to implement the information given as they see fit. However, clear and concise definition of the protocol is necessary, and strict adherence in the mainline client is crucial. The protocol version should be indicated for proper handling, but neither the name of the client nor its version needs to be reported. Nonetheless, the additional data from a user agent string could encourage more supporters to the scene and be used for calculating various statistics. Therefore, formalizing how this information will be included, and using it to their advantage would be best.</summary>
