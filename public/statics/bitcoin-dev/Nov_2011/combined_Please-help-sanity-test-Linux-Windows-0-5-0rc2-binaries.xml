    <summary>On November 4, 2011, Gavin Andresen wrote an email about the Bitcoin-0.5.0rc2 release candidate. He stated that he removed the bitcoin-0.5.0rc2-linux.tar.gz file because it was not sane, and they needed to teach the Qt build to statically link dependencies. Once the Mac and Linux deployment issues were fixed, expect a release candidate 3.Later in the email thread, Andresen provided information about the tagged v0.5.0rc2 of Bitcoin. Gitian-built binaries were uploaded to https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.5.0/test/. He also mentioned that the Mac builds will be delayed due to issues creating a standalone .app. Shasums for the uploads were also provided, along with Andresen's v0.5.0rc2 gitian.zips. Towards the end of the email thread, Douglas Huff asked what was wrong with the Mac build, stating that he just built on 10.7 without any issues. Andresen replied that once the Mac and Linux deployment issues are fixed, expect a release candidate 3.In a recent message posted by Gavin Andresen, it has been announced that the Qt build needs to be taught to statically link dependencies. This seems to be related to issues with Mac and Linux deployment. However, once these issues are resolved, a release candidate 3 can be expected. The message provides no further details or information about what the release candidate 3 will contain or when it will be released. It is clear, however, that the developers are actively working on fixing the deployment issues in order to move forward with the next release of the software.</summary>
