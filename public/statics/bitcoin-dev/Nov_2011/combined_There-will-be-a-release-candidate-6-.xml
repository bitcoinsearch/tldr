    <summary>Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen received an email from a tester who provided feedback that a user behavior of encrypting a wallet, backing it up, performing some activity, and restoring the backup could lead to disastrous results. Andresen agreed and decided to rework the wallet encrypt/rewrite code and create a release candidate 6. His previous attempt at encrypting the wallet resulted in unencrypted private keys in the new wallet. The rework includes invalidating all old keypool keys, writing new keypool keys to the old wallet, encrypting all keys in the old wallet, and rewriting the old wallet to create a new wallet.Andresen also requested help with a mysterious problem in which bdb throws an exception when dbenv.close(0) is called during shutdown. Additionally, if this use case is supported, users should be notified of wallet changes that result in invalidated backups.The Bitcoin developer, Gavin Andresen, has proposed a solution to the problem of unencrypted private keys in new wallets. He plans to invalidate all old keypool keys, write new ones to the old wallet, encrypt all the keys and rewrite the old wallet to create a new one. He will test this solution today.Andresen is also seeking help from anyone who can compile a -g version of bdb and step through DbEnv::close in a debugger to identify why it throws an exception during shutdown. This information was shared on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.Splunk, a tool for making sense of IT infrastructure data, was advertised at the end of the post.</summary>
