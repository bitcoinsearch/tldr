    <summary>The user is experiencing intermittent crashes on bitcoin-qt.exe while executing RPC commands, especially when sending a bunch of RPC commands in rapid succession. The issue has not been encountered with "getbalance" but with other commands. The user suspects that sending a single letter as the command seems to trigger the crash most often. While using version 0.4.1, the user was unable to generate the crash. However, an issue has not been logged for this problem, and the user wonders if it's related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/639.The user requests suggestions for additional debug information before submitting an issue. The system configuration includes Windows 7 x64 and Bitcoin 0.5 rc5. The error message associated with the crash contains details such as faulting application name, module name, process id, application start time, application path, module path, and report id.In a separate email thread, Gavin Andresen seeks help in sanity testing two versions of Bitcoin: bitcoin-0.4.1/test and bitcoin-0.5.0/test, available for download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/.</summary>
