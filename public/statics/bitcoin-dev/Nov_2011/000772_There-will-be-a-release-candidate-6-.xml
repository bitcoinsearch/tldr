    <summary>In November 2011, Gavin Andresen sent an email to the Bitcoin Dev mailing list about a release candidate for Bitcoin. In the email, he mentions feedback from a tester who provided input on user behavior and how it can lead to disastrous results if not handled properly. He agreed with the feedback and stated that he would be reworking the wallet encrypt/rewrite code and creating a new release candidate six. Andresen explains his previous attempt at encrypting the wallet resulted in unencrypted private keys in the new wallet. To handle this, he plans to invalidate all the old keypool keys in the old wallet, write new keypool keys to the old wallet, encrypt all the keys in the old wallet, rewrite the old wallet to create a new wallet, and then shutdown/restart. Additionally, Andresen requests assistance in solving a problem with bdb throwing an exception during shutdown. He asks if anyone is willing to compile a -g version of bdb and step through DbEnv::close in a debugger to find out why an exception is being thrown. The email ends with a link to Splunk, a tool that takes data from IT infrastructure and makes sense of it.</summary>
