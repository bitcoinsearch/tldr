    <summary>The conversation is about Alan Reiner's proposal of authenticatable derived addresses for depositing coins. The proposal suggests that instead of certification, a scalar, base address could be communicated to authenticate the deposit. Certification requires an online private key for authentication, while a scalar, base address does not. To derive the scalar, HD address public derivation could be used. Although payment messages are currently at the application level, there is a possibility of adding another level of signed messages with a different offline X509 key to upload signed addresses in batches. However, this approach has inferior characteristics and is a protocol layering violation. The discussion also touches on the usefulness of TOFU validatability of the low-level address format and the consideration of augmenting the derivation with Timo Hanke's bind to contract hash.</summary>
