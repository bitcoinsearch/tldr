    <summary>In a discussion about merge mining, David Vorick mentions that Dogecoin uses scrypt, which is a popular algorithm. He also addresses the concern of a potential attack through merge mining, stating that if any large currency were to be attacked, it would probably be litecoin miners attacking dogecoin. However, he argues that an attacker with enough control over the litecoin network to perform such an attack would likely have a vested interest in cryptocurrencies doing well. He goes on to say that a successful attack on dogecoin would cast doubt on the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem and hurt the attacker's interests. In response, Jorge Timón disagrees with Vorick's assumptions about the interests of a potential attacker and suggests that some individuals within the cryptocurrency ecosystem may actually want dogecoin to disappear. The discussion ends with Timón questioning Vorick's stance on merged mining and whether or not it applies to Dogecoin.</summary>
