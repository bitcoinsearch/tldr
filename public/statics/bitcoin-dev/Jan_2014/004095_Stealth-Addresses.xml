    <summary>In a Bitcoin Development Group meeting, the name "stealth address" was suggested to be changed to something more neutral. Gregory Maxwell agreed that regardless of political overtones, "stealth" is cringe-worthy. He suggests "private address," but it could be confused with private keys. Therefore, he recommended using "static address" as a reasonable attempt at describing intended use/direction. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, provided his contact information at the end of the email.</summary>
