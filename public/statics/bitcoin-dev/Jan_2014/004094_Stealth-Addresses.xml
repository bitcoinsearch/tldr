    <summary>During a discussion on Wed, Jan 15, 2014 at 12:22 PM, Ben Davenport proposed to change the name "stealth address" to something more neutral. In response to this, the idea was acknowledged and it was agreed that regardless of the 'political' overtones, stealth is a little cringe-worthy. Possible alternatives were discussed including "private address", which was deemed confusing with private-keys. The suggestion of "static address" was considered the best option as it would improve awareness that normal addresses are intended to be more one-use-ness.</summary>
