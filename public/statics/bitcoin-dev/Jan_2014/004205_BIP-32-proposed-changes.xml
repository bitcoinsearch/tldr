    <summary>Pieter has created a pull request for a rewritten version of BIP 32 based on feedback to make it more readable. The changes include not reusing the terminology 'public' vs 'private' for the alternate derivation scheme, but calling them "hardened". Additionally, explicit type conversion functions have been added, and the suffix 'h' is used to mean hardened instead of using the ' suffix to mean "alternate" in two very different meanings. CKDpriv and CKDpub are used for the derivation functions that operate on private and public keys. Pieter notes that these are just documentation changes and the semantics remain unchanged. Comments are welcome on the pull request at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/12.</summary>
