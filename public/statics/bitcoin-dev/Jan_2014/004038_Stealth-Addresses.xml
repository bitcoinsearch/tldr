    <summary>On January 10, 2014, Peter Todd sent an email mentioning that it's possible to make stealth addresses include a second pubkey for communication purposes. This pubkey can either not be used in the scriptPubKey or can be part of an n-of-m multisig where n is greater than or equal to two. Third parties can also be given access to this key to scan the blockchain. This concept was deemed exciting and Drak questioned the chance of it becoming a BIP.</summary>
