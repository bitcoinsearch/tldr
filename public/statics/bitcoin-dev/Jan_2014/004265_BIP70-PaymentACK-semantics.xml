    <summary>On January 27, 2014, a discussion was held between Jeff Garzik, Pieter Wuille, and Kevin Greene about whether the wallet should broadcast a transaction to the Bitcoin network when it receives an ACK or assume that the merchant server will do it. Wuille believed that receiving an ACK should signify that the receiver takes responsibility for getting the transaction confirmed, meaning that the merchant/processor should take on that responsibility after delivering a PaymentACK. This would allow the client to go offline and remove the requirement for the P2P network to function as a reliable sender-receiver communication channel, reducing it to a broadcast medium to get transactions to miners. Garzik questioned whether this was truly the intent and if the merchant/processor should take full responsibility for getting the TX confirmed.</summary>
