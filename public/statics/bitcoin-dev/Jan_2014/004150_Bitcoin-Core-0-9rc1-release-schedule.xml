    <summary>In an email exchange between Wladimir and Luke-Jr on January 17th, 2014, Luke-Jr shared a GitHub link for bitcoin/bitcoin pulls, stating that these have been tested and stable for months. Wladimir replied that #3242 autoconf improvements needed rebase and consideration of comments from jgarzik and him. He also mentioned that other proposals might affect mining/consensus, so he wanted more reviewers and testers to give ACKs before merging. Luke-Jr asked for elaboration, disagreeing that there was anything controversial in the proposals except for possibly affecting consensus if buggy.</summary>
