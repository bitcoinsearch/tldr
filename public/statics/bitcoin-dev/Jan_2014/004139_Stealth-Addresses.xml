    <summary>The writer expresses their indifference towards the name of a certain address in blockchain technology, as long as it works. They mention attempting to enter a reusable address on blockchain.info and assuming it is an unsupported feature when it does not work. The writer suggests that regardless of its name, blockchain.info should inform users that this address only allows the owner to view payments. They propose calling the address with public keys the "reusable address" and the one generated from a shared secret the "stealth address."</summary>
