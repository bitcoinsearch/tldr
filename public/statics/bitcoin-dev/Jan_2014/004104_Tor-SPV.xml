    <summary>A proposal has been made to introduce a new P2P protocol command "tor?" to add a service flag and bump the protocol version. If a client sends a "tor?" message to a node with the new service flag set, it will respond with a new "tor" message that contains a regular addr packet with a single address, the IPv6-ified version of its hidden service name. The suggestion is to add the service flag so that the remote peer can add IPv6-ified hidden service addresses to "addr" messages instead of a separate message type that implies binding a clearnet IP to a hidden service ID. This would remove the implication that a node has to give both public and private IPs to a peer. The network address format may need modification to differentiate between IPv6 clearnet vs. Tor addresses. A batch of "addr"s could contain one's own hidden service ID or one learned from someone else.</summary>
