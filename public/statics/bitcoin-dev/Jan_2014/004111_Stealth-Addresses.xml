    <summary>A proposal has been made to change the name of "stealth address" to something more neutral and descriptive. The suggestion made was "reusable address" which is claimed to be a more suitable term for non-programmers and encourages wallets to present options as either 'one time use' or 'reusable'. This description packs a marketing punch that could help drive adoption, making the feature only useful if/when it is broadly adopted.The proposed reusable address feature meets all the required criteria. Communication between parties is a single message from the payee, which may be public. Multiple payments to the same address are not publicly linkable on the blockchain. The payee has explicitly designated they expect to receive more than one payment at that address. Payers can publicly prove they made a payment to the reusable address by revealing a secret. The war against address reuse may soon be a distant memory with this new feature. Other attempts at describing the intended use/direction include "static address," which is considered the best option, as well as "private address" which may cause confusion with private-keys. Regardless of the political overtones, the term "stealth address" is cringe-worthy. CenturyLink Cloud offers enterprise cloud services and is the leader in the industry. More businesses are choosing CenturyLink Cloud for critical workloads, development environments, and everything in between.</summary>
