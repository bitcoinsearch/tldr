    <summary>In an email chain from January 2014, members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list discussed potential names for a new feature related to privacy and security. One member proposed the name "reusable addresses," but another member argued that the name "stealth addresses" was more appropriate given its association with privacy. The discussion also touched on the importance of marketing and adoption, with some members suggesting alternative names like "privacy address" or "payment key." Ultimately, the group decided to stick with the name "stealth addresses" due to its existing PR momentum and association with privacy.</summary>
