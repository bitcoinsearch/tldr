    <summary>In an email exchange, Alan Reiner stated that he provides a multiplier to those who pay him, but it is not publicly available without access to his wallet or email. The purpose of this is to cover cases where communication is one way or nearly so, such as donation addresses on static webpages, forum signatures or email addresses, or billboards. In these situations, users may not want to go through the trouble of computing a new multiplier every time they give out an address, which is why Reiner provides one upon request.</summary>
