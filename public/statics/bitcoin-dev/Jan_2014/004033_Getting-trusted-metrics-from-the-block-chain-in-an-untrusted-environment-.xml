    <summary>In an email exchange, Clément Elbaz proposed the idea of paying a fee to the network for every metric request sent, with the aim of executing the request on the blockchain and having the response approved by the Bitcoin network. He suggested the need for proof of work and the creation of a specific blockchain that would store metric requests, current block number when they were asked, and hash of their responses. However, he received feedback that it would be more practical to set up a node, create an API interface and have the 'app' use the API on the node. Clément also proposed an alternate, small and fixed-length 'metric request blockchain,' which would temporarily store structures defined as [metric request | current block number when request was made | hash of the response] instead of financial transactions. These structures are verifiable, so it could work the same way as a regular financial blockchain. He suggested that metrics requests can be expensive to compute and validate, so it would make sense to pay a fee every time one is requested. Ultimately, he received private answers, and after studying them, he concluded that SPV mode of bitcoinj will be just fine for his specific needs.</summary>
