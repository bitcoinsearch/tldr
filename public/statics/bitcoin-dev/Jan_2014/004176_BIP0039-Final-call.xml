    <summary>In January 2014, slush wrote an email to the community announcing the reconsideration of all comments received on their BIP39 proposal. The proposal now doesn't require any specific word list and allows every client to use its preferred words. Generated mnemonic can be applied to any other BIP39-compatible client. Brooks raised a question about the proposal, wondering if it has turned the "mnemonic sentence" into a brain wallet. According to Brooks, since every mnemonic sentence can now lead to a bip32 root, and only the client that created the mnemonic can verify the mnemonic passes its checksum. Assuming all clients use different wordlists, the only client that can help is the one that created the mnemonic in case of fat-finger errors.</summary>
