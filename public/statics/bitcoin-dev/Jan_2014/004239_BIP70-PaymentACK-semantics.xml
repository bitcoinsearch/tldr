    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen, they discuss the issue of when wallets should broadcast transactions versus when they should submit them via HTTP. Hearn suggests following a certain interpretation for now, but admits he forgot why it wasn't specified in the first place. They also discuss how automatic CoinJoin can complicate matters if wallets are required to wait for a PaymentACK before broadcasting. This would force users to violate the spec to do CoinJoin. Additionally, not broadcasting the transaction right away adds implementation complexity and raises questions about what to do if the payment_url is unavailable or if the merchant eventually broadcasts the transaction.</summary>
