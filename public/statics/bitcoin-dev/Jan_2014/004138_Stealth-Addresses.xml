    <summary>In an email thread from 2014, Peter Todd expressed his opposition to the name "reusable addresses" and suggested using "stealth addresses" instead. Another participant in the thread agreed with Todd's sentiment but suggested that "master address" may be a more neutral alternative. The discussion centered around finding a name for a fixed address from which payment addresses can be generated as needed. The participants also shared their contact information through attachments.</summary>
