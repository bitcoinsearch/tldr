    <summary>The context discusses the effectiveness of a static address privacy system in an alternate blockchain that encourages address re-use and charges higher transaction fees for those seeking privacy. The question is whether this system still works if 95% of the transactions re-use addresses, rendering them effectively static. Jeff Garzik suggests 'static address' as a reasonable name for the intended use/direction. Gregory Maxwell agrees and suggests it may improve awareness that normal addresses are intended to be more one-use-ness. Ben Davenport suggests changing the name 'stealth address' to something more neutral. Despite some political overtones, the group seems to agree that 'static address' is the best option.</summary>
