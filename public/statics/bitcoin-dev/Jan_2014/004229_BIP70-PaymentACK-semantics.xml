    <summary>In a discussion between Pieter Wuille and Kevin Greene, the topic of whether a wallet should broadcast a transaction to the bitcoin network upon receiving an ACK was brought up. Pieter believes that receiving an ACK should signify that the receiver takes responsibility for getting the transaction confirmed. If there is no payment_url specified in the PaymentRequest, then the wallet is responsible for broadcasting the transaction to the bitcoin network. However, if there is a payment_url specified, the wallet should rely on the merchant server to broadcast. Kevin agrees with the idea of having an error field as a way for client applications to interpret the response.</summary>
