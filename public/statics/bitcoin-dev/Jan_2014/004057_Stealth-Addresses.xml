    <summary>In an email conversation, the issue of trusting a third party to relay payment requests without tampering was discussed. It was noted that relying on a third party for this would always be an issue, hence the need for signing. Signing a payment request for an individual is easy and can be done with an email address. This involves obtaining a certificate from a website such as Comodo that generates and installs certificates in web browsers. Once obtained, a wallet app can easily be told to sign payment requests with the email address. For organizations or companies, an email address with a well-known domain name may suffice.</summary>
