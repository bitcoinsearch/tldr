    <summary>Adam Back posted about his idea of a proof for the existence of a space-efficient way to do better than bloom filters/prefix/bloom-bait. He stated that he had written up the details on Bitcointalk.org with the use of novel application of IBE based on weil-pairing. This allows the recipient to send a delegation private key specific to the block being queried, so the node servicing the query has no ability to correlate with queries in other blocks from the same user. Adam believes it may be possible to do further than this, besides delegating decryption, only to delegate filtering. It could be done without introducing weil pairing hardness problem or using public key steganography. Peter Todd replied that it would be interesting if someone can dig up a proof showing doing much better than Gregory's ambiguity tradeoff is impossible.</summary>
