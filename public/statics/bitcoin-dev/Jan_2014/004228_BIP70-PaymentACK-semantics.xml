    <summary>During a discussion on January 27, 2014, Kevin Greene proposed the need for an error field to help client applications interpret responses. Pieter agreed with this proposal and added that it is essential to determine whether the wallet should broadcast the transaction to the bitcoin network upon receiving an ACK or assume that the merchant server will do so. In Pieter's opinion, the primary meaning of receiving an ACK should be to acknowledge that the receiver takes responsibility for getting the transaction confirmed to the extent possible.</summary>
