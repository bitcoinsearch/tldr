    <summary>In a discussion about the way payments are handled in Bitcoinj, Mike Hearn suggests that the transaction is only committed to the wallet if the server accepts the Payment message and ACKs it. In case of any failure submitting or internal server error, the transaction would not be retried and the UI would show that the payment failed. However, this method is not suggested or required by the specification, and it's currently not implemented in Bitcoin core master. The context doesn't provide further information about the implications of these differences.</summary>
