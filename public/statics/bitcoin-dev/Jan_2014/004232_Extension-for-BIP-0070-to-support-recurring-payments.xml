    <summary>Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, has mentioned that recurring payments and subscriptions is a frequently-requested feature in the Bitcoin network. According to him, this feature would require a new BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The situation is said to be similar to HTML5 local storage where the remote merchant wants to initiate a persistent behavior. This indicates that implementing this feature would require careful planning and execution.</summary>
