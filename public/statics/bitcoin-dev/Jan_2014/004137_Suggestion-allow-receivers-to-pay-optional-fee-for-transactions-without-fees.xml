    <summary>A user named DÃ¢niel Fraga sent a very small donation of 0.00121 BTC without paying fees and was hoping that after a few days it could be included in a block. However, Blockchain.info simply removed it as transactions without fees are usually rejected by miners. The user suggested that it would be nice if the receiver could have a chance to pay the fee when the sender didn't pay any fee. It would be technically possible for the receiver to attach some fee to the transaction, even if he/she didn't send the transaction. This suggestion might require changes to the protocol to allow the receiver to pay an optional fee. In response to this, Ben Davenport explains that there is no need for protocol changes. A user can create a transaction which spends the output to oneself, attaching a fee to that transaction. In order for miners to grab the transaction fee on that transaction, they would have to also mine the original transaction. Likely, one would have to do this manually, but software could be written to simplify doing it. There are proposals to make miners recognize this situation and account for it, however, only eligius is running it at the moment. If someone were to try it now, it likely wouldn't result in inclusion. But this is on the radar, and it will eventually get merged into mainline.</summary>
