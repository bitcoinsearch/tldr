    <summary>In a message sent on January 1, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed his appreciation for working with and meeting members of the Bitcoin community. He also looked forward to upgrades planned for the coming year and hoped that the pace of progress would increase. Wendell, who contributed to the development of Hive Wallet, expressed similar sentiments in a message posted on hivewallet.com and Twitter. He felt lucky to be part of the community and believed that 2014 would be an amazing year. Despite the growth of the Bitcoin community in 2013, there was little change in the core software. Both Wendell and Mike were excited about the potential for innovation in the coming year.</summary>
