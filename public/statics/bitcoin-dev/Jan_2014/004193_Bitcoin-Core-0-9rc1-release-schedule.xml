    <summary>In an email exchange dated January 19, 2014, Wladimir expressed concern over the lack of (auto)tests for pull #1647, which had received comments expressing a need for such tests. However, there was no response from Luke or anyone else regarding who would be responsible for addressing these comments. Wladimir then requested that someone give pull #1647 its final push by addressing the comments so that it could be integrated in the 0.9 release.</summary>
