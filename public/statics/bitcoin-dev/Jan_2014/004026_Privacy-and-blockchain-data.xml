    <summary>One way to make a privacy/bandwidth trade-off is to generate addresses with common prefixes, where the length of the prefix determines the anonymity set. However, this expands the potential attackers to anyone with a copy of the blockchain instead of just those watching SPV queries. The UTXO set size consists of 7.4 million unspent outputs, 2.2 million transactions with unspent outputs, and 2.1 million unique unspent scriptPubKeys. If an 8-bit prefix is used, there would be around 10,000 transactions in the monitored UTXO. If someone knew the different days/time-periods a user transacted, they could figure out their prefix. Additionally, anyone a user transacts with would know their prefix outright, allowing for obvious identification of spend versus change addresses in a transaction.</summary>
