    <summary>In an email conversation between Chuck and another party, the topic of arbitration in payment transactions is discussed. The merchant could potentially argue that the transactions seen on the network were insufficient. However, it is assumed that the arbitrator would have rules in place to determine what is an acceptable form of payment. Additionally, HTTP has response codes for submission of the Payment message, and there is potential to add signing to PaymentACK and other features in the future if necessary.</summary>
