    <summary>Dogecoin uses the scrypt algorithm which is popular among cryptocurrencies. Merge mining may favor Dogecoin. David Vorick suggested that attacking a significant currency would not be beneficial as it would be expensive and traumatize the whole system. Litecoin miners attacking Dogecoin is possible but unlikely due to the vested interest in protecting cryptocurrencies. An attack on a major currency would cast doubt on the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, drop the value of Bitcoin, and all cryptocurrencies using the same work function as Dogecoin. There is no clear indication from the conversation whether or not Jorge Tim√≥n is in favor of merged mining.</summary>
