    <summary>The email discusses extending the payment protocol with new fields and developing microdonation, microtransaction, and multisignature via browser. The proposed method involves presenting very long addresses or multiple addresses by default from within the bitcoin client, enabling microdonations as a default. This would allow users to support different individuals, organizations, causes, etc., for each transaction while stipulating the addresses to which this giving or microdonation would occur. Microdonations could be conducted over mobile with zero fees, and the fees were applied only to the item purchased unless the value of the microdonations was at a certain threshold value where fees would apply.The email also proposes using the microdonation process to limit the possibility of a 50%+1 attack. However, it raises questions regarding decentralizing the giving process, identifying donations, and creating a simple prototype implementation. The email suggests using 2-of-2 multisig to prevent a transaction from being spent if one party attempts to cheat. It recommends queuing transactions through an online watch process and verifying them offline before fulfilling large orders. The email also proposes creating new user-friendly prefixes for stealth addresses, including single pubkey addresses.The author plans to implement prototypes for pay-to-STEALTH addresses, a watcher process, and an offline verifier. They also include links to academic papers on ephemeral keys in Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocols and elliptic curve public key validation. Finally, the email promotes CenturyLink Cloud for enterprise cloud services.</summary>
