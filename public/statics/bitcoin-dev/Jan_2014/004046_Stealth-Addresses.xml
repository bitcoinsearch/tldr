    <summary>The discussion revolves around extending the payment protocol with new fields instead of making long addresses. Building a static PP file is proposed given the necessary inputs, and implementing support for parsing those fields and generating the new transaction type into bitcoind is also planned. The prefix and the one vs two pubkey approach are being considered, and it is suggested that both should be supported equally. A longer prefix is preferred over a shorter one due to its usability trade-off. Saving bytes in the address by requiring both pubkeys to start with '03' or the same byte is not deemed worth the arbitrary restriction. The internal wallet code for receiving STL payments and updating balances is more complex and requires a decision on how the STL keys should be encrypted. The idea of highlighting these STL addresses as reusable is discussed, and an expiration date can be added to the certificate or 'expires' field in the static PP file if required.</summary>
