    <summary>The context discusses the need to modify the network address format to differentiate between IPv6 clearnet and Tor addresses. A clever hack has already been implemented by sipa where 80-bit Tor keys are mapped to a subregion of reserved IPv6 space, allowing for magical IPv6 hidden service addresses that can be included in addr packets. However, it is suggested that nodes do not necessarily have to give both public and private IPs to a peer, and instead, a set of peers can be chosen who are believed not to be sybils of each other but may provide hidden services run by others. This raises concerns about malicious nodes generating multiple hidden service keys that map to their own node and waiting for traffic to arrive. To avoid this issue, clearnet nodes can inform about their own hidden service IDs. The goal of using hidden services is not necessarily to hide P2P nodes but to use them as a means of authentication and encryption. It is suggested that 6-hop hidden service circuits may not be necessary for most nodes that aren't Tor-exclusive, and a 3-hop circuit would work just as well.</summary>
