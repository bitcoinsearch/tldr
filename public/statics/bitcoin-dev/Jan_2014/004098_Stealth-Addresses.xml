    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2014, Gregory Maxwell suggested renaming "stealth addresses" to something more neutral. He proposed "static address" as a suitable alternative, given that it describes intended use/direction and also raises awareness that normal addresses are intended to be more one-use-ness. Jeff Garzik agreed with the suggestion. However, some participants expressed concerns about possible confusion with the term "static" in computer programming. Another proposal was "private address", but it could be confused with private keys. The discussion did not result in a final decision on the name change.</summary>
