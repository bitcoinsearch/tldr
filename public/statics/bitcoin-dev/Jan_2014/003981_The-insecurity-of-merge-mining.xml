    <summary>In a discussion on merged mining, Luke-Jr disagreed with Peter Todd's statement that using merge-mining is dangerous for altcoins because it makes them vulnerable to 51% attacks by reusing existing hashing power. Luke-Jr argued that any non-scam altcoin is secure using merged mining since any attacker would invest in the altcoin instead of attacking it. Non-scam altcoins can take advantage of merged mining to increase their security. However, Peter Todd argues that an altcoin's value may not be equal to all miners, and some miners may have different interests or local regulations that make them attack the altcoin. Peter Todd suggested implementing Zerocoin by embedding ZTC transactions within Bitcoin transactions to make it more secure, though this approach has slower confirmations.</summary>
