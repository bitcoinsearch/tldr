    <summary>In this message, Mark proposes the idea of having an officially named "reusable address" format to discourage people from using traditional addresses for data storage. He mentions that no amount of finger-wagging has been able to stop people from using the block chain for data storage, but news of the OP_RETURN change to relay rules in 0.9 got people to be less damaging in how they do it. While a reusable address format won't stop people from doing dumb things like vanity addresses, it may help reduce the misuse of traditional addresses. The message also includes a PGP signature.</summary>
