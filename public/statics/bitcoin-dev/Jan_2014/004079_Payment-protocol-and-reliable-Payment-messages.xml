    <summary>As a prospective buyer, imagine receiving an offer from a merchant that you would like to accept, but the merchant changes their mind. In most cases, if the merchant has not delivered the product or service yet, they are allowed to change their mind without any issues. The problem arises only when the merchant changes their mind after you have made the payment.</summary>
