    <summary>In an email exchange on Jan 15, 2014, Jeff Garzik suggested the term "static address" to describe a certain type of address. When asked if this term is different from an address configured by DHCP, he responded with humor but also acknowledged that the term may not be easily understood by the average user. Roy also noted that while the term may be neutral and shorter than other options, it may still be unclear to some users.</summary>
