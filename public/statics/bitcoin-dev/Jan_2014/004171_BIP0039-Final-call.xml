    <summary>The community has provided feedback on BIP39 proposal, and the team behind it has taken the suggestions into consideration. The current draft of the proposal no longer requires a specific wordlist, allowing each client to use its preferred set of words. The generated mnemonic is now compatible with any other BIP39-compatible client. The team is requesting final comments on the current draft as they move towards releasing firmware for Trezor. The draft can be found on their GitHub page.</summary>
