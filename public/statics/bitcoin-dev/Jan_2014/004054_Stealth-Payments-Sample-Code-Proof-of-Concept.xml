    <summary>On January 13, 2014, Jeremy Spilman spent 1BTC on TestNet to a stealth address but questioned if it could be redeemed. He also shared the code that generated the transaction via a GitHub link. The discussion then turned towards hiding 0BTC OP_RETURN transactions from the transaction list and the suggestion of just displaying "Payment received from Jeremy, 0.1 BTC" in the address column. There was also talk about extending the wallet format to keep 'd2'/'Q2' unencrypted for testing purposes but not as a stand-alone private key. Finally, there was a concern that the protocol should be reviewed by a professional cryptographer due to potential issues with people detecting payments.</summary>
