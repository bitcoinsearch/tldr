    <summary>It seems that there was some excitement around the Bitcoin website, although it is unclear when this occurred. The steady state load on the site is not very high, with a peak of 10 visitors per second and only around 100 requests per second at steady state. It is suggested that the specifications of the dedicated server may not have been what was expected. As a solution, it is proposed to move the site to Jeremy's hosting, which should not be very expensive outside of major press cycles. Additionally, SSL-protected file hosting could be obtained after the move.</summary>
