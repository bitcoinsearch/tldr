    <summary>In a forum post, Mike Hearn discussed using IPv4-based anti-Sybil heuristics that could improve the system in the future. He mentioned that they could use anonymous identities or crypto for better Sybil systems and eliminate the "connect via clearnet" step in favor of hidden services. In response to this post, Rob suggested using proof-of-stake as an anti-Sybil scheme on Tor. He proposed associating a temporary Tor service ID with a wallet instead of an IP address since people would not want their IPs linked to their wallets. Each node connected could sign a challenge with a key that controls some BTC, and the client node verifies the funds are different. Even if it was only a small 0.01BTC stake, it would be similar to the cost of obtaining another IP through a cheap VPS or VPN and significantly higher than the cost to an attacker who can MITM everything and operate on any IP anyway.</summary>
