    <summary>In an email conversation, Alan Reiner discussed a payment scheme in which users can simply give a multiplier and root key to someone who wants to pay them. This method has been compared with "stealth addresses", which use ECDH to create multiple payment addresses without querying the payee. However, while discussing it with Peter Todd in IRC, Reiner suggested using two EC points for the stealth address - one for the payment and another for ECDH. This would make delegating detection possible and avoid keeping spending keys online to detect payments. However, he later expressed his concern about constantly keeping spending keys online even for limited use-cases envisioned.</summary>
