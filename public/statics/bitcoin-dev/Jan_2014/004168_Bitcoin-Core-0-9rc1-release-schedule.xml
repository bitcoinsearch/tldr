    <summary>On January 19, 2014, Jeff Garzik opened a discussion about luke-jr's pull request for CPfP. The pull request remains open because it is considered useful to close the mismatch between how Bitcoin transaction fees are attached by the sender and the willingness of the receiver to pay a fee in modern economic situations. While there is general agreement that the feature appears to be useful, the code changes themselves are controversial. The consensus among comments on the pull request is that it needs auto tests. Wladimir asked Luke if he would do this or if anyone else was working on it.</summary>
