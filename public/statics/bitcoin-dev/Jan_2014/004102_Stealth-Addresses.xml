    <summary>In a conversation between Jeff Garzik and Roy Badami, they discuss potential names for Bitcoin addresses that do not allow for address reuse. Jeff suggests "Routing address" as it may have synergy with bank routing numbers, but is unsure if this will be helpful. Roy suggests "static address," however, he notes that this phrase may not be easily understood by typical users. Despite this, Roy acknowledges that it is a neutral name and shorter than other options. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
