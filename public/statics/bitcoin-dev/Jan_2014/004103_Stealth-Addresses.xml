    <summary>In 2014, someone proposed the idea of calling certain addresses 'type S addresses'. The proposal was made in an email conversation, where it was suggested that the name should reflect the fact that the addresses were encoded with an 's' prefix. It is unclear what kind of addresses these were, as the context surrounding the proposal is not provided. Nonetheless, the suggestion highlights the importance of using clear and descriptive terminology when dealing with technical concepts.</summary>
