    <summary>In an email conversation between Gary Rowe and Wladimir, they discussed the use of the term "reusable address". They both agreed that it was a simple and clear term. However, Wladimir expressed his concern about using the term "routing address" in finance as he associated it with network routing rather than banking. He also found it difficult to translate the term into local language.</summary>
