    <summary>In this email conversation, Jeremy Spilman and Peter Todd are discussing the concept of stealth addresses in Bitcoin. They explain that a payee generates a public key that serves as an identifier, with a corresponding private key. To receive payment, the payee generates a new keypair with a public key published in the transaction. The payer can calculate a shared secret between them and the payee, allowing either party to calculate the pay-to-address. The downside is that private keys have to be held unencrypted in memory, making stealth addresses unsuitable for eCommerce payments. However, it is possible to include a second pubkey in the stealth address for communication purposes or use a n-of-m multisig.</summary>
