    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd discussed the naming of a new type of bitcoin address. Hearn suggested using "stealth addresses", but Todd argued that it had negative connotations. Instead, he proposed "privacy addresses" or "incognito addresses". They ultimately decided to use "stealth addresses" for public marketing purposes, but "incognito addresses" within the wallet software itself. They also discussed the need to ensure backwards compatibility for any updates to the address format and inquired about the efficiency of scanning the blockchain for matching transactions.</summary>
