    <summary>On January 27, 2014, Andreas Schildbach presented his work on leveraging the payment protocol for face-to-face payments. He implemented a prototype on a branch of Bitcoin Wallet using bitcoinj 0.11. On January 30, 2014, he merged the code to his bitcoinj-0.11 branch and put up binary .apk files for experimentation. The binaries can be found at https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/releases/tag/v3.30-bitcoinj0.11. It should be noted that these binaries don't yet do URI support so you can't scan a bitcoin URI with r= in it and see the verified merchant name, etc. Andreas plans to do the UI for that in the next update.</summary>
