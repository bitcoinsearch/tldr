    <summary>In an email sent on January 1, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed his excitement for the upcoming year in Bitcoin development. He noted that while there were many exciting things happening in the Bitcoin community in 2013, it was a relatively quiet year for core software upgrades. Hearn expressed hope that this would change in 2014 and that the pace of development would increase. Hearn also wished everyone a happy new year and thanked them for their contributions to Bitcoin's development. He mentioned that Bitcoin was one of the 100 most searched for terms in 2013 and expressed his enthusiasm for what 2014 would bring. The email included a signature advertising AppDynamics, a service that provides visibility into application performance. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list on SourceForge.</summary>
