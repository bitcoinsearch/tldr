    <summary>In a discussion about the security of Bitcoin software, Jorge Timón and Troy Benjegerdes discussed the importance of checking hash values to prevent attackers from replacing parts of files. While Timón believed that this was more relevant for compiled binaries rather than source code, he acknowledged the usefulness of package management systems like apt-secure. Additionally, when Benjegerdes suggested that the binary should check its own hash, Timón expressed doubt that this was possible. Ultimately, the group agreed that promoting the use of signed .deb packages and operating systems with secure package management was a better approach to security than relying on TLS on the bitcoin.org server.</summary>
