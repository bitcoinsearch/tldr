    <summary>In a discussion on making stealth addresses, Jeremy mentions the possibility of adding a second pubkey to stealth addresses for communication purposes. He also notes that this approach can help with outsourcing the effort of scanning the blockchain to third-parties. The process involves generating an ephemeral key and creating a P2SH address. To detect payments, one could scan for TxOut with OP_RETURN and check for Q2' elsewhere in the transaction. However, Mallory could generate transactions with the right Q2', but with his own pubkey instead of Q. To prevent such attacks, Q2' could be put in a 2-of-2 multisig, which would make the transaction unspendable for both parties. Jeremy further states that user-friendly prefixes could be added for single pubkey (41 byte) stealth addresses. He plans to implement prototypes for: Pay to STL addresses, watcher process to detect and queue STL payments, and offline verifier to verify encrypted d/d2 output.</summary>
