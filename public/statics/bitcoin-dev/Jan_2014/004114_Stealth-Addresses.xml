    <summary>Eric Martindale, a software developer and entrepreneur, proposed the idea of "recycled address" in Bitcoin development mailing list. He suggested that this variation might avert misconceptions about the "re-use" of Bitcoin addresses being exclusive to one's own identity. Jeremy Spilman supported Eric’s idea and suggested calling it "reusable address", which he thinks describes it best to non-programmers and encourages wallets to present options as 'one time use' vs 'reusable'. Jeff Garzik thought “static address” would be a reasonable attempt to describe the intended use or direction of the feature, while Gregory Maxwell suggested "private address" or "static address". The discussion was focused on finding a neutral name for the feature, with an aim to drive its adoption.</summary>
