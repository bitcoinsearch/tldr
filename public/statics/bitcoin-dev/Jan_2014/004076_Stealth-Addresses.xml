    <summary>In a conversation with Peter Todd, Jeremy discussed the use of two EC points in the stealth address - one for payment and one for ECDH. The reason behind this approach was to make delegating detection possible so that spending keys don't have to be online to detect payments. However, this approach got dropped. Instead, Jeremy decided to put both pubKeys in a 2-of-2 multisig to prevent malicious senders from triggering false positives on the online detection key. This also prevents funds from being controlled by a payer. Although there could still be a false positive, the funds would be trapped, making it unlikely for anyone to do so.Jeremy requested a review of the Gist and TXs on TestNet to see if it aligns with expectations. He also asked for a review of the discussion around doing two ECDH operations with a single ephemeral key.</summary>
