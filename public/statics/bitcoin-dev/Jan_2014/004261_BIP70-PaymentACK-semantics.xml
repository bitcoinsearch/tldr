    <title>BIP70: PaymentACK semantics</title>

    <summary>In a discussion between Pieter Wuille and Kevin Greene, the question was raised whether the wallet should broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network when it receives an ACK or always assume that the merchant server would do that. Wuille believes that receiving an ACK should mean that the receiver takes responsibility for getting the transaction confirmed. However, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, disagrees with this and points out that it is within the customer's economic incentive and right as a free person to work to get their transaction relayed to the network and confirmed in parallel with whatever the merchant is doing. BIP 70 also states that the customer broadcasts the transaction in addition to sending the Payment message.</summary>
