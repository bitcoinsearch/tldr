    <summary>The goal of using Tor hidden services is not to hide P2P nodes but rather to provide authentication and encryption for secure connections. The 6-hop hidden service circuits are overkill for this purpose, and a 3-hop circuit would work just as well for most nodes that aren't Tor-exclusive. Using Tor hidden services as an authentication method ensures that only the person with the private key can connect to it, making it more secure than relying solely on clearnet IPs. However, if a node is already compromised, moving communication to Tor does not change that. The use of Tor may result in network slowdowns, and if widely adopted, could reduce overall transactions per second on the Bitcoin network.</summary>
