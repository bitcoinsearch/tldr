    <summary>On January 16, 2014, Luke-Jr shared a link to a Github pull request that contained several improvements which he claimed were well-tested and stable. However, he noted that one of the improvements regarding autoconf required a rebase and comments from jgarzik and himself in regards to -enable-frontends=. Luke-Jr expressed concern about the other improvements as they affected mining/consensus and wanted more reviewers and testers to acknowledge (ACK) them before merging. The email was addressed to Wladimir.</summary>
