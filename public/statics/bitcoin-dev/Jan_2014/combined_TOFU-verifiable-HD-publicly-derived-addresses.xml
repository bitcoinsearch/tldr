    <summary>The conversation revolves around Alan Reiner's proposal of authenticatable derived addresses for depositing coins. The proposal suggests a scalar, base address instead of certification to authenticate the deposit. Certification requires an online private key for authentication, while a scalar, base address does not. To derive the scalar, HD address public derivation could be used. The current payment messages are at the application level, but there is a possibility of adding another level of signed messages with a different offline X509 key to upload signed addresses in batches. However, this approach has inferior characteristics and violates protocol layering. The discussion also highlights the usefulness of TOFU validatability of the low-level address format and the consideration of augmenting the derivation with Timo Hanke's bind to contract hash. Overall, the conversation delves into various technical aspects related to the proposal and its implementation for secure depositing of coins.</summary>
