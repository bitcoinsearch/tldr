    <summary>There is a pull request for CPfP that remains open by luke-jr. It is considered useful because it closes the gap between how bitcoin transaction fees are attached by the sender and modern economic situations where the receiver is willing to pay a fee. Mark Friedenbach pointed out the pull request in response to Wladimir's inquiry about issues not being addressed by Odinn Cyberguerrilla's organization. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist from BitPay, Inc., signed off on the email.</summary>
