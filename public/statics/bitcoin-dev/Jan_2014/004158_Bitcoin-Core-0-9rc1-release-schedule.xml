    <summary>In this conversation, the discussion revolves around merging CPFP (Child Pays for Parent) in upstream. BitPay wants to see this happen but there are disagreements between people regarding various edge case handling and implementation details which is preventing the merger. Luke-Jr mentions that the proposals are well-tested and stable for months now. However, Wladimir explains that some of the proposals are controversial as they affect mining/consensus and he would like to see ACKs from more reviewers and testers before merging. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, is also part of the conversation. The emails end with an advertisement for CenturyLink Cloud and a link to join the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</summary>
