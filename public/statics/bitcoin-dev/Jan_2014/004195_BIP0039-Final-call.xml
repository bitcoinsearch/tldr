    <summary>In an email conversation, Thomas Voegtlin thanks for a new proposal by Slush and suggests implementing checksums that do not depend on the wordlist to avoid problems of collisions once users ask for wordlists in every language. This approach will also allow implementing variable stretching proposal by sipa, but he understands that it may not be possible because of the computational requirements of devices such as Trezor. However, Peter Todd argues that trezor can bruteforce 8 bits == 0 and generating seed taking 10-30 seconds doesn't seem like a big deal. He also suggests that even a 1/256th "checksum" will really cut down on the number of mistakes made and money lost.</summary>
