    <summary>There is an issue with the master branch of Bitcoin where leveldb renames all .sst files to .ldb, causing the 0.8.x version of Bitcoin to think the index is corrupt. A workaround to allow 0.8.x to work again is to simply rename all the files from .ldb back to .sst. The fix for Bitcoin's leveldb is being discussed on GitHub. The developers are planning the next major release of Bitcoin, version 0.9rc1, in February 2014. However, there are still open issues that need to be resolved before release, and they are requesting input from the community regarding any other issues or bugs that should be addressed.</summary>
