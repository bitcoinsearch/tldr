    <summary>The discussion is centered around fair advertising rules, particularly in the context of dynamic pricing and revocable bids in trading. The concern is that merchants may use aggressive tactics such as retracting offers after partial commitment from customers or systematic abuse of pricing mistakes. One approach is to send a payment message to the merchant who then broadcasts the transaction to claim funds, with the user relying on the merchant for retraction. Another approach is for the user to broadcast the transaction and payment message to the merchant. To prevent retraction, the transaction can be bound to the payment message using a hash function. It is noted that if a merchant systematically retracts advertised offers, it could be evidence of unfair trading leading to censure.</summary>
