    <summary>The context is a PGP signed message, discussing the issue of proper Unicode handling in relation to cryptocurrencies. The author expresses concern that if there are issues with input method or machine changes, it may render coins inaccessible due to decomposed vs. compatibility forms. There is also discussion of encoding a 128-bit random number using its hash as a private key, and potential difficulties with understanding the checksum. The author suggests a possible solution involving brute force, but notes that this may be expensive for a trezor if k is large. Finally, the message concludes with a GPG signature.</summary>
