    <summary>In this context, the conversation revolves around different ways to improve the privacy and security of SPV wallets. Mike Hearn suggests that SPV wallets should identify nodes on the clearnet via their addr announcements+service flag, select some of these nodes using standard clearnet anti-sybil heuristics, and connect without using Tor. However, Miron suggests that connecting through Tor would preserve the privacy of the SPV node and reduce the ability of an attacker to MITM because the routing varies with each exit node. Additionally, it would be good to gossip the mapping of (IP -&gt; onion address) to allow detection of a future MITM since the MITM can't spoof the onion fingerprint.</summary>
