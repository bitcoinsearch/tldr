    <summary>When a Payment message is sent and the server goes silent after receiving it, the delivery can be retried. However, the merchant can still force transactions into the wallet even if no ACK has been received. In such cases, there will be no retries and the wallet will consider the payment as not made. The ACK is not particularly important in the current design. If this situation becomes frequent, improvements can be made, but it is unlikely to happen.</summary>
