    <summary>On January 20, 2014, Slush posted a message on GitHub regarding the BIP39 proposal, which had been reconsidered based on feedback from the community. The proposal no longer requires a specific wordlist, allowing clients to use their own preferred words. This makes it possible for generated mnemonics to be applied to any other BIP39-compatible client. However, there is still some confusion about how different word lists can be compatible with each other. The message also stated that the Trezor firmware was approaching its release and they needed to finalize this part of the firmware. They requested the last comments on the current BIP39 draft. Luke questioned whether the implementation should be a client-side thing rather than being implemented in the Trezor firmware.</summary>
