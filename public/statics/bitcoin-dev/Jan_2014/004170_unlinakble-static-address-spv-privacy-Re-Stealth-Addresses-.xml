    <summary>In an email exchange, Troy Benjegerdes raises concerns about mechanisms to keep coin flows private and who would pay for them. He also questions the impact on data size and centralization of 'full' nodes. Peter Todd responds by stating that the exact encoding is still undetermined, but other encodings he proposed in his original paper are the same size or even smaller than a standard transaction. Todd's response does not address Benjegerdes' concerns about cost and centralization.</summary>
