    <summary>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers on January 13, 2014, Gregory Maxwell proposed the use of stealth addresses as a solution for privacy concerns. Gavin Andresen expressed concern that using stealth addresses would make it difficult for non-technical users to make payments without errors. Maxwell countered that if someone is capable of using the payment protocol, they probably do not need stealth addresses. A practical example was given where someone could provide a business card with a QR code containing a stealth address for receiving Bitcoin payments; this would be an improvement over giving out a regular Bitcoin address. The discussion concluded with the consensus that stealth addresses should be made easier to use.</summary>
