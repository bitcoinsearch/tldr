    <summary>In an email conversation, Jeremy Spilman suggests using a 160-bit curve for d2/Q2 and e/P when payment is only being sent to Q1, resulting in shorter code and faster multiplication. However, he also acknowledges that if it weakens privacy, it may not be worth the added complexity. Additionally, the use of a super-fast hand optimized code for a 160-bit curve may not exist, making it slower in practice and adding extra code to carry around.</summary>
