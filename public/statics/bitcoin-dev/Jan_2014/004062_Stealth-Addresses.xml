    <summary>In an email conversation on January 13, 2014 at 19:40, Roy Badami expressed his desire to give out a business card with a stealth address instead of just a Bitcoin address. This would be considered a major advance for him. Drak agreed with this sentiment. A stealth address is a privacy feature that allows the owner of the address to receive payments without revealing their public address.</summary>
