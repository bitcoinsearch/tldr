    <summary>In January 2014, Daniel Fraga posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about a small donation he received without any fees. He was concerned that this type of transaction is usually rejected by miners and wondered if there was a way for the receiver to pay the fee when the sender didn't. He suggested that Bitcoin-qt could warn the receiver about receiving a transaction without a fee and offer the option to attach a fee for faster confirmation. Ben responded with a suggestion to create a transaction that spends the output to yourself while attaching a fee to it. Miners would need to mine both transactions to grab the fee, but no protocol changes would be needed. Though likely done manually, software could simplify the process.</summary>
