    <summary>In an email exchange in December 2013, Gregory Maxwell and Drak discussed the NSA's potential ability to change every download of bitcoin-qt. They agreed that encryption was necessary, but Maxwell asserted that checking the hashes was the only cure for the problem. In response, Drak argued that the downloads were already protected by actual signatures with offline keys, which he believed to be more secure than SSL encryption.Maxwell replied that he used to think encryption was important, but the exchange had convinced him otherwise. He suggested that kerberized telnet with no encryption but with integrity checking would be a more secure option than "secure" shell. Additionally, Maxwell brought up the issue of malicious memes being inserted into emails that tried to get him to buy things below his signature. He proposed moving the mailing list to a new server and included a link to http://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/WhyChooseSavannah/ as a potential option.</summary>
