    <summary>A user named D창niel Fraga received a small donation of 0.00121 BTC without any fees attached. D창niel was hoping that the transaction would be included in a block after a few days, but it was removed by Blockchain.info. D창niel suggested that if the receiver could pay a fee when the sender didn't pay any fee, it would be nice. For example, he suggested to pay a fee of 0.0001 BTC to receive 0.00121 BTC. Ben Davenport replied that you can create a transaction that spends the output to yourself and attaches a fee to that transaction. No protocol changes are needed for this process. However, likely, you'd have to do this by hand, but software could be written to simplify doing it.</summary>
