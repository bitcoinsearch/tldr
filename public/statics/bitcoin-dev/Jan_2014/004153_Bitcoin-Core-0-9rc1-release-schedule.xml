    <summary>BitPay, a Bitcoin payment processor, is interested in seeing Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) changes merged upstream. However, disagreements regarding edge case handling and implementation details have prevented merging. While some changes were deemed well-tested and stable for months, others affecting mining/consensus require more reviewers and testers before merging. Garzik notes he is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</summary>
