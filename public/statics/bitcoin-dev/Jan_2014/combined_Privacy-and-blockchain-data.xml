    <summary>Bitcoin wallets maintain transaction outputs while preserving privacy. The set of all transactions associated with scriptPubKeys in the wallet is kept up-to-date without scanning the blockchain for relevant data, which is essential for scalability, efficiency, and privacy. However, syncing a wallet can leak information about coins owned, making it vulnerable to internal and global attackers. Basic functionalities of spending funds, receiving new funds, detecting unauthorized spends, and detecting confirmation are explained, while scalability and efficiency are improved by spreading work across multiple nodes at both per-block and within-block levels. Deterministic wallets using BIP32 or similar technology have become popular due to their simple backup model. Bloom filters, prefix filters, and cryptographically blinded schemes are explored as query schemes, while correlation attacks and DoS attacks are addressed. Address use, management, and generation are discussed to solve the problem of users expecting quick notifications of new transactions paying any address generated by their wallet while maintaining privacy.The email conversation discusses the trade-off between privacy and bandwidth in Bitcoin wallets. One way to make a privacy/bandwidth trade-off is to generate addresses with common prefixes, where the length of the prefix determines the anonymity set. However, this expands the potential attackers to anyone with a copy of the blockchain instead of just those watching SPV queries. Therefore, using non-specific filters and prefixed addresses for incoming payments is suggested for better privacy. Also, prefix filters would be matched against all txouts in blocks rather than UTXO. Furthermore, change txouts are not recommended to have prefixes to prevent obvious identification of spend versus change addresses in a transaction. If an 8-bit prefix is used, there would be around 10,000 transactions in the monitored UTXO. If someone knew the different days/time-periods a user transacted, they could figure out their prefix. Additionally, anyone a user transacts with would know their prefix outright, allowing for obvious identification of spend versus change addresses in a transaction. The article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin wallets and their functioning.</summary>
