    <summary>In a conversation on January 10, 2014, Peter Todd mentioned the possibility of making stealth addresses include a second pubkey for communication purposes. This second pubkey could either be unused in the scriptPubKey or part of an n-of-m multisig. Additionally, it would be possible to outsource the effort of scanning the blockchain by giving the third-party that key. The idea is exciting, but it would need a prototype implementation before becoming a BIP. There are two versions - one with no prefix and one with a prefix, which is harder to implement due to uncertainties around how to force the prefix and the availability of indexes. Peter Todd added this idea to his to-do list, which was already quite long.</summary>
