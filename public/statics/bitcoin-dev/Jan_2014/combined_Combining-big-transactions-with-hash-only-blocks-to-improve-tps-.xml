    <summary>Bitcoin developer Jorge Tim贸n proposed two optimizations on January 22, 2014, to improve the transaction processing rate and anonymity of the network. The first optimization is to keep only hashes of transactions included in a block and transfer all transactions separately, which removes redundancy and allows for more consistent bandwidth utilization. This method also reduces block propagation time and allows for 50tps in a 1MiB block.CoinJoin is the second optimization proposed by the author, which allows many people to send coins with one transaction, thus increasing the effective transaction rate. However, it induces delays that can take some time due to collaboration between users in real-time. As a fallback where CoinJoin is not applicable, the author proposed Jumbo transactions, which remove the CoinJoin-induced delays while keeping transaction sizes big. Jumbo transactions do not mix coins and therefore do not increase anonymity of the network, but offer benefits such as no wait time for every participant to sign the transaction, backward compatibility with the current transaction system, and more suitable for POS payments. The proposal suggests that Jumbo transaction size limit should be made lower than CoinJoin to make fees for these transactions higher and create an incentive to only use them when necessary.The idea of not rebroadcasting transactions as part of blocks is being considered as it can help cut network traffic by almost half. However, if miners only receive the hashes of transactions, they may find it difficult to validate blocks and mine on top of a block when they don't know if it's valid. The use of zkSNARKs could be used to prove that hash-only blocks have valid transactions, however, generating it may be inefficient. Various issues related to these optimizations are also discussed, such as selfish miners keeping a subset of transactions for themselves, creating an incentive to mine only well-distributed transactions to lower orphan rate, and the potential for invalid transactions to be sneaked into a block. To mitigate these problems, nodes should verify all transactions before propagating a block and not accept a block before it gets verified. Additionally, the Jumbo transaction size limit can be made lower than CoinJoin, making fees for these transactions higher and creating an incentive to use them only when necessary.References were provided to various sources that discuss increasing the network hashing power by reducing block propagation time and Bitcoin privacy for the real world. Ultimately, these proposed optimizations could improve tps and network anonymity while mitigating problems related to network traffic and transaction verification. However, there are potential issues such as selfish miners keeping a subset of transactions for themselves and releasing them only with a new block. Therefore, nodes should verify all transactions before propagating a block to mitigate this problem. Overall, the proposal offers interesting insights into improving Bitcoin's efficiency and privacy.</summary>
