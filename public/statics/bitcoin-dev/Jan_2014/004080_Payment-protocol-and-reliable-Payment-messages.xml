    <summary>In an email conversation on January 14, 2014, Mike Hearn posed a hypothetical question about payment requests and merchants changing their minds. The email thread discusses the legal binding of a payment request for a specified amount of time, where if the merchant changes his mind after receiving payment from the customer, it is considered problematic. The email also talks about how a payment request is legally binding, and the contract becomes valid if the customer accepts the offer by paying. It mentions that there are extreme cases covered by law that can override this process. The email concludes with questions about the relevance of an expiry time in the message and the purpose of a payment request if it's not binding.</summary>
