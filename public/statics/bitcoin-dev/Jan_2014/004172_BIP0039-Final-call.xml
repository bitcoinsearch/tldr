    <summary>A group of developers have implemented the latest specification in bitcoinj, using a wordlist provided by slush+stick. The implementation seems to be working fine and has been approved by the group. Meanwhile, slush wrote a message to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, stating that they have reconsidered all comments received from the community regarding their BIP39 proposal. The proposal now doesn't require any specific wordlist, allowing clients to use their own preferred list of words. Generated mnemonic can then be applied to any other BIP39-compatible client. Slush requested the last comments on the current BIP39 draft as they are moving towards the release of Trezor firmware and need to finalize this part of the firmware. The email contained a link to the current draft of BIP39 on GitHub. Additionally, the email contained an advertisement for CenturyLink Cloud, with a quote or a free trial available for those interested in enterprise cloud services.</summary>
