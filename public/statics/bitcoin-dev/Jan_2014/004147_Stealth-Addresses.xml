    <summary>There is a suggestion to consider the name "Confidential address" instead of "private key" for better accuracy and confidence. This name would be useful in multinational corporate internal international settlement, where companies can use bitcoin for their transactions without competitors being able to detect them. The term "stealth" is not considered the best option as it connotes negative associations such as stealing, hiding, and sneakiness.</summary>
