    <summary>On Jan 27, 2014, Andreas Schildbach discussed the landscape of scan-to-pay transactions in Bitcoin. He assumed that at least 50% of Bitcoin transactions were initiated by a BIP21 URL encoded into a QR-code. However, he had tried to encode a payment request into a Bitcoin URL and used his existing work on encoding transactions into QR-codes.Jeremy Spilman found this work interesting and asked about the process after a payer scanned the QR code with the protobuf PaymentRequest. He inquired whether they used their own connectivity to submit the payment response. To improve the process, he suggested putting a Bluetooth address in the payment_url inside the PaymentDetails message for the smartphone to send back the Payment response and get PaymentAck.Andreas Schildbach had already prototyped placing a Bluetooth MAC address into the payment_url, which was mostly the same mechanism as Tap to Pay.</summary>
