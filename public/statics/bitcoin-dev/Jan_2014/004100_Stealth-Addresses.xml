    <summary>The conversation between Roy Badami and Jeff Garzik revolves around finding an appropriate name for a type of address that is not deprecated. The name "routing address" is suggested, but it is unclear whether the familiarity with bank routing numbers adds value or not. Jeff suggests "static address" as a reasonable attempt to describe the intended use/direction. Roy questions if the average user would understand this term and proposes a longer alternative. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist who works at BitPay Inc.</summary>
