    <summary>Mike Hearn expressed concerns about the brittleness of SPV privacy parameters, stating that users tend to turn down such parameters for little bandwidth usage, leading to almost no privacy. He believes this issue can be resolved with the implementation of bandwidth modes and monitoring. However, he acknowledges that the underlying trade-off will always exist, as fewer bandwidths make it harder, and more addresses to check also makes it harder. He suggests that users should have better options than the current situation that could result in lost funds. Peter Todd replied to Mike's concerns, agreeing that HD wallets used properly without re-using addresses will quickly lead to a fairly full bloom filter unless addresses are expired. Todd supports the need to provide users with better options to address the issue.</summary>
