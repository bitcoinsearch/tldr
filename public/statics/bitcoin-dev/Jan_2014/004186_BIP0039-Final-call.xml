    <summary>The email conversation revolves around the issue of proper Unicode handling in Bitcoin. It is suggested that Unicode canonicalization should be performed before any text hits the crypto code, and there are algorithms available to automatically resolve such issues. However, it is still important to handle Unicode properly to prevent accessibility issues for users who may switch input methods or machines. In regards to BIP39 implementation, MultiBit plans to use the implementation present in Bitcoinj, which has received interest from 100% of clients. The word list will be generated internally and confirmed through a retyping operation to detect character encoding transpositions. While the first word list implemented will be in English, alternative non-English word lists will be integrated to make it easier for the global community. Users will be able to select their language and locale, with a fallback to English if necessary.</summary>
