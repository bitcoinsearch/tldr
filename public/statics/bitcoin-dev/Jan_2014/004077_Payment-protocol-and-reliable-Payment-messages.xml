    <summary>The context of the conversation involves a proposal by an individual named Pieter Wuille regarding the use of a payment protocol for face-to-face payments. The proposal entails using payment requests via NFC or QR, payment messages and payment confirmations through Bluetooth. Wuille suggests that this can be done by incorporating a Bluetooth mac address into the payment_url. The person responding to the proposal acknowledges this suggestion and expresses no issues with it.</summary>
