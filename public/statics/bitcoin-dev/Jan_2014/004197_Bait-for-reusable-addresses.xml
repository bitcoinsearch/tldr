    <summary>In the context provided, it is stated that the current implementation of SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) has issues relating to privacy and bandwidth usage. Specifically, users have been known to turn down privacy parameters in exchange for lower bandwidth usage, resulting in bloom filters that offer little privacy. However, it is noted that this issue is not fundamental but rather a result of the current implementation being used on a wide range of devices without any monitoring or bandwidth modes. It is expected that this issue will be resolved at some point in the future.</summary>
