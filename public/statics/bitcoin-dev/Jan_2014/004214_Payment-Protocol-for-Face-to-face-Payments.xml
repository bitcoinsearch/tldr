    <summary>The author has implemented a prototype on a branch of Bitcoin Wallet that leverages the payment protocol for face-to-face payments. The NFC tap-to-pay use case currently works by publishing a BIP21 URL using an NDEF URI message, supplemented by a Bluetooth MAC address. The author proposes that instead of the BIP21 URL, a BIP70 payment request be published using an NDEF MIME message where the paymentUrl field contains a Bluetooth URL with the MAC address of the payee. Payment message and PaymentACK reply are then used to finish the payment. For scan-to-pay, the author encoded a payment request into the bitcoin URL using protobuf serialization and Base43 encoding. Finally, the payment protocol URLs can be used for links published on web pages and may provide a replacement for the BIP72 specification.</summary>
