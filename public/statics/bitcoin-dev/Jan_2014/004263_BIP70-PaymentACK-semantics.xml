    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen from January 30, 2014, they discuss the intent of giving customers a great experience when it comes to Bitcoin transactions. Garzik poses a question about whether the merchant or processor should take responsibility for getting a transaction confirmed. Andresen responds by suggesting that wallets should be allowed to experiment with different ways of broadcasting transactions to see what works best in practice. While the discussion is brief, it highlights the importance of creating a positive user experience in Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
