    <summary>Andreas Schildbach, a well-known developer in the Bitcoin community, was suggested to use .bitcoinpaymentrequest files with the right MIME type instead of packing a file into a URL. However, when Andreas tried this method, he found that Chrome, the AOSP browser, and Firefox all insisted on handling the link with their download manager, which required an additional click. The download manager was a separate component that was not updatable with the browser, and Firefox ignored the click altogether. Despite registering the correct MIME type and setting the MIME type of the href just in case, Andreas did not find success and asked for suggestions on what else to try.In certain contexts, using a file approach to download and open a Bitcoin URI may be the best option. However, this requires an additional click using a download manager, which some users may find inconvenient. A Bitcoin URI with r= eliminates the need for this extra click but may not always be applicable. For example, when sending payment requests through messaging apps or email attachments, a file approach is likely the better choice. Overall, it seems that there are limitations to using .bitcoinpaymentrequest files with the right MIME type, and developers may need to consider alternative solutions depending on the context.</summary>
