    <summary>In an email chain discussing the naming of a new feature in Bitcoin, Peter Todd suggests using "incognito addresses" to describe the feature when users want their transactions to be private. He also mentions the importance of ensuring that the address format can be upgraded in a backwards compatible way and asks for performance figures on how efficient scanning the blockchain for matching transactions is. The discussion veers off-topic with talk of painting a shed and a humorous comment about not having to worry about cache invalidation. Overall, the conversation is technical in nature and focused on the development of Bitcoin.</summary>
