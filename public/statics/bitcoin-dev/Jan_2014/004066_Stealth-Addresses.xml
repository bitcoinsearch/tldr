    <summary>In a thread about the use case of the payment protocol, Mike Hearn expresses his concerns about address reuse when reusing PaymentRequests without using stealth addresses. In response to this, Roy states that they are discussing extending the protocol to include stealth addresses in a future version, as the first version is not yet released. There was initial confusion around the thread but it was clarified that Mike's message was referring to using stealth addresses within the payment protocol.</summary>
