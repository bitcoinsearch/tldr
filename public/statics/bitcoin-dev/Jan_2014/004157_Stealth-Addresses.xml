    <summary>In an email conversation, Alan Reiner questioned whether there is a faster asymmetric scheme available for encryption. He mentioned ed25519 but was not sure if it could be used for encryption. In response, the suggestion was made that doing ECDH with their curve is nearly twice as fast as any other encryption available at this security level. Using a separate encryption method would require additional code and double the amount of data needed compared to using the ephemeral key for derivation. Therefore, it was concluded that there may not be much room for improvement in terms of encryption speed.</summary>
