    <summary>In a recent conversation about math, Adam noticed a discrepancy in the equation used by the other party. The equation Q'=Q+H(S) was mentioned and Adam initially thought it was a typo. However, upon checking the code, he found that it also said the same thing. He assumed that the equation should have been Q'=Q+H(S)*G instead, which would mean that Util.SingleSHA256() multiplies by G internally.</summary>
