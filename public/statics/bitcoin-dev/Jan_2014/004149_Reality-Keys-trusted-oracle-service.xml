    <summary>A Tokyo-based startup named Social Minds is launching a new service called Reality Keys, which provides real-world data in a format that can be used to complete or disregard Bitcoin transactions based on quantifiable facts. The service provides two cryptographic public keys for if the event happens and another for if it doesn't. Users then specify the date by which they would like to confirm the status or outcome of the particular event. The service is anonymous, as Reality Keys only provides the keys and has no knowledge of the contract or the amounts of Bitcoin at stake.</summary>
