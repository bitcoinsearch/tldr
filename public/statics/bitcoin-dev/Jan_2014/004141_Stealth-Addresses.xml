    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jeremy Spilman proposed calling "reusable addresses" as "payment key" or "reusable payment key" instead of "address". Peter Todd strongly disagreed and believed that it should be called "stealth address" for better marketing. He argued that users might get confused with the term "reusable address" as standard pay-to-pubkey-hash addresses are already reusable and transactions associated with them appear to be public knowledge. In contrast, the term "stealth address" sounds more appealing to users as it implies privacy, which is a major concern in Bitcoin transactions. Additionally, stealth addresses have had a lot of PR already and changing the name now may slow down adoption. Many people have heard of stealth addresses and understand the basic idea of why they're a good thing. Changing the name might risk people not making the connection when wallet software gets upgraded to support them.</summary>
