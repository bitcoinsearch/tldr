    <summary>In an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Stephane Brossier proposed an extension to the Payment Protocol (bip-0070) to address the case of recurring payments in Bitcoin. He suggested that as there has been a growth in companies embracing the subscription model and Bitcoin is growing into a mainstream currency, defining a protocol to address this need would be the next logical step. Brossier suggested a workflow similar to bip-0070 where the wallet would get a RecurringPaymentRequestAuth which describes the nature of the future recurring payments, the customer would then get prompted from the wallet to authorize it, and then the wallet would poll the merchant server at a well-defined frequency. If the PaymentRequest was within the bounds of what was accepted by the customer, the wallet would make the payment the same way it works for bip-0070. The author of this email, however, thinks that an implementation should be made before proposing a BIP as this will ensure a working solution.</summary>
