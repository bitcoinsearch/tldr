    <summary>In this email conversation, the topic of using signed payment requests is discussed. While the idea is not opposed, the issue of QR code size arises as signed payment requests can be too large for them. Additionally, most certificates are currently using RSA keys which are not very compact. The discussion then moves on to the mechanism behind addresses and trust stores. It is mentioned that while addresses may eventually become unnecessary with widespread adoption of wallets supporting BIP70, it still has some uses in the present. As for trust stores, they are just local databases and do not involve TCP. The conversation also touches on the idea of using Bitcoin for face-to-face transactions and the importance of signed payment requests for providing proof of purchase. Finally, the BitPay proposal for overloading URLs to work for both web browsers and wallet apps is briefly discussed.</summary>
