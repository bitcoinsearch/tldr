    <summary>In a discussion about Tor hidden services, the idea of nodes giving both public and private IPs to peers is questioned. Instead, it is suggested that a set of peers believed to not be sybils of each other could give hidden services run by other people. However, if this information is just obtained through addr announcements, it raises concerns about malicious nodes generating multiple hidden service keys and waiting for traffic to arrive. One suggestion to avoid this is to have clearnet nodes inform of their own hidden service IDs. Another suggestion is to require hidden service addresses to follow a certain pattern, like a fixed prefix, which would essentially be a proof-of-work scheme. The main goal is not to hide P2P nodes, but rather to have both clearnet and hidden service options available.</summary>
