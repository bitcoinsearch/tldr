    <summary>The use of prefixes in payment analysis can have side effects, such as allowing public elimination of candidate connections and making network flow analysis even more effective. SPV can be adjusted to improve privacy, and bloom is considered more private than prefix due to its wallet-to-node connection. Reusable addresses are useful for full node recipients and trusted server offload, particularly for static and donation addresses, and a second delegatable key can enable risk-free searching. However, there is no plausible mechanism yet to make reusable addresses SPV-like in network characteristics and privacy. Efficient crypto could solve this problem, but no solution has been found yet. Payment protocol can add another level of identity framework on top of TOFU addresses, and client-side certs can be experimented with for identity, such as enrolling with regulated entities like exchanges. Ultimately, the brittleness of SPV can be resolved by improving bandwidth modes and monitoring.</summary>
