    <summary>A proposal for BIP39 was reconsidered by the community, which now doesn't require any specific wordlist. The generated mnemonic can be applied to any other BIP39-compatible client as every client can use its very own list of preferred words. However, this has led to concerns that it could lead to users losing a lot of money because of fat-fingering the sentence. Peter Todd expressed his concern that it is enough to get a NACK from him on making the current BIP39 draft a standard. He questioned if any wallets implemented BIP39 this way already in released code.</summary>
