    <summary>The team behind MultiBit is working on implementing BIP39, with the help of Trezor and bitcoinj. They plan to use the BIP39 implementation present in Bitcoinj. However, proper Unicode handling is a serious issue they are addressing. They are generating the word list internally (12, 18, 24) and confirming it is entered correctly through a retyping operation. This will allow them to detect character encoding transpositions and alert the user before it becomes an issue. While English is the language of the first word list to be implemented, the team plans to integrate alternative non-English word lists to make life easier for the global community. To achieve this, the user will select their language, implying a locale, and then the word list will be selected from that locale if available with a fallback to English. This follows the same approach as resource bundles in Java.</summary>
