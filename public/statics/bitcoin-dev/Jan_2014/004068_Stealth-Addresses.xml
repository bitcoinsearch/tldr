    <summary>Mike Hearn suggested that signing a payment request for an individual is easy, depending on the kind of identification required. If an email address is sufficient, he suggests using a browser with a system keystore to go to comodo.com and get a free email certificate. However, this method may not be ideal for the business card scenario, as it requires the payer to scan a QR code on the business card and check that the email address displayed by their wallet matches the one printed on the card.</summary>
