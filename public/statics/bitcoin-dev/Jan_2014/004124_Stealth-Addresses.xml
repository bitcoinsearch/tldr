    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin development in 2014, there was a proposal to use the term "reusable address" for a type of Bitcoin address that can be used multiple times. The idea behind this terminology was to reinforce the notion that other types of addresses should not be reused. However, one participant in the conversation argued that all addresses are technically reusable and that calling them "public addresses" might be a better choice for common terminology. The conversation also included advertisements for CenturyLink Cloud as a provider of enterprise cloud services.</summary>
