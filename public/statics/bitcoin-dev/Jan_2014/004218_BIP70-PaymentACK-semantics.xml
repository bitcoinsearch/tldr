    <summary>Currently, there is no way to differentiate between a failed or rejected submission and a successful one beyond the freeform memo field. It would be beneficial to have an error code field in future versions. This suggestion would aid in identifying the cause of a failed submission and provide valuable information for troubleshooting. The addition of an error code field could potentially save time and resources by allowing for more efficient issue resolution.</summary>
