    <summary>In this email conversation, the participants are discussing whether the wallet should broadcast a transaction to the bitcoin network when it receives an ACK or rely on the merchant server to do so. Kevin Greene states that if there is no payment URL specified in the PaymentRequest, then the wallet is responsible for broadcasting the transaction, otherwise, it should rely on the merchant server. Pieter Wuille agrees and suggests that there needs to be a way for client applications to interpret the response, and that receiving an ACK should mean acknowledgement that the receiver takes responsibility for getting the transaction confirmed. The reason why this is not specified is due to some inability to come to an agreement on when to broadcast versus when to submit via HTTP.</summary>
