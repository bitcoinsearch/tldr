    <summary>In an email conversation between Jeremy Spilman and Gavin Andrese on January 12, 2014, Jeremy proposed a way to standardize Bitcoin addresses using pubkeys. He suggested adding a prefix to the addresses to make them more uniform. However, Gavin expressed his concern that this method would be too complicated for non-technical users. He suggested extending the payment protocol instead to simplify the process. Gavin warned that if they didn't make it easier for users, they would end up spending two years writing code to work around the complexity of the current system.</summary>
