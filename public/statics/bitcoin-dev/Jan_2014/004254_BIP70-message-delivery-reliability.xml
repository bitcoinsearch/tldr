    <summary>In an email conversation dated January 30, 2014, Mike Hearn discussed the use of arbitrators in Bitcoin transactions and whether it places unnecessary trust in third parties. He suggested that if merchants signed and agreed to unsigned transactions before broadcasting them, concerns about arbitration would disappear. However, Chuck pointed out that merchants can also lie by returning false HTTP response codes or broadcasting transactions despite receiving a "not found" code. He suggested adding signing to PaymentACK and other measures to address this issue in the future.</summary>
