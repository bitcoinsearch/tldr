    <summary>During a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Jeremy Spilman proposed to use the term "reusable address" in place of Bitcoin's standard addresses. He believed it would describe it best to non-programmers and encourage wallets to present options as 'one time use' vs. 'reusable.' However, Drak pointed out that all addresses are reusable, and to an average user, addresses are already reusable so there is little to distinguish the address format. Drak suggested using "public address" instead as common terminology.</summary>
