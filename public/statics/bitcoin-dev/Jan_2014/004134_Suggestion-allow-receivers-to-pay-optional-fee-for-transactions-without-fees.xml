    <summary>The author received a small donation of 0.00121 BTC without paying fees and doesn't know who sent it. Such transactions are usually rejected by miners, so the author hoped it would be included in a block after a few days, but Blockchain.info removed it. The author suggests that if the receiver could have a chance to pay the fee when the sender didn't pay any fee, it would be better than nothing. The author wonders if it is technically possible to allow the receiver to pay an optional fee or attach some fee to the transaction. Bitcoin-qt could even warn the receiver he received a transaction without fee and if he wants faster confirmation he could pay a fee. The author is not a programmer and tried this suggestion on Bitcointalk but nobody answered.</summary>
