    <summary>Mike Hearn, a developer, raised an important question on Bitcoin development mailing list in January 2014. He asked whether the wallet should broadcast the transaction to the bitcoin network when it receives an ACK or always assume that the merchant server will do that. He also pointed out that at that time, there was no way to differentiate between a failed/rejected submission and a successful one beyond the freeform memo field. He suggested having an error code field as well for future versions of Bitcoin. In his message, Hearn also included a link to CenturyLink Cloud, which he described as the leader in enterprise cloud services. He encouraged businesses to consider CenturyLink Cloud for their critical workloads, development environments, and everything in between. The email thread ended with a reminder about the Bitcoin-development mailing list and instructions on how to subscribe.</summary>
