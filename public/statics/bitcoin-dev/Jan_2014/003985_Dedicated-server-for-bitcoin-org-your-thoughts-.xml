    <summary>There is a discussion about the need for wallet users to know when an upgrade is available and have the ability to click an 'update' button to get a binary they can trust. Although deterministic builds are awesome, they do not fully solve this problem. Matt Corallo had implemented auto-updating using gitian updater, but it was eventually abandoned due to lots of bike shedding. However, there is no question about its possibility with the current build process according to Wladimir.</summary>
