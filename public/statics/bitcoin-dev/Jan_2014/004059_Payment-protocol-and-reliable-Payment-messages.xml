    <summary>In an email dated January 13, 2014, Pieter Wuille suggested optimizing BitcoinJ's payment_url feature by only sending payments through the URL and not broadcasting transactions on the P2P network. This would minimize the risk of a transaction confirming without the payment being received, though it cannot be guaranteed. However, another individual questioned the effectiveness of this approach, arguing that relying solely on HTTP connections could result in more failed payments due to potential issues with proxies or Bluetooth endpoints. They suggested having fallback payment URLs in case of such failures. Additionally, the proposal was noted to conflict with the use of the payment protocol for face-to-face payments, which require NFC or QR payment requests, Bluetooth messages for payment confirmation, and the inclusion of a Bluetooth MAC address in the payment URL.</summary>
