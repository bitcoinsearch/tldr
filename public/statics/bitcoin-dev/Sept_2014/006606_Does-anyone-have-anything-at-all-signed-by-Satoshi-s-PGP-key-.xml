    <summary>According to a recent communication from 'peter' via email, there is no evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto ever cryptographically signed any communications. This contradicts the common claim that "Satoshi PGP signed everything." The email also includes an attachment of a signature file, but it is unclear if this is related to the previous statement.</summary>
