    <summary>In a discussion about whether Satoshi Nakamoto ever used PGP for anything, Peter Todd asked if there was any evidence that Satoshi had access to a key. He also questioned the reliability of using PGP for identity purposes, as it is common knowledge that verifying someone's identity in person is necessary before trusting or signing their PGP or GPG key. Thomas Zander agreed with Todd's points and suggested that PGP cannot be relied upon for identity verification purposes regarding Satoshi.</summary>
