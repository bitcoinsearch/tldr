    <summary>In September 2014, Gregory Maxwell sent an email to a group of people regarding a proposal. He had privately reached out to some individuals but was also pinging the group for commentary on the proposal. However, it is possible that non-subscribed users were unable to access the file through sourceforge because the attachment through their web interface was giving back HTTP 500 error. Bryan's contact information was also included in the email.</summary>
