    <summary>Alan Reiner requested a recap and link for a discussion which was provided by Justus Ranvier on the Open Transactions wiki. He also provided a link to the implementation of it on Github. The BIP numbering process was criticized for silently pigeonholing proposals. Open-Transactions resolved this by changing their proposal naming scheme and their purpose codes to not rely on centrally allocated numbers. Justus Ranvier's public key ID is C3F7BB2638450DB5, and he is a member of Monetas.</summary>
