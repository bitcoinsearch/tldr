    <summary>Cozz Lovan has been working on improving Bitcoin Core's wallet code recently. To ensure that these changes can be implemented in the upcoming version 0.10, anyone who is interested in the performance of Bitcoin Core's wallet is encouraged to help test and review the improvements. Some of the changes include subtracting fees from amounts, improving ReorderTransactions, replacing OrderedTxItems with an in-memory map, and calling checkBalanceChanged() periodically instead of for every updated transaction. Other changes involve moving g_signals.SetBestChain below SyncWithWallets, calling SetBestChain before and after rescanning, and not flushing the wallet in AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe().</summary>
