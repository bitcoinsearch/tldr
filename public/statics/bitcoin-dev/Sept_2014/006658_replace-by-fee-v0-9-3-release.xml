    <summary>In a discussion about nodes propagating alerts without verifying them, Tom Harding questioned how a node could independently verify a double-spend alert. He relayed the first double-spend as an alert and kept a live list of relayed double-spend transactions on http://respends.thinlink.com. Peter Todd responded by discussing his recent port of the replace-by-fee branch to the v0.9.3 release and added that the release's scriptSig size limit increase adds a new category of double-spending exploit. However, he did not have time to add that exploit to his replace-by-fee toolkit for at least another week. In response to Lukeâ€™s question, there was no mention of a version compatible with CPFP.</summary>
