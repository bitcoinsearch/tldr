    <summary>Justus Ranvier had written to Alan, expressing his disappointment on not being mentioned in Alan's work, which they shared with him back in January and have been publicly documenting it ever since. In response to this, Alan asked Justus to recap/link the information so that it could be part of the discussion. Alan explained that he gets a lot of emails from a lot of people about a lot of things and nine months ago was an eternity in this world, therefore, he didn't want Justus to assume poor intentions or sneaky motives. Alan mentioned that he has no problem giving credit where it is due.</summary>
