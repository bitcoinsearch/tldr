    <summary>Pieter Wuille sent a new pull request on September 8, 2014 to bitcoin/bips. The pull request involved changes to the order of the rules and additional reference documentation about minimal pushes and number encodings. Wuille clarified that extra consensus rules cannot prevent someone from creating outputs whose spending transactions will be malleable. It was stated that there were no changes made to which rules are mandatory in v3, so this was considered to be a pure clarification and reorganization of the text. Gregory and Jeff were asked if their concerns were addressed and others were invited to make comments. The changes can be viewed at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/102/files.</summary>
