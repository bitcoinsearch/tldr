    <summary>The Bitcoin development mailing list discusses a proposal called "No-Collision" mode, which is suggested to allow for multisig BIP32 wallets. Justus Ranvier suggests calling it a "voting pool wallet," which was the original application for the arrangement. Alan Reiner responds and asks for Ranvier to recap or link their work. Ranvier provides links to their work on sourceforge and Github documenting that they have been publicly sharing their ideas since January 2014 and are currently implementing it in btcwallet. Ranvier expresses annoyance with the BIP numbering process, which can pigeonhole proposals. He explains how they have resolved this issue by changing the naming scheme for their proposals and purpose codes to no longer rely on centrally-allocated numbers.In addition to the discussion on the "No-Collision" mode proposal, the context contains a link to a white paper that helps in complying with PCI DSS 3.0 Requirement 10 and 11.5 using EventLog Analyzer. The link provided directs the user to a page where they can download this tool. It should be noted that the email is from the Bitcoin-development mailing list, which is followed by the end of the digest.</summary>
