    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin's development mailing list, Tom Harding asked how nodes could independently verify a double-spend alert. In response, he shared issue #4570, which relays the first double-spend as an alert. Harding has been keeping a live list of relayed double-spend transactions at http://respends.thinlink.com. He also mentioned that he had ported his replace-by-fee branch to the recent v0.9.3 release and added that the new version's scriptSig size limit increase adds a new category of double-spending exploit. However, he won't be able to add that exploit to his replace-by-fee toolkit for at least another week or so.</summary>
