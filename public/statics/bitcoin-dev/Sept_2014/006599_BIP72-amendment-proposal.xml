    <summary>The conversation discusses various topics related to Bitcoin wallets and security measures. The first part talks about the compatibility of non-BIP70 wallets with certain addresses, such as QR codes. The recommended hash function is also discussed, with SHA256 being suggested as a viable option. The conversation then moves on to discussing the use of certificates in verifying the authenticity of websites and the potential issues with X.509. An article is referenced that argues for the use of PKI despite its complexity, and the importance of adding an additional mechanism for security measures. Finally, the conversation touches on the benefits of using existing address hashes as both a backwards compatibility measure and an authentication mechanism.</summary>
