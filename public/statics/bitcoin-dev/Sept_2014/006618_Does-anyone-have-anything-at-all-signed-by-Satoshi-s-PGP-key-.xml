    <summary>The conversation starts with a psycho-analytical view on making love to partners as a subconscious desire to make love to oneself. The discussion then moves onto the concept of PGP WoT and its validity.

He further gives an example of how the online entity known as Satoshi is more relevant than meeting them in person. The conversation ends with a GnuPG v1 signature.</summary>
