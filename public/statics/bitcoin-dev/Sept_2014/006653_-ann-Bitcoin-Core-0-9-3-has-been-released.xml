    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.3 has been released which includes updated translations and brings only bug fixes. The users are recommended to upgrade their systems to this new release. If you are running an older version, shut it down and then run the installer on Windows or copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt on Mac or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt on Linux. The blockchain files will be re-indexed for the first time if you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier. However, the 'chainstate' of this release is not always compatible with previous releases, so the users should run the old release with the -reindex option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in case of switching back to a 0.8.x release.The new release includes several updates such as avoidance of a segfault on getblock if it canâ€™t read a block from disk in RPC. In Protocol and network code, it does not poll showmyip.com anymore as it doesn't exist anymore. In Wallet, it checks redeemScript size that does not exceed 520 byte limit and ignores (and warns about) too-long redeemScripts while loading wallet. In GUI, it fixes unicode character display on MacOSX. OpenSSL has been upgraded to 1.0.1i and miniupnpc has been upgraded to 1.9.20140701. Several contributors including Andrew Poelstra, Cory Fields, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Johnathan Corgan, Julian Haight, Michael Ford, Pavel Vasin, Peter Todd, phantomcircuit, Pieter Wuille, Rose Toomey, Ruben Dario Ponticelli, shshshsh, Trevin Hofmann, Warren Togami, Wladimir J. van der Laan, and Zak Wilcox have helped in bringing this release. Contributions from everyone who helped in translating on Transifex are also acknowledged.</summary>
