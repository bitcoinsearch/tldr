    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, a member named Thomas Zander responded to Peter Todd's question about whether Satoshi ever used PGP or had access to a specific key. Zander pointed out that trusted identity verification is crucial for using PGP or GPG keys effectively, which would disqualify PGP as a reliable method for identifying Satoshi. However, Zander suggested that if the key in question is on bitcoin.org, it's reasonable to assume that the owner of the key and the original owner of the website are one and the same. No evidence was presented to support this assumption.</summary>
