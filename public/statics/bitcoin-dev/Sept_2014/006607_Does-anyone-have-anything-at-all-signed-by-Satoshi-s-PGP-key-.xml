    <summary>Peter Todd, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has stated that he has no evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, ever signed any communications with PGP. Todd wrote in an email that he had never seen any cryptographic signatures by Satoshi and that he did not believe the widely held claim that everything was signed. However, Todd states that he is not certain whether Satoshi might have signed the occasional thing related to releases. Jeff Garzik, another Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, is also mentioned in the email.</summary>
