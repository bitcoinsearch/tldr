    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.3 has been released, which includes only bug fixes and updated translations, and it is recommended that users upgrade to this new release. Upgrading instructions have been provided for those running an older version, while users can report bugs using the issue tracker at Github. However, downgrading warnings have also been issued as the 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous releases. The release notes detail the changes in RPC, Protocol and network code, Wallet, GUI, and Miscellaneous categories. The IsStandard() scriptSig length has also been increased. The contributors to this release, including Andrew Poelstra, Cory Fields, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Johnathan Corgan, Julian Haight, Michael Ford, Pavel Vasin, Peter Todd, phantomcircuit, Pieter Wuille, Rose Toomey, Ruben Dario Ponticelli, shshshsh, Trevin Hofmann, Warren Togami, Wladimir J. van der Laan, and Zak Wilcox, have been acknowledged, as well as those who helped translate on Transifex. Melvin Carvalho praised the contributors who helped translate Bitcoin documentation on Transifex, expressing his curiosity about a particular change in Bitcoin code; Increase IsStandard() scriptSig length. Peter Todd, who made the change, removed the limits on the number of public keys for P2SH CHECKMULTISIG outputs. Previously, there were restrictions where even a 1-of-12 P2SH could be spent in a standard transaction yet multisig scriptPubKey's requiring more signatures quickly ran out of scriptSig space. Using more outputs is trivial and doesn't cost much. In the main.cpp file, the limit for the biggest standard txin was increased to 1650 bytes.The new release includes several updates such as avoidance of a segfault on getblock if it canâ€™t read a block from disk in RPC. In Protocol and network code, it does not poll showmyip.com anymore as it doesn't exist anymore. In Wallet, it checks redeemScript size that does not exceed 520 byte limit and ignores (and warns about) too-long redeemScripts while loading wallet. In GUI, it fixes unicode character display on MacOSX. OpenSSL has been upgraded to 1.0.1i and miniupnpc has been upgraded to 1.9.20140701. Contributions from everyone who helped in translating on Transifex are also acknowledged.</summary>
