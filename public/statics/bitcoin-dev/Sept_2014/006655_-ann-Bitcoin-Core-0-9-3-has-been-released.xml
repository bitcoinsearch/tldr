    <summary>Melvin Carvalho praised the contributors who helped in translating Bitcoin documentation on Transifex. Melvin also expressed his curiosity about a particular change in Bitcoin code; Increase IsStandard() scriptSig length. Peter Todd, who made the change, removed the limits on the number of public keys for P2SH CHECKMULTISIG outputs. Previously, there were restrictions where even a 1-of-12 P2SH could be spent in a standard transaction yet multisig scriptPubKey's requiring more signatures quickly ran out of scriptSig space. The newly allowed scriptSig space can only be used for signatures, so not much has changed from a "stuff-data-in-the-blockchain" point of view. Using more outputs is trivial and doesn't cost much. In the main.cpp file, the limit for the biggest standard txin was increased to 1650 bytes.</summary>
