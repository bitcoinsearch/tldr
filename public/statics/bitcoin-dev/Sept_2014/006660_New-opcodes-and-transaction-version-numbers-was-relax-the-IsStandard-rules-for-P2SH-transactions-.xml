    <summary>In an email thread from September 28th, 2014, Bitcoin developer Peter Todd suggests upgrading the address format to inform senders that they must use a transaction with an increased version number to solve a particular issue. However, he notes that creating new addresses for every new opcode would defeat the purpose of pay-to-script-hash (P2SH). Another developer responds by suggesting a single update to the address format that allows a transaction version number to be part of the serialization, which would prompt sending software to apply that version to the payment transaction. While this seems like it should work for soft forks, there may be some subtleties and safety concerns to consider.</summary>
