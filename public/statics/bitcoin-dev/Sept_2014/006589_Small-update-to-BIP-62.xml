    <summary>In a conversation between Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell, it was noted that the definition of rule 4 in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 62 may not be specific enough. Pieter acknowledged this issue and promised to write an update soon. Gregory also suggested that the rules should be reordered so that the applicable ones are contiguous and first, which Pieter agreed to. Additionally, there was discussion about extra consensus rules and how they cannot prevent someone from creating outputs whose spending transactions will be malleable. In response, Pieter sent out a new pull request for BIP 62 that changes the order of the rules, adds more reference documentation about minimal pushes and number encodings, and clarifies the limitations of extra consensus rules. It's important to note that no mandatory rules were changed in this revision, making it purely a clarification and reorganization of the text.</summary>
