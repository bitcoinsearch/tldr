    <summary>BitPay, a leading Bitcoin payment processor, has tested the impact of adding more bytes to QR codes and found that it does indeed make them harder to scan in low-light environments such as restaurants and pubs. In response to a suggestion that Base64 encoding of SHA256 was overkill, and that HTTPS should provide enough security, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, replied that BitPay had tested this theory and found that scannability was impacted. He added that adding a hash made QR codes more bloated and harder to scan, and that if SSL is useless, "we all have much bigger problems".</summary>
