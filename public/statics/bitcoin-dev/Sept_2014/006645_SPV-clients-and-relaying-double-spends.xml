    <summary>Aaron Voisine, the CEO of breadwallet, discussed the issue of double-spends in Bitcoin transactions and how they can affect SPV clients. He suggested that nodes should relay double-spends to alert the network about any attempts, which can be helpful for SPV clients who cannot detect double-spends on their own. However, he also acknowledged the concern of sybil attacks with this approach. Therefore, he proposed that nodes should also send reject messages, such as BIP61, to indicate which transactions they believe to be invalid but are still relaying. This proposal can increase the cost of performing a 0 confirmation double-spend attack on an SPV client above just relaying double-spends without indicating if a node believes the transaction to be valid.</summary>
