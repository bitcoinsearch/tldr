    <summary>The relevance of in-person vetting of identity is being debated within the bitcoin community with regards to its importance for community development and Satoshi's anonymous identity. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, argues that the currency of bitcoin development is code, and electronic messages describing cryptographic theses, making the real world identity irrelevant to whether or not bitcoin continues to function. He suggests that the fingerprint that matters most is the "online entity known as Satoshi," which is easily established without any in-person meetings. Garzik dismisses guidelines promoting PGP WoT as useless and "stupid geek wanking," arguing that a person's behavioral signature is what is relevant. Brian Hoffman, on the other hand, agrees that in-person vetting of identity is frustrating but insists that its value is undeniable. He believes that PGP signatures are fine assuming that an individual has established a pattern of use.</summary>
