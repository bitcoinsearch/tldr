    <summary>On September 15, 2014, Gregory Maxwell expressed concern about the possibility of a server replacing a public key and signature in all the same places. He requested that the discussion move to another list as it was off-topic. Another user agreed with his sentiment. In response, the original poster acknowledged that their post was also off-topic but believed it was still important for the intended audience to see it. The message is accompanied by a PGP signature indicating its authenticity.</summary>
