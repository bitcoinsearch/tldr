    <summary>The WoT (Web of Trust) has been criticized for its in-person aspect, but dismissing it as "geek wanking" is unfair. The value of in-person identity vetting cannot be denied as many governmental clearances and credentials require it. A person's behavioral signature can also be relevant, but this does not apply to all situations, such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) which recommends in-person verification before trusting or signing a formerly-untrusted key. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, argues that the "online entity known as Satoshi" is the relevant fingerprint and can be easily established without any in-person meetings. However, he acknowledges that this may not always apply, citing the example of "sipa," an online entity whose identity was claimed by someone with photo ID labeled "Pieter Wuille."</summary>
