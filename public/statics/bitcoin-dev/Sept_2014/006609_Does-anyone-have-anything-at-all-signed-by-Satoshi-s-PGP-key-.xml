    <summary>In an email conversation dated September 13, 2014, Jeff Garzik denied that Satoshi Nakamoto ever signed any private emails or forum posts. This statement is consistent with information provided by other sources, including a tweet by Peter Todd. It is possible that Satoshi may have signed things related to releases, but there is no evidence of this. For example, even the archive.org capture of bitcoin.org from January 31, 2009, which has a link to his PGP key, does not show any signatures. The earliest signature found by Todd is from Gavin Andresen in v0.3.20. Todd speculates that Satoshi may have created the PGP key only for security-related bug reports and questions whether he ever used PGP at all.</summary>
