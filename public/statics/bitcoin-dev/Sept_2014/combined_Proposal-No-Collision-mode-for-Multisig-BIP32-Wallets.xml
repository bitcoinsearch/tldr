    <summary>In January 2014, Justus Ranvier shared his work with Alan Reiner and expressed his disappointment that he wasn't mentioned in Alan's work. In September of the same year, Alan asked Justus to recap and link the information so that it could be part of the discussion. Alan explained that he gets a lot of emails about various things and nine months ago was an eternity in this world, therefore, he didn't want Justus to assume poor intentions or sneaky motives.Alan requested a recap and link for a discussion provided by Justus on the Open Transactions wiki. He also provided a link to the implementation of it on Github. The proposal put forth is for a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) related to multisig wallets based on BIP32. The proposal suggests that for an M-of-N multisig wallet, there should be N internal chains and N external chains. Each party is assigned a chain based on the lexicographic ordering of their wallet's root public key in the multisig, which guarantees that no parties are generating and distributing the same addresses. This also provides a certain level of built-in book-keeping.The proposal further suggests coins being received on chain 2*x were created by participant x (receiving), and coins received on 2*x+1 are change outputs created by participant x (outgoing). Thus, it's easy from simply looking at the wallet structure who was responsible for which transactions. An alternative suggestion given is that each "device" could be assigned a pair of chains, for example, for a 2-of-3 there may be three participants plus a CFO with a "watch-only" version of the multisig wallet. In this scenario, four pairs of chains might be used, but it's not clear how they would be assigned. The document linked in the proposal contains pictures to visually describe the concept and can be viewed here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bitcoinarmory-media/MultisigWalletNoCollide.pdf. If this proposal has been proposed before, the author considers it their contribution to documentation. Lastly, the author mentions that "No-Collision Mode" is not a great name and is open to suggestions for changing it.Justus Ranvier responded to Alan's request for a suggestion to change the name "No-Collision Mode" by offering to call it a "voting pool wallet" since that was the original application for this arrangement. He also expressed his desire for Reiner to mention their work since they had publicly documented it ever since they shared it with him back in January. Ranvier questioned whether the fact that they were implementing the idea in btcwallet made what they were working on unmentionable. The messages included PGP signatures and attachments of public key IDs.</summary>
