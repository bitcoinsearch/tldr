    <summary>In an email conversation between Matt Whitlock and Thomas Zander on September 15, 2014, the two discussed the idea of including a bitcoin public key in email signatures to establish proof of identity. However, Whitlock pointed out that this method would not work because simply attaching the public key to emails could allow the email server to replace it with a different one. This would result in the signature not verifying under the public key seen by everyone else. Furthermore, Whitlock suggested moving the discussion to another list as it was off-topic.</summary>
