    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 72 is being amended by adding an "h" parameter that includes the hash of the PaymentRequest message obtained through the "r" parameter. The purpose of this hash is to securely link the trust anchor, such as a QR code, to the payment request message and prevent certain apps from comparing address+amount fields as a workaround. This will also allow for more advanced BIP70 use cases. Once the apps read a matching hash, they will not need to compare any other fields. Julian Haight helped with the development of this standard. This amendment to BIP72 has been proposed on GitHub via a Pull Request.</summary>
