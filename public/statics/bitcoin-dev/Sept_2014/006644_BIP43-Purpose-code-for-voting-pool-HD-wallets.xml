    <summary>In this message, Gregory Maxwell discusses the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) process. He believes that the process is broken in the case of informational BIPs because proposals that require action from others do not logically belong in the same process as purely informational proposals that do not. Maxwell explains that the only reason the informational BIPs were proposed was to support the intent of BIP43.
