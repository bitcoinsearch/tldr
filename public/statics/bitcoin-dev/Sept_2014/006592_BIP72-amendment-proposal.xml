    <summary>In September 2014, a message was sent to the bitcoin-development-request list regarding the use of a hash to link a trust anchor, such as a QR code, to a payment request message in a secure manner. This approach would eliminate the need for some apps to compare address and amount fields, which could prevent certain advanced BIP70 use cases. The plan was well received, but concerns were raised about how this could affect supply chain payments on retail websites. The author requested a list of apps that perform this type of checking to better understand the potential impact of the change.</summary>
