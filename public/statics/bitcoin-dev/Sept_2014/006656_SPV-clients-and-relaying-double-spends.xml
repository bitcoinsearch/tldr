    <summary>During a discussion on 25th September 2014, Aaron Voisine shared his opinion that nodes should not propagate alerts without independent verification. He raised the question of how a node could independently verify a double-spend alert other than having access to an actual signed double-spend. In response to this, #4570 was relayed as the first double-spend alert. The person running this branch on mainnet maintained a live list of relayed double-spend transactions at http://respends.thinlink.com.</summary>
