    <summary>In an email exchange on September 12, 2014, Mark van Cuijk and a bitcoin development team discussed the use of a hash to link the trust anchor (QR code) to the payment request message in order to prevent apps from comparing address+amount fields. This would allow for more advanced BIP70 use cases. Van Cuijk requested a list of apps that perform this kind of checking, as he was working on a project in the supply chain that would require multiple outputs on a transaction. He listed Bitcoin Wallet, Hive Bitcoin Wallet (checked by source), and over 300 forks/clones of Bitcoin Wallet as examples of wallets that perform this kind of checking. The development team noted that not all wallets support BIP70 at all, which would need to be taken into consideration for advanced use cases.</summary>
