    <summary>A discussion on hash functions took place between Andreas Schildbach and Mike Hearn, in which the latter suggested that SHA256 is overkill for generating a bitcoin URI. He argued that 80 bits of entropy would be sufficient to keep QR codes compact while maintaining security. Schildbach evaluated available hash functions and asked for recommendations. There were concerns raised about X.509's ability to replace trust anchors established by scanning QR codes or tapping devices together. While signing with the key in the URI was suggested as an alternative, it was acknowledged that this approach would be harder than calculating a hash.</summary>
