    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Alan expresses his support for BIP43 and suggests adding a "Purpose" node to identify different tree structures in a wallet file. He proposes a non-hardened first-layer derivation for common trees and a "No-collision mode" for multisig BIP32 trees. These could be supported by changing the BIP43 "Purpose" index, and wallet software could recognize and react to the Purpose node for various tree structures. Clients with complex multi-layer trees that are unlikely to be recycled across users could use a "random" Purpose recognized by their system, but it would be better if that field was encoded in the root seed instead. Alan believes that putting an extra layer between the root and the "important" tree nodes provides flexibility to BIP32 as a whole.</summary>
