    <summary>The context suggests an efficient approach to improve the PaymentRequest system. The proposed approach involves adding another marker parameter to the end of the URL and another field to PaymentRequest containing an ECC signature calculated using the public key that hashes to the address in the URI. Upgraded wallets will then look for the additional parameter and expect to find PaymentDetails signed with the address key. PKI signing is still useful for providing identity for receipts, display on hardware wallets, dispute mediation, etc. This approach adds only a few characters to a normal, backward-compatible QR code and is not difficult to implement. During a discussion on this approach, it was suggested that leaving the implementation of different lengths to experimenters would be a good idea.</summary>
