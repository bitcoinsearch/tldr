    <summary>In a 2014 email exchange, Thomas Zander suggested including a Bitcoin public key in his email signature to establish that everyone had his public key many times in their email archives. However, he did not want to sign the emails. In response, it was pointed out that this method would not work as the email server could replace the public key with another one, which would cause verification issues when providing a signature later on. Therefore, it was necessary to sign the messages to ensure that the correct public key was being used.</summary>
