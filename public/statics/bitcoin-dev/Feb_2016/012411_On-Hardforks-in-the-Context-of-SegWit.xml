    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Simon Liu asks about the rationale for offering a discount from segregated witness, in which transaction input/output data is argued to be less expensive than signatures. Peter Todd responds that UTXO set space is significantly more expensive for the network as all full nodes must keep the entire UTXO set. He notes that engineering always has "magic numbers" involved and gives an example of his proposal to use a 99% miner vote threshold for hard-forks with the goal of increasing the block interval to 24 hours. While 24 hours may be considered a magic number, he argues that eliminating it with yet another meta level of engineering analysis becomes a game of diminishing returns.</summary>
