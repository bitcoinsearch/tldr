    <summary>This document proposes a set of best practice guidelines for creating heterogenous input script transactions (HITs) that minimize the adverse privacy consequences of such transactions and simultaneously maximize the effectiveness of privacy-improving techniques such as CoinJoin. There are two forms of HIT proposed: Standard form and alternate form. The formation of a standard form HIT is not possible in certain cases, where a compliant implementation may create an alternate form HIT. Clients which create intentional HITs must have the capability to form alternate form HITs, and must do so for a non-zero fraction of the transactions they create. The recommendations in this document aim to maximize the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing transactions, minimize the adverse privacy consequences of unavoidable heterogenous input transactions, and limit the effect on UTXO set growth.</summary>
