    <summary>To prevent significant cost blowups in the validation process of transactions, a restriction has been placed on non-segwit inputs. However, this move has been met with opposition as it could disrupt many services and potentially invalidate hash time locked transactions. The limitation on scriptPubKeys to 100 bytes and the prohibition of OP_CODESEPARATOR in them, along with push-only scriptSigs, have also raised concerns regarding native multisig. While this point is considered less important than the previous restriction, it still poses a problem.</summary>
