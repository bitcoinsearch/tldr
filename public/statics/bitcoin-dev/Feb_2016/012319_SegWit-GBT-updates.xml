    <summary>The conversation between Cory Fields and Luke Dashjr from February 1, 2016, discusses the use of "default_witness_commitment" within the GBT protocol. Dashjr suggests that it is better to leave it out of the standard protocol as enabling and encouraging centralization contradicts GBT's design principles. Fields questions this stance, arguing that some complexity can be skipped by providing a known-working commitment for passed-in-hashes. Dashjr acknowledges this point but stresses that having such a commitment could increase the odds of bugs in the process. They also discuss a commit by ckpool that introduces a bug in working code due to serializing a positive number as a signed one.</summary>
