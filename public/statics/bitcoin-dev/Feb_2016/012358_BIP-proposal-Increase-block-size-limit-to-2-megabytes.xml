    <summary>Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT have implemented an increase in the block size limit to 2,000,000 bytes, which has been reviewed by merchants, miners, and exchanges for a couple of weeks. A draft BIP has been provided with accurate sigop counting, existing sigop limit (20,000), and a new, high limit on signature hashing. After 75% hashpower support, there will be a 28-day grace period. Gavin Andresen has written a blog post providing a guided tour of the 2MB fork, as well as another blog post discussing a couple of the constants chosen. He encourages constructive feedback, but discourages arguments about whether or not it is a good idea to roll out a hard fork now.</summary>
