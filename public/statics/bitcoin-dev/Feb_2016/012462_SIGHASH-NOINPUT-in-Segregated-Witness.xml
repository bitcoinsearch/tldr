    <summary>Joseph Poon suggested using SIGHASH_NOINPUT flag for achieving a signature that does not include the outpoint being spent and the amount. He also added that the spent outpoint's script would be included as part of the signature. Bryan, in response to this, suggested considering other SIGHASH flag types while drafting BIP. He shared various proposed SIGHASH types and a 'Build your own nHashType' proposal draft link. There were some replies from jl2012 and petertodd about OP_CODESEPARATOR. Furthermore, a draft implementation of SIGHASH_NOINPUT was also shared. However, there were concerns raised about replay using SIGHASH_NOINPUT or something.</summary>
