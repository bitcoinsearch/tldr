    <summary>In a discussion concerning the Bitcoin Classic hard fork, Gavin Andresen responded to Adam Back's request for a security considerations section. Andresen suggested that he could write a blog post summarizing their Slack discussion of Simple Payment Verification (SPV) security immediately after the first greater-than-1mb-block if needed. Regarding testing the change against libraries, wallets, pools, stats servers and hardware, Andresen noted that it was happening by those providers themselves, and directed Back to the list on the Classic home page. When asked about a rollback plan, Andresen explained that the only voting in this BIP is done by the miners, which cannot be faked. When asked how he plans to monitor and manage security through the hard-fork, Andresen replied that he does not plan to monitor or manage anything; the Bitcoin network is self-monitoring and self-managing, with services like statoshi.info doing the monitoring, and miners and people and businesses managing the network as they do every day.</summary>
