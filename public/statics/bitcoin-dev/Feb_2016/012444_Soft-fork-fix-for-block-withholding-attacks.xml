    <summary>The context discusses the possibility of designing clients to warn users when a soft fork occurs, and the potential safety benefits of doing so. While the reference client can provide warnings for high POW softforks, many SPV clients cannot. The suggestion is made to implement a delay between version number changes and rule activation, allowing nodes to receive a warning recommending that they update.Additionally, specific guidelines are proposed for increasing difficulty intervals and updating targets at each difficulty re-targetting. The target would eventually reach 0 after 64 weeks, resulting in a difficulty that is 256 times higher than the header. Finally, the context notes that an attacker with 2% of network power could create five blocks for every block produced by the rest of the network.</summary>
