    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim√≥n questioned why being kicked out of the network is not considered a problem for the users of those nodes. Tom Zander replied that if a node is "old", it will stop receiving new blocks and would be "x-hours behind" with "x" increasing every hour. This results in unconfirmed transactions. Upgrading the software would provide an updated view of the network. Zander stated that nobody considers this to be a problem because it is not.</summary>
