    <summary>In a discussion about the implementation of a better header format and bigger block size for Bitcoin, Matt Corallo expresses his support for a proposal to implement changes in stages. However, he suggests that only one hardfork should be scheduled at a time to avoid complications. The first hardfork should include changes that are necessary in the near future based on reasonable designs. After seeing its outcome, a second hardfork can then be considered. Corallo agrees with most of the proposal but wants to spend more time considering Lukeâ€™s header changes and also suggests adding timewarp fixes for enhanced safety and reduced disruption. It is worth noting that any client designed for stage 2 should also be ready for stage 3.</summary>
