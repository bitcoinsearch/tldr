    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, Gavin Andresen responded to comments about the proposed 28-day grace period for miners to coordinate and upgrade their software in response to rule changes. He disagreed with the statement that there is no cost to a longer grace period, suggesting that some users may be kicked out of the network if they are running un-maintained full nodes. While he did not deny the possibility of technical reasons why an upgrade may take longer than 28 days, Andresen suggested that a longer time frame, such as a year, would be less controversial and safer for everyone. He also raised questions about the "95% better than 75%" comment and suggested that losing un-maintained nodes may not be problematic.</summary>
