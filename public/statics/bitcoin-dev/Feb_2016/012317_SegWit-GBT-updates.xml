    <summary>A discussion between Luke Dashjr and Cory Fields about the omission of the "default_witness_commitment" key in the Bitcoin protocol has taken place. Fields believes that omitting the key would encourage pools to build their own commitment, but Dashjr argues that it could make server-side implementation more vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. Dashjr suggests leaving the "default_witness_commitment" as a bitcoind-specific extension to encourage adoption, but recommends leaving it out of the standard protocol for now. Fields believes that the burden on mining software increases the risk of bugs in the process, but Dashjr points out that libblkmaker can be used to handle the heavy lifting. Fields also mentions that he has already fixed bugs relating to serialization or commitment creation in mining/pool software.</summary>
