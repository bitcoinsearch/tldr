    <summary>In this email exchange, Ryan Grant questions the process for changing the status of a BIP from Draft to Active when rough consensus is reached on the mailing list. He asks if the mix of wiki and mailing list is intentional and whether second-order reply commentary should go on the wiki or the mailing list. Luke responds by explaining that the wiki page is meant for leaving comments recommending or discouraging adoption of a completed BIP after discussion is over. He notes that all review should remain on the mailing list and suggests that any forum used for review should have indisputable records of moderation and user edits. Ryan then asks if it is necessary to ask for indisputable records of moderation and user cross-comment editing for all current and future forums that BIP authors might choose for review, given that the author-chosen forum may be in addition to the Bitcoin Wiki. He wonders if dump.bitcoin.it is a sufficient public record of contentious moderation or user cross-comment editing. Luke responds that as long as the wiki as a whole is verifiable, it would suffice, except for accounts/passwords.</summary>
