    <summary>On February 26th, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner sent an email congratulating someone on a successful implementation of the SKCP system. The person asked if it is possible for the person who performed the trusted setup to extract information from a proof, to which Lerner replied that it is not possible due to the information theoretic secrecy of the SKCP system. This holds true even in the case of malicious initialization.The SKCP system is based on cryptographic assumptions that the proofs cannot be forged. Therefore, the soundness of the scheme is guaranteed. The security of the SKCP system is maintained through the use of information theoretic secrecy, which ensures that no one can extract any information from the proof.Overall, the SKCP system is a secure and reliable way to maintain the integrity of data. It uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that the proofs cannot be forged and that no one can extract information from them. This makes it an ideal choice for anyone who needs to maintain the integrity of their data in a secure and trustworthy manner.</summary>
