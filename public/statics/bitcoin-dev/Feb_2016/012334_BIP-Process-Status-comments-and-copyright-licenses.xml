    <summary>In February 2016, Gavin Andresen expressed concern over the definition of "consensus" in regards to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. He believed that the definition gave too much centralized control to whoever controlled the mailing list and the wiki. He also acknowledged that any medium of communication would inevitably be controlled by someone, even if it is unmoderated. Andresen pointed out that the criteria for updating the status of BIPs was only relevant to observing their adoption and not to actually accepting them. Therefore, if the BIP process were to break down on this or any other point, it would not have any impact on the actual reality. To clarify this point, he added a statement to the end of the section stating that the criteria were not to be used as reasons to oppose or reject a BIP. If a BIP became actually and unambiguously adopted despite not meeting the outlined criteria, it should still be updated to Final status.</summary>
