    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.12.0rc3 binaries are available for download from https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.12.0/test/. The source code is also available on GitHub under the signed tag https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v0.12.0rc3. This release candidate includes bug fixes, new features, and other improvements. Preliminary release notes can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.12/doc/release-notes.md. Release candidates serve as test versions, and if no critical problems are found, this release candidate will be tagged as 0.12.0.The diff since rc2 includes changes such as renaming permitrbf to mempoolreplacement and providing minimal string-list forward compatibility, updating hardcoded seeds in January 2016, not absolutely protecting local peers, adding whitelistforcerelay to control forced relaying, security/export checks to gitian, and increasing the SUBVERSION_COLUMN_WIDTH of Peertable in qt.Additionally, a new certificate was used to sign the Windows installer, which should solve compatibility issues with Windows 7. The executables were made possible thanks to the gitian builders who kept up so quickly after tagging. Any bugs should be reported using the issue tracker at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues.</summary>
