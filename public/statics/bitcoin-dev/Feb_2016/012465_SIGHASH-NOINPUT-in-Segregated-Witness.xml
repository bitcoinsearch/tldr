    <summary>In an email conversation between Bryan Bishop and Joseph Poon, the topic of SIGHASH flags was discussed. Bryan suggested that if a BIP for a new SIGHASH flag is being drafted, then other types should be considered as well. Joseph responded by saying that he will review those proposals while drafting the BIP. He believes that there is a single clean way to achieve outsourcability for LN, but may be compatible with other arrangements. Joseph is hesitant to propose too much flexibility before there are clear use-cases, however, he is interested in hearing about other sighash flags if others have examples for them. Bryan also mentioned some concerns about replay using SIGHASH_NOINPUT in a previous conversation. Joseph thinks that SegWit resolves malleability without worrying about replay attacks in the event of key reuse. He believes that it is only safe to use the new sighash type inside segwit itself. The new sighash flag would only be used if its features are needed.</summary>
