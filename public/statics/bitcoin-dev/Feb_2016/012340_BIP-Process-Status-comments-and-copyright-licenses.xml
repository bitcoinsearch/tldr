    <summary>The discussion revolves around different types of consensus and the need to distinguish between them. BIP99 requires two concepts: "consensus rules" and "adoption consensus". The former refers to the id of a theoretical communication channel, while the latter pertains to how users coordinate to upgrade to a new channel. In this regard, BIP99 aims to establish safe deployment requirements for an uncontroversial hardfork, similar to those for softforks. However, the concept of "adoption consensus" needs a neutral term that doesn't favor softfork or hardfork changes. The proposal aims to clarify the meaning of "consensus" in four contexts: (1) consensus among developers for changes in the BIP process; (2) economic consensus to veto a soft-fork by firing the set of miners; (3) actual consensus in economic adoption of changed rules; and (4) the set of rules currently established as defining Bitcoin, enforced by an actual consensus of economically-relevant nodes. While context 3 can be disambiguated with "adoption consensus," context 4 is referred to as "consensus rules" or "consensus protocol." However, sharing the word "consensus" for all four contexts may still be confusing. Thus, suggestions are welcome to make this completely clear.</summary>
