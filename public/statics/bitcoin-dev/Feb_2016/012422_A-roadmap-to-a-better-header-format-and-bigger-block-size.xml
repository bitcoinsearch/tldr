    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, jl2012 proposed a 2-3 year roadmap with objectives to present better header format and bigger block size. Stage 1 is Segregated Witness (BIP141), which will not break any existing full or light nodes. This may happen in Q2-Q3 2016. Stage 2 is fixes that will break existing full nodes, but not light nodes, which may happen in Q1-Q2 2017. Fixes for stage 3 will break all existing full nodes and light nodes, and may happen in 2018 to 2019. The alternative roadmap suggests implementing stage 2, which will break existing full nodes and light nodes, mid-2017 or later and stage 3, which will fix the time warp attack, in 2018 to 2019. In terms of safety, the second proposal is better, but in terms of disruption, the first proposal is less disruptive. It is miners' responsibility, not the devs', to confirm that the supermajority of the community accept changes in Stage 2 and 3. The reference links provided are Matt Corallo's and Luke-Jr's proposals.</summary>
