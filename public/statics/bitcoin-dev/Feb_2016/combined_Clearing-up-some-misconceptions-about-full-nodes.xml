    <summary>Node software has improved significantly in terms of user experience, and running Bitcoin data on an SSD greatly improves the user experience. Although the number of full nodes worldwide is unknown, they are essential to ensure that all of Bitcoin's rules are being followed, making it trustless and secure. Running a full node as your wallet is recommended for increased security and privacy.The rollout of the hard fork to 2MB will affect the entire bitcoin ecosystem, and its rollout effect is difficult to plan in advance. However, users who want to move forward with the economic potential of the 2MB blocksize can keep their existing funds safe while testing the waters with the new blocksize. It is important to learn from past experiences, as hard forks are not done on a whim.There are several ways to run a full node as a wallet, but concerns have been raised about the viability of running a full node on a system that is also used for other purposes. However, when running a full node in non-mining mode, the CPU load is fairly light and the GPU is not touched at all. Certain misconceptions about full nodes need to be cleared up, such as the myth that there are only around 5,500 full nodes worldwide. Another myth is that there's no incentive to run nodes, but using a full node as a wallet is the only way to ensure that none of Bitcoin's rules have been broken, and it increases security by providing checks against possible attacks.To get the benefits of running a full node, it is recommended to use it as a wallet, preferably on hardware the user controls. Using cloud servers is not recommended since bandwidth and connections are not problems today, trust, security, and privacy are. Running Bitcoin-qt on a spinning hard disk can cause system responsiveness issues and disrupt user experience. However, moving the Bitcoin data to an SSD improves the user experience significantly.Overall, running a full node has minimal downsides while providing many benefits such as increased security and privacy. As the new blockchain builds momentum, the old one will eventually become obsolete. However, it may also become the digital equivalency of Silver and that is also a useful, profitable, and viable alternative with a proven history of success.</summary>
