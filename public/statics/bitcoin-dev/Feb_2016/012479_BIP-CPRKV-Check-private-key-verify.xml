    <summary>The discussion about the usefulness of a certain feature for LN is taking place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The feature being discussed involves the creation of a non-standard script to execute a payment in an altcoin, without requiring any new opcode. However, it is noted that this method will only work for coins that allow non-standard scripts, as it violates the standard output script assumption. While there was initial focus on maintaining standard scripts on the altcoin, this non-standard script approach would be an improvement over the cut and choose method.</summary>
