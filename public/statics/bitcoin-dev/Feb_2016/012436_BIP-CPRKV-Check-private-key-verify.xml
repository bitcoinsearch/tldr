    <summary>On the bitcointalk forums, there was a discussion about using CLTV for cross chain transfers. However, many altcoins do not support CLTV, which makes transfers to those coins insecure. To address this issue, a protocol was created that uses cut and choose to allow commitments to publish private keys, but it is clunky and not entirely secure. Additionally, a BIP draft for an opcode was created that would lock outputs unless a private key was published that matches a given public key. The draft can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/TierNolan/bips/blob/cpkv/bip-cprkv.mediawiki.</summary>
