    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion on Feb 6, 2016, Jannes Faber argued that exchanges must be able to send their customers both coins as separate withdrawals during a hard fork, while also stating that supporting the obsolete chain is unnecessary and has not been offered in any cryptocurrency hard fork before. Failure to allow separate withdrawals would amount to theft of customer funds, but announcing planned behavior before the fork would avoid ethical or legal issues. The email was followed by an HTML attachment and a signature.asc non-text attachment, which were not described further.</summary>
