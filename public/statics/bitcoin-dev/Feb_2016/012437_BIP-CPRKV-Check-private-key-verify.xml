    <summary>The email conversation is discussing the possibility of increasing the sigop count for a NOP without using segwit. It is determined that this would be a soft fork, as it makes previously allowed actions disallowed. If the sigop count is increased and valid under the new rules, it is also valid under the old rules. There is no need for specific support on the altcoin. This allows the Bitcoin network to act as a trusted 3rd party so that channels can be safely used on the altcoin, despite its malleability issues and lack of OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. In regards to seg-witness, ideally, the opcode would work in both old and new scripts by repurposing OP_NOP3.</summary>
