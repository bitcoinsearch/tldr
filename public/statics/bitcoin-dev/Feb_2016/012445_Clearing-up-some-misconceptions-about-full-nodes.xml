    <summary>Running Bitcoin-qt on a spinning hard disk can cause system responsiveness issues and disrupt user experience. However, moving the Bitcoin data to an SSD improves the user experience significantly. After initial synchronization, Bitcoin-qt only uses a small amount of CPU to verify new blocks and transactions. Running Bitcoin-qt continuously is less painful than running it occasionally.A full node can be run on a small desktop machine by getting the Bitcoin data off of spinning media and onto SSD, having plenty of RAM, and leaving bitcoin-qt running all the time. The number of full nodes worldwide is unknown as not all nodes have open ports that can be probed. Open-port-nodes are able to upload blocks to new full nodes but closed-port-nodes cannot be measured. Full nodes check that all of Bitcoin's rules are being followed making it trustless. It is recommended to run a full node as your wallet for increased security and privacy. Running a full node as a wallet has become much easier with improved user experience and efficiency improvements. The downsides of running a full node are minimal while the benefits are many.The rollout of the hard fork on the entire bitcoin ecosystem is a complex process that cannot be relied upon by simply press releases to encourage users to upgrade their nodes. The debacle with Pulse Audio during the mid-2000s serves as a lesson for those who seek that route. On the other hand, spinning up "bitcoin-2.0" and enabling users to move their wallets to the new blockchain at their leisure doesn't cause instant degradation in the ecosystem. Bitcoin "brand" loyalty will ensure that users who want to move forward with the economic potential of the 2MB blocksize will be able to keep their existing funds safe while testing the waters with the new blocksize. Bitcoin still remains the only game in town when it comes to scale and proven history of financial return. As the new blockchain builds momentum, the old one will eventually become obsolete. However, it may also become the digital equivalency of Silver and that is also a useful, profitable, and viable alternative with a proven history of success.</summary>
