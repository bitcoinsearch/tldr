    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Matt Corallo proposed increasing the extranonce space available for ASICs by setting a maximum number of bytes. Currently, blocks begin with at least eight 0-bytes, but increasing the minimum difficulty to six 0-bytes would increase the difficulty by 2^16x and reserve more space for extranonce rolling. The extranonce rolling doesn't necessarily have to occur in the ASIC itself, and increasing the space dynamically would correlate with ASIC speeds and make sense. Luke agreed with the proposal and saw no reason not to increase the minimum difficulty at the same time.</summary>
