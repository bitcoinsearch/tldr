    <summary>In a discussion about the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), Luke Dashjr and Dave Scotese addressed issues related to the need for multiple software projects to release their own implementations of API/RPC and corresponding application layer BIPs. They agreed that only one such application would be standard, avoiding confusion in usability, while multiple applications could benefit from coordination encouraged by the BIP and BIP 123. Additionally, they clarified that comments and status are unrelated metrics to judge a BIP and should not directly influence each other. The author of a BIP should also be allowed to specify other internet locations for comments, although this could potentially be abused to discourage or censor negative comments. Overall, the focus was on accessibility and discussion, with an emphasis on avoiding bias and censorship in moderation decisions.</summary>
