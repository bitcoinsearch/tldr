    <summary>A year ago, the author wrote a draft BIP which aims to accomplish certain important goals, including deploying proper merge-mining as Satoshi suggested before he left, expanding the nonce space miners can scan in-chip, and providing a way to safely deploy hardforks without risking leaving old nodes vulnerable to attack. The author plans to revise and complete the BIP soon and welcomes suggestions for doing so. The link to the BIP can be found on GitHub.</summary>
