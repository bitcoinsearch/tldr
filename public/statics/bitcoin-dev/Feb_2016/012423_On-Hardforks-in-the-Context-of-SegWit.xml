    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing the possibility of increasing extranonce space in mining, which is used to allow miners to change aspects of a block that will produce a different hash. While ASICs can never use more space than what they can reasonably assume will always be available, some members of the community are suggesting that increasing the extranonce space could simplify mining control and move complexity back into Bitcoin Core. The proposal is to add nonce space in the first compression function, allowing for optimization if you can brute-force the midstate. There is also discussion about increasing the minimum difficulty at the same time, however, some believe that this adds unnecessary complexity. Overall, the proposed changes would allow for greater ASIC speeds and increased dynamic extranonce space.</summary>
