    <summary>Henning Kopp, a researcher at Ulm University in Germany, is seeking to understand confidential transactions. He poses a question regarding how the receiver of a transaction can check which amount was sent to him when the sender creates a confidential transaction and picks the blinding values correctly. Despite this, anyone can still verify that the transaction is valid as it remains publicly verifiable. Henning believes that the receiver needs to learn the blinding factor to reveal the commit off-chain. However, he seeks clarification on how this works.</summary>
