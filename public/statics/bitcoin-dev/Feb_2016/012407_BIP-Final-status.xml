    <summary>Peter Todd and Luke Dashjr discussed the upgrade of five additional BIPs from Draft to Final status on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Peter Todd suggested updating BIP 50 with new information that calling it a "hard fork" misses subtleties about what happened during that fork in March 2013. However, he agreed that BIP 50 could use some rephrasing. He also noted that the May 2013 change was definitely a hardfork despite the issues with the pre-March protocol. The proposal for the upgrade can be found on GitHub and requires ACKs from the BIP champions.</summary>
