    <title>Hardfork bit BIP</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev discussion, jl2012 clarified that the triggering block is not where the hardfork starts. For instance, in BIP101, the hardfork happens when the first &gt;1MB is mined. Those who fail to upgrade will realize a hardfork, and the grace period will be zero for them. To get the benefit of the update, clients have to update in some way. An SPV client that fully validated the header chain would reject the hard forking header. The Bitcoinj SPV wallet ignored the version bits and followed the longest chain. It is unclear if Core enforces the 95% rule for soft-forks before checking for long forks. It is assumed to occur during header checks rather than full block checks.</summary>
