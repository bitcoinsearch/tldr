    <summary>In this email conversation, a discussion is held about the addition of a "default_witness_commitment" key, which is absent in the current reference implementation. The omission of the key was assumed to allow clients to create the commitment themselves instead of having it provided to them. While the two approaches are not at odds with each other, allowing for simpler cases both encourages laziness and complicates server-side implementation. Additionally, it could make it more vulnerable to DoS attacks. The burden on mining software would be increased, increasing the odds of bugs in the process. Serialization or commitment creation bugs relating to mining/pool software were already fixed in SegWit.</summary>
