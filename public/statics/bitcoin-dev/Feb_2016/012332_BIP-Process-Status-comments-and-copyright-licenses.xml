    <summary>The term "consensus" used in the context mentioned in the link https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-biprevised/bip-biprevised.mediawiki#formally-defining-consensus has been a source of confusion with other related terms such as "consensus rules" and "consensus code". The author suggests using another term for this concept to avoid confusion. In the past, the author had used the term "uncontroversial" in BIP99 but is open to suggestions for other alternatives. The author proposes "nearly universal acceptance" or "ecosystem-harmonious" among others. The goal is to avoid overloading the term "consensus" for two distinct yet related concepts.</summary>
