    <summary>On February 26, 2016, Tier Nolan inquired about atomic cross chain transfers between Bitcoin and legacy altcoins. He defined legacy altcoins as those with strict IsStandard() rules and without advanced script opcodes. Although it may seem redundant to own technologically outdated coins, some people still prefer them. Nolan noted that performing an EC multiply in a snark is possible but would require a lot of work for an efficient implementation. Building a circuit for field operations using 128 bit operations would be ideal. However, the overall process would be relatively simple with no branching. Nolan suggested using the single-show-signature scheme he created on the Bitcoin side to force the Bitcoin side to reveal a private key, instead of performing the EC multiply. The link provided explains this scheme further.</summary>
