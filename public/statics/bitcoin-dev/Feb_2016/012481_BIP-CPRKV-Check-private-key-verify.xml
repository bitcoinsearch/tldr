    <summary>In an email exchange on February 29th, 2016, Mats Jerratsch shared a link to a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list from November 2015 regarding a proposal for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would enable a new type of transaction signature called Schnorr signatures. Jerratsch noted that the proposal was relevant to the Lightning Network (LN) as well. He asked if there was much demand for coding up a patch to the reference client and mentioned that even if there were, segregated witness might be taking up any potential soft-fork slot for the time being.</summary>
