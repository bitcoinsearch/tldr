    <summary>The author argues that Bitcoin scaling is not an emergency and that there are more pressing concerns such as mining centralization and privacy. They provide links to articles explaining what a qualifying emergency looks like, and suggest that a hard fork should only be considered in response to a major crisis that all participants can agree on. The author suggests that a hard fork could be used to enforce decentralized mining pools, which would help address the issue of mining centralization. They also express concern about the rising cost of transaction fees, but believe that this alone does not constitute an emergency. Finally, they provide a link with suggestions for fixing the issue of mining centralization.</summary>
