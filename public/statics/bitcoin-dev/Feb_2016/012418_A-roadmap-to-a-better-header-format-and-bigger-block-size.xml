    <summary>A developer on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list suggested presenting a roadmap for a better header format and bigger block size, with three stages of rule changes to ensure everyone has enough time to upgrade. Stage one is Segregated Witness, which will not break any existing full or light nodes. Stage two is fixes that will break existing full nodes but not light nodes, including increasing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and anti-DoS rules for the O(n^2) validation of non-segwit scripts. Stage three is fixes that will break all existing full and light nodes, including changing the header format to Luke-Jr's proposal and moving all commitments to the new structure, reclaiming unused bits in the header for mining, and fixing the time warp attack. The alternative roadmap would delay stage two until mid-2017 or later but would still include changes that break existing full and light nodes. Both proposals have pros and cons, with the first being less disruptive and the second being safer. It was emphasized that it is the miners' responsibility, not the devs', to confirm that the supermajority of the community accepts changes in stages two and three. References to Matt Corallo's and Luke-Jr's proposals were included.</summary>
