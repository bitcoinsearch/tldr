    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr raised concerns over how old nodes would react to a soft fork. Tom Zander replied that if a node is not updated in time then it will stop receiving new blocks and any funds within it will not be confirmed. In response Gavin Andresen commented that there would be almost no hash power left on the weaker branch of a fork and thus an attack against older nodes was unlikely. However, Dashjr disagreed and suggested that an attacker could rent hashing power for a few days and build a fake chain to trick merchants into believing the payment was genuine.</summary>
