    <summary>On February 26th, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner sent an email congratulating someone on a successful implementation of the SKCP system. The person asked if it is possible for the person who performed the trusted setup to extract information from a proof, to which Lerner replied that it is not possible due to the information theoretic secrecy of the SKCP system. This holds true even in the case of malicious initialization. The soundness of the scheme is based on cryptographic assumptions that the proofs cannot be forged.</summary>
