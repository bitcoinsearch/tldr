    <summary>The email is a discussion among Bitcoin developers regarding the use of CLTV for cross-chain transfers. The issue raised was that many altcoins do not support CLTV, making transfers insecure. To address this issue, Tier Nolan proposed a protocol using cut and choose to allow commitments to publish private keys. However, this protocol was deemed clunky and not entirely secure. As a solution, Nolan created a BIP draft for an opcode that would lock outputs unless a private key matching a given public key was published. While this proposal could be implemented through a new segwit version, it may require specific support in the altcoin, which could be troublesome. Additionally, increasing the sigop count for a NOP without using segwit would result in a hard fork.</summary>
