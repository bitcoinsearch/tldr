    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen discussed the potential of a non-consensus hard fork and its impact on hash power. He stated that there would be almost no hash power left on the weaker branch of the fork if past soft-fork adoption by miners was considered. Furthermore, he argued that the 75% threshold, which gives veto power to a single big solo miner or mining pool, might not be enough to prevent a veto from a 20% miner who could use their hashpower to vote for an upgrade but then not mine anything on the new chain. This way, there could be as little as 55% mining the new 2MB chain with 45% of hashpower remaining on the old chain. He warned that in the case of a non-consensus fork, people involved might act in ways that aren't very gentlemanly. Therefore, guarding against it is crucial to avoid making the fork a huge mess.</summary>
