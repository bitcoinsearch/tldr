    <summary>In a mailing list for Bitcoin developers, Toby Padilla expressed frustration over the moderation of his posts commenting on how unevenly it was being applied. Peter Todd, another developer, responded by explaining that actual humans have to approve each post and that the timing of Luke's comments may have just been when those humans were available. Todd also noted that the aggressive moderation is necessary due to the large number of subscribers and that other mailing lists, including the one where Bitcoin was first announced, also use manual approval moderation. He suggested that an unmoderated version of bitcoin-dev could be created if desired.</summary>
