    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol is a decentralized census-based system involving currency, suggesting that roll-out schedules should be conservative with minimal assumptions. A hard fork of six months seems to be the most conservative timeframe. Although it seems like a safe assumption that adoption would be faster, whether it is "very safe" and "significantly faster", or whether it will be 6 times faster, all of those assumptions seem significantly less safe and robust. Gavin Andresen, who proposed a forking concept, wrote that he surveyed several of the biggest infrastructure providers and the lead developer; they all agree that "28 days is plenty of time." However, there seems to be no evidence backing up that claim. In fact, experience shows that people take longer than 28 days to patch and restart their bitcoind. It's unclear if this will translate into more or less than 6x the adoption speed of previous instances, but the idea that it would be faster is solid. Furthermore, resorting to shouting doesn't help engage parties in reasonable discussion on the technical merits of a proposal.</summary>
