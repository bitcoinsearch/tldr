    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Gavin argued that SPV wallets are more affected by soft forks than hard forks, and that transaction validation rule changes are therefore a big concern for lightweight clients. However, aj countered that soft-forks that only forbid non-standard transactions would not affect the security of low-confirmation transactions sent to SPV wallets. Aj suggested that ensuring soft-forks only affect non-standard transactions addresses this concern.</summary>
