    <summary>The email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Luke Dashjr from February 6, 2016, regarding Bitcoinâ€™s capacity increase has been leaked. The conversation includes discussion about the need for a capacity increase, miners expressing their support for BIP, and hard forks. Dashjr suggests using version bits to trigger a soft-hard fork so as not to leave old nodes entirely insecure. He also suggests rephrasing the text to indicate that miners should observe economic support before enabling any bit. Additionally, Dashjr refutes Andresen's claim that there is broad agreement that a capacity increase is needed now. He cites evidence to the contrary, including a tweet from Barry Silbert. They also discuss the difference between SPV wallets and light clients and whether there is a need to address both.</summary>
