    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Toby Padilla raised an issue regarding the rejection of any output having zero value by Bitcoin Core, even if it's a single OP_RETURN output. He provided the blocking code to support his claim. However, he acknowledged that the wording of his BIP needs to be cleaned up to make things more clear. It was mentioned in the discussion that the dust limit is completely ignored for OP_RETURN outputs, so setting them to 1 satoshi can be a workaround. The discussion was held on Tue, Jan 26, 2016.</summary>
