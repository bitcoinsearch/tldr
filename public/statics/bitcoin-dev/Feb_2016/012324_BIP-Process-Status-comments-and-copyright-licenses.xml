    <summary>The author of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), Luke Dashjr, has completed an initial draft of a BIP that provides clarifications on the Status field for BIPs. Moreover, it adds the ability for public comments on them and expands the list of allowable BIP licenses. The section discusses whether multiple applications should provide their API/RPC implementations and corresponding application layer BIPs. While there is only one such application, its UI will be the obvious standard, and confusion in usability will be avoided. Any more than one such application will benefit from the coordination encouraged and aided by this BIP and BIP 123. The post also clarifies that comments and status are intended to be unrelated metrics, and any influence of one over the other indicates a deviation from their intended use. The author of a BIP may indicate any commenting URL they wish, including those outside theÂ Bitcoin Wiki.</summary>
