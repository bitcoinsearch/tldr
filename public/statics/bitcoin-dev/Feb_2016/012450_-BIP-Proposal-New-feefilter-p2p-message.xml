    <title>[BIP Proposal] New "feefilter" p2p message</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer forum post on February 16, 2016, Alex Morcos questioned the use of the feefilter message, which is defined as a message containing an int64_t where pchCommand == "feefilter". He asked about extensibility and why 64 bits would be used for what is likely a small number. Another user, Luke, pointed out that the fee filter is additive with a bloom filter for transactions, so if an SPV client loaded a bloom filter and sent a feefilter message, transactions would only be relayed if they passed both filters. Luke indicated that this seemed to make feefilter entirely useless for wallets.</summary>
