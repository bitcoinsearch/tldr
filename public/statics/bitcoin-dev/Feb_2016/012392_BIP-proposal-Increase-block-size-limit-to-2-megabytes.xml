    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is centered around custodians who fail to produce coins on both sides of a fork in response to depositor requests. Jannes Faber stated that they *must* be able to send their customers both coins as separate withdrawals, while Jonathan Toomim argued that supporting the obsolete chain is unnecessary and has not been offered in any cryptocurrency hard fork before. He further stated that if the custodians announce their planned behavior before the fork, he doesn't see any ethical or legal issues. However, the original statement suggests that custodians who fail to produce coins on both sides of a fork may find themselves in serious legal trouble, especially if the price moves against either fork. It is unclear whether this is a general opinion or a legal requirement. The discussion ends there, and it is left up to interpretation how custodians should handle forks and what legal consequences they may face.</summary>
