    <summary>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the proposed hard fork in Bitcoin's block size limit, and addresses concerns regarding the 28-day grace period for implementing the upgrade. The author argues that there is broad agreement that a capacity increase is needed now and that the current timeline is more than enough time for individuals and the Bitcoin Core project to implement the upgrade. Additionally, the article responds to a message from Luke Dashjr regarding the BIP's Rationale section, accurate signature counting, and hashing limits per block. Finally, the article discusses the need for economic support and potential soft-hardfork deployments in future upgrades.</summary>
