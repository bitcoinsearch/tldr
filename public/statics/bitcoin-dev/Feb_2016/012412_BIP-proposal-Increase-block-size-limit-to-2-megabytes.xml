    <summary>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen of Bitcoin Classic was warned by Peter Todd not to quote a list on the Classic website that contained inaccurate and misleading information about companies testing Classic. Todd highlighted the fact that many of the companies listed had no intention of running or testing Classic, and cautioned against mixing support for 2MB with support for Classic. Todd also discussed security considerations unique to hard-forks, and questioned how it could be known whether or not any testing was actually being performed. In addition, he suggested that exchanges and other players in the ecosystem were seeking technical advice on how to split coins across chains effectively, as post-hard-fork coins are legally separate currencies and must therefore be given the opportunity to transact in them separately if customers choose to. Todd also noted that millions of dollars of Bitcoin were voting against the fork on the proof-of-stake voting site, Bitcoinocracy.com. When questioned about how he planned to monitor and manage security through the hard-fork, Andresen replied that he did not plan to monitor or manage anything, as the Bitcoin network is self-monitoring and self-managing.</summary>
