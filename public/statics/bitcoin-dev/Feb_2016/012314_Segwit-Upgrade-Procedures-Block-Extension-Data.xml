    <summary>On February 1, 2016, Pieter Wuille proposed a second number push in the coinbase scriptSig. This push would be similar to the current BIP34 height push and would push a byte offset inside the coinbase transaction that points to a 32-byte hash H. The offset excludes the witness data and is more flexible and compact than the current system. There was some discussion about whether this could be enforced in the extra nonce instead, but ultimately the proposal was accepted. However, there were concerns about adding arbitrary data, as it could be used for non-Bitcoin purposes. To address this, it was suggested that the data in the coinbase witness stack have a fixed number of entries, depending on the block version number, with Version 5 blocks having only one entry. This could allow for soft-forks to add new entries in the stack.</summary>
