    <summary>On February 5, 2016, Gavin Andresen announced the release of a hard fork proposal to increase the block size limit from 1MB to 2MB. The proposal was reviewed by merchants, miners, and exchanges and implemented and tested as part of the Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT implementations. The proposal includes increasing the block size limit to 2,000,000 bytes, an accurate sigop counting with existing sigop limit (20,000), and a new high limit on signature hashing. A 28-day grace period is proposed after 75% hash power support. Andresen mentions that the adoption rate of the last major Bitcoin core release could give insight into how long it might take people to upgrade. He notes that about 38% of full nodes were running the 0.11.0 release twenty-eight days after its release in July 2015. Three months later, about 50% of the network had adopted this release, and six months later, approximately 66% of the network was running some flavor of 0.11. However, he acknowledges that picking a short grace period of 28 days may alienate nodes who do not upgrade with the aggressive upgrade timeline proposed. Two blog posts are provided by Andresen; one that walks through the code and another that discusses some of the constants chosen. Andresen requests constructive feedback but states that arguments about whether or not it is a good idea to roll out a hard fork now will be unproductive, so he suggests that they don't go there.</summary>
