    <summary>Exchanges and miners, who are using the network 100% of the time, face the problem of getting booted off the network. This is not a concern for normal wallet users as they are not taking payments every few minutes like the exchanges. However, if miners aren't up to date, it could cause a sudden drop in hashpower that would affect the network for all users, including normal wallet users, by delaying confirmations. Therefore, miners must never be booted off the network, and hashpower voting is the best way to ensure this never happens.Tom Zander via bitcoin-dev responded to Jorge Tim√≥n's comment regarding being lost or kicked out of the network. Tom stated that if a node is "old", it will stop receiving new blocks, and funds won't get confirmed until the software is upgraded. He also made it clear that this is not a problem because it does not occur frequently.</summary>
