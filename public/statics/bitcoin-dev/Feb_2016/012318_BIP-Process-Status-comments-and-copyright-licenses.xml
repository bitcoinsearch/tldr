    <summary>Luke-jr has created an initial draft of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to clarify the status field for BIPs. Additionally, the proposal expands the list of allowable BIP licenses and introduces the ability for public comments on them. The revised BIP can be found on GitHub. Luke-jr plans to open discussion on making this BIP an Active status along with BIP 123 after initial revisions have been made. He requests any objections to be shared now so that he can address them and reach a consensus.</summary>
