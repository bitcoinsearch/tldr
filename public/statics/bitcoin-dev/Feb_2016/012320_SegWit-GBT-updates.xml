    <summary>In this email exchange, Luke Dashjr and Cory Fields discuss the default witness commitment for GBT (GetBlockTemplate) protocol. Dashjr argues that allowing for a simpler implementation of the protocol could enable centralization, while Fields suggests that providing a known-working commitment would be beneficial for adoption. Dashjr also mentions that omitting the default witness commitment from the standard protocol would be better in terms of security. Fields requests clarification on some of Dashjr's points, including the potential DoS vector and the use of libblkmaker. Dashjr responds that the burden on mining software is not significant and that libblkmaker can handle the heavy lifting. Dashjr also expresses concern about introducing bugs into working code and the need to consider the sign bit when serializing heights.</summary>
