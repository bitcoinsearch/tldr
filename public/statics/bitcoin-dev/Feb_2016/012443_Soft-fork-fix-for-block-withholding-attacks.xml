    <summary>A proposal for fixing block withholding attacks with a soft fork was presented by gladoscc via bitcoin-dev. However, it was pointed out that while the technique may work, it doesn't meet the standard definition of a soft-fork as most of the Bitcoin dev/research community has been using. This is because less than a majority of hashing power can create a chain that appears to be the most-work chain from the perspective of non-adopting nodes if it's adopted by a majority of hashing power. The proposed technique may be called a "pseudo-soft-fork", which still needs further analysis to determine whether it reduces risk compared to a simpler hard-fork implementation of the idea.</summary>
