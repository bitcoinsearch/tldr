    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the proposal of BIP 74 has sparked some debate on whether or not it should be implemented. A user named Toby Padilla expressed his dislike for policing others' use of the protocol and stated that as long as a transaction pays its fee and has greater than dust value, there should be no objection to it. Peter Todd suggested that while a BIP is not required for deployment, those in favor of the feature should write up a non-numerical BIP document and lobby wallet vendors to implement it. Pieter Wuille added that comments made about the feature are personal opinions and do not necessarily reflect whether it should be accepted as a BIP, and that having a BIP accepted does not mean wallets have to implement it. It was noted that BIP 74 was assigned to this proposal last Friday.</summary>
