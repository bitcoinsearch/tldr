    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are currently undergoing updates on GitHub, with proposed changes to the status of several BIPs. These include updating the status of Accepted BIPs to Final. Among the BIPs included in the proposal are M-of-N Standard Transactions, Protocol Version and User Agent, URI Scheme, and Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets. The update has been open for a week and is expected to be merged within the next week unless there are objections.In addition, Luke Dashjr proposed an upgrade to five additional BIPs from Draft to Final status on Feb 8, 2016, seeking approval from the BIP champions. One of these BIPs, BIP 50, authored by Gavin Andresen, was discussed in particular. Peter Todd suggested updating BIP 50 with new information that calling it a "hard fork" misses subtleties about what happened during that fork in March 2013. However, he agreed that BIP 50 could use some rephrasing. It was suggested that the description of this fork as a "hard fork" is not entirely accurate, as the rejection of the chain by version 0.7 was non-deterministic and depended on seeing a reorganization in a specific way. The proposal for the upgrade can be found on GitHub and requires ACKs from the BIP champions.Another proposal seeks to upgrade five additional BIPs from Draft to Final status, including March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem, Fixed Length "version" Message (Relay-Transactions Field), getutxo message, Strict DER signatures, and Use "Accept" header for response type negotiation with Payment Request URLs. The champions of these proposals have been called upon to provide their ACKs.</summary>
