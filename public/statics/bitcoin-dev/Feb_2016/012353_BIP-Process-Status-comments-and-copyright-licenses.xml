    <summary>The conversation between Luke Dashjr and an unknown person took place on February 4, 2016. The discussion was centered around the review process of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Luke Dashjr suggested that all reviews should remain on the ML (mailing list) while author-chosen forums could be used in addition to the Bitcoin Wiki. Luke Dashjr expressed his confusion over a particular phrase in BIP 2 which stated that if a BIP was not yet completed, reviewers should do their work "on a wiki page or fork of the git repository". In response, the unknown person thanked Luke for clarifying the matter.</summary>
