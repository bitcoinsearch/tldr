    <summary>A draft proposal for a two-stage hard fork to implement changes to the Bitcoin header format has been submitted on GitHub by James Hilliard. The proposal aims to fix issues with pooled mining and provide other desirable changes in a non-merge mine compatible way. The first stage of the hardfork will use merge mining, which requires that the pre-fork chain be mined with a generation transaction containing no new coins and no transactions. This stage would also require consensus rules that increase difficulty and hold back the original chain, making it difficult to mine the 2016 blocks needed to trigger a difficulty adjustment. The second stage of the hardfork will be activated only after 50,000 blocks and will make the header format incompatible with merge mining. To ensure the success of this proposal, any clients merge mining must be locked in for the headers change stage so that the original chain is dead by the time the headers change takes place.The hardfork will permanently disable all nodes, both full and light, which do not explicitly add support for it. However, their security will not be compromised due to the implementation. All nodes must choose to upgrade to migrate, and miners must express supermajority support. Furthermore, there is a high risk of there being two viable chains if a way to permanently disable the original chain is not implemented. The first stage of the hard fork is designed to make it difficult to mine the 2016 blocks needed to trigger a difficulty adjustment and make it clear to unupgraded clients that they need to upgrade. The proposal also ensures that any clients merge mining are locked in for the headers change stage so that the original chain is dead by the time the headers change takes place. The proposal is still in draft stage, with a reference implementation yet to be created.</summary>
