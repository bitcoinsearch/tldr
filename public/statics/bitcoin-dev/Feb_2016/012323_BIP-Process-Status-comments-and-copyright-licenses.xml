    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr requested objections to be provided for consensus to be reached regarding the formally defining consensus section. It was also mentioned that clear reasoning must be given for objections that were not considered substantiated by the community. In regards to the BIP comments section, comments should be solicited on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and fairly summarized in the wiki with time given for suggesting edits on the mailing list. Wiki registration and monitoring should not be a required hurdle to participation.</summary>
