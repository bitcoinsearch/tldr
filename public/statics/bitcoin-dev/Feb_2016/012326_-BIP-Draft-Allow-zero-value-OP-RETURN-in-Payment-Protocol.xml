    <summary>In an email exchange on January 26, 2016, Toby Padilla expressed his dislike for policing others' use of the bitcoin protocol. He believed that if a transaction pays its fee and has a greater than dust value, there should be no objection to it. Peter Todd responded by saying that getting a BIP for a feature is not a hard requirement for deployment and encouraged Padilla to write up his BIP document with a non-numerical name for ease of reference and lobby wallet vendors to implement it. Todd refrained from commenting on whether or not he thought the feature was a good idea and emphasized that individuals should not get the impression that bitcoin developers are gatekeepers for how people choose to use the cryptocurrency.</summary>
