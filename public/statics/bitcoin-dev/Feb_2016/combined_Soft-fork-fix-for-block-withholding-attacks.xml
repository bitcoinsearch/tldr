    <summary>The context proposes a solution to fix block withholding attacks with a soft fork. The solution involves redefining the block PoW target to be less than the difficulty, with the last two bytes being the target. Blocks must include a blinded hash of the target plus some junk in the coinbase, and miners cannot arbitrarily switch targets. Hashers must submit all shares that match the first PoW criteria and delegate secondary verification to the miner. Miners are required to communicate a proof of their target hash in a non-hashed area of the block. This can be deployed as a soft fork with miner opt-in triggering across many difficulty cycles.Furthermore, the context suggests designing clients to warn users when a soft fork occurs, and the potential safety benefits of doing so. While the reference client can provide warnings for high POW soft forks, many SPV clients cannot. The suggestion is made to implement a delay between version number changes and rule activation, allowing nodes to receive a warning recommending that they update. Additionally, specific guidelines are proposed for increasing difficulty intervals and updating targets at each difficulty retargeting. It is noted that an attacker with 2% of network power could create five blocks for every block produced by the rest of the network. A proposal for fixing block withholding attacks with a soft fork was presented by gladoscc via bitcoin-dev. However, it was pointed out that while the technique may work, it doesn't meet the standard definition of a soft-fork as most of the Bitcoin dev/research community has been using. This is because less than a majority of hashing power can create a chain that appears to be the most-work chain from the perspective of non-adopting nodes if it's adopted by a majority of hashing power. The proposed technique may be called a "pseudo-soft-fork", which still needs further analysis to determine whether it reduces risk compared to a simpler hard-fork implementation of the idea.</summary>
