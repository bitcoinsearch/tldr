    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email chain on February 5, 2016, Gavin Andresen suggested increasing the block size limit to 2,000,000 bytes with accurate sigop counting and a high limit on signature hashing. Andresen expressed his opinion that it would be absurd to have a hardfork without combining these limits into a single weighted sum. He proposed the formula of 0.5*blocksize + 50*accurate_sigops + 0.001*sighash as a solution. Constructive feedback was welcomed on his proposal.</summary>
