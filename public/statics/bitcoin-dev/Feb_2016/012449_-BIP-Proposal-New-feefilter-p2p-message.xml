    <summary>A proposal has been made to add a new optional peer-to-peer (p2p) message called "feefilter" that would help to reduce unnecessary network traffic. This message would inform peers of the minimum fee below which no transactions are accepted to a node's mempool, saving them from requesting transaction ids and saving the node from requesting transactions that are not in its recentRejects filter. The feefilter message is optional and can be ignored as a protocol rule, and there is also an option to turn off sending the messages within the implementation. The draft BIP text provides an abstract, motivation, specification, considerations, backward compatibility, and implementation details. The feefilter message is designed to instruct peers not to send inv's to a node for transactions with fees below the specified fee rate, and it is meant to filter transactions that are not accepted to a node's mempool, without adversely affecting the propagation efficiency of transactions across the network. There are privacy concerns related to deanonymizing a node by broadcasting identifying information about its mempool min fee, but these concerns are addressed by quantizing the filter value broadcast with a small amount of randomness and broadcasting messages to different peers at individually randomly distributed times. The sending of feefilter messages can be disabled by unsetting the "-feefilter" option, and older clients remain fully compatible and interoperable after this change.</summary>
