    <summary>On February 4th, 2016 jl2012 via bitcoin-dev suggested a proposal on Github for a new version number flag. The author agreed with the proposal and had independently proposed it in the past. However, there were some language nitpicks made by Luke which the author agreed with. It was then pointed out that the version number flag may not be sufficient in the deployed network as many clients do not validate the version field due to a lack of interest in security. As a result, to fully achieve the intended effect using the highest bit of prev would currently be much more effective.</summary>
