    <summary>In an email exchange on February 26, 2016, Gregory Maxwell suggested using a scheme he had previously developed to force the Bitcoin side to reveal a private key. The scheme was proposed in a post on the lightning-dev mailing list in November 2015 and involves using a single-show-signature approach. The recipient of the email thanked Maxwell for the information and stated that they would review it.</summary>
