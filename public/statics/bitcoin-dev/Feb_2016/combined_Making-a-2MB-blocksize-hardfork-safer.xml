    <summary>The article discusses the potential impact of segregated witness on hardforking blocksize increases in Bitcoin. It suggests that if segregated witness is successful, a hardfork may need to trade off an increase in blocksize with a decrease in the witness discount. Without segregated witness, alternative changes would be needed to prevent hashing large amounts of data when checking signatures or reducing worst-case UTXO growth.Furthermore, the author does not believe that fees will rise significantly or that there will be a "fee event" due to spam attacks but suggests having a backup plan in case of major issues with segregated witness. The author proposes that Gavin's BIP, which includes an increase to ~2MB coupled with accurate counting and limiting of sighash bytes, could be a good technical backup plan if segregated witness proves too difficult to deploy safely. However, the author acknowledges that this may not be acceptable politically and offers suggestions for making it workable, including a higher level of supermajority and a longer voting period. The article emphasizes that these are just hobbyist suggestions and do not have any backchannel contacts in mining or bitcoin startups.</summary>
