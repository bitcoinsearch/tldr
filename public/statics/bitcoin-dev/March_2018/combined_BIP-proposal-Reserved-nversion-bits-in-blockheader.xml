    <summary>A proposal has been made to reserve 16 bits of the nVersion field in the block header for general purpose use, reducing the number of parallel soft-fork activations using versionbits from 29 to 13. This proposal aims to prevent node software from emitting false warnings about unknown signalling bits under the versionbits signalling system (BIP8/9). The scope of the proposal is limited to reserving bits for general use without specifying specific uses for each bit, allowing mining manufacturers to play in the designated area without causing disruption or inconvenience. Specific use cases are not important for this proposal.The current draft integrates the work of Timo and Sergio, who proposed something similar years ago. The specification should be complete, including updates for GBT and the Stratum mining protocol. It is not appropriate to begin using a draft BIP on mainnet before any discussion or consensus has been reached. The author hopes DragonMint miners can still operate using the current Bitcoin protocol. Reserving 16 bits for general use leaves enough for 13 parallel soft-forks using version bits.There are a variety of things that miners may desire to use some of the nVersion field bits for. Rolling more bits from nTime is not ideal because it may distort the timestamps over a longer period. Version-rolling AsicBoost requires two bits from the nVersion field to calculate 4-way collisions. Any two bits can be used and mining equipment can negotiate which bits are to be used with mining pools via the Stratum "version-rolling" extension.Sixteen bits from the block header nVersion field, starting from 13 and ending at 28 inclusive (0x1fffe000), are reserved for general use and removed from BIP8 and BIP9 specifications. A mask of 0xe0001fff should be applied to nVersion bits so bits 13-28 inclusive will be ignored for soft-fork signalling and unknown soft-fork warnings. This specification does not reserve specific bits for specific purposes. The proposal is backwards compatible and does not require a soft fork to implement.The proposal is revived now because the new DragonMint miner uses version-rolling AsicBoost on mainnet. It is essential to bring this up so that node software can adapt the versionbits warning system to prevent false positives. The proposal is dual licensed as BSD-3-Clause and CC0-1.0 Universal.</summary>
