    <summary>It is a common belief that the count of unspent outputs in a network causes an increase in cost due to the bloat in UTXO size. However, this is not entirely true, and it is just a misperception. The additional cost to the network is not necessary, but it arises from the implementation detail of specific node software. There is no need for redundant indexing of unspent outputs. Therefore, everyone does not have to pay the cost.</summary>
