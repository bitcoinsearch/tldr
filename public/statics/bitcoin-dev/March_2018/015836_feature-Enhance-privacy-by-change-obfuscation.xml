    <summary>Damian Williamson suggested adding an "Enhanced privacy" option for transaction creation to randomly distribute change across up to twenty output addresses, as long as each output is not dust. However, Evan Klitzke argues that this would be expensive for the network due to the bloat in UTXO size, which everyone would have to pay for. Additionally, it may not be as private as intended because the wallet would likely have to rejoin those inputs in future transactions, resulting in a high transaction fee for the user.</summary>
