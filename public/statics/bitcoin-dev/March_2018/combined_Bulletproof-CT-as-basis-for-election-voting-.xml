    <summary>Bulletproof Confidential Transactions have the potential to be used in electronic voting to hide the amount transferred without compromising the identity of the senders and receivers. This feature makes it a suitable use case for an election where voters can hide their preference of party while still being auditable. In countries like the one mentioned in the context, every citizen is issued a National ID Card with a digital certificate. The voting authority can send a coin (1 coin = 1 vote) to each citizen above 18 and later, each voter can send her coin to her preferred party along with 0 coins to other parties to disguise her vote. However, there might be some missing features required in Bulletproof to support this use case. ZmnSCPxj believes that if voters send vote-coins directly to "The Party," then "The Party" knows the votes of particular voters, and may then dispatch subcontractors to dispatch those voters. However, there is a possibility that aggregators/mixers can be used to obscure the source of coins. Sending directly from the tx of the Voting Authority to another tx to the selected party would let The Party members who secretly control the Voting Authority records figure out which voters got which txouts of the Voting Authority. The Party, a miner-strong group with control over the government of an entire country, could censor transactions that do not give it non-zero amounts of coins. It may be better to focus on libertarian solutions on top of blockchains than attempting to force democratic ideals on them.In an email conversation between Tim and JOSE FEMENIAS CAÑUELO, Tim suggests reading literature on e-voting before implementing blockchain, while JOSE proposes a simple implementation for e-voting using Bulletproof Confidential Transactions to hide the amount transferred, where each citizen is issued a coin representing a vote and voters send their coins to their preferred party. Tim does not point out any specific issues with JOSE's proposal but suggests discussing such topics elsewhere.</summary>
