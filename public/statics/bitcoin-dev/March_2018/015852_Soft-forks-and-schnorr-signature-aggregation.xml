    <summary>In a discussion among developers on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bram Cohen suggested that most unused opcodes in bitcoin should be reclaimed as RETURN_VALID, with one OP_NOP and one 'real' RETURN_VALID opcode. The idea was met with some agreement, with Anthony Towns suggesting that it could simplify scripts and save bytes. However, there was some debate over whether to keep just one OP_NOP or not. There was also discussion about how to implement multisig opcodes, with Cohen suggesting that using MAST is an elegant solution for a large number of possibilities, while others suggested more complex formulas for combining signatures.</summary>
