    <summary>The author is seeking advice on whether it is possible to activate soft forks like BIP65 and BIP66 without prior signaling from miners. They are working on a project that is a clone of a clone of Bitcoin, which currently does not have BIP65 or BIP66 enforced - no signaling of these soft forks either. The project aims to bring the code branch up to 0.15 so that they can implement Segwit and other key features introduced by Bitcoin. However, activating soft forks will segregate the 0.15 clients onto their own fork. The author wants to know if they can skip over signaling and go straight into activation/enforcement if the entire network upgrades to the correct version of the software based on Bitcoin 0.15, which includes the block height that has enforcement. As their network is very small, it is reasonable to assume that the whole network will upgrade their clients within a short window (~2 weeks). The author would schedule the activation ~2 months out from when the client is released to ensure everyone has time to upgrade.The author also asks if the block version gets bumped up automatically at the time that a soft fork activates or if there is additional stuff that needs to be done within the code to ensure it bumps up at the same time. From what the author saw in the code, it appears that it will bump up automatically, but they would like confirmation on that.</summary>
