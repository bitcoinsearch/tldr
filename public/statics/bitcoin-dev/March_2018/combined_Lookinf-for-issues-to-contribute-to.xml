    <summary>Daniel R, an intermediate programmer, is seeking guidance on contributing to Bitcoin Core. He has already cloned the git repository and wants to learn more about the structure of Bitcoin Core and gain experience working with its source code. Daniel has knowledge of Python, C/C++, and Java, as well as advanced understanding of cryptographic concepts and procedures, and is teaching himself math related to elliptic curves. Currently, he is working on a bachelor thesis exploring the use of blockchain in the car industry, analyzing various aspects of protocol design.Ryan suggested that Daniel start with simple and boring changes and organically gain a better understanding. He recommended going to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls to find issues, reproduce the problem, test the fix, and look at how the person did it. Ryan believes that there's a lot more demand for elbow grease than advanced maths stuff in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.</summary>
