    <summary>It appears that some nodes claiming to be connected to Satoshi:0.15.0 are not actually honoring the version.relay=false flag (BIP37), according to a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Eric Voskuil. Andrew, in response to this post, suggested that it may be a bug rather than intentional change, and asked for specific details on how to reproduce the behavior if it is indeed true. It is important to ensure that the reported behavior is not simply due to nodes setting their user-agent to Satoshi:0.15.0 rather than actually being connected to those nodes.</summary>
