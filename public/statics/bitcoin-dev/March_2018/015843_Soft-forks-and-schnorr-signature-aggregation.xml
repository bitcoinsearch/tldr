    <summary>In an email thread between Anthony Towns and ZmnSCPxj on March 21, 2018, they discussed the concept of signature aggregation in Bitcoin. They talked about gathering public keys for aggregate signature checking instead of signatures. During this script, public keys and messages go into the signing/verification algorithm to produce/check the signature. ZmnSCPxj proposed having two places where they aggregate public keys: one at the script level and the other at the transaction level. However, it was noted that transaction-level aggregate, which is what gets checked, is different between pre-fork and post-fork nodes. The difficulty of reconciling script with signature aggregation was also mentioned.</summary>
