    <summary>Bulletproof Confidential Transactions can be used to hide the amount transferred instead of the senders and receivers of a coin. This feature makes it a perfect use case for an election where voters can hide their preference of party while still being auditable. In countries like the one mentioned in the context, every citizen is issued a National ID Card with a digital certificate. The voting authority can send a coin (1 coin = 1 vote) to each citizen above 18 and later, each voter can send her coin to her preferred party along with 0 coins to other parties to disguise her vote. This method ensures that each party will accrue votes as many coins received. However, there might be some missing features required in Bulletproof to support this use case. It is important to consider these features before implementing this naive implementation.</summary>
