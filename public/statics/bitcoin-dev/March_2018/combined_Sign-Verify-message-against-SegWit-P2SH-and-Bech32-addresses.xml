    <summary>The current implementation of sign/verify in Bitcoin Core is broken for SegWit and Bech32 addresses, but there is a way to verify cold storage addresses using the software. This involves having the owner sign a message with each address and then verifying it. However, this process only works for addresses starting with '1' and not those starting with '3' or 'bc1'. The solution can be found in issue#10542, which suggests signing with the embedded key instead of a witness address.This feature is important as there are few other ways to verify that an address is held. It should be noted that the linked issue is not currently labeled GUI, but could potentially be added unless a new issue is opened. Overall, while there are limitations to the verification process, it provides a viable option for ensuring the existence of cold storage addresses.</summary>
