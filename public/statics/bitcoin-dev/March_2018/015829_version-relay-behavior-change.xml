    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil raised concerns about nodes that no longer appear to be honoring the version.relay=false flag (BIP37) in /Satoshi:0.15.0/ and later versions of Bitcoin Core. Andrew Chow responded, suggesting that the nodes in question may not actually be forked from Bitcoin Core, but rather fake nodes that do not follow the protocol or perform verification. Fake nodes can set whatever user agent they want, including Bitcoin Core's user agents. Despite reviewing relevant Core sources and syncing against a Core node locally, Voskuil still suspects this behavior is related to Core, as it is very common and all user agents are consistent. However, he does not see any issues with Core sources or his own flag and version settings. Voskuil has previously dropped peers for noncompliance with the protocol and is considering reinstating this behavior. It is unclear whether this behavior is intentional or a bug, and specific details on how to reproduce the issue have been requested.</summary>
