    <summary>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the relaxation of some of the Denial of Service (DoS) prevention rules to open up more use cases and adoption. The issue of institutional wallets sweeping incoming payments and sweeping unconfirmed outputs is raised, but it is believed that this behavior is unintentional. It is suggested that if people start using the new replacement behavior, then institutions doing these sweeps may stop doing it. The development of a reasonable standard Replace-by-Fee (RBF) policy that aligns with miner incentives is discussed as miners prefer transactions with higher package fee rates. The weakening of DoS protections is not considered a huge problem, and it is proposed to try relaxing some of the rules in a release and see what happens.</summary>
