    <summary>The current implementation of sign/verify is broken for SegWit and Bech32 addresses. However, there is a way to verify that cold storage addresses exist using Bitcoin Core by having the owner sign a message with each address and then verifying it. The process only works for addresses starting with '1' and not those starting with '3' or 'bc1'. The solution is noted in issue#10542 and it suggests signing with the embedded key instead of a witness address. This is an important feature as there are few other ways to verify that an address is held. The linked issue is not currently labeled GUI, but could be, unless a new issue should also be opened.</summary>
