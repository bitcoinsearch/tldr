    <title>BIP proposal: Reserved nversion bits in blockheader - stratum mining.configure</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses two separate proposals related to Bitcoin mining. The first proposal relates to a new method for miner configuration called mining.configure, which was chosen due to the determinism of expecting the response. This proposal is in response to issues with an existing method, mining.capabilities, which was not being well documented or used. The reasoning behind the new method can be found on Github.The second proposal involves reserving 16 bits of the block header nVersion field for general-purpose use and removing their meaning for the purpose of version bits soft-fork signaling. This would reduce the number of parallel soft-fork activations using versionbits from 29 to 13 and prevent node software from emitting false warnings about unknown signaling bits under the versionbits signaling system (BIP8/9). The proposal cites several example cases that would benefit from using some of the bits from the nVersion field including rolling more bits from nTime and Version-rolling AsicBoost. The email thread also includes comments from Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev, who questions why an obsolete draft was posted and suggests that the proposal should be based on previous work by Timo and Sergio. Additionally, he notes that the specification should be complete, including updates for GBT and the Stratum mining protocol, and that it is not appropriate to begin using a draft BIP on mainnet before any discussion or consensus has been reached.</summary>
