    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Damian Williamson suggested a new feature for enhanced privacy in transaction creation called change obfuscation. The operation randomly distributes change across up to twenty output addresses while ensuring that each output is not dust. However, Evan Klitzke pointed out that this would be expensive for the network due to the bloat in UTXO size. Moreover, it doesn't seem private as the wallet will have to rejoin those inputs in future transactions and users will have to pay a high transaction fee as a result. Thus, despite understanding the additional cost, Klitzke did not support the idea.</summary>
