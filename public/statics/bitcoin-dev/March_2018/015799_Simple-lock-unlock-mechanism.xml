    <summary>In an email conversation, a user named Kalle expressed confusion regarding the use of graftroot and how it relates to multisig and freezing. Another user had suggested that if someone were to go through the trouble of freezing their coins, they could simply use multisig instead. However, the original user pointed out that in either case, a robber would need both signatories to access the coins, and the CLTV could be overridden with graftroot. Kalle also noted that graftroot requires a pubkey rather than a p2sh format.</summary>
