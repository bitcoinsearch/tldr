    <summary>In a discussion on ways to improve multilingual usage of BIP39, it was suggested that there should be a standard way to convert any words into a hex string, regardless of language or character encoding. This is important because there has been some rhetoric about only needing English words, but it's clear that there exists an obvious need to support all languages for a standard in wallet seed generation. Although there is currently no multilingual standard or official Portuguese wordlist, the discussion on this topic is ongoing and it's important to start choosing/codifying a standard. A GitHub user has started a Portuguese wordlist which may be helpful for those looking to expand the BIP039 wordlist to Portuguese. In response to a proposal to expand the BIP039 wordlist to Portuguese, it was noted that Portuguese is the 6th most spoken language in the world and is an official language in 10 countries.</summary>
