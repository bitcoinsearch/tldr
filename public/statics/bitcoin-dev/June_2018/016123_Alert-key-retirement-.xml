    <summary>The alert key for Bitcoin has not been disclosed yet, even though the alert system has been retired for a while. Further information can be found on the Bitcoin website and the bitcoin-dev mailing list. It has recently been suggested that it would be helpful to wait for v0.13 end-of-life before revealing the alert keys. The author is seeking information regarding anyone who has requested final alert messages for any projects that may have copied the Bitcoin alert pubkey. The author's contact information is provided at the end of the message.</summary>
