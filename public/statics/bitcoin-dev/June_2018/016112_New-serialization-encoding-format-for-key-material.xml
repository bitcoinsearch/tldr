    <summary>Pieter proposed to construct a code and implementation for various BCH codes on the request of Jonas Schnelli. Pieter presented an example BCH code for base32 data which adds 27 checksum characters and can correct up to 7 errors in strings with length up to 1023, including the checksum characters themselves. The code can encode sequences of integers ranging from 0 to 31. He also provided an example of how to decode and correct errors in the encoded message. However, the code he provided has no special properties beyond the ones it is designed for. Pieter suggested that he could easily generate similar code for BCH codes with different properties.</summary>
