    <summary>Darren Weber, a Bitcoin developer, has suggested a new idea to make it more difficult for malicious attackers to double-spend large amounts with a relatively brief majority of the network hashing power. He proposes introducing a hash workload that is proportional to the sum of transactions in a block, which could be linear or exponential. However, Thomas Guyot-Sionnest questions how this could be implemented as it could have detrimental side-effects such as users keeping large amounts in many smaller addresses to avoid being penalized on small transactions, leading to an increase in UTXO size for everybody. Guyot-Sionnest also notes that this would require very good consensus and a hard fork, and does not believe it is worth pursuing. Weber acknowledges that he is not yet at a point where he can answer any questions about implementation details with authority, but will consider the points raised by Guyot-Sionnest further.</summary>
