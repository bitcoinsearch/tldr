    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.16.1 has been released for download on various operating systems including Windows, Mac, and Linux. The new minor release features several bug fixes and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report any bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub and subscribe to receive security and update notifications. If you are running an older version of Bitcoin Core, it is recommended that you shut it down and wait until it has completely shut down before installing version 0.16.1. It is important to note that wallets created in version 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16. Notable changes in the new version include the removal of the `-blockmaxsize` option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes, which was deprecated in version 0.15.1 and has now been replaced by the `-blockmaxweight` option. There have also been several bug fixes related to block and transaction handling, P2P protocol and network code, as well as wallet and GUI improvements. Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems, but is not frequently tested on Unix-like systems. As such, users are advised to exercise caution when using the software on these systems.The latest version of Bitcoin Core includes several improvements and updates. One issue addressed is the default port not being shown correctly in settings dialog. The build system has been updated with new features such as allowing depends system to support armv7l, switching to downloading expat from GitHub, updating trusted git root, fixing Qt build with Xcode 9 and XCode 9.3, and defining endian-conversion DECLs in compat without config.Several tests and QA have also been conducted including adding missing signal.h header, ensuring bitcoind processes are cleaned up when tests end, handling disconnect_node race, testing starting bitcoind with -h and -version, among others. A few miscellaneous updates were made including bumping the leveldb subtree, excluding patches from lint-whitespace, holding cs_main while calling UpdatedBlockTip() signal, and avoiding launching as admin when NSIS installer ends on Windows. Additionally, documentation was improved by clarifying bestblock and unspent counts in RPC Docs and fixing a version typo in getpeerinfo RPC call help. The release was contributed by various individuals including 251, Ben Woosley, David A. Harding, e0, fanquake, Henrik Jonsson, JeremyRand, Jesse Cohen, John Newbery, Johnson Lau, Karl-Johan Alm, Luke Dashjr, MarcoFalke, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille, Suhas Daftuar, Tamas Blummer, and Wladimir J. van der Laan.</summary>
