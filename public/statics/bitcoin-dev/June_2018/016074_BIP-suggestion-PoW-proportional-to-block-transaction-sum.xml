    <summary>A proposal was made on Github to introduce a hash workload that is proportional to the sum of transactions in a block, making it harder for malicious attackers to double-spend large amounts with relatively brief majority of network hashing power. However, there are concerns regarding implementation and exclusion of transactions based on economic value. Additionally, there may be detrimental side-effects such as an increase in UTXO size for everybody. The proposal would require good consensus and a hard fork, leading some to believe it is not worth pursuing.</summary>
