    <summary>On June 2, 2018, Russell O'Connor expressed his preference for a different opcode for CHECKSIGFROMSTACK due to his dislike of opcodes that pop a non-static number of elements off the stack. He believes that popping a dynamic number of stack elements makes it more difficult to validate that a Script pubkey doesn't allow any funny business. Someone else agreed with this sentiment and suggested that CHECKMULTISIG should be removed from the new script system for similar reasons.</summary>
