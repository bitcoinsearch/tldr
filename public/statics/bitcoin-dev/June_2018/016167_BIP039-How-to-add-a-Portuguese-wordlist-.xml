    <summary>Breno is interested in proposing the expansion of BIP039 wordlist to include Portuguese or to help if it has already been proposed. Portuguese is considered as the 6th most spoken language in the world and is an official language in 10 countries. He seeks guidance on what steps he should take to propose the expansion.</summary>
