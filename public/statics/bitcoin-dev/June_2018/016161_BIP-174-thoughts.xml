    <summary>In this communication, Tomas Susanka and Andrew discuss the use of typed records in Bitcoin transactions. While Tomas believes that typed records would be a better choice, he is willing to compromise on this point. However, there are several reasons not to use typed records. Firstly, retaining the key-value map model is less of a breaking change. Secondly, it is easier to enforce uniqueness for certain things, such as redeemScript and witnessScript. With a key-value model, every key-value pair must have a unique key, which means combiners do not need to know anything about types. Lastly, the typed records model does not save a lot of space in a transaction. One extra byte per key-value pair is not significant considering the data inside each key-value pair far exceeds one byte. Overall, it appears that using the key-value map model is a more practical solution than using typed records.</summary>
