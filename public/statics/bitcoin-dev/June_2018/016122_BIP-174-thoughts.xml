    <summary>In an email thread, Pieter Wuille expressed uncertainty about the extent to which existing projects have worked on implementing BIP 174 and whether the specification is still subject to change. Meanwhile, the new Coldcard hardware wallet is based on PSBT (BIP 174) and is considered "PSBT Native", allowing it to add signatures to PSBT files from MicroSD or USB and finalize PSBT files for simple cases. The BIP174 spec is deemed reasonable and should only be changed in a forwards-compatible way moving forward. There are no strong feelings regarding specific comments made. Peter D. Gray, founder of Coinkite, provided contact information in his signature.</summary>
