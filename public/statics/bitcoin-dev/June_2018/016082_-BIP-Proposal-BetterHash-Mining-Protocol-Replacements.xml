    <summary>A proposal has been made to replace getblocktemplate with something that is both more performant, more robust for consensus changes and moves more block-switching logic inside of the work provider. Additionally, Stratum will be replaced with something more secure, simpler to implement and better-defined. This new protocol will provide the ability for a pool to accept work which the users of the pool selected the transactions for, providing strong decentralization pressure by removing the network-level centralization attacks pools can do while still allowing them full control of payout management and variance reduction. The latest version of the full BIP draft is available on GitHub and implementations are available for the work-generation part as well as pool/proxy parts.</summary>
