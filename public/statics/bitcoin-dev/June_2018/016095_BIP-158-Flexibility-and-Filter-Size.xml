    <summary>A proposal has been made to change the way filters are created for Bitcoin transactions. Currently, the "regular" filter includes the outpoint, but there is a suggestion to switch to including prev scripts instead. However, some argue that this would be costly in the short term, as it would impact wallet operation, rescans, and HD seed imports. Additionally, the proposed change would need to be generalized enough to allow several components to be committed, have versioning, and provide necessary extensibility for future items. While some wallets use filters primarily for rescan purposes, constructing them locally for this particular use case independent of what's currently deployed on the P2P network is not possible. Furthermore, maintaining the outpoint allows for a "single honest peer" security model in the short term, and scanning blocks directly when peers disagree on the filter content is still possible regardless of how the filter is constructed. However, some argue that this point is being overplayed, especially considering the current state of non-existing validation in SPV software. Overall, there are arguments both for and against the proposed change in filter creation, with concerns about cost, practicality, and security.</summary>
