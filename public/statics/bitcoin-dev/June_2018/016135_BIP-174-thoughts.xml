    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin core developer, has questioned the extent to which projects have worked on implementations of BIP 174, a specification for partially signed Bitcoin transactions. Jason Les, who is developing a Python implementation of the specification as part of a multi-sig hardware wallet, responded to Wuille's comments. Les suggested that the key-value map model should be kept and also expressed appreciation for the idea of enabling the ability for combiners to verify two PSBT are for the same transaction. He also agreed with the use of Z85 instead of Base64 for encoding purposes.</summary>
