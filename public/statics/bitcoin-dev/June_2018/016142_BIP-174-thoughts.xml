    <summary>The email thread discusses the need for revisions to BIP 174, a standard for Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT). While some developers have already implemented BIP 174, they agree that agreeing on a good standard should be a priority. They discuss whether there should be any per-output data and conclude it is unnecessary. The field for sighash type is discussed, with one party arguing it should be binding. They also consider size constraints for PSBTs, concluding that keeping the format clear while avoiding duplication of data is important. They put forward suggestions for optimizing PSBTs, including keeping BIP32 paths per-input and moving public keys to the value part of the record. The need for deduplication of witness/redeem scripts is also considered.</summary>
