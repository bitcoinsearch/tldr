    <summary>In the message, Will raises concerns about buffer overflows that may occur due to hundreds of thousands of zero bytes in the input or output key-value arrays. He seeks clarification regarding whether this would be considered valid since it is simply an array of empty dictionaries. Additionally, he asks for clarification on the extensibility section of the spec which allows additional key-value maps with different types for the key-value pairs to be added at the end of the format. Will wants to know if this refers to new types beyond the current global, input and output types. He also seeks clarity on the number of maps that follow and how this affects the use of different definitions of the data types.</summary>
