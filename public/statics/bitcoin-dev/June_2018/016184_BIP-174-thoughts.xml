    <summary>The participants of a discussion regarding a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) have been engaged in bikeshedding and the discussion has become unproductive. Andrew, one of the participants, believes that it is time to end the discussion. Another participant agrees with Andrew's point of view and wants to either lock down or move the BIP to the next level of approval. The latter proposes moving the BIP from Draft to Proposed status, which is met with agreement. Peter D. Gray, the founder of Coinkite, provides his contact information at the end of the conversation.</summary>
