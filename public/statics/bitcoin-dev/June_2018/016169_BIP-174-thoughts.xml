    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list was centered around whether or not implementing "protobuf-based-BIP174" encoding is worth the effort and if it's necessary to use a large dependency for such a simple format. William Casarin expressed his opinion that using a large dependency for this purpose is unnecessary, and although making it protobuf-compatible is an interesting idea, it could be more work than it's worth. He also mentioned building a simple serializer in approximately an afternoon. Matejcik supported the point made by Casarin and stated that it is possible to write a protobuf-compatible encoder/decoder for the simple structure in about an afternoon. Additionally, many projects already have protobuf parsers and thus introducing another format would be a mistake as the difference between ad-hoc format and protobuf for BIP174 is negligible. Slush added that some projects need the BIP174 parser as an extra dependency/library despite already using a protobuf library.</summary>
