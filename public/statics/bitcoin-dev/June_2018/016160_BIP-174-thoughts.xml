    <summary>The idea of using bech32 was brought up in a conversation, but there are concerns that it may not be suitable. Bech32 is optimized for BCH and has error detecting properties that are guaranteed for 4 characters with a maximum length of 90 characters. It is also larger than base64. Although it is a dependency for native Segwit addresses, it may not be the best option for this particular situation. Further analysis is needed to determine if bech32 is feasible for this project.</summary>
