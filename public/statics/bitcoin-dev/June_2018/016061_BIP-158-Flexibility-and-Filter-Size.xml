    <title>BIP 158 Flexibility and Filter Size</title>

    <summary>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the security and privacy enhancements in BIP 37. According to Tamas Blummer, an outpoint + output script filter is useful for implementing wallets with BIP 37, and committing such a filter to the block cannot be an error. Without block commitment, mobiles would have to use trusted filter provider or implement a complex data hungry algorithm, which would still make them insecure as with BIP 37. However, implementing this filter on P2P prior to a soft fork adding the commitment may not result in its widespread use. It is suggested that BIP 37 could be decommissioned after the soft fork, thereby offering both security and privacy enhancement at modest data cost. The issue of verifying filter validity is also discussed, where it is concluded that if nodes generate filters accurately, then downloading relevant blocks should not be affected even in the presence of a malicious peer.</summary>
