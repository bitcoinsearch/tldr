    <summary>The author is asking if lightning nodes only need to watch for transactions that come after the funding transaction and if running a pruned bitcoind instance with txindex would be useful. They also mention that indexing pruned nodes is not supported because it doesn't make sense, but with the lightning requirements, does an indexed pruned node start to make sense? The email thread then shifts to a previous post about whether chunks of blockchain could be saved on minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents so that people with limited storage space can still use Bitcoin. One response suggests using the "prune" flag to get a snapshot of the blockchain, but notes that it's incompatible with "txindex" and "rescan" so it may be an issue for lightning nodes.</summary>
