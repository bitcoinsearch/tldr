    <summary>The email is a late feedback on a PR that includes a few notes. The authors provide four points in their message, starting with the BIP-32 path being global and not per-input, which could lead to address reuse. They suggest having separate sections for global, input, and output data or keeping spend to public keys in the global section and input public keys in the per-input sections. The second point is about the redeem script (0x01) and witness script (0x02), which are confusing, and the authors propose having separate output sections. The third point is about the sighash type 0x03 and whether it should be binding. The final point is about skipping records for types that one is unaware of, which the authors think could be a security issue. They suggest introducing a flag to define optional records or changing the structure to {data}. Finally, the authors argue for clarity and ease of use over space constraints, although they acknowledge that this format is not intended for blockchain or persistent storage, so size does not matter as much.</summary>
