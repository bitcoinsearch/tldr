    <summary>Bitcoin Core has released version 0.16.1 for download on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. The new release includes several bug fixes, updated translations, and removal of `-blockmaxsize` option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes. The deprecated option has been replaced by the `-blockmaxweight` option. Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems but it's not frequently tested on Unix-like systems, so users are advised to exercise caution when using the software on these systems. The latest version of Bitcoin Core includes several improvements and updates, including documentation clarification, several bug fixes related to block and transaction handling, P2P protocol, network code, wallet and GUI improvements. A number of tests and QA have been conducted to ensure the stability of the system. The release was contributed by various individuals, including Ben Woosley, David A. Harding, fanquake, JeremyRand, Pieter Wuille, Tamas Blummer, and Wladimir J. van der Laan.</summary>
