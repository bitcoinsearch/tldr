    <summary>Tamas Blummer, a blockchain developer, believes that lighter but SPV secure nodes could help the network to grow mesh-like while adding more users who blindly follow proof of work (POW). In the long term, most users' security will be determined by either trusted hubs or POW. Blummer is unsure which is worse, but he thinks that offering the choice to the user is important and therefore commits filters. However, Gregory Maxwell, another blockchain developer, disagrees with Blummer's viewpoint and thinks that all these filter things are a total waste of time.</summary>
