    <summary>In a post on Bitcoin-dev, matejcik argues that while the BIP174 format is simple to parse by hand, it can be tedious and time-consuming. They suggest that the use of protobuf, with its many implementations for sorting record types and delimiting records, would be a more efficient solution. However, they also acknowledge that using protobuf may be overkill for such a simple format and could result in unnecessary dependencies. Matejcik notes that implementing a protobuf-based version of BIP174 may be equally as difficult as implementing the current version of BIP174. As an alternative, they have created a simple serializer that they believe would be useful in projects like clightning. The serializer is available on Github under the name libpsbt.</summary>
