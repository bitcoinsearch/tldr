    <summary>A discussion on proposed changes to BIP 174 was held via Bitcoin-dev email. The proposed changes include encoding PSBTs as binary or a Base64 string. This would not add any extra dependencies like Z85 would. One member suggested considering the use of bech32, but running some numbers would be necessary since it would be larger than base64 and might not be supported by all wallets. Another member disagreed with removing global types from the proposal, stating that leaving it there would allow for future extensibility. Overall, there was agreement on the proposed changes and further discussion will be had regarding the number of records and their keys.</summary>
