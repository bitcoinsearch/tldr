    <summary>Pieter, a contributor to the Bitcoin project, expressed concerns about the use of Bech32 in a recent proposal by Jonas Schnelli. While Bech32 is known for detecting errors, Pieter argues that it is not efficient for error correction beyond a single error. He suggests that other base32 BCH codes could be designed with more efficient algorithms for recovery, making good design strength more important than selecting a code from a large set with better properties. Pieter presents two sets of codes he has identified: one designed for length 93 and another for length 341, each with varying levels of error correction properties. Depending on the requirements, Pieter offers to construct a code and implementation in a few days.</summary>
