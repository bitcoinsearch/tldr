    <summary>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Johnson Lau, the topic of discussion was about a design called Graftroot. Johnson Lau argued that if this design is dangerous, then the existing signature checking rules must be equally dangerous. However, Pieter Wuille pointed out that the safety of a construction does not solely depend on consensus rules but also on how it is used. He further mentioned that having the option of Graftroot being non-optional is not required as signers could have signed any arbitrary transaction instead, making delegation less powerful.</summary>
