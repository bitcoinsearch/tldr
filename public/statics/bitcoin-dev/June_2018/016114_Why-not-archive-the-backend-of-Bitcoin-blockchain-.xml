    <summary>Lightning nodes need to monitor the network for transactions that require a reaction. Lightning nodes have to watch for transactions that come after the funding transaction. Lightning doesn't need to run with -txindex. Pruned nodes should work as long as the current blockchain head that the lightning node has seen does not fall into the pruned range. An indexed pruned node could make sense but `-txindex` should never be required to run a lightning node. Tailing the blockchain is more than sufficient to get the necessary data. The reliance on `bitcoind` can hopefully be minimized in the future.</summary>
