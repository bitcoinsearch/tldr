    <summary>The discussion on ways to improve multilingual usage of BIP39 has highlighted the need for a standard way to convert any words into a hex string, regardless of language or character encoding. While some have argued that English words are sufficient, it's clear that support for all languages is necessary for a standard in wallet seed generation. Currently, there is no multilingual standard or official Portuguese wordlist, but there is ongoing discussion on this topic and the need to start choosing/codifying a standard.In response to a proposal to expand the BIP039 wordlist to include Portuguese, it was noted that Portuguese is the 6th most spoken language in the world and an official language in 10 countries. Breno is interested in proposing the expansion or helping if it has already been proposed and seeks guidance on the steps he should take.A GitHub user has started a Portuguese wordlist which could be useful for those looking to expand the BIP039 wordlist to Portuguese. It's important to recognize the significance of including all languages in the standard for wallet seed generation, and the ongoing discussion on this topic highlights the need for action to codify a standard.</summary>
