    <summary>In a recent email exchange, it was discussed that hardware wallets (HWWs) may not be able to handle partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBT) natively due to their constraints on presenting various information during signing-verification. However, the Coldcard hardware wallet is PSBT native and can work directly from PSBT without any issues. The Coldcard expects a PSBT to be uploaded over USB or MicroSD card and works in-place with it by scanning over it multiple times. It supports 256k byte PSBT files with hundreds of inputs/outputs, working in a system with only 25k free RAM after startup. It was also suggested that defining a mime-type for PSBT would be a great usability feature, especially since it's a binary format.</summary>
