    <summary>A developer has proposed a change in the Bitcoin core code that would disallow using SIGHASH_SINGLE without matched output, as it is an insecure signature form that commits to no output while users might think it commits to one. This makes it easier for UTXO of the same key to be stolen in non-segwit scripts. The developer suggests that this unintended consensus behavior should be disabled with a softfork since these signatures are inherently unsafe. However, another developer questions the need for a softfork on security grounds and proposes that it may be better to consider soft-forking the code out on the basis of code complexity instead. He also wonders if the non-standardness of the signature means it is secure.</summary>
