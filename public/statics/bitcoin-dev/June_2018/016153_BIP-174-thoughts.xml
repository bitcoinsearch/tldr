    <summary>In this email thread, William Casarin suggests using a human-readable part like lightning invoices for encoding in PSBTs. However, Peter D. Gray opposes the idea and suggests using binary only and hex for developers and JSON interfaces. While Andrew agrees with Peter that PSBTs are not user-visible things, he thinks most people will end up copy-pasting them as strings and Base64 encoding would make the strings smaller. They also discuss filename extensions and mime-types to match. Andrew acknowledges the need for an update in Appendix A and defining symbols for numeric key values. Finally, he mentions that he will try his best to fix the issues with the tables in the BIP.</summary>
