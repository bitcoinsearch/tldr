    <summary>The email conversation between Bram Cohen and Bryan discusses the possibility of an attacker or group of attackers conspiring to reduce block sizes in order to increase transaction fees, which could be done with a miner activated soft fork. While it is not possible to significantly increase or decrease the block rate in the long run due to the work difficulty adjustment, an attacker could potentially produce empty blocks to DOS the system or carry out a 51% attack. The discussion also mentions previous talks on soft-hard-forks employing empty blocks requiring less than 51% hashrate.</summary>
