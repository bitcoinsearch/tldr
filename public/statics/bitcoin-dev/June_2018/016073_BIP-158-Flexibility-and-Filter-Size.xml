    <summary>In an email conversation, Jim Posen expressed hesitancy towards making a complexity tradeoff for bandwidth savings due to a behavior that is discouraged. However, Kalle corrected Jim's statement, saying that the bandwidth gains are actually from filters observing that false positives are independent between two filters, not from address reuse. This means that clients who connect once a day will likely only download 2-3 filters at most if they had nothing relevant in the last ~144 blocks.</summary>
