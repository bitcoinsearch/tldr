    <summary>In an email thread, William Casarin shared his experience of building a simple serializer in an afternoon and expressed his preference for using a smaller library like libpsbt over larger dependencies like protobuf. He also shared a pull request for converting the writer part of a code to protobuf-compatible version, which took him less than an hour to write. The code produced PSBTs that could be parsed by his "bip174 playground".</summary>
