    <summary>The Bitcoin developers discussed the practicality of creating per-input and per-output extra fields in order to simplify signers, but concluded that it would not be worth the effort. They also debated the confusion surrounding global items 0x01 (redeem script) and 0x02 (witness script), which are used for Pay-To-Script-Hash input and output scripts. They suggested adding a new output section to clarify the difference between input and output redeem scripts. The developers also noted that skipping records with unknown types could potentially be a security issue, and considered introducing a flag to define optional records. Finally, they discussed whether or not to make the "number of inputs" field mandatory, but ultimately agreed that it could be dropped if signatures/witnesses were not put inside the transaction until they were finalized.</summary>
