    <summary>On June 5, 2018, Jim Posen raised concerns on bitcoin-dev about the complexity tradeoff for bandwidth savings, stating that it may not be worth it due to the discouragement of certain behaviors. However, there is a point of clarification that if scripts are used to identify inputs and outputs, then no use is required for the savings. This means that each coin spent was created once, allowing for a potential 2:1 change in bits set without any reuse at all. It is unclear what portion of coins created are spent within the same 144 block window.</summary>
