    <summary>Achow101 suggests that Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) should be either in binary or encoded as a Base64 string. He states that several Bitcoin clients already support Base64 encoding of data for signed messages, which would not add any extra dependencies like Z85 would. In order to make PSBTs more human-readable, he proposes creating a human-readable part similar to lightning invoices. Achow101 also suggests dropping the magic code and using base encoding that excludes + and / characters, such as base62 (gmp-style), for easier copy/pasting. The context includes an example of both human-readable and base62 encoded PSBTs. The author notes that the base64-encoded PSBT is 920 bytes while the base62-encoded PSBT is 927 bytes.</summary>
