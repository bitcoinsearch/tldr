    <summary>For codes designed for a length of 341, the number of checksum characters needed to correct errors varies based on the number of errors to be corrected. For correcting one error, three checksum characters are required, and for correcting two errors, seven checksum characters are required. This pattern continues up to correcting 28 errors, which requires 102 checksum characters, or approximately double the length of the code. The trade-off between code length and recovery properties is determined by the user's medium of storage. It may be beneficial to support multiple checksum variants to accommodate varying storage mediums. The proposal suggests supporting longer checksum variants, such as the 51 or 102 character checksums.</summary>
