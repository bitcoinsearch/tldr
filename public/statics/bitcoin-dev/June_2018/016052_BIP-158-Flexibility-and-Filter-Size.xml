    <summary>In a message sent on June 1st, 2018 to bitcoin-dev, Olaoluwa Osuntokun mentioned a proposed change in using the previous output script instead of the outpoint. However, modifying the filters in this way could pose a security risk for light clients, as it makes strong assumptions about the integrity of the nodes that the client is communicating with. This type of network attacker could be anyone from an individual on the same LAN or WiFi segment to someone who has compromised an upstream router. The original proposal for using these types of maps was that their digests could eventually be committed and then checked against the commitment, matching the same general security model used otherwise in SPV. Unfortunately, using the scripts instead of the outpoints takes us further away from a design that is optimized for committing (or, for that matter, use purely locally by a wallet).</summary>
