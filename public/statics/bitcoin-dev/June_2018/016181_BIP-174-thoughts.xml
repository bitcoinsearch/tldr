    <summary>Rodolfo Novak, the founder of Coinkite, has announced that Coldcard's plugin for Electrum using the original BIP spec is ready. The hardware is also ready with this specification and will be made public soon. Samourai Wallet and Sentinel are also ready with the current spec. The team intends to upgrade it once the final spec is ready but needs to ship Coldcard first. In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrew Chow clears up some confusion regarding whether a PSBT can contain hundreds of thousands of zero bytes in the input or output key-value arrays, stating that it is outdated information. It was intended for the possibility of adding output maps, which has already been done. He also states that it is possible for a PSBT to contain very large unknown key-value pairs which could potentially cause a problem, but it should not be an issue as they are something the user has to enter rather than something received remotely without user interaction. There was also a proposal to set a hard limit on the size of the PSBT, but Andrew Chow opined that such a limitation would not be practical or useful.</summary>
