    <summary>A Discreet Log Contract (DLC) is a Bitcoin-compatible oracle contract that allows transactions to be based on signatures broadcasted by some set of oblivious oracles. It is used as a contracting building block that enables various applications such as betting, hedging, financial contracts, and synthetic assets. Interested individuals can now follow or participate in work related to Discreet Log Contracts through the dlc-dev mailing list. The repository contains links to blog posts and the white paper. Monthly specification meetings are also held on the first Tuesday of every month. Recent updates include the use of ECDSA Adaptor signatures, defined TLV-serializations for messages required to set up DLCs between parties, multiple compatible DLC implementations, specified compression algorithms, and algorithms allowing users to use a threshold t-of-n oracles. A more stable v0 tag/release is expected to be available in a few months.</summary>
