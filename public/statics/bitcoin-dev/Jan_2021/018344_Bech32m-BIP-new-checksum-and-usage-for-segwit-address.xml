    <summary>Pieter Wuille has proposed changes to the checksum in native segwit addresses for v1 and higher in a BIP draft. The proposal involves defining a new encoding, Bech32m, which is a tweaked variant of Bech32, and a new segwit address encoding that replaces the corresponding section in BIP173. The new encoding prescribes using Bech32 for v0 witness addresses and Bech32m for other versions. Rusty commended the clarity of the write-up and was impressed with the mathematical jujitsu that ensures no bech32 string is a valid bech32m string even with three errors.</summary>
