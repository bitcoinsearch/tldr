Pavol "stick" Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs, expressed excitement about Luke's efforts and mentioned that their company had spun off a new entity called Tropic Square which shares the goal of bringing open security chips to the general public. He offered to arrange a call to exchange ideas with Luke. The link to Tropic Square's website is provided in the email.</summary>
