    <summary>Hardware Wallets (HW) are useful in preventing private-key extraction and mitigating the compromission of a user's day-to-day device. The goal is to spark discussions on improving HW for all bitcoiners, mainly focusing on issues that may affect Revault, a vault protocol being developed. The proposed improvements include displaying the Bitcoin Script itself when possible, knowing pubkeys or xpubs the HW does not hold private keys for, better Bitcoin compatibility, keeping track of inputs already signed once, and adding ways to check that a "clawback" has been signed first. These improvements are necessary for any decent security, assuming the computer on which the transaction is crafted is compromised. Revault does not plan on building hardware wallets but hopes existing and upcoming manufacturers will implement strong security for their users. The email also includes links to prior work on similar problematics.</summary>
