    <summary>The email proposes a discussion to improve hardware wallets for bitcoiners, including those using the vault protocol Revault. The author lists prior work on similar issues and discusses proposed improvements, such as output script parsing to display the Bitcoin Script instead of just an address, pubkey interpretation to display a label for pubkeys or xpubs not held by the wallet, better support for advanced Bitcoin features like inputs, and tracking signed inputs to follow a specific signing order.However, implementing these changes may be difficult given the low memory and computational power of secure elements. A major concern is the risk of poisoned inputs to hardware wallets and pre-signed transactions protocols, which can incapacitate the entire defense mechanism if any input is spent. The proposed solution is to keep track of inputs that have already been signed once and follow a specific signing order, but this requires a Merklized persistent data structure to store most of the storage on the trust-minimized software.The primary issue with hardware wallets is that they are assumed to not have internet access, which creates problems when clawback transactions need to be broadcasted at a specific blockheight. However, devrandom believes that achieving the desired "liveness" requirements without compromising too much on the air-gap is possible through UTXO oracles, a narrow optical or serial protocol, and a set of operators that can react to lack of liveness. Going online to get proof of time passing increases the attack surface to the blockchain, but may be necessary for timely broadcast of clawback transactions in protocols where they are necessary.The email also highlights the risk of poisoned inputs to hardware wallets and pre-signed transactions protocols, and proposes improvements to keep track of inputs that have already been signed once and check that a "clawback" has been signed first. However, maintaining state for the hardware device requires a Merklized persistent data structure to store the majority of storage on the trust-minimized software, and the hardware wallet cannot know the current block height when the clawback transaction must be broadcast if it cannot be an online device.The author concludes by stating that while Revault does not plan on building hardware wallets, they hope existing and upcoming manufacturers implement stronger security measures, which will ultimately benefit everyone. The improvements proposed in the email would benefit all bitcoin users, not just those using the Revault protocol, and include displaying the Bitcoin Script itself when possible, knowing pubkeys or xpubs the HW does not hold private keys for, better Bitcoin compatibility, keeping track of inputs already signed once, and adding ways to check that a "clawback" has been signed first.</summary>
