    <summary>The proposed BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) suggests the addition of a new, optional p2p message called "disabletx" to allow peers to communicate that they do not want to send or receive loose transactions during their connection. This message would ease the implementation of software that could increase inbound connection limits for such peers, which would make it easier to add additional persistent block-relay-only connections on the network, strengthening its security with little additional bandwidth. Currently, software has been deployed using the BIP37/BIP60 "fRelay" field in the version message to signal that transactions should not be sent initially. However, BIP37 allows transaction relay to be enabled later in the connection's lifetime, complicating software that would try to distinguish inbound peers that will never relay transactions from those that might. By adding the "disabletx" message, nodes can distinguish between peers that will and will not enable transaction relay. This proposal adds a new, optional message that a node can send a peer when initiating a connection to that peer, to indicate that connection should not be used for transaction-relay for the connection's lifetime. In addition, without a current mechanism to negotiate whether addresses should be relayed on a connection, this BIP suggests that address messages not be sent on links where tx-relay has been disabled. The full specification and compatibility details are provided in the BIP.</summary>
