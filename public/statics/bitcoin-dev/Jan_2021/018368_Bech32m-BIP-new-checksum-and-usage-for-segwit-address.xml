    <summary>In an email exchange between nakagat and Pieter, nakagat expressed agreement with Pieter's idea but noted that it was not the same as "checksum = hash (hrp, data)." Pieter clarified that while they are not the same, both have error-detection properties. However, Pieter argued that the BCH-based checksum used in Bech32 is better at detecting certain subsets of errors than a hash can be. He added that if they wanted a checksum with error detection properties equivalent to a hash, they should just use a hash like Base58Check did. Nonetheless, Pieter emphasized that this is not the goal of Bech32/Bech32m. If nakagat still had questions, Pieter suggested taking the discussion off the email list.</summary>
