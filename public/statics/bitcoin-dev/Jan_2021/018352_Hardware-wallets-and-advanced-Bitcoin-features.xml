    <summary>The email proposes a discussion to improve hardware wallets for bitcoiners. The author starts the discussion from a vault protocol they are developing called Revault and its hardware wallet requirements, but also includes improvements that would benefit all bitcoin users. The postulate is that hardware wallets are useful to mitigate the compromise of a user's device. The email lists prior work on similar issues and then discusses proposed improvements in various areas. One improvement is output script parsing where the hardware wallet should display the Bitcoin Script itself instead of just an address. Another improvement is pubkey interpretation where the hardware wallet could know pubkeys or xpubs it does not hold private keys for and display a label. Additionally, the hardware wallet should be made more compatible with advanced features of Bitcoin including better support for inputs. Finally, the hardware wallet should be able to keep track of inputs already signed once and follow a specific signing order. The author acknowledges that some of these changes may be difficult given the low memory and computational power of secure elements, but believes they are necessary for decent security. The author concludes by stating that while Revault does not plan on building hardware wallets, they hope existing and upcoming manufacturers implement stronger security measures, which will ultimately benefit everyone.</summary>
