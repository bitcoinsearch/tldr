    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer and the creator of SegWit, has announced updates to Bech32, a bitcoin address format. He updated several reference implementations (C, C++, Python, Javascript) to support Bech32m and added links for more reference implementations. In addition, he opened a pull request on Bitcoin Core and made updates to the BIP draft. The updates to the draft include clarifying the title, adding rationale for not permitting both Bech32 and Bech32m for v0, adding a section on error location, and adding links for more reference implementations. Wuille responded to questions regarding using a hash function to compute the checksum instead of Bech32's algorithm, stating that it would be functionally equivalent to computing the final xorred-in constant from the HRP and the data using a hash function.</summary>
