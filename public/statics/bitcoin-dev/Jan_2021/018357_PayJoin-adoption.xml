    <summary>PayJoin is a privacy technology that has the potential to damage the ability of blockchain surveillance to spy on bitcoin users and destroy bitcoin's fungibility. A protocol standard has already been defined and implemented by several projects such as BTCPayServer, Wasabi Wallet, JoinMarket, and BlueWallet. The lack of adoption for PayJoin may be due to the lack of visibility. A wiki page tracking adoption has been created to help increase awareness of PayJoin. Pushing merchants towards accepting Bitcoin specifically via software like BTCPayServer, which already supports PayJoin, might be immensely helpful in increasing adoption. Directly contributing to the software by writing an implementation is the most helpful but harder option. Recently, a UK bitcoin exchange shut down due to new regulations, with the owner writing a blog post about the issue. The post highlighted that using entities that are paranoid about keeping their coins clean and adhering to all the regulations can increase risk scores, making it difficult to use personal wallets or donate to someone online. If PayJoin is adopted widely, it can help ensure that crypto remains permissionless money for the internet. To increase adoption of PayJoin, implementing it directly with companies/in respective software repositories seems like a strong first step for greater adoption, as it gets more eyes on it in general.</summary>
