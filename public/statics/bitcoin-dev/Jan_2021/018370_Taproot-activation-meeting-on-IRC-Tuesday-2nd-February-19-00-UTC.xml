    <summary>There has been a community effort to move towards consensus on an activation method for the proposed Taproot soft fork. Notable contributors include David Harding, AJ Towns, Aaron van Wirdum, Jonathan Bier, Ben Carman, and Alejandro De La Torre. There are many others who have also made an impact. Various proposals for activating Taproot can be found on the Bitcoin wiki, Erisian, Bitcoin Magazine, BitMEX blog, Suredbits, and Taproot activation websites. To make progress towards finalizing the revised BIP 8 activation method, a meeting will be held on IRC on the ##taproot-activation channel on February 2nd at 19:00 UTC. General questions or discussion on Taproot activation are welcome. Participants should do sufficient pre-reading in advance. Relevant pull requests related to BIP 8 are available on GitHub and comments or questions can be posted on the IRC channel before or after the meeting.</summary>
