    <summary>In an email to Pieter Wuille, Takatoshi Nakagawa proposed the creation of BECH32M_CONST from hrp and data instead of constants. He suggested that this could be done while maintaining the same error position as Bech32 by recalculating the value created from hrp and data. This would allow him to commit both hrp and data to the checksum. In response, Pieter Wuille updated several reference implementations (C, C++, Python, Javascript) to support Bech32m. He also updated the website with an error-locating JS decoder and demo, opened a Bitcoin Core PR, and made updates to the BIP draft. Nakagawa had read the BIP draft of Bech32m and implemented it in Go. When he asked if the Checksum had to be fixed, Wuille was unsure of his question and provided three possible interpretations.</summary>
