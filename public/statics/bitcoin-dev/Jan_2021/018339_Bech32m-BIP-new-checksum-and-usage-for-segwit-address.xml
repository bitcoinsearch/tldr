    <summary>On Monday, January 4, 2021, Pieter Wuille proposed a BIP draft for changing the checksum in native segwit addresses for v1 and higher. This draft was created following discussions held on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list. The proposal suggests defining a new encoding called Bech32m, which is a tweaked variant of Bech32. The Bech32 section of BIP173 remains in effect. The new segwit address encoding replaces the corresponding section in BIP173 and prescribes using Bech32 for v0 witness addresses and Bech32m for other versions. Pieter provided a link to the Github repository containing the BIP draft.</summary>
