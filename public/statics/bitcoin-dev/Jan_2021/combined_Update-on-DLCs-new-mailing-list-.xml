    <summary>Discreet Log Contract (DLC) is a Bitcoin-compatible oracle contract that can be used as a building block for various applications such as betting, hedging, financial contracts, and synthetic assets. Transactions can be based on signatures broadcasted by some set of oblivious oracles. Those who are interested in following or participating in work related to Discreet Log Contracts can do so through the dlc-dev mailing list, which contains links to blog posts and the white paper. Monthly specification meetings are also held on the first Tuesday of every month.Recent updates include using ECDSA Adaptor signatures, defined TLV-serializations for messages required to set up DLCs between parties, multiple compatible DLC implementations, specified compression algorithms, and algorithms allowing users to use a threshold t-of-n oracles. A more stable v0 tag/release is expected to be available in a few months.</summary>
