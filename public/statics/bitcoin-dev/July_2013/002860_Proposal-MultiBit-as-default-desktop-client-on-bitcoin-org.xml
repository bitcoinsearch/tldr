    <summary>The topic being discussed in the given context is about MultiBit, a Bitcoin wallet application. The discussion revolves around its security, ease of use, and support for developers. One person suggests that bundling the app with a stripped-down JVM would make it friendlier and easier to use. Another person raises concerns about Java's security problems, which have caused it to be an instant uninstall item on Windows PCs. However, it is noted that MultiBit only executes highly trusted code, so there has almost never been a Java exploit against secure trusted code. The conversation then shifts towards supporting developers who wish to contribute to MultiBit. The project's supporting documentation has been beefed up to make it more accessible. Additionally, a dedicated support page has been created on the website, which has fixes and support notes for the most common issues. In-app help also now has a 'Support' section with troubleshooting and the commonest gotchas. Failing that, people are directed first to bitcoin.stackexchange.com, and then to GitHub issues to search existing or raise a new issue. Finally, there is a discussion about whether MultiBit should replace Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app. While one person votes "yes," another expresses concerns about Java's security problems and recommends a fast SPV client as a first wallet instead. Despite this, the general consensus seems to be that MultiBit is a reliable and user-friendly option.</summary>
