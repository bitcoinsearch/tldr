    <summary>The multibit.org server is a dedicated server hosted by the German company http://www.server4you.net. The server is physically located in Strasbourg, on the French side of the French-German border. On July 9, 2013, Mike Hearn expressed his concern about SourceForge's horrible user interface and blocking of some countries, which exposes them to a large and potentially hackable mirror network. He suggested that they keep using their own servers since they are not bandwidth constrained. Later in the discussion, Jeff Garzik agreed with Daniel F's suggestion that they should move the downloads to a site where download bandwidth worries do not exist, like SourceForge. The download of MultiBit from the multibit.org server was limited to around 30,000ish maximum copies per day due to the bump up of its size from 11MB to 30-40MB. The multibit.org server maxed out at 1 TB of bandwidth per day. Finally, the email ends with a signature promoting the website: https://multibit.org, with the tagline "Money, reinvented."</summary>
