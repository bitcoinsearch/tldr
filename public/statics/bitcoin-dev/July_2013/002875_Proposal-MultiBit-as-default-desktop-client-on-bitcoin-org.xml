    <summary>In an email conversation from 07/09/2013, Nick Simpson suggested Cloudflare as a solution to bandwidth issues. Jonathan Corgan of Corgan Labs endorsed the service, stating that his team had switched to Cloudflare's free service tier a few months prior and found it reduced their bandwidth bill by about 50% with minimal impact on their operations. The GNU Radio Project hosts their own web servers, downloads, and git repositories on AWS EC2. Cloudflare is a content delivery network that provides various services including DDoS protection, CDN, DNS, and security.</summary>
