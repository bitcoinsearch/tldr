    <summary>Michael has informed Bazyli about a fresh build based on git (Xcode) and has faced an issue where the paillier and account tests were missing. Michael has asked Bazyli to comment them out in tests/CMakeLists.txt so that the coinexplorer can build without any issues. Michael has also mentioned that he has done a git push, therefore, Bazyli needs to do a git pull first before proceeding.</summary>
