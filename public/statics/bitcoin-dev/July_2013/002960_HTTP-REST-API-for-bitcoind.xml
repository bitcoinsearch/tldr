    <summary>Jeff Garzik proposed the addition of an HTTP REST API for bitcoind which would allow external access to transaction, address, and block indices. The API would provide a decentralized block explorer capability. The first two implemented API calls are simple GET requests for returning a block or transaction based on a query string. Jeff suggested that adding one more URL would make the API perfect: GET /rest/block-with-tx/TX-HASH. This URL would make it possible for an SPV client to trace the providence of any transaction without needing to maintain the entire chain. Dr. Andy Parkins expressed his agreement with Jeff's proposal.</summary>
