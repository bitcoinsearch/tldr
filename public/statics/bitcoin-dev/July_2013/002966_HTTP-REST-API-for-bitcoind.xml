    <summary>In an email conversation between Andy Parkins and Pieter Wuille on July 23, 2013, it was revealed that there is no default index being maintained for transactions. This means that enabling -txindex since version 0.8 is necessary for access to the index. However, Pieter argues that maintaining such an index is an unnecessary burden. When a new transaction is received, it does not involve the blockchain in any way for verification. Instead, a separate database with unspent transaction outputs is used for validation, which currently stands at around 230 MB. The blockchain is merely a historical record used to serve other nodes and perform wallet rescans.</summary>
