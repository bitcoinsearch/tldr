    <summary>In an email thread dated July 22, 2013, Jeff Garzik shared the goal of the HTTP REST interface which was to access unauthenticated, public blockchain information. However, he made it clear that there was no plan to add wallet interfacing or manipulation via the API. One participant in the thread asked if it was planned to expose the UXTO set of a given address. This feature would be useful for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets to swipe a previously unknown private key such as a paper wallet.</summary>
