    <summary>The article discusses the need for an address-indexed committed merkle UTXO-set tree for safe SPV security assumption. The proposed MerkleTrie in libcoin is currently indexed only on UTXOs, but adding an extra index for scripts would be easy. The burden on validating nodes for keeping such an index is minimal and hardly affects timing differences. However, the MerkleTrie index is currently re-built on startup which takes around 30 seconds. It needs to be synced with disk in the long run as the UTXO set will grow over time. To be useful, this system needs to be enforced by miners, which puts a significant burden on validation nodes. More research is needed before implementing it efficiently.</summary>
