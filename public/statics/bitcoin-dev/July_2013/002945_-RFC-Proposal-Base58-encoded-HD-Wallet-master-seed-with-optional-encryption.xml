    <summary>In a forum discussion from July 2013, Jean-Paul Kogelman proposed a Base58 encoded HD wallet master seed with optional encryption. Andreas M. Antonopoulos replied to the proposal, stating that he had a beta BIP0038 compliant paper wallet and was currently working on BIP0032 paper wallets. Antonopoulos also expressed interest in Kogelman's proposal, calling it necessary and a great approach to combine BIP0038 and BIP0032. Kogelman asked for feedback on his proposal and provided a link to the draft. However, in response to another participant's question about whether the encoding/decoding functions would suffice, Kogelman stated that the proposal was not yet in shippable form.</summary>
