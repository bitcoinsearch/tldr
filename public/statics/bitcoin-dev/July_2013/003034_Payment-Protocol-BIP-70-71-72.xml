    <summary>Gavin Andresen has created three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) based on the preliminary payment protocol specification. The BIPs include network protocol/messages, MIME types for messages and bitcoin URI extension. He expects the wallet-side implementation to be added into Bitcoin-Qt soon, which can be found on Github. Additionally, there is a reference implementation of server-side code available for generating payment requests in php and C++. This announcement was made by Gavin Andresen himself.</summary>
