    <summary>In an email conversation, Greg Troxel asked about the applicability of a Linux packaging letter to other non-Linux packaging systems such as FreeBSD ports and OpenBSD ports. The repeatable build infrastructure is portable to any mostly-POSIX-compliant system, though it has not yet been implemented. Requiring precise library dependencies is awkward. If the package builds on BE systems and then fails tests, it should fail at build time. People are being asked not to patch, but if they do make changes, merging them into the mainline helps ensure they get necessary testing needed to be safe.</summary>
