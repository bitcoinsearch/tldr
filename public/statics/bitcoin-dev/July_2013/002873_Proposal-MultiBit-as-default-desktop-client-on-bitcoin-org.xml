    <summary>In an email exchange dated July 9, 2013, Nick Simpson suggested the idea of using Cloudflare to help with bandwidth issues. However, Jeff Garzik responded that it would not be a good idea as Cloudflare was rapidly becoming a single point of failure for the bitcoin community. Jeff is a senior software engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., a leading bitcoin payment processor. The concerns raised by Jeff can be attributed to the fact that Cloudflare operates as a reverse proxy service which helps websites protect themselves from various types of attacks such as DDoS attacks, but also stores sensitive data which could be vulnerable to hackers.</summary>
