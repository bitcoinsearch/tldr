    <summary>In this conversation, Gavin Andresen and E willbefull discussed the compatibility of PaymentRequest-only bitcoin URIs. While E willbefull expressed concern that certain types of payments may not make sense to have a single fallback address, Gavin assured him that P2SH addresses already support all exotic transactions. He also clarified that while a page with a bitcoin URI link may rely on a separate service provider to assemble the PaymentRequest message, the payment transaction will always be created by the customer's wallet software. Gavin went on to suggest that if PaymentRequests gain widespread adoption, he would be happy to write another BIP allowing bitcoin: URIs to include a request parameter.</summary>
