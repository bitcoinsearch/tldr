    <summary>The developer of MultiBit, Jim, has expressed interest in bundling a JVM with the software to make it easier for users. However, this would require all build packaging to be redone and retested, and would increase the download size from 11MB to 30-40MB. Furthermore, there is currently no provision for automatic updates, but Jim suggests implementing signed files that MultiBit can check and update. He believes this must be put in place before bundling a JVM to avoid users having to redownload it. By having lists of all signed artifacts with SHA256 hashes, it would be practical and safe to start mirroring the code and crosschecking each mirror to ensure the SHA256s are correct. Java's security issues have made it an instant uninstall item on Windows PCs, according to Robert Backhaus. Although Java exploits are common, Caleb James DeLisle argues that Multibit is trustworthy and secure enough to handle money, so discouraging its use due to security concerns may not be necessary. Jim has recently added a dedicated support page on the website and improved in-app help to cover common issues. Users are also directed to bitcoin.stackexchange.com, and finally to GitHub issues to search existing or raise new issues. Mike Hearn has suggested that MultiBit replace Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app, which Gavin Andresen supports. The supporting documentation for the website can be found at https://github.com/jim618/multibit-website.</summary>
