    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list revolves around the need for bigger configurability in Tor itself. Jeff Garzik suggested that it would be interesting to explore linking directly with a Tor library, which is far superior to requiring a properly configured external process. To address this issue, Wendell from grabhive.com shared a Tor.framework for Cocoa developers, similar to their BitcoinKit. The framework embeds the existing tor code and reroutes internal Cocoa internet communication via tors proxy. However, some participants in the discussion felt that what they need is more significant configurability in Tor itself. Overall, there seems to be a need for a Tor library that provides better options for developers.</summary>
