    <summary>It appears that a document was created urging the Linux packaging community to not modify the upstream sources for Bitcoin. The creator of the document requested that people sign it if they agree with the wording, but someone deleted the signatures and replaced it with a request for PGP signing. The creator decided to roll back the document and lock it. If anyone would still like to add their name to the document, they can let the creator know or post it in the comments. A previous version of the document had been signed off on by Gavin, Pieter, Jgarzik, and Gregory Maxwell, but there were some minor inconsistencies with the current version.</summary>
