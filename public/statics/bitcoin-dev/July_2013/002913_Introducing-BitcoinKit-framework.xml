    <summary>The discussion is about extending the BitcoinKit.framework to handle the Basic SPV concept, which was originally planned by Satoshi. However, it was not completed due to several reasons such as lack of confidence in understanding the code and the risk involved in making invasive changes to core validation code. Therefore, a separate implementation was created for better risk management and to provide an object-oriented API that people could use to build a variety of apps. Additionally, the bitcoind codebase would require serious changes for mobiles beyond that required for ordinary SPV support, making it unclear if the decision to create a separate implementation was the right call. The situation is different now, with more unit tests and more people with a good understanding of the code. If someone wanted to implement SPV mode in bitcoind, they could be sent Satoshi's old patch, which indicates the basic cut lines.</summary>
