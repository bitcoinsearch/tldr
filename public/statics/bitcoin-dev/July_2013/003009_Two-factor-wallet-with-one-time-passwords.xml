    <summary>The author describes a new implementation of P2SH outputs that allows for scriptPubKeys to be reused. The implementation involves a merklized abstract syntax tree (MAST) and the use of short 6-word strings as authorization for payment. A disadvantage is the large storage requirements for the wallets. However, both tables can be stored in a distributed hash table in the cloud without loss of security. The security level is still 2^64, making it difficult for attackers to find a 64-bit pre-image.</summary>
