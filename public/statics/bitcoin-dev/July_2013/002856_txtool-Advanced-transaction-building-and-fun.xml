    <summary>txtool is a command line tool written in node.js that interfaces with Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind to assist in building complex transactions. Its goal is to demonstrate advanced bitcoin features and make it easier for users to experiment, while the intended audience has a basic understanding of bitcoin transactions. The full list of commands and theory of operation can be found on GitHub. The tool includes working examples such as multi-signature transaction building and passing around transactions for signing. More examples will soon be demonstrated, including decentralized crowdfunding and atomic coin swapping. Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., created txtool.</summary>
