    <summary>During a discussion in San Jose, Wendell expressed interest in hiring someone to complete a patch. Pieter Wuille introduced him to Eric Lombrozo who also showed interest but has since become busy and no detailed estimate has been produced. Wendell is interested in an open discussion around adding SPV support to bitcoind and is willing to fund or co-fund the project. He encourages options whenever possible including micro-stripped-VMs and transpilation. Mike Hearn offered to send Satoshi's old SPV patch to assist with the implementation of SPV mode in bitcoind.</summary>
