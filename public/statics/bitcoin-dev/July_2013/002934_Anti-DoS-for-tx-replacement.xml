    <summary>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik on July 18, 2013, Todd suggests using OP_DEPTH to eliminate the risk of a payee vanishing and putting funds in limbo. The conversation then turns to the costs, benefits, and risks associated with scripts no longer being stateless due to the introduction of OP_DEPTH.OP_DEPTH is an opcode that returns the current depth of the script's execution stack, which can be used to determine whether certain operations are valid or not. By using OP_DEPTH, Todd believes the risk of funds getting stuck in limbo due to a payee vanishing can be eliminated.Garzik questions the implications of scripts no longer being stateless due to the introduction of OP_DEPTH. He asks about the costs, benefits, and risks associated with this change. It is unclear from the context what specific concerns Garzik has regarding this change.Jeff Garzik is a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc. BitPay is a payment processing company that enables businesses to accept Bitcoin payments.</summary>
