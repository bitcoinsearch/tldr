    <summary>In this context, a user named Wendell asks Peter Todd if his advice on using Tor applies to both full and SPV nodes. Peter Todd responds that users should use Tor to preserve their privacy and that the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks is minimal for those who use Bitcoin correctly. He also advises against trusting zero-conf transactions as they are not secure. The conversation seems to be related to the use of bitcoinj over Tor, which is not an option at the time of writing. Wendell's contact information, including grabhive.com, Twitter handle, and GPG key, is also provided.</summary>
