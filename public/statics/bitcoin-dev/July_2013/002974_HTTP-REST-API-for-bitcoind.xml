    <summary>In a 2013 email exchange, Peter Todd proposed exposing the unspent transaction output (UXTO) set of a given address to enable Simple Payment Verification (SPV) wallets to swipe previously unknown private keys. However, this was deemed undesirable as it could increase resource usage by SPV clients on full nodes and make them more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Todd suggested adding HTTP authentication/SSL to the REST API instead, allowing SPV users to run their own instance or for trusted parties to set up servers. He even offered to set it up for Bitcoin Wallet users.</summary>
