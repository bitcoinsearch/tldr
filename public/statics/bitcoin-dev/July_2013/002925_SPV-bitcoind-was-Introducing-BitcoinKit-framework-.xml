    <summary>The libcoin/bitcoind client is a library that can be built upon to create both bitcoind and any client. It downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. The library contains a hash of the current set of UTXOs as part of the coinbase which is already implemented in libcoin. The library is compatible with "master". Bootstrapping the hash of UTXOs is the only thing missing from libcoin. There is some stub code for a p2pool like mining scheme ensuring several UTXO hashes every 10 minutes, but it's not yet finalized.</summary>
