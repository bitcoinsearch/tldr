    <summary>In a message posted on 07/09/2013 at 10:28 AM, Mike Hearn expressed his concerns over using SourceForge as a mirror network for Bitcoin downloads. He criticized the website's user interface and country blocks, which could potentially expose the system to hacking. Furthermore, he stated that although their servers are not bandwidth constrained, it would be best to use free capacity only if needed and keep using their own servers. However, Hearn clarified that in terms of the autoupdate process, the website's hackability and UI should be irrelevant since it will perform various checksum and signature verifications. Finally, he highlighted that the autoupdates could create lumpy download demand.</summary>
