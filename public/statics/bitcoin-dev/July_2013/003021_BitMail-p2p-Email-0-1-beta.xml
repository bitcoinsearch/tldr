    <summary>Pond is an email-like messaging system that runs over Tor and provides forward security that is resistant to traffic analysis. It was written by Adam Langley, who has serious credentials in the field. Most interestingly, messages are stored for a week and are strictly limited in size, and there is no spam because there are no addresses â€“ users must grant someone permission to message them by giving them a small file. Pond also takes forward security seriously and can use NVRAM in a TPM chip to destroy keys for data that might otherwise be un-erasable. However, it is written in Go. Meanwhile, a number of apparent sock accounts have been posting about what appears to be the same software under the name "goldbug" for a couple of days.</summary>
