    <title>Opcode whitelist for P2SH?</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on July 28, 2013, John Dillon proposed the idea of creating a whitelist for specific opcodes in scripts serialized using P2SH. He suggested dropping pay-to-pubkey and pay-to-multisig due to their potential for dumping data in the UTXO set. While this may be reasonable for miners, it could pose issues for interoperability between wallets. Therefore, some specific standard forms would still be necessary without a much smarter solver. However, this would require expanding the code required to implement a wallet, which is unfortunate but may be necessary.</summary>
