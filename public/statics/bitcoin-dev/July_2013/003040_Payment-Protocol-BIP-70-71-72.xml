    <summary>In a message from 31 July 2013, Gavin Andresen discussed the possibility of having a URI that is solely a payment request. Roy Badami had suggested using a URI like "bitcoin:?request=https%3A%2F%2Fmerchant.com%2Fpay.php%3Fh%3D2a8628fc2fbe" for this purpose. However, Andresen believed that a bitcoin address would still be needed for backwards compatibility. He proposed initiating a payment request with just an anchor tag if web browser support for arbitrary MIME types was strong enough. This would save a http round-trip. Badami pointed out that it's generally not possible to set the "Accept" header on a browser via a standard href. Andresen did not dispute this and ended his message with his signature. The email was sent on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. In addition to this discussion, the email also included an advertisement for getting SQL databases under version control. A link to more information about this was provided.</summary>
