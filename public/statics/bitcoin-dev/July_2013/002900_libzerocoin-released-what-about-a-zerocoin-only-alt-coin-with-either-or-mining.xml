    <summary>In July 2013, Peter Todd responded to a message sent by Luke-Jr regarding the creation of an alt-coin with no-reward/PoSacrifice merged mining as well as (rewarded) Prime POW and no subsidy halving. Todd criticized the proposal, citing Luke-Jr's past actions of 51% attacking other alt-coins. Luke-Jr's suggestion was met with skepticism due to his history. Todd deemed the statement as slander and inappropriate for discussion on the dev ML.</summary>
