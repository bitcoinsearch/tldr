    <summary>In an email exchange between Michael Gronager and Wendell, Michael mentions that the hash of the current set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) as part of the coinbase is already implemented in libcoin. He explains how libcoin is a library based on the satoshi client, and you can easily build both a bitcoind and any client on it. He also suggests looking at the BlockChain.h/cpp and the MerkleTrie classes in github.com/libcoin/libcoin to see how it works. However, Michael notes that what is missing from libcoin is a scheme to bootstrap the hash of UTXOs, though there is some stub code for a P2Pool-like mining scheme ensuring several UTXO hashes every 10 minutes. Michael says he will not have time to finalize it in the first few months, but anyone is welcome to help out. Wendell expresses his wish that they had known about libcoin a month ago, given that it downloads the entire blockchain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, which takes less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop.</summary>
