    <summary>In an email thread from 2013, Peter Todd discusses a potential improvement to Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) security. The suggestion is to ask for the history of a given transaction output, or txout, which includes the previous transactions that funded it. This could potentially be done with a non-interactive proof, which samples a subset of the prior transactions. The discussion is unrelated to Tor and was sent as an email with a signature attachment.</summary>
