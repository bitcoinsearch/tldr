    <summary>In a discussion about the security measures employed by Pond, Mike Hearn explains how the system utilizes a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip to reliably destroy keys for data that an SSD device might have otherwise made un-erasable. In doing so, the system ensures that sensitive information is properly safeguarded against unauthorized access. For those who are not too familiar with TPM chips, it is a hardware-based security solution used to securely store and manage cryptographic keys and other sensitive data. By utilizing this technology, Pond can provide its users with a high level of security and peace of mind.</summary>
