    <summary>The BitcoinKit.framework has been launched, which allows developers to write Bitcoin wallet apps for Mac OS X using bitcoind and a small API. Support for other Bitcoin implementations is soon to follow. BitcoinKit's first application is as the backbone of a new Mac wallet app called Hive, which will be released soon at www.grabhive.com. The source code is available on GitHub, and support is available via GitHub issues and a Bitcointalk thread. A sample GUI app is included. However, being based on bitcoind means it will take a very long time to synchronize for new users, which may cause some users to drop out. The best fix for this is SPV mode, but so far, the only SPV mode implementation is bitcoinj. The developer is experimenting with trans-piling bitcoinj to C++ to make it usable from Objective-C++ with this use case in mind.</summary>
