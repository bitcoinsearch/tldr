    <summary>In this email thread from July 18, 2013, Peter Todd proposes using the OP_DEPTH instruction to remove the risk of payees vanishing and putting funds in limbo. He suggests implementing it as a true soft-fork or as part of a script v2 using the soft-fork mechanism. jl2012 points out that there is already an OP_DEPTH instruction that returns the number of items on the stack. In the future, Todd suggests using terms such as OP_BLOCKHEIGHT, OP_TXOUTHEIGHT, and OP_TXOUTDEPTH to talk about hypothetical instructions that put the block height, confirmed txout height, and confirmed txout depth on the stack. He then provides an updated example of how the code would look using these new terms.</summary>
