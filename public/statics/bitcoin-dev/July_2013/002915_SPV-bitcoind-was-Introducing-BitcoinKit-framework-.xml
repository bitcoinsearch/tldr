    <summary>In a forum thread, Wendell expressed his interest in the development of an SPV bitcoind and offered to fund such work. Mike Hearn provided some of Satoshi's old code for this, but it is now broken. Despite this setback, Wendell's offer still stands and he is seeking feedback from knowledgeable parties about possible approaches to an SPV bitcoind. Wendell hopes that any resulting development could eventually be merged into the master branch rather than being a fork.</summary>
