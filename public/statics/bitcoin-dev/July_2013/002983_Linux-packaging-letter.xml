    <summary>In July 2013, Mike Hearn reported that someone had deleted the signatures of people who had signed a certain text and made substantive edits to it. The text was rolled back to a previous version that was missing the last copyedits made the previous night. The previous version of the text that had been ACKed the previous night was available at http://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/code/20130723-linux-distribution-packaging-and-bitcoin.md.Mike Hearn suggests using PGP to avoid issues like the one experienced with the edited text. He believes that using PGP is good because it shows solidarity with people building security infrastructure that our ecosystem depends on. For people working in their domain, basic competence and use of these tools are a kind of civic hygiene. Although it is poorly used and will be ignored by most, packagers are the most frequent users of PGP that Mike has encountered. Fortunately, PGP is harmless in any case.For those interested in offering PGP signatures of the text, they can download it from http://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/code/20130723-linux-distribution-packaging-and-bitcoin.md, clear sign it using gpg, and post the little signature asc. The result composes nicely at http://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/code/20130723-linux-distribution-packaging-and-bitcoin.md.asc.</summary>
