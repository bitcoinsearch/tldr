    <summary>The first part of the context talks about the Java Web Start system and its recent improvements. An example is given of how quickly an app can download and run using this system. JavaWS keeps the app up to date from that point, making it a secure option for downloading apps.However, there is a risk that an unknown author could damage the computer, but Jim has a code signing certificate to identify himself. While there is currently no provision for automatic updates, Jim plans to have Bitcoin signed files that MultiBit can check and update. The maximum number of downloads that the multibit.org server can deliver per day drops from around 90,000 to 30,000ish with bundled JVMs. To provide a good user experience, JNLP is suggested as an option on the multibit webpage until they have their own auto-update engine. Modern Java versions let you bundle the app with a stripped-down JVM. However, Java's security problems have made it an instant uninstall item on Windows PCs for about a year now.The second part of the context consists of messages from the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted on lists.sourceforge.net. These messages advertise AppDynamics Pro, a tool for application monitoring and bottleneck diagnosis. Links are provided to sign up for a free trial of the tool. One message is signed off with a promotion for Multibit, a service for managing Bitcoin currency. Gavin Andresen voted "yes" to have MultiBit replace Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app, and he thinks most users will be happier with it.</summary>
