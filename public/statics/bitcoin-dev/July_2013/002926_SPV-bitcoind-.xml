    <summary>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Andreas Schildbach, the topic of average connection time for the Bitcoin app was brought up. Andreas explained that the current programming allows for connections to stay open for at least two more minutes after receiving a block, and at least eight more minutes after sending or receiving a transaction. This is to allow the chain to catch up while preventing excessive battery drain. Additionally, connections stay open as long as the screen is on and the app is in the foreground. Mike suggested gathering telemetry from the Android wallet to determine how long SPV wallets typically remain open, and Andreas agreed to look into allowing users to opt in to usage statistics.</summary>
