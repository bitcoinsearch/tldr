    <summary>The Multibit client is an application written in Java, which has been criticized for its security issues. However, the author of this message argues that the code executed by Multibit is highly trusted, as it handles users' money. There have almost never been any Java exploits against secure, trusted code. The author suggests that discouraging the use of Java apps solely because people may accidentally activate the browser plugin when installing the JVM is valid, but client diversity is more important than stamping out Java. The message also includes updates about the Multibit website and support. The website is a Java application serving HTML, and its source code can be found on GitHub. The author has created a dedicated Support page on the website, added a support section to the in-app help with troubleshooting and common gotchas, and directed users to the Bitcoin Stack Exchange, where they can search for existing or raise new issues. Finally, the author mentions that Multibit has replaced Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app.</summary>
