    <summary>In 2013, Rob Meijer completed the first draft of his presentation slides and speaker notes for his talk titled "Defeating Trojans" at OHM2013. He used BitCoin as one of the main examples to emphasize the importance of programs like BitCoin having their own private storage apart from $HOME. To ensure that he didn't misrepresent BitCoin, he asked for someone to review his slides.</summary>
