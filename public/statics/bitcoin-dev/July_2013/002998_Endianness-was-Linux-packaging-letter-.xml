    <summary>In an email exchange from July 23, 2013, Gregory Maxwell discusses the protocol used for transmitting data through wires. He mentions that the protocol is LE (Little Endian) almost everywhere, but there is enough BE (Big Endian) to keep people on their toes. The order of transmission is important for ensuring proper communication between devices and networks. While the protocol may not be perfectly consistent across all systems, it is still important to understand and account for variations in transmission order. Overall, the email emphasizes the importance of attention to detail in communication protocols and the need to remain aware of potential differences in transmission order.</summary>
