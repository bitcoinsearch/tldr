    <summary>In a forum post on Tuesday 23 July 2013, Pieter Wuille responded to Andy Parkins' suggestion of adding an additional URL to the Bitcoin protocol. Andy suggested adding "GET /rest/block-with-tx/TX-HASH" to enable Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients to trace the providence of any transaction without needing to maintain the entire chain. However, Pieter revealed that there is actually no such index being maintained by default and enabling the -txindex since 0.8 is necessary to get this feature. He further stated that maintaining such an index is an unnecessary burden. Andy was surprised by this revelation and inquired about how newly received transactions have their inputs verified. They discussed whether multiple linear brute force searches of the block chain are carried out for every new transaction or if transactions are only recorded if they were in a block, and just their presence indicates they're valid.</summary>
