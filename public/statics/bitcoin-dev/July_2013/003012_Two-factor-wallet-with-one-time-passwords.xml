    <summary>On July 28, 2013, a discussion was held on Bitcoin development mailing list about minor scripting language additions to implement merklized abstract syntax tree (MAST) support. Peter Todd proposed a version where scriptPubKey's can be reused by verifying that path. He also mentioned the disadvantage of large storage requirements for wallets. In response, another user suggested that the size of the table deriving which H(nonce) is selected for a given txid:vout can be significantly smaller and nested IF statements can be replaced by creating the merkle tree over the tuples [i,H(nonce_i)] and proving that the nonce_i provided matched the precommitted tree.</summary>
