    <summary>The statement mentions that the blockchain has grown significantly since last year and the 3.5 speed has not been tested since Pieter's ultraprune. The speaker also notes that libcoin has a similar feature to ultraprune, which is done directly in the sqlite database backend. They suggest running a head-to-head test to compare the timings, but assume that the results would be similar due to Bitcoin's increased optimization since the first implementation of libcoin. It is suggested that ultraprune made a significant difference in Bitcoin's performance, but it is unlikely that this claim still holds true.</summary>
