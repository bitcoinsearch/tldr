    <summary>A new Tor.framework has been released for Cocoa developers, which is similar to BitcoinKit. This framework is aimed at making it easier for developers to link with a Tor library directly, avoiding the need to configure an external process. The release was announced by Wendell, and comes after discussions on IRC about the benefits of having a Tor library. Developers can find the Tor.framework on Github.</summary>
