    <summary>In an email correspondence from July 23, 2013, Andy Parkins suggested the addition of a URL for tracing the providence of any transaction without maintaining the entire blockchain. This URL would be "GET /rest/block-with-tx/TX-HASH". The construction of this transaction-hash-to-block database is not difficult for full clients to supply and already being done anyway. However, SPV clients can benefit from this feature without having to maintain the entire chain. Pieter, in response to Andy's suggestion, clarified that there is no such index being maintained by default, and enabling "-txindex" since version 0.8 is necessary to get it. If enabled, it can be exposed.</summary>
