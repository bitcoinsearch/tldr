    <title>Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop client on bitcoin.org</title>

    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list revolved around hosting MultiBit downloads. Currently, the multibit.org server can deliver around 90,000 copies of MultiBit per day due to its maximum bandwidth capacity of 1 TB. However, hosting the downloads on SourceForge could provide virtually unlimited capacity but comes with the downside of a horrible user interface and blocked countries. Additionally, using SourceForge exposes the software to a potentially hackable mirror network. Despite not being bandwidth constrained on their own servers, Jeff Garzik suggests moving the downloads to a site where bandwidth is not a concern. The email also includes a promotional message for AppDynamics, a tool for application monitoring.</summary>
