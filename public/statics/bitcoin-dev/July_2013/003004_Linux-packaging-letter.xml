    <summary>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Zooko, they discuss the issue of packaging in the software industry. Hearn suggests that the quality of non-expert packaging is often inconsistent, leading to wasted time and broken software. He goes so far as to say that his former project adopted a policy of automatically closing bug reports from people using distributor packages due to the number of subtle bugs introduced. Zooko agrees with Hearn's sentiments, stating that upstreams should be more willing to listen to packagers who may know what they're talking about. The two briefly discuss alternative ways to approach the issue of packaging.</summary>
