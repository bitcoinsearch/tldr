    <summary>In an email exchange about Bitcoin's limits, Johnathan Corgan endorses Cloudflare for reducing bandwidth bills and providing application monitoring with end-to-end visibility. He explains that the GNU Radio Project has cut their bandwidth bill by 50% since switching to Cloudflare's free service tier. The initial message suggests that despite potential limitations, it would be a good problem to have if they had to dramatically increase the download size and Bitcoin usage by 10x to hit the limit. The email thread ends with a link to AppDynamics for those interested in diagnosing root cause issues with their applications.</summary>
