    <summary>The article is about a Linux packaging letter, but it raises questions about how applicable the information is to non-Linux packaging systems like pkgsrc, FreeBSD ports, OpenBSD ports, etc. The author also asks if the repeatable build infrastructure is portable and works with other operating systems and CPU types. The requirement for precise library dependencies is seen as awkward, but synchronous updates of multiple packages are difficult. It's considered a bug that the package will build on BE systems and then fail tests. Finally, the author suggests that willingness to make accommodations for packaging issues in the master sources is necessary if people are asked not to patch.</summary>
