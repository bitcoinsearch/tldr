    <summary>Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) are hardware components that provide permanent storage in the form of NVRAM. They are designed to be as cheap as possible and have been standard with nearly all computers, except for Macs, for a long time. The cost of TPMs is only a few dollars at most, which is why they are slow. Some motherboards come with a TPM module header, but they do not come installed. The modules themselves may cost around $50-$100 and come with API docs. The goal of using TPM NVRAM is to avoid wearing down the hard drive and extend its useful life. However, because the TPM has a limited number of write cycles, it poses a problem if someone wants to delete data securely. Using TPM NVRAM solves this issue, albeit at a high usability cost. If the TPM storage has a limited number of write cycles, it may seem unreliable. Therefore, reliable and "really gone" data can be achieved on platters or SSDs provided the disk is encrypted. TPMs are an essential component of computer security and are widely used across different systems. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an independent security chip that becomes more useful when integrated with features on the motherboard, BIOS, CPU, northbridge, and IOMMU. When combined, these components create a full-blown TCG-compliant TC environment that can be used for many things.Although there was speculation that TPM could be useful for digital rights management (DRM), this feature was never implemented, and cryptography is to DRM as TC is to DRM. The FUD surrounding TPM was unwarranted and undermined its usefulness as a cryptographic security tool. AMD has TPM, although it is unclear which models support it. Version control is standard for application code but not databases; however, steps can be taken to put SQL databases under version control.The thread in question was accidentally posted on the announce list instead of the development list, and the poster wondered why it was open access. The topic under discussion was TPM functionality and why it received so much negative attention in the past, with some attributing this to the fact that it was pushed by a software/hardware monopoly for purposes of DRM and locking down systems. However, the published specifications and technologies were never intended for such uses, and there has never been a TC/TPM mode that would have generally locked systems down or been useful for DRM. Locking a system down for tampering or DRM does not require flexible open specifications with multiple competing implementations, but rather an approach like the Xbox 360's.</summary>
