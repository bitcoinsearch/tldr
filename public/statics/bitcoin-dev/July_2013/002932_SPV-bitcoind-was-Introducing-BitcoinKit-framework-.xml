    <summary>The BitcoinKit developer has encountered some problems with libcoin and expressed a desire to have a closer look at it. However, the issues faced so far are that it uses QT which is required for compilation and steps to create an xcodeproject from cmake failed. Furthermore, attempts to compile it using QT libs and cmake from the terminal also failed on bitcoind.cpp. The assumption is that it uses llvm to compile the templates that bitcoind is using which is not compatible. Therefore, BitcoinKit is a separate dynamic library compiled with gcc or llvm pretending to be gcc. Finally, the sources used by Michael seem to be outdated for Mac OS X.</summary>
