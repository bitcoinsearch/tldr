    <summary>In this context, Pieter Wuille and Luke-Jr discuss the potential risk of merge-mining on the security of the blockchain. They note that invalid blocks are rejected by validating clients, but if an attacker has hash power for the parent chain, they can mine invalid blocks for the merge-mined chain at no cost. This poses a risk to the security of the chain, especially when considering privacy concerns such as those related to zerocoin. Wuille expresses concern about the possibility of the chain being strangled at birth due to merge-mining, which makes attacking it costless for the attacker. He also notes that the basic assumption underlying mining security is that it is more profitable to collaborate with mining a chain than to attack it, but in the case of merged mining, this assumption may not be valid.</summary>
