    <summary>A group of individuals have written an open letter to the Linux packaging community, urging them not to patch or modify the upstream sources of Bitcoin. The letter outlines that Bitcoin is different from other programs and should be treated as such. They have requested others to sign the document if they agree with its contents. The trigger for this action was the discovery that Debian bitcoind's had been split out of the consensus in April due to unknown reasons, potentially related to a patch utilizing system leveldb. A link to the letter can be found in the provided Google Docs URL.</summary>
