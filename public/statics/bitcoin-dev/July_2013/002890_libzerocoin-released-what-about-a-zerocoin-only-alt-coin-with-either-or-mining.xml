    <summary>The conversation is regarding the concept of merge mining and its cost. The writer believes that merge mining is not mining a coin for free, rather the total reward should tend to equalize the mining costs. However, the value comes from demand, not costs, so if people demand it more, the price will rise regardless of how it's mined. On the other hand, the cryptocurrencies are neutral to the cost of mining, or perhaps benefit from it being as cheap as possible. Invalid blocks are rejected by validating clients in all circumstances, which means miners cannot mine them maliciously or through negligence. If another miner accepts transactions, there is no issue even if some miners reject them.</summary>
