    <summary>The discussion is centered around the concept of bi-directional sacrifice and pegging zerocoins to bitcoins. The need for a bitcoin peg on the creation cost of zerocoins is highlighted as it provides stability to a new alt-coin. Merge mining is not preferred as it dilutes the available compute for a given coin. Sacrificing bitcoins as a way to mine zerocoins without having the bitcoin network validate zerocoin is suggested. Bi-directional sacrifice is more complicated and requires coin validation requirements. The price equality depends on the extra functionality or value from the characteristics of the other coin. Removing taint may mean that zerocoins should be worth more. A suggestion is made to use p2p transfer for trading.</summary>
