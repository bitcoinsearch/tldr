    <summary>In this email conversation from 2013, Wendell expresses his willingness to write specifications and supervise/audit/advise for a few hours a week regarding a potential project. Peter Todd responds by saying he has more good ideas than he has time to implement but is considering it. He mentions that he accepted funds from John Dillon to implement replace-by-fee, but the scope of the project turned out to be bigger than originally thought. Todd suggests reviewing his git commit track record before offering anything.</summary>
