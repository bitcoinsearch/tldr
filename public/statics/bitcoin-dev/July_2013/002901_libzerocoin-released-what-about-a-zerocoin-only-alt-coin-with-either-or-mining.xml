    <summary>In this email exchange, Luke-Jr suggests the creation of a Zerocoin with no-reward/PoSacrifice merged mining as well as (rewarded) Prime POW. Peter Todd questions the credibility of Luke-Jr's ideas due to his past involvement in 51% attacks on alt-coins. Luke-Jr denies any accusations and calls out Peter Todd's comment as slanderous. The email ends with Peter Todd retracting his original statement.</summary>
