    <summary>In an email thread discussing BitCoin development, Rob Meijer writes that he has completed the first draft of his slides and speaker notes for his upcoming talk on "Defeating Trojans" at OHM2013. One of the main examples he uses in this talk is BitCoin to emphasize the need for programs like BitCoin to have their own private storage apart from $HOME. He requests help reviewing his slides to make sure he doesn't misrepresent BitCoin. The email thread also includes an advertisement for AppDynamics, an application monitoring tool.</summary>
