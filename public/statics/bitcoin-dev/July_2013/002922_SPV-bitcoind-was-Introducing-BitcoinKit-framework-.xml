    <summary>In an email conversation dated July 17, 2013, Peter Todd proposed the idea of a desktop client that would download blocks as they are created, gradually building up a more complete UTXO set over time. This would allow the node to start with the same security level and usefulness as a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) node, but with better security and privacy. The node would also contribute to the network by relaying blocks and transactions, and could store a subset of the chain history for other nodes to bootstrap from. In the future, miners could commit a hash of the UTXO set for even more options to relay transactions safely. The idea was deemed a good one by Wendell of grabhive.com and Twitter, provided that available disk space was taken into consideration and only a fraction of it was used.</summary>
