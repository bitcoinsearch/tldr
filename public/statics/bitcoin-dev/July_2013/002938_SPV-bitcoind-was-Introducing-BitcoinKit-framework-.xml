    <summary>The behavior of SPV clients is considered abusive since they utilize maximum node resources with minimum cost. This, however, is not entirely true as compromised web servers are also a common occurrence and the asymmetry in node resources is biased against devices such as phones and tablets that have limited memory bandwidth. A good anti-DoS strategy should prioritize existing users over new users and old coins over new coins. In case Bitcoin suddenly becomes too popular, there must be enough nodes to support all users and some rules can be followed, such as disconnecting recent connections to long-lived connections to avoid running out of TCP sockets and preferring processing new blocks to serving old parts of the chain when disk seeks run out. It is suggested that instead of talking about DoS, we should discuss what happens if Bitcoin suddenly gets too popular and how to handle it.</summary>
