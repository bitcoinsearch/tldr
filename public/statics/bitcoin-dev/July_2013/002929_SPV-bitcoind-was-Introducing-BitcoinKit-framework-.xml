    <summary>In an email conversation from 2013, Michael Gronager discussed the benefits of having a merkle tree hash of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in the Bitcoin network. He noted that this would allow for easy and trusted downloading of UTXOs from any client, enabling a quick bootstrap process. However, he also acknowledged that this approach would reduce node security to Simple Payment Verification (SPV) of past history. For wallet clients who are willing to accept SPV security, this could be a viable option, but it's important not to over-hype the benefits of committed UTXO trees.</summary>
