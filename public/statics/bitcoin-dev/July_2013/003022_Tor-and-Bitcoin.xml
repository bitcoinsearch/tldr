    <summary>Hive had plans to make their wallet proxy through Tor by default, however, this was not possible due to bitcoinj lacking SOCKS support. This raised a discussion on whether it is advisable practice for SPV wallets to use Tor in the first place. Mike Hearn suggested being careful with Tor and Bitcoin as connecting outbound from Tor could mean traffic is being logged and MITMd by exit nodes. This could lead to being transparently connected to a sybil network. While this scenario seems unlikely, it is best to be prepared. To support Tor well in bitcoinj, hidden peers would need to be added along with an anti-sybil heuristic. In regions where Bitcoin is illegal, packet filtering may not be far off, making it necessary to be proactive and prepared. Gregory Maxwell's comments on hidden service support for bitcoind were suggested as being interesting to get.</summary>
