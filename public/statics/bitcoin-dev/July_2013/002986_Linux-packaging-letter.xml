    <summary>In July 2013, Mike Hearn reported that Debian's bitcoind had split out of consensus sometime in April. The reason for this remains unknown, but it is believed to be related to a patch that uses system-level database (leveldb). There have been reports of an indeterministic and avoidable database corruption, but there is no evidence that it is a fork or Debian's fault. Pieter urged caution in blaming people before understanding the issue and suggested educating packagers about the risks.</summary>
