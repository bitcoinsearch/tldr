    <summary>In a 2013 discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gavin Andresen expressed his belief that PaymentRequest-only bitcoin URIs would be important in the future. He argued that certain types of payments, such as exotic transactions, may not make sense to have a single fallback address. Additionally, a page with a bitcoin URI link may rely on a separate service provider to assemble the transaction. Responding to Roy Badami's question about whether it is possible or sensible to have a URI that is only a payment request, Andresen noted that a bitcoin address would likely still be necessary for backwards compatibility. However, he suggested that if web browser support for arbitrary MIME types was strong enough, a payment request could be initiated with just an anchor tag, which would save a http round-trip. Overall, Andresen's comments suggest a forward-thinking approach to the development of bitcoin technology and a consideration of potential use cases beyond traditional transactions.</summary>
