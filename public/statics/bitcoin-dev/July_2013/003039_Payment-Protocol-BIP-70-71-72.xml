    <summary>On July 31, 2013, Gavin Andresen responded to Roy Badami's question about whether it would be sensible to have a URI that is only a payment request. Andresen suggested including a bitcoin address in the URI for backwards compatibility. He also mentioned that if web browser support for arbitrary MIME types is strong enough, then a payment request can be initiated with just an anchor tag, which would save a http round-trip.</summary>
