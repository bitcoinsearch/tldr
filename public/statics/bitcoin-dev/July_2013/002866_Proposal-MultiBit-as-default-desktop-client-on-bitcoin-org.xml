    <title>Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop client on bitcoin.org</title>

    <summary>In a discussion held on September 7, 2013, Jim pointed out that the MultiBit download size would increase from approximately 11MB to 30-40MB. As a result, the maximum number of copies that the multibit.org server can deliver per day would decrease from around 90,000 to 30,000ish. It was also noted that the multibit.org server's bandwidth limit was capped at 1 TB per day. To overcome this limitation, it was recommended that downloads be hosted on SourceForge instead, which would provide virtually unlimited capacity.</summary>
