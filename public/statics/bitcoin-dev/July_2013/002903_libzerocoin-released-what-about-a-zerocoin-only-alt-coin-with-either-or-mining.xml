    <summary>In an email sent on July 13, 2013, Peter Vessenes explains that market liquidity is a significant issue for alternative currencies that do not peg to Bitcoin. The global liquidity of Bitcoin was already very low at the time, making it too low for many transactions. One solution to this problem is to have automated BitcoinZerocoin P2P trading without the need for an exchange. This would also be more desirable from a privacy standpoint, reducing the risks associated with exchanging Zerocoins.</summary>
