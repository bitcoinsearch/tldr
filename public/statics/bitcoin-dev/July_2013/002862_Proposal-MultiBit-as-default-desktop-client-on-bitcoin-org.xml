    <title>Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop client on bitcoin.org</title>

    <summary>The email is a message sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list. It includes an advertisement for AppDynamics, which offers application monitoring services that can help isolate bottlenecks and diagnose root causes of issues in seconds. The email provides a link to start a free trial of AppDynamics Pro. The sender's signature promotes Multibit, a platform for managing bitcoins. The email concludes with another promotion for AppDynamics, encouraging readers to get end-to-end visibility with their application monitoring services.Regarding MultiBit, the idea of bundling a JVM with it has been suggested to simplify the user experience. However, this would require redoing and retesting all the build packaging and increase the maximum copies of MultiBit downloaded. Additionally, there is currently no provision for automatic updates, and Bitcoin signed files need to be in place before bundling a JVM so that users don’t have to keep redownloading it. The multibit.org server maxes out at 1 TB of bandwidth per day, and one possible solution is to invest in a copy of JET, which does native compilation down to self-contained Windows binaries. However, as a proprietary tool, its outputs may not be reproducible. Another option is to use an existing auto-update framework to support threshold signed updates, which would download in the background and then ask the user to restart once the update is available locally. Although modern Java versions allow for bundling the app with a stripped-down JVM, Java's security problems have made it an instant uninstall item on Windows PCs for about a year now. Therefore, it’s been recommended to have an SPV client as a first wallet and recommending users to install Java without properly disabling the browser plugin is not feasible until Multibit is provided as a compiled binary without a Java dependency. To provide support for common issues, a dedicated Support page has been added to the website with fixes and support notes, and the in-app help includes a 'Support' section with "Troubleshooting' and the most common gotchas. Users are directed first to bitcoin.stackexchange.com, then to Github issues to search for existing or raise a new issue. Finally, there has been consensus to have MultiBit replace Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app.</summary>
