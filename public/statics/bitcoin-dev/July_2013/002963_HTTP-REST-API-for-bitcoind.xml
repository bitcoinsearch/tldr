    <summary>The Bitcoin REST API is designed to access unauthenticated, public blockchain information and will not add wallet interfacing or manipulation capabilities. However, a proposed GET request that allows SPV clients to trace the providence of any transaction without maintaining the entire chain has been discussed. The query would not increase resource usage by SPV clients on full nodes, which is undesirable due to potential DoS attacks. UTXO data currently requires full trust in whomever provides it, until UTXO commitments are implemented. John Dillon's comments on using micro-transactions to compensate full-nodes for maintaining expensive blockchain indexes are also worth reading.</summary>
