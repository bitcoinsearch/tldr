    <summary>During a discussion between Mike Hearn and Daniel F in July 2013, Hearn expressed his concern about the poor user interface and blocked access in some countries of SourceForge. In response, Daniel suggested that free capacity was available through services like Cloudflare, which could help with their bandwidth issues. Hearn agreed, suggesting they could serve new users off their own servers and use auto-updates from SF.net mirrors. However, he also pointed out that using SourceForge exposed them to a potentially hackable mirror network. Daniel argued that hackability and UI should be irrelevant for the auto-update process, which he believed would create very lumpy download demand. The conversation ended with a link to AppDynamics offering end-to-end visibility with application monitoring.</summary>
