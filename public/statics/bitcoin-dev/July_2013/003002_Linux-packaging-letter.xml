    <summary>On July 24, 2013, Jeff Garzik responded to Mike Hearn's request for a more digestible alternative to a letter that had already been signed. He provided a link to his work-in-progress version on Github, which he estimated would be ready within the next 24 hours. Garzik mentioned his experience with Fedora packaging while at Red Hat and expressed interest in publishing his alternative on opensource.com.</summary>
