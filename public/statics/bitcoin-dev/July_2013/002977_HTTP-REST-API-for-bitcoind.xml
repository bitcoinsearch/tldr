    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Andy Parkins suggests that reducing the blockchain storage requirement for SPV clients would result in more nodes being able to participate in the network, hence reducing the load on full nodes. Peter Todd’s response to this suggestion was his proposal for “Partial UTXO” mode. Todd explains that miners could get away without keeping the entire chain provided they don't (often) try to mine transactions spending UTXO's that they haven't verified themselves. As the discussion continues, they talk about how UTXO data currently requires one to have full trust in whomever is providing it, and that situation will continue until UTXO commitments are implemented. They debate the difference between SPV and full security while noting that headers only blockchain is far easier to maintain. In conclusion, they discuss the potential benefits of fetching blocks by transactions and having simple nodes offer a contribution to the network rather than just being parasitical on the full nodes.</summary>
