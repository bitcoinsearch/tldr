    <summary>Bitcoinj, a Java-based implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, does not download all headers but only from the last checkpoint and discards the old ones. It differs considerably from Bitcoind and will likely continue to do so in the future. The team plans to store only relevant outputs in the wallet to save memory, as some users have wallets that don't fit in RAM. They aim to use simplified payment verification (SPV) mode, which is headers-first sync without the full block sync step, replacing it with bloom/birthday-based fetching of blocks interesting to associated wallets. In SPV, the mempool needs to be disabled and there will be other small changes. Pieter Wuille is currently working on headers-first sync, which he believes is generally very useful and fixes many edge-cases block synchronization that the blockchain currently experiences. This is also a first step towards SPV mode.</summary>
