    <summary>In a forum discussion, a user named JP suggested adding a 2-byte 'weeks since genesis' or 'months since genesis' feature that would work for SPV wallets. But Mike Hearn pointed out that it wouldn't be usable unless it had a birthday. Without a birthday, scanning the entire chain would be slow, and finding a fully indexed copy of the blockchain would be expensive and more centralized. Mike recommended adding a UNIX time as an extra 4 bytes or using a uint16 that represents "days since birth of this specification" to save a few characters.</summary>
