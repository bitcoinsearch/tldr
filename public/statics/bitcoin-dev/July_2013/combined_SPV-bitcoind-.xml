    <summary>During an email discussion between Mike Hearn and Andreas Schildbach, the topic of average connection time for the Bitcoin app was brought up. Andreas explained that the current programming allows for connections to stay open for at least two more minutes after receiving a block, and at least eight more minutes after sending or receiving a transaction. This is to allow the chain to catch up while preventing excessive battery drain. Additionally, connections stay open as long as the screen is on and the app is in the foreground.Mike suggested gathering telemetry from the Android wallet to determine how long SPV wallets typically remain open, and Andreas agreed to look into allowing users to opt-in to usage statistics. Mike also proposed the idea of partial UTXO sets but had concerns about how many SPV wallets remain open. He believes most users only keep their wallets open to check if they have received or sent money.Android apps are programmed to become active upon installation and inactive when uninstalled. However, when receiving a block, they stay connected for at least two more minutes to allow the chain to catch up while avoiding battery drain. Upon sending or receiving a transaction, they stay connected for at least eight more minutes as it is likely that the wallet will see more activity. Moreover, on the send and request coins screens and the network monitor, the app stays connected for as long as the screen is on and the app is in the foreground (i.e., resumed state). Andreas agreed to look into allowing users to opt-in to usage statistics to gather telemetry from the Android wallet to determine how long SPV wallets typically remain open.</summary>
