    <summary>The increasing reliance of many websites on Cloudflare for SSL private keys is a cause for concern, particularly because they are located in a country with surveillance laws like the United States. This has led to concerns that Cloudflare is becoming a single point of failure (SPOF) for the Bitcoin community. With more and more websites using Cloudflare, this could potentially make the entire Bitcoin ecosystem vulnerable to attacks or surveillance. It is important for website owners to consider alternative options for SSL protection in order to reduce their dependence on Cloudflare and mitigate these risks.</summary>
