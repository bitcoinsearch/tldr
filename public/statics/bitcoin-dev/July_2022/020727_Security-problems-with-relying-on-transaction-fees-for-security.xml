    <summary>In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd expressed concern over designing protocols based on the expectation that prices will continue to rise indefinitely. He argued that this is a bad idea and that Bitcoin should not be treated as a speculative asset. However, some members of the community believe that designing protocols with the assumption that prices will continue to rise is a good idea as it aligns with the belief that Bitcoin will grow in utility compared to fiat currencies. They argue that if Bitcoin fails to do so, then there would be no point in using it anyway. This debate highlights the different perspectives within the Bitcoin community regarding the purpose and potential of the cryptocurrency. It also underscores the importance of careful protocol design to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the network.</summary>
