    <summary>The Bitcoin development community has been discussing the concept of half-aggregation in various contexts. A concrete specification of the scheme and a place for collecting supplemental information have been proposed by Jonas Nick in a BIP draft. The scheme specifies only the cryptographic scheme and does not prescribe specific applications. However, "incremental aggregation" is allowed, which allows additional BIP-340 signatures to be aggregated into an existing half-aggregate signature. This could pave the way for computer-aided formal proofs as the formal specification provides a mathematically precise description of the scheme. A blog post provides a broader context on half-aggregation of BIP-340 signatures.Michael Folkson discusses the potential role of a half-aggregation BIP draft and the challenges of implementing CISA/CISHA as a consensus change. While there are use cases for this half-aggregation BIP, such as Lightning gossip, there would need to be two tiers of verification if CISA/CISHA was attempted in the long term. It may even be necessary to define a new output type specifically for the CISA/CISHA use case where there is no access to a script path at all. Despite these long-term considerations, Folkson suggests focusing on the use cases for the half-aggregation BIP that can be worked on today.In a recent tweet, Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille shared a draft BIP for half-aggregated signatures in Taproot. The draft BIP does not specify whether "half aggregation needs a new output type or not" as it is out of scope. However, half-aggregation has multiple possible applications. Wuille also provides links to the CISA repo, which describes some of the challenges of implementing CISA/CISHA as a consensus change, and a Sigagg case study on LN channel announcements.According to a StackExchange post linked by Wuille, CISA requires a new output type. This argument also applies to half-aggregating signatures across transaction inputs, known as CISHA. The only difference between half and full aggregation is that the transaction signature is a single half-aggregate signature instead of a 64-byte signature. Additionally, batch verification of Taproot output key spends and script spends can be done using Schnorr signatures and key tweaks. Overall, Wuille's draft BIP proposes the use of half-aggregated signatures in Taproot, which could have multiple applications. However, the decision on whether a new output type is needed for half-aggregation remains out of scope. The CISA repo and Sigagg case study provide further information on the challenges of implementing CISA/CISHA as a consensus change.</summary>
