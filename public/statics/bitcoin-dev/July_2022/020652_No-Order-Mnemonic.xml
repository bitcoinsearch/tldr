    <summary>Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, challenged developers to crack his password that is secured with a 12-word seed phrase from BIP39. He stated that without performance requirements, one can store the words in any order, making brute force recovery possible. Pavol Rusnak suggested encoding the index of permutation used to scramble the otherwise sorted list. However, repetitions make this more difficult. Anton Shevchenko shared his Python implementation for a different mnemonic encoding that requires users to remember words but not their order. Bram was interested in whether it is possible to create an encoding using BIP-39 words as part of error correction if the order is lost or confused.</summary>
