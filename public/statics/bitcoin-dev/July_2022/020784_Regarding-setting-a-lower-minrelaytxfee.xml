    <summary>The writer is asking for input from Bitcoin enthusiasts on the topic of whether or not a dust protection measure should be lowered slightly. The current satoshi per virtual byte (sat/vB) rate is perceived as too high for a dust protection measure, and should be lowered to half when prices go double than today and keeps oscillating at that point. Although it is not a consensus rule, the writer believes it can be done easily with support from full node operators. While the writer supports LN, they believe transaction affordability should remain constant in the future, allowing those who are willing to wait in a queue the option for the same affordability for minimum fees in the future as it is today.</summary>
