    <summary>A member of the bitcoin-dev community recently suggested removing the fixed dust limit and relying solely on the mempool size limit to determine what is considered dust. Another member responded by suggesting that individual nodes adjust their settings, but this would not be effective without a network-wide change. The current settings may be useful in certain situations, such as miners trying to push transactions to their own mempools, but for the majority of users, changing the defaults would achieve nothing.</summary>
