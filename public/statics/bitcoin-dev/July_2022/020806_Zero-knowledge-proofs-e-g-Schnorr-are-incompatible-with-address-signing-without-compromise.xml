    <summary>In a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) discussion, it was pointed out that in BIP340, the intentional design choice is either batch verifiability or public key recovery. It was also discussed how to recover a public key from a single-key signature. The user had planned to concatenate the public key after the signature and not append it after the Taproot address since it was unruly. The discussion suggested working on BIP322, which is compatible with every script type, not restricted to single-key policies, and trivially extensible to future schemes. In addition, Pieter Wuille mentioned that every Taproot compatible wallet has a BIP340 implementation.</summary>
