    <summary>According to recent reports, there are two coins that have an expected (soft) emission time larger than Bitcoin's. The first coin has an order of magnitude larger anticipated time frame at 50 years. However, it appears that Dogecoin (DOGE) has joined the ranks with an expected emission time of 33 years. This means that both Bitcoin and DOGE will have a limited supply of coins in circulation, which is often seen as a positive attribute for investors. This news may attract more attention to DOGE as it continues to gain popularity among investors and social media users. It remains to be seen how this development will affect the overall cryptocurrency market, but it is clear that these coins are continuing to evolve and adapt over time.</summary>
