    <title>Adding SIGHASH to TXID</title>

    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal to control transaction flow through different SIGHASH flags is being discussed. The proposal suggests introducing new SIGHASH_PREVOUT_XYZ flags for all existing sighashes and using them to apply sighashes to the previous transaction, forming a new txid that remains stable even if new inputs and outputs are added. The main use case of this proposal is to control transaction flow when using other sighashes like SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. By default, the Core client signs everything with SIGHASH_ALL, but the proposal suggests changing this behavior and proposing different sighashes based on the created transaction. The proposal also suggests displaying the transaction in a way visible in block explorers, highlighting or graying out inputs and outputs based on the selected sighashes to make it easier for users to control them.</summary>
