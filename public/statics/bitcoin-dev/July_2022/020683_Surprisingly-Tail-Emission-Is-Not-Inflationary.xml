    <summary>In an email exchange between thenoblebot and Peter Todd, the former raises a question regarding the dilution of other holders' coins, which can occur if one miscalculates lost coins. The question remains as to how one can definitively know that coins are lost, or if they have simply not been accessed for a certain amount of time. In response, Todd directs thenoblebot to re-read his article, which discusses tail emission and its lack of inflationary effects. It is important to note that Todd's proposal does not involve re-assigning ownership of coins, and therefore, it does not take away anyone's ability to access their coins.</summary>
