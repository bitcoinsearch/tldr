    <summary>The email conversation between Alice and Peter Todd discusses whether lowering the minrelaytxfee for Bitcoin transactions would reduce profits for miners. Peter presents a complex argument about block publication incentives for miners and states that, to a first approximation, failing to mine a known transaction at any fee above zero is leaving money on the table. In an analogy, Alice asks if reducing ticket prices would increase revenue for airlines, and Peter explains that this would depend on factors such as demand and capacity. The email is sent using Proton Mail secure email, with the original message included at the end.</summary>
