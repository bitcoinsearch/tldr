    <summary>Antoine Riard discussed the range of use cases for covenants proposals in a bitcoin-dev email. He mentioned that the range has grown significantly and listed various use cases such as multi-party stateful contracts, congestion trees, payment pools, eltoo layered commitments, programmable vaults, multi-events contracts, blockchain-as-oracle bets, spacechains, and trustless collateral lending. However, there is a big question whether capabilities are in scope for a covenant proposal. Specifically, vaults work better when payments to them are immediately locked up in the vault rather than having to accept them first.</summary>
