    <summary>Anton Shevchenko announced that he has created a python implementation for a different mnemonic encoding that requires users to remember words but not the order of those words. The code is open-source under the MIT license and can be found on GitHub. An interesting mathematical question was raised about whether it is possible to create a code that always uses BIP-39 words for the same key as part of its encoding, with added error correction words in case the order is lost or confused. If BIP-39 contains a duplicate, an extra word can be added.</summary>
