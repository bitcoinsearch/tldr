    <summary>The draft BIP does not specify whether "half aggregation needs a new output type or not" as it is out of scope. However, half-aggregation has multiple possible applications. The StackExchange post linked to in the context argues that CISA requires a new output type. This argument also applies to half aggregating signatures across transaction inputs, known as CISHA. The only difference between half and full aggregation is that the transaction signature is a single half-aggregate signature instead of a 64-byte signature. Furthermore, batch verification of Taproot output key spends and script spends can be done using Schnorr signatures and key tweaks.</summary>
