    <summary>Bitcoin's emission curve lasts over 100 years, but only emits a small amount of all bitcoin during the last 100 years from 2040-2140. The shape of the emission curve is what matters for proper distribution, and emitting 99% in the first year and 1% in the next 100 years is a terrible form of distribution. Quantifying the expected time of emission, Bitcoin's equals 6 years. Monero appears better due to its tail emission yielding an infinite expected time of emission, but looking at just the soft total emission, it is worse than Bitcoin. Ethereum is even worse with its huge premine, and PoS coins like Algorand have an expected emission time of 0. There is only one coin whose expected (soft) emission time is larger than Bitcoin's, and it is about an order of magnitude larger, at 50 years. The article also highlights the importance of using soft total supply when comparing different cryptocurrencies' emission curves.</summary>
