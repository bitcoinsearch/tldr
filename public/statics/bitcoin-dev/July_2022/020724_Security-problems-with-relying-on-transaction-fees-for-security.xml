    <summary>In the future, mining could become a public service rather than a for-profit business model. Game theory suggests that large holders will be the major players in mining. If someone holds a hundred Bitcoin, they could sell one to purchase mining equipment and ensure stability of the rest. Interested parties would continue to secure the chain through game theoretic methods, and Bitcoin doesn't require a security budget. Existing holders have the means, ability, and incentive to secure their funds, and it's important to advertise this instead of keeping it a secret.</summary>
