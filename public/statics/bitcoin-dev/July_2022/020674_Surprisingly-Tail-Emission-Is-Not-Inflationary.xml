    <summary>In an email exchange, naman naman raised the concern that if someone hasn't had access to their coins for a long time and they wish to access/move them after such a time, the proposed approach of tail emission may take away their ability to do so. He also questioned how one could prove conclusively that "lost" coins are "lost forever". In response, Peter Todd clarified that his article on tail emission has nothing to do with re-assigning ownership of coins. The article discusses how tail emission can be used to maintain the security of a blockchain without causing inflation. Todd's article can be found at https://petertodd.org/2022/surprisingly-tail-emission-is-not-inflationary.</summary>
