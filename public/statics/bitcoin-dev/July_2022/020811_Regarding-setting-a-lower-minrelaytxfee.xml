    <summary>In an email exchange on July 28, 2022, David A. Harding pointed out a potential conflation of two Bitcoin policies in the phrasing by Aaradhya Chauhan and Peter Todd. Specifically, he noted that they may be conflating the "dust limit" policy (which sets a minimum output amount) with the "min tx relay fee" policy (which sets a minimum transaction relay feerate). Todd acknowledged the correction and thanked Harding for pointing it out. The email was part of a larger conversation thread and included a non-text attachment containing Todd's signature.</summary>
