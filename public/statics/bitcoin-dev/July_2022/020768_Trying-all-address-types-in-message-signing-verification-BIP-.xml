    <summary>In a recent email, Peter from Coinkite Inc mentioned that the BIP-322 proposals did not gain wide acceptance in the past. However, there is renewed interest in using BIP322 to validate signatures related to upgrading the Bitcoin-native Decentralized Identifier Method (did:btcr) beyond its current specification, to version 2.0. This has been discussed in detail in the advance-readings of the RWOT11 conference in The Hague and in the DID Core specification document by W3C. The proposed use of BIP322 would allow for improved security and privacy in the handling of decentralized identifiers on the Bitcoin blockchain.</summary>
