    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named alicexbt asked about the possibility of reducing the minimum relay transaction fee for Bitcoin transactions. Another user commented that while this is not a consensus rule and could be done with support from full node operators, some miners may be hesitant to lower profits by using a lower minrelaytxfee. However, failing to mine a transaction with a fee above zero is seen as leaving money on the table according to an article by Peter Todd. Additionally, by allowing near-zero transactions into a miner's mempool through the Child-Pays-For-Parent mechanism, they potentially have the ability to mine more fees.</summary>
