    <summary>Based on the statement "I'm pretty sure we will have a textbook case of Prisoner's Dilemma here" and the response "no, there is no large payoff for betrayal," it seems that there is a situation where two individuals must decide whether to cooperate or betray each other. The concept of Prisoner's Dilemma is a scenario in game theory where the best option for both players would be to cooperate, but due to mistrust and self-interest, they end up both choosing to betray each other, resulting in a suboptimal outcome for both parties involved.In this particular scenario, it appears that one individual believes that there will be a classic example of the Prisoner's Dilemma playing out. However, the response suggests that there may not be a large enough benefit for either party to choose betrayal over cooperation. Without further context, it is unclear what decision the individuals will ultimately make.</summary>
