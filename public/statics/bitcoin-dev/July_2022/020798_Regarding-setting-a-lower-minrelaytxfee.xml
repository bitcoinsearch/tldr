    <summary>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, suggested removing the fixed dust limit and relying solely on the mempool size limit to determine what is or is not dust. He proposed that nodes could change their limits without requesting permission or making changes in the source code. In addition, he stated that if some node was a miner, then it could be enforced, but free transactions were still useful for communication. However, if more of them were accepted, negative fee transactions with proper sighashes could be used instead, which would make it unlikely that miners would voluntarily add coins. Furthermore, Peter Todd argued that lowering the dust limit now would prepare the entire ecosystem for dealing with conditions where fee revenue would be significant in the future. He asserted that we were approaching full blocks, so the dust limit was not providing value by reducing block usage. Instead, it was artificially lowering mempool usage and putting the Bitcoin system in a no-backlog state. Therefore, he recommended removing the fixed dust limit entirely.</summary>
