    <summary>There is a debate regarding the subsidy to directly tie miner revenue to the total value of Bitcoin. Some argue that this approach may not incentivize the service that keeps Bitcoin secure for large transactions in the way they want. They believe that if the fees are not sufficient for this purpose, then large holders would be incentivized to mine. However, others find this argument meaningless and straightforward. They assert that it's not complicated and that large holders are already incentivized to mine if they feel that the fees are not enough to ensure security for their transactions.</summary>
