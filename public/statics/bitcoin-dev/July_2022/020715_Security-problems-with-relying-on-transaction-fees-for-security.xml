    <summary>In a recent message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bram Cohen raised concerns about the established day/night cycle with fees going to zero overnight and longer gaps on weekends and holidays. He argues that if in the future Bitcoin is entirely dependent on fees for security, which is scheduled very strongly, and this pattern persists, it will become a serious problem. However, he acknowledges that this may only be true today when adoption is still low, but there is a good chance our grandchildren might never see an empty mempool if Bitcoin drives the world economy and is used 24/7 globally.</summary>
