    <summary>In an email conversation on July 25, 2022, Antoine Riard asked for the definition and examples of capabilities in the context of Bitcoin. The responses include payments sent to vaults that are only accepted by that vault and subject to its restrictions, which constitutes a capability for the vault. Additionally, oracles whose validity can be verified on the chain can serve as a capability, allowing transactions to depend on their output. Finally, colored coins with verifiable validity on the blockchain represent another example of a capability.</summary>
