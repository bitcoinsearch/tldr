    <summary>A discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has brought up the question of whether a perpetual block subsidy would be tied to the total value of Bitcoin. Peter Todd had previously argued that it would not be so, but another participant in the thread pointed out that such a subsidy would be tied to the total value of Bitcoin lost each year on average. This led to a question about whether this would be the ideal way to incentivize miners to keep Bitcoin secure, since it does not directly tie their revenue to the total value of Bitcoin. The debate continues.</summary>
