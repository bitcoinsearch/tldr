    <summary>Bitcoin's value as a store of value is primarily based on its finite supply. While this limits its use as a currency, the cultural aversion to monetary inflation and the negative economic consequences it causes are significant benefits. There have been discussions about decaying UTXO value to include holders in the distribution of Bitcoin blockchain security costs, but it's unlikely to be implemented due to potential centralization issues with pool operators colluding. In a healthy Bitcoin ecosystem, some pool operators would defect and mine transactions for market-based fees, eventually leading to an end to discriminatory premium fees.</summary>
