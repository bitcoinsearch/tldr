    <summary>In a recent email conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Russell O'Connor mentioned that due to the maturity rule, the output of the coinbase cannot be used as a bribe. This led to the discussion of using other coinbase outputs as inputs to bypass the maturity rule, but it was ultimately decided that the only option would be to leave transactions in the mempool as a bribe. However, this is not a reliable solution and can lead to smaller operations being unable to mine competitively. The conversation highlighted how mining being dependent on fee-income makes it complex and harder for small players. Additionally, there was a point made about centralization pressure which was well received.</summary>
