    <summary>The author of the email proposes online meetings on IRC as an alternative to in-person meetings, which may allow for more open discussion and better understanding of complex topics. They also suggest restarting the Scaling Bitcoin conferences twice a year to keep up with the rapidly evolving scaling landscape. The author notes that while higher-bandwidth communication channels like invite-only events may facilitate deeper discussion, they come at the cost of openness and context-archiving, which is important in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The email then shifts to a discussion about the difficulty of finding consensus on covenant designs and attracting experienced developers to invest time in building and maturing use-cases toolchains demonstrating the worthiness of such consensus change. The author suggests starting with a state-of-Bitcoin-art version of the protocol, deploying it, and then proposing protocol improvements requiring consensus changes back to the community once there is economic traffic. Finally, the author advocates for advanced scripting technologists to reveal what parts of their work are currently science, engineering, and product-oriented with understandable delivery dates, so that there can be more room for incremental exploration of the space. They note that champions of different use-cases should give an honest account of knowns and unknowns of their use-cases to provide clarity for discussions.</summary>
