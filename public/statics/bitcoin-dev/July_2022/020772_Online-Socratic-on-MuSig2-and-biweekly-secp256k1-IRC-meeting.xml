    <summary>Michael Folkson has shared information regarding an online Socratic discussion on MuSig2 scheduled for Thursday, July 28th at 17:00 UTC. The discussion will feature Tim Ruffing, who has agreed to attend. There is a reading list provided that covers the work of Tim and other people who have implemented and researched MuSig2, with the hope that some of those people will attend the discussion as well. This discussion will be similar in format to the Sydney Socratic with Jesse Posner on FROST in March. For those who prefer IRC discussions over video discussions, there is also a biweekly secp256k1 IRC meeting that recently started on the Libera IRC channel #secp256k1. The next meeting is set for Monday, August 1st, 2022 at 15:00 UTC. It is not organized by Michael but he thought it might be of interest to a similar group of people. Michael can be contacted via email, Keybase, or PGP. Links to the online Socratic discussion, reading list, and the previous Sydney Socratic are provided in the context.</summary>
