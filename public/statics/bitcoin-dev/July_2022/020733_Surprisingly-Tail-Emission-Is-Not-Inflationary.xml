    <summary>The idea of modifying the 21M cap in Bitcoin is seen as a reckless one. The premise that people will keep losing coins indefinitely is unprovable, and it could incentivize the creation of better storage, custody, and inheritance solutions. Bitcoin's value proposition includes having a fixed supply cap with a predictable issuance curve, which promises not to be fiat and not do what central banks are doing. If the protocol is tinkered with, it could invite adversaries to subvert the protocol further.</summary>
