    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd argued that it would take catastrophic black swan events to cause significant inflation rate changes due to lost coins. The model used in the discussion suggests that if a certain percentage of coins are lost, the value of all outstanding coins will go up by that percentage. Similarly, if the rate of coin breakage increases, the value of all coins will go up by a factor of that increase. However, this is an idealized model and assumes steady state conditions. The discussion highlights the potential impact of lost coins on the overall value of Bitcoin.</summary>
