    <summary>The discussion is about the potential for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on Wasabi, a popular Bitcoin wallet. The participant, alicexbt, agrees that some DoS vectors are already mitigated, but argues that punishment in the case of failure to relay transactions will be difficult, as the transaction is broadcasted after signing and before coinjoin tx broadcast. However, inputs are already checked multiple times for double spend during coinjoin round. The main point of discussion is that the attacker with thousands of UTXOs can also DoS rounds by simply failing to complete the round. In fact, the double-spend DoS attack requires more resources, because for a double-spend to be successful, BTC has to be spent on fees. It's just a fact of life that a motivated attacker can DoS attack Wasabi by spending money. The design choice seems to be serving them well so far.</summary>
