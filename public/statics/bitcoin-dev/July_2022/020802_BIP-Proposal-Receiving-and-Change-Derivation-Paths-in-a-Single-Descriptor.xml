    <summary>A recent update has been made to the BIP text, allowing for the use of arbitrary length tuples. This change was suggested by Pavol Rusnak in response to a discussion on the generalization of tuple sizes. While Andrew Chow initially proposed that the limit should remain at one tuple per key expression, as long as the tuples are all the same length, Pavol argued that it would be beneficial to allow for any sized tuples. Although there are currently no specific use cases for this change, Pavol believes that future standards may require more sub-paths. Pavol is the co-founder of SatoshiLabs, a company focused on developing secure and user-friendly cryptocurrency products.</summary>
