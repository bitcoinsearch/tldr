    <summary>On July 11, 2022, Russell O'Connor sent a message to bitcoin-dev expressing his uncertainty about what would happen after miners create anyone-can-spend outputs to bribe other miners. In response, Peter Todd explained that smaller miners would need to pay larger bribes than larger miners, which would lead to mining centralization. Additionally, keeping capital around to pay bribes would be burdensome for smaller miners. This situation could cause a disaster for mining centralization. The email thread ended with Peter's signature and contact information.</summary>
