    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Antoine Riard proposed a covenant effort to advance the state of covenant and contracting knowledge, collect use-cases, share engineering learnings from the prototype, and explore the problem space. He referenced the high standard set by Taproot/Schnorr in terms of safety-first and careful Bitcoin engineering effort, but also noted that more time spent working out use-case prototypes and standard libraries could have prevented headaches around x-pubkeys. In response, Michael Folkson cautioned against claiming Taproot history as a standard methodology in bitcoin development and suggested examining more agile approaches instead of inventing a multi-decades-lifecycle based methodology.</summary>
