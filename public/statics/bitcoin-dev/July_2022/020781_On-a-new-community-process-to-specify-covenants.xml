    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Antoine Riard discussed the need for higher standards in Bitcoin development. He emphasized the importance of setting and enforcing engineering standards that evolve with the growth of technical complexity and increase in funds at stake. Riard believes that engineering standards should be treated as a living matter and updated through consensus-driven methods. Regarding multi-decade lifecycle based methodologies, Riard advocates for more documentation and communication towards the community. However, he acknowledges that any additional engineering process must be enforced by a limited set of FOSS contributors. Riard suggests advancing in an evolutionary and consensus-driven way to avoid regression. In response to a previous email, Aliashraf disagreed with Riard's claim that Taproot/Schnorr has set a high standard in Bitcoin engineering. He argued that Bitcoin development methodology is still an open problem given the contemporary escalation/emergence of challenges. Instead of inventing a multi-decades-lifecycle based methodology, Aliashraf suggests being open-minded in examining more agile approaches and their effects on discussions. Riard responded by expressing curiosity about concrete examples of good engineering practices that could be adopted in Bitcoin development, especially regarding consensus changes. He hopes to learn from such practices and work towards even higher standards.</summary>
