    <summary>On Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ruben Somsen proposed a new method to burn multiple amounts in a single OP_RETURN. He suggested using a merkle sum tree to achieve this goal. The tree would have two levels, with the top level representing the total amount burned and the bottom level representing the specific use cases for the funds. The proposal includes two examples, one where 30 of 100 is allocated to AB and 70 is allocated to CD, and another where 20 of 100 is allocated to A and 30 is allocated to B. However, the practicality of using this method is limited as it is only useful when burning significantly less than a transaction fee.</summary>
