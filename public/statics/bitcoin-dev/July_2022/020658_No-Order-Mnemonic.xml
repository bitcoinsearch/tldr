    <summary>It is impossible for the first word of a 12-word mnemonic to be the last word in the list alphabetically, as it would end up at the end of the mnemonic once rearranged. However, choosing 11 random words and then sorting them alphabetically before assigning a checksum would reduce entropy considerably. This would only leave around 10 trillion combinations to bruteforce, which could be exhausted within a couple of months with hardware that can do one million guesses per second.</summary>
