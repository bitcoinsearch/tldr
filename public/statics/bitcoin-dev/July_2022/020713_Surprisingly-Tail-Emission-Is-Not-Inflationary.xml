    <summary>On July 10th, 2022, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev forum regarding the effects of tail emission on full nodes. A user named vjudeu suggested that people who run full nodes have no choice but to accept Segwit and Taproot and would similarly have no choice if there were zero satoshis involved. They proposed that upgraded clients could support amount hiding or other features to show non-zero values. Another user named Larry Ruane disagreed, stating that this method worked for Segwit because it only involved signatures, not the effect of the transaction on the UTXO set. In contrast, consensus requires all nodes to always agree on the UTXO set.</summary>
