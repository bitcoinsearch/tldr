    <summary>In an email thread, Andrew Chow suggests that a particular method could be generalized to any sized tuples as long as they are all the same length and the limit is one tuple per key expression. Pavol Rusnak, co-founder of SatoshiLabs, agrees with this idea and believes it could be useful for future standards that may introduce more sub-paths. However, he notes that there are no existing use cases in mind since BIP-44, BIP-84, etc. are already fine with just using a comma.</summary>
