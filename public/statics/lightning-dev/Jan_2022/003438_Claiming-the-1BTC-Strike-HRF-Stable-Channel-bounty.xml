    <summary>Recently, two bitcoin companies Strike and HRF posted three bitcoin bounties for features they want to see implemented in bitcoin. The second bounty is for "Stable Channels" which requires pegging bitcoin to a fixed amount of USD value inside the lightning channel using Discreet Log Contracts. This concept is explained in detail in Suredbits' blog post. However, there are limitations to this approach as updating the channel state invalidates the DLC funding txid. Lightning Devs are encouraged to reach out to Chris if they have any question on the financial engineering/DLC side of things.</summary>
