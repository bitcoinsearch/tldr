    <summary>Will reached out to Christian regarding the use of RPC over lightning. Will has created a C library called lnsocket that allows him to send messages from iOS to control his lightning node. After reaching a point with lnsocket where he can send TLVs, he is now considering the format of RPC commands. Will mentioned that although c-lightning plugin uses JSON-RPC payload, something more compact and rpc-friendly like grpc would be better. He is curious about the cln-grpc PR. Will believes that an RPC bolt will be super powerful in the long run. Christian responded to Will's message by saying that this is the final PR in cln-* series. It exposes the JSON-RPC over grpc, with mTLS authentication built-in. The pull request can be viewed on GitHub.</summary>
