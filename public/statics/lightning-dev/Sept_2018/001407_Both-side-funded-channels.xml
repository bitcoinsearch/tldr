    <summary>The implementation of dual-funded channels in the Lightning Network is being discussed, which would allow both parties to contribute funds to a channel at the same time in a single transaction. However, there are concerns about the potential for leaks of private information and attacks on funds tied up in channels. To mitigate these risks, the initiator of the channel would be required to pay a fee based on the capacity requested from the other party and the "to_self_delay" parameter. The starting state of the channel would also put slightly more money into the initiatee side, and the initiator would have to put up funds equal to or greater than what it requests from the initiatee to mitigate privacy leakage. These issues will be discussed further at the November lightning-dev summit, with implementation taking over a year. The author suggests that dual-funded channels may not be necessary given the requirement for the initiator to put up funds anyway and the potential for off-to-onchain swaps, where funds are moved back on-chain in exchange for slightly higher fees. This solution can be implemented now and repeated until enough incoming capacity is obtained.</summary>
