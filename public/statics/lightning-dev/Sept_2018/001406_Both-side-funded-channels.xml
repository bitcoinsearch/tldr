    <summary>A week ago, Cezary had a conversation with Christian Decker who informed him of the plan to implement both-side funding channels. The implementation would allow for a single, trustless transaction where Cezary could pay 100 sat to a peer if they agreed to put some of their funds into the channel. Cezary sought clarification on whether he understood the plan correctly and requested information on when it would be implemented.</summary>
