    <summary>A final year undergraduate student at IIT Bombay, Shruti, is exploring routing in Lightning Network and has created a Github repository to reproduce the results of the Flare Routing Paper. The results for reachability in the LN graph after varying the number of beacons (B) and queried nodes (Q) for Graph order = 2000 and Seed for Random Generator = 212 have been provided. In Figure 6(a) of the Flare Routing Paper, the estimated results for Graph order = 2000 have also been given. It can be observed that the reachability with zero queried nodes is more than expected. Additionally, the reachability with one queried node is greater than expected for 2 beacons and lesser than expected for 4 beacons. On the other hand, the reachability with more than one queried node is lesser than expected for 2 beacons and greater than expected for 4 beacons. As a result, the total reachability is lesser by around 8% for 2 beacons and is almost equal for 4 beacons. Shruti has requested suggestions to overcome the discrepancies in reproducing the results and to improve the algorithm's design. She has also shared the links to the Flare Routing Paper and the Github repository for reference.</summary>
