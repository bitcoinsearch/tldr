    <summary>Rusty Russell, a Bitcoin Lightning developer, is considering a change to c-lightning. The proposed change would automatically append an 'r' field for a channel with sufficient incoming capacity for the amount requested. This feature uses a weighted probability across peers and could potentially be useful for payment routing and establishing initial channels. Although this isn't exactly what the 'r' field was intended for, it could be beneficial as a hint for payment routing and a solution for centralization issues. The Blockstream Store, for example, has stopped advertising its address to avoid centralization. Russell welcomes any thoughts or feedback on his proposal.</summary>
