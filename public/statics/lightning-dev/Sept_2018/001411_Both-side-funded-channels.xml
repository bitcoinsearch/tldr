    <summary>In a conversation between Giovanni and ZmnSCPxj, they discussed the implementation of a possibility of both-side funding channels in the Lightning Network. While Giovanni expressed joy over this development, ZmnSCPxj expressed concerns about centralization risks and potential privacy leaks if not implemented properly. They agreed that it would be best to automate the negotiation process and support it widely to ease the job of autopilots. ZmnSCPxj suggested an extension to `node_announcement` that would advertise a node's support for dual-funding and contain its limits. He also emphasized the importance of homogenizing the network by having every node support incoming dual-funding requests if it has onchain capacity to improve decentralization and privacy.</summary>
