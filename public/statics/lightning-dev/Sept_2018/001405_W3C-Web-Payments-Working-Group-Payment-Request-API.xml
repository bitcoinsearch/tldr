    <summary>The W3C Web Payments Working Group is currently discussing the compatibility of Bitcoin and Lightning with the proposed Payment Request API. Christian Decker, a member of the working group, has commented that the spec should be compatible with both cryptocurrencies, but suggests the need for a special Payment Method ID to be assigned to Bitcoin and Lightning since they cannot rely on a centralized URL. A local handler can also be specified as a Payment Handler, allowing for a Bitcoin or Lightning daemon running locally that is invoked for payment requests. The Payment Request API even mentions XBT as a supported currency in addition to ISO4217 codes. As there are multiple ways to go about proposing a payment method, the discussion is ongoing and progress is being tracked on the working group's Github page.</summary>
