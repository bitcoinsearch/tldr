    <summary>Rusty Russell, the developer of c-lightning proposed a change to the software on the Lightning-dev mailing list. The change would automatically append an 'r' field for a channel which has sufficient incoming capacity for the amount using a weighted probability across the peers. This would be useful for payment routing and also potentially for establishing an initial channel. However, this poses a risk as it leaks the current channel capacity to the user. This could allow users to track the capacity and even do a binary search over capacities, depending on how fine-grained the amount in the invoice is and how much control the user has. Johan Tor√•s Halseth suggested including all incoming channels with sufficient capacity up to a limit. Rusty welcomed thoughts from the community about the proposal.</summary>
