    <summary>Kulpreet Singh has been analyzing the Lightning Network (LN) to measure the centrality of nodes and their dependence on certain nodes to route payments and prevent network partitions. He used the central point dominance and betweenness centrality metrics to track changes in key metrics that could help the community decide on which nodes to open new channels with.In response to Singh's article, Rene Pickhardt shared his implementation of four heuristics for selecting nodes to connect with in the c-lightning autopilot. One of those heuristics samples from the nodes that contribute to high diameter to improve network properties.In an email exchange with Kulpreet Singh, Rene Pickhardt discusses his work on a probability density function that is proportional to the average capacity of each node in the candidate set. Meanwhile, Kulpreet Singh shares his early results on measuring node centrality in Lightning Network by measuring the centrality of nodes and number of articulation points in the network as per Robert E. Tarjan.René Pickhardt commented on Kulpreet's article about measuring the centrality of nodes in the LN graph. He agrees with Kulpreet's calculation of betweenness centrality but believes that the difference will be due to the fact that they don't work on the same snapshot. René believes looking at the articulation points should not be their main focus.Kulpreet Singh has shared his work on measuring and tracking the centrality of nodes in the Lightning Network graph to help the community decide on which nodes to open new channels with. He used two metrics, namely betweenness centrality and articulation points, to analyze the network's structure and decentralization. Singh has published the results of his study in a Medium post.In response, Elias from Lightning Network suggests using flow algorithms for a more detailed analysis of the network's graph structure. René Pickhardt also shared his autopilot implementation that selects nodes contributing to high diameter to improve network properties and reduce articulation points and biconnected components.Kulpreet Singh shared his ideas about measuring the centrality of various nodes in the Lightning Network graph and tracking the changes in key metrics that could help the community decide on which nodes to open new channels with to prevent network partitions. In response, Rene Pickhardt provided feedback, suggesting that Singh should not focus too much on articulation points since it is also the responsibility of nodes to have more than one channel. Pickhardt also suggested allocating funds for suggested channels using a probability density function that is proportional to the average capacity of each node in the candidate set.</summary>
