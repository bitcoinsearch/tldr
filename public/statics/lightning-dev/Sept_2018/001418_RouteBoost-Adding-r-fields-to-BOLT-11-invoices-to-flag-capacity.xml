    <summary>Johan asked if there is any reason not to include all incoming channels with sufficient capacity. Rusty Russell, the developer of c-lightning, is considering a change where the `invoice` would append an 'r' field for a channel which has enough incoming capacity for the amount using a weighted probability across their peers. This change isn't exactly what the 'r' field was originally intended for, but it would be useful for payment routing and possibly for establishing an initial channel. The Blockstream Store deliberately doesn't advertise an address anymore to avoid centralization, so this change could be helpful for them. Rusty welcomes thoughts on this change.</summary>
