    <summary>In a Lightning-dev discussion, a user suggested that there is currently no good way to initiate a receiving channel, which could be seen as a weakness of the Lightning Network. However, another user disagreed with this statement, pointing out that people who consistently keep their node online for a few months typically receive incoming capacity anyway. Additionally, a third user offered a different perspective, explaining that routing nodes benefit from being close to as many merchants as possible in order to capture part of the flow of funds. This could result in competition between routing nodes to fund stable channels with new merchants and potentially eliminate the issue of incoming capacity in the long run.</summary>
