    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj suggested using an adaptor signature in the `update_add_ptlc` message for PTLC-offerers. However, LL questioned whether previous PTLC adaptor signatures would need to be re-sent for each `update_add_ptlc` message due to changes in the commit tx. Instead, LL suggested putting the adaptor signature in `commitment_signed` if possible, as is currently done with pre-signed HTLC signatures. The conversation also touched on MuSig2 and pre-sharing of signature nonces, which could potentially simplify the process and maintain a similar structure.</summary>
