    <summary>The email is inquiring about the email address needed to obtain approval or permission for opening and closing lightning network channels or performing OP_RETURN transactions with bitcoin. The sender also mentions that frivolous use of block space is not encouraged, and while writing chess moves on a dollar bill can be sent to friends, it has not been recorded as a valid pastime on any ledger. They provide links to two related things: Koala Studio's attempt to play chess on LN in 2019, which shutdown in August 2019, and Etleneum still having chess but working differently. Their primary goal with this project can be different and focused on testing Bitcoin transactions, while the secondary goal is to have fun and contribute to increasing demand for block space. If chess sounds boring, it can be replaced with any two-player game that works for such a setup and can be played with patience over a few hours/days. The sender also notes that zero fee transactions do not work anymore and that all transactions will pay fees that are required long term. OP_RETURN is used by many projects and excluded from the UTXO set. The sender signs off with their name and public key.</summary>
