    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed allowing 0 value outputs in transactions with the condition that they must be used as intermediate outputs. The proposal suggests that in order for a transaction to create an output of 0 value, it must be spent by another transaction. The parent transaction must also have a higher feerate after CPFP'ing the parent than the parent alone. This would help prevent the proliferation of 0 value UTXOs while still allowing them to be used for things like anchor outputs and CTV-based contracts. Jeremy Rubin believes that this rule would address all issues related to allowing 0 value outputs to be created for immediately spendable outputs.</summary>
