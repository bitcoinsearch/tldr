    <summary>A proposal has been made to add an additional feature bit that allows a channel to forward PTLCs only, no HTLCs. In the event that an old state is broadcasted and you forget every old PTLC, you can still reconstruct all the scripts and use key path spends for every output immediately (excepting the local_anchor, and to_remote is delayed by a block) provided you know the revocation key and your own private key. This strategy can be used for htlcs as well as ptlcs but it leaves you at risk of losing funds if the other party never attempts to claim them. It is not recommended. The goal of this proposal is to ensure that state information is bounded no matter how long the channel remains open or how many transactions travel over the channel.</summary>
