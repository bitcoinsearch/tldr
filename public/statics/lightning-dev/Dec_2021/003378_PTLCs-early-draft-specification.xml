    <summary>In a previous post, there was concern about the increased number of communication rounds needed to generate signatures with MuSig. However, a potential script path has been proposed to reduce this. The proposal involves having a script that the other party can spend if they reveal the discrete log of point X. With taproot, it is possible to have a script path as well, which allows for supplying a partial signature to satisfy "A CHECKSIGVERIFY" if the receiver knows the discrete log of X. This reduces the number of round trips needed to set up the MuSig spend. It should be noted that it is the PTLC-offerrer who provides the adaptor signature in this scenario and includes it in the `update_add_ptlc` message.</summary>
