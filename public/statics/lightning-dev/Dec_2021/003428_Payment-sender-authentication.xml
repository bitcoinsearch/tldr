    <summary>Joost Jager inquired about implementing opt-in sender authentication in Lightning to protect sender identity while still allowing certain use cases. However, Lightning already has sender authentication through giving someone a pre-image hash over an authenticated channel. This means that the person who made the payment is the only one who knew the pre-image hash and can be identified as the sender. Attempting to go beyond this by proving to a third party who made a payment can lead to serious problems, such as government raids, and should be carefully considered.</summary>
