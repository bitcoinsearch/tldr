    <summary>In a conversation with Bastien, ZmnSCPxj explains that it is impossible for a node to prove that it did not receive a message. While it is possible to prove knowledge, proving the lack of knowledge is much harder, if not impossible. If a proof-of-lack-of-knowledge were to exist, then an individual could generate the proof by running a virtual machine that knows everything except for that specific piece of information. This leads to a contradiction as the individual actually knows the fact but can present the proof-of-lack-of-knowledge by pretending to be ignorant.</summary>
