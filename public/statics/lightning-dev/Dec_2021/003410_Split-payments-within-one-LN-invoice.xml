    <summary>Ronan, a Dublin-based entrepreneur, is building Trelis.com, a platform that provides simple payment links to accept Lightning. He is curious if it's possible to create an invoice that splits the payment to two lightning addresses. In case it is not possible, he wants to know what would be required to develop this feature, whether it will require a protocol change or could it be built with the current protocol. Ronan mentioned an app on LN Bits that splits payments, but it doesn't seem to work.</summary>
