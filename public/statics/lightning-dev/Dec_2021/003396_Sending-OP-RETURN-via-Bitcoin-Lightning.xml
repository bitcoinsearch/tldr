    <summary>The conversation is about single-use seals that require an on-chain transaction to post proof of publication to the ledger in case bitcoin is used as the ledger. The transfer of ownerships can be batched into a merkle tree and then added to a single transaction going into the ledger, thus allowing for scalability. Additionally, since aggregation is trustless with respect to validity, users can choose what kind of censorship risk they are willing to accept. This risk can also be mitigated with "multisig" schemes, which use multiple aggregators in parallel.</summary>
