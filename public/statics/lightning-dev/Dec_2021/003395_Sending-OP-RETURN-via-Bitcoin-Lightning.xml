    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Christian Moss raised concerns about the scalability of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using RGB. It was noted that each transaction to transfer ownership of an NFT would require an onchain transaction, inhibiting scalability. However, RGB aims to address this issue in the future by leveraging scalable single-use-seals, which enable the creation of digital assets without requiring onchain transactions for every transfer of ownership. Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, has previously written about the potential of scalable single-use-seal asset transfer in 2017.</summary>
