    <summary>The discussion between ZmnSCPxj and Joost revolves around the idea of presenting users with options for payment attempts that take into account reliability scoring and provide information on time and fee. While this approach may be useful, ZmnSCPxj highlights the possibility of black swan events that could cause high fee transactions to stall, rendering the estimated time irrelevant. In response, Joost proposes a fuzzy "time preference" parameter for LND that is indicative of expected payment time and can be presented as a slider or with three predefined values (slow, normal, fast) and associated costs. ZmnSCPxj suggests asking for a fee budget instead, but Joost argues that this may lead to users setting unreasonable values due to lack of knowledge about network conditions.</summary>
