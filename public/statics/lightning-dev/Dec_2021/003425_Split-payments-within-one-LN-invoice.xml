    <summary>In an email exchange, ZmnSCPxj and cdecker discuss the possibility of a payment being split between two parties (B and C), with only one of them needing a plugin. This would be less limiting than requiring all receiving parties to have a plugin. However, the issue of creating a signfakeinvoice command arises as it is currently assumed that every invoice has a preimage known and recorded in the database. ZmnSCPxj suggests sidestepping lightningd and signing in the plugin itself if access to the hsm_secret is available. However, this raises concerns about the future where the HSM is truly a hardware module and cannot rely on the existence of the hsm_secret. In theory, a plugin could just read hsm_secret, but the creation and exposure of getsharedsecret is considered for this potential future scenario.</summary>
