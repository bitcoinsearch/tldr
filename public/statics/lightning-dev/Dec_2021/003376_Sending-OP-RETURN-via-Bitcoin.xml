    <summary>There is a discussion about the possibility of sending OP_RETURN via Bitcoin Lightning. The question raised was whether it's possible to make transactions with this opcode via Lightning. While OP_RETURNs do not have ownership according to the bitcoin network, it's not hard to define a protocol that associates an OP_RETURN with ownership that could then be transferred via lightning by sending associated currency. One suggested solution to this is RGB, but it still needs severe attention paid to auditing the design before it can be practically usable. Omni Layer already supports NFTs on Bitcoin, and recently added NFT support. OmniBOLT also exists as a LN layer for Omni assets and is currently being audited. Sending NFTs using Lightning is generally impractical because it requires a whole new network for each new asset. However, fungible assets should be doable by any popular token asset.Bitcoin Error Log is a Telegram group dedicated to tracking and discussing errors and bugs related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
