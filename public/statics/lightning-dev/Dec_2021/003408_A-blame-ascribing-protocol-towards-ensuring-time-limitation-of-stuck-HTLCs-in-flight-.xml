    <summary>A Lightning Network developer has published a proposal to address the issue of hash time-locked contract (HTLC) spam via onions. The protocol, which doesn't solve the issue but aims to mitigate it, involves ascribing blame to malicious actors by making use of a new lightning message called “blame_channel” in combination with the proposed onion messages. The proposal also ensures that blame can be ascribed quickly by requiring a reply proportional to the cltv delta at the hop, thus enabling a sending node to quickly identify and isolate the malfunctioning channel. Although the proposal is not a complete solution to nodes abusing the possibilities of onion routing and HTLCs spam, it presents a useful collection of observations towards guaranteeing fast settlement of payments.</summary>
