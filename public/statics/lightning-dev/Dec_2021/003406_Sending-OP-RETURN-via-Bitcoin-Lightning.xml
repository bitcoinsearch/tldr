    <summary>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, responded to a comment made by Christian Moss via Bitcoin-dev regarding the scalability of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using RGB. According to Moss, each transaction involving NFTs would require an on-chain transaction, which would not be scalable. However, Todd explained that RGB plans to scale NFTs and similar things in the future using scalable single-use-seals. In his 2017 article, Todd explains that single-use seals require an on-chain transaction to post proof of publication to the ledger when an asset is transferred, but it can scale because multiple proofs can be batched into a Merkle tree and added to a single transaction going into the ledger.</summary>
