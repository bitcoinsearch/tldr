    <title>Sending OP_RETURN via Bitcoin Lightning</title>

    <summary>In this email thread from the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Héctor José Cárdenas Pacheco asks if it is possible to use the OP_RETURN opcode to make Lightning transactions with NFTs on Bitcoin. He specifically asks if opcodes like OP_RETURN can be included in a channel's opening or closing transaction and if that OP_RETURN can change hands within that channel or network of channels. Although OP_RETURNs do not have ownership according to the bitcoin network, it is possible to define a protocol that associates an OP_RETURN with ownership and transfer ownership via Lightning by sending associated currency via Lightning. The divisible ownership of OP_RETURNs can also be defined through a protocol layer parallel to Bitcoin/Lightning that stores and reads all Bitcoin transactions and those involving nodes' channels as well as those with the OP_RETURN, similar to how CounterParty does it.</summary>
