    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion, the topic of using OP_RETURN to create and trade NFTs was brought up. The question was raised whether it's possible to make transactions with this opcode via Lightning. The response was that OP_RETURNs do not have ownership according to the Bitcoin network, but it is possible to define a protocol that associates an OP_RETURN with ownership, and ownership could then be transferred via Lightning by sending associated currency via lightning. The possibility of making the OP_RETURN divisible was also discussed, which would require a protocol layer parallel to Bitcoin/Lightning that stores and reads all Bitcoin transactions and the ones which involve the node's channels as well as the ones with the OP_RETURN. It was suggested to research RGB for more information on NFTs.</summary>
