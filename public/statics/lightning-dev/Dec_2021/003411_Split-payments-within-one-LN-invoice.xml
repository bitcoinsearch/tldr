    <summary>Ronan McGovern, a developer based in Dublin, is building Trelis.com which is a platform for accepting Lightning payments through simple payment links. He reached out to the Lightning Network community asking if it's possible to create an invoice that splits payments to two Lightning addresses. Ronan asked if a protocol change would be required for this or if it could be built with the current protocol. He also mentioned that he saw an app on LN Bits to split payments, but it didn't seem to work. The response from the Lightning Network community was that splitting payments to two Lightning addresses is typically done at the application level. They mentioned that the Fountain podcasting app works in this way and seems to work okay.</summary>
