    <summary>In this conversation between LL, t-bast, and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the process of providing an adaptor signature in the `update_add_ptlc` message. The PTLC-offerrer is responsible for providing the signature, and it needs to be included in the message. However, all previous PTLC adaptor signatures would need to be re-sent for each update_add_ptlc message because they would no longer be valid once the commit tx changes. It is suggested that it's better to put the adaptor signature in `commitment_signed` if possible, as is currently done with pre-signed HTLC signatures. Fast-forwards are also mentioned as a way to avoid this issue since they delay the change of the commitment tx.</summary>
