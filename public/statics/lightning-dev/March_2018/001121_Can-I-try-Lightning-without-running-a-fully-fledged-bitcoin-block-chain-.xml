    <summary>The idea of archiving chunks of blockchain on a minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents has been proposed as a solution to the seemingly infinite length of the chain and the need for storing it on individual devices. The proposal suggests that old chapters (i.e. those more than two years old) could be stored in an evenly distributed manner across the planet, with only the index needing to be widely distributed in order to reconnect with a chapter if needed. This would no longer be a limitation for people who do not have enough storage space for the whole blockchain on their device. In related news, Yubin Ruan had questioned whether it was possible to try Lightning without running a fully-fledged bitcoin block chain, due to limited space on their laptop. Federico Tenga suggested that pruning could be used, which would still require validation of the entire chain but would not require storing all of it on the disk.</summary>
