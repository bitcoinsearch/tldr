    <summary>Kenichi Kurimoto and his corporate team, Nayuta Inc. from Japan, have been working on combining cryptocurrency and IoT. They are developing another Node software based on Lightning Network Specification (BOLT) which is currently in the development phase. The basic feature of BOLT works on a small closed Testnet network with LND, c-lightning, and éclair. Nayuta Inc. has written instructions on how to use it on a closed network which can be found on their Github page. However, they have not tested ip address broadcast mode yet.Once the node has a valid path to starblocks, payment for starblocks can be done. Nayuta Inc. has respect for the efforts of the people who made the RFC document and wishes to contribute further to protocol development.</summary>
