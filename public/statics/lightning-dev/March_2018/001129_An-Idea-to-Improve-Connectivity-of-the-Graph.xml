    <summary>Christian Decker, a member of the Lightning Network development team, has pointed out that the current approach to state invalidations in the Lightning Network is not well-suited for multi-party negotiations beyond two parties. The potential reactions to a party cheating grows exponentially in the number of parties in the contract, which is why the Channel Factories paper relies on the Duplex Micropayment Channel construction instead of the retaliation construction in LN. Alejandro is seeking further elaboration on this assumption from the community.</summary>
