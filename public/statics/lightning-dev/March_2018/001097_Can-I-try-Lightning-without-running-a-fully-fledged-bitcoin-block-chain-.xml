    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Aleksej asked whether running a pruning node would work with C-lightning. However, ZmnSCPxj replied that C-lightning is currently known to not work with a pruning bitcoind. Yubin Ruan also mentioned that they don't have enough space to store the whole blockchain on their laptop. Lnd has a neutrino mode which is a SPV mode, but the neutrino protocol is not yet in official bitcoind. As per ZmnSCPxj, the solution is to peer with a neutrino-supporting bitcoin peer.</summary>
