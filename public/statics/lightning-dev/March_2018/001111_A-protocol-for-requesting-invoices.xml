    <summary>The article discusses the use of different TOR addresses for separating various activities. It is recommended that different addresses be used for payer/payee communication if one wants to keep them unlinked from their node ID. Using another pseudonymous communication method is also an option. Depending on the transport layer used, different types of URLs may be generated. Another use case mentioned is using partial onion routes for payments in the opposite direction to refund a payer who wishes to remain anonymous. The original payee can have an URL which can be a TOR hidden service or regular TCP. The payer can then remain anonymous by sending an invoice for the refund that uses a partial onion route on LN. The purpose of this use case is to keep the original payer anonymous, not to keep the original payee anonymous.</summary>
