    <summary>The email discusses the concept of atomic multipath payment (AMP), which has two main properties: it has a proof-of-payment and multipath decorrelation. The author explains the use of BIP32 hierarchically derived (HD) keys by Wuille to derive child keys from a parent key. The author also outlines how a conditional payment can be made, with the payee providing a private key that matches a public key, using Poelstra's Scriptless Script concept, which requires the Bellare-Neven (BN) signatures. Additionally, Maxwell's taproot construction is used to form the timelock half of an HTLC. The author proposes a method for multipath payments, wherein the payer derives multiple child keys and sets up conditional payments requiring revelation of each private child key. The payee waits until all partial payments are received before claiming them, as revelation of any one child key would reveal the parent private key serving as proof-of-payment. This method achieves atomicity in the sense that the payee cannot claim partial payments.</summary>
