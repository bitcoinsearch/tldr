    <summary>In an email exchange on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Yubin Ruan expressed concern over not having enough space on their laptop to store the entire blockchain. In response, Aleksej suggested trying to run a pruning node instead. Despite Yubin's lack of storage space, Aleksej believes that running a pruning node should still be feasible. The conversation took place on March 17th, 2018 and was posted on the Linux Foundation's mailing list.</summary>
