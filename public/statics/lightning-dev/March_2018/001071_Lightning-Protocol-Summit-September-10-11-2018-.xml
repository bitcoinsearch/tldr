    <summary>In October 2016, a kickoff summit for the Lightning Protocol was held in Milan. Rusty, who is proposing another meeting, suggests September 10th and 11th in Adelaide, Australia as a date and location that works for him. The purpose of the meeting is to develop, update and optimize the Lightning network protocol to determine what changes will be included in the next version of the specification.Rusty extends the invitation to developers, expressing his willingness to host them in Adelaide, a wine-growing region with exotic animals and great weather during spring. In addition, he assures that travel funds will be provided for developers who would not be able to attend the meeting otherwise.</summary>
