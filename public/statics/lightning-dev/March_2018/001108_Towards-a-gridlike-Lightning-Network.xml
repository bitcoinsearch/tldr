    <summary>The article "Cyclic Superhubs as Solution Towards Reasonable Lightning Network Topography" suggests organizing the Lightning Network using cycles to allow easy accessibility for all participants. However, coordination is needed to set up cyclic superhubs. To address this issue, an algorithm is presented that utilizes node gossip to identify peers with which to form superhubs. The algorithm involves starting with a 32-bit number and performing successive filtering on nodes extracted from node gossip based on hash values and matching high bits. The resulting set of nodes is sorted according to hash, and the candidate for forming a superhub is identified. If the candidate cannot be connected to or has other errors, the process is repeated with an incremented value of i. The author notes that even if nodes have different local maps of the network, they can still potentially form non-overlapping superhubs based on the algorithm.</summary>
