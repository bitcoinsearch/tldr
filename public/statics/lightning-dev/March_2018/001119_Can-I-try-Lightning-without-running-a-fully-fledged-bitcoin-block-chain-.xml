    <summary>A member of the Lightning-dev mailing list, Yubin Ruan, expressed concern about not having enough space on their laptop to store the entire blockchain. One solution suggested was pruning, which involves removing older data from the blockchain. However, it was noted that even with pruning, the entire chain would still need to be validated, albeit taking less disk space. The Lightning-dev mailing list is hosted by the Linux Foundation and is dedicated to discussing development related to the Lightning Network, a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin.</summary>
