    <summary>The email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Andrew Poelstra discusses the idea of making atomic multipath payments (AMP) with proof-of-payment and multi-path decorrelation properties. BIP32 hierarchically derived (HD) keys by Wuille are used to derive private and public child keys, and conditional payments require revelation of the private child key for each public key. Scriptless Script handles only the equivalent of hash locking while Taproot can form the timelock half of an HTLC. An "output has different spend conditions depending on who publishes to the chain" primitive using Graftroot is suggested as a powerful feature that nobody has noticed until recently. The email also mentions the use of adaptor signatures which are reblinded at each layer, allowing arbitrary sets of signatures to be made atomic, and using discrete logs as challenges makes reblinding and transferable proof-of-payment easy. The email concludes with Andrew mentioning his ongoing work in understanding Lightning and figuring out better ways to use scriptless scripts.</summary>
