    <summary>A suggestion was made on the Lightning-dev mailing list to create an implementation of a technique used in Hyperledger to prune the blockchain. The idea is to periodically archive old chapters of the chain on a minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents, instead of continuing to add on to an increasingly long and infinite chain. This would allow for the old chapters to be stored in an evenly distributed manner across the planet. The same 150 computers would not need to store every chapter, just the index would need to be widely distributed in order to reconnect with a chapter if needed. It was also suggested that pruning could be used to validate the whole chain while not needing to store all of it on a laptop.</summary>
