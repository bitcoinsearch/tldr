    <summary>A discussion on the possibility of using a similar technique used in Hyperledger to prune the blockchain based on consensus was brought up by Mahesh Govind. However, Christian pointed out that it is probably off-topic for the Lightning mailing list, and suggested taking the discussion to either the bitcoin-dev or bitcoin-core-dev mailing lists. Meanwhile, Segue questioned why chunks of blockchain can't be peeled off the backend periodically and be archived on minimum of 150 computers across seven continents. Federico Tenga responded to Yubin Ruan's inquiry on whether he can try Lightning without running a fully-fledged bitcoin block chain, suggesting pruning as an option to validate the whole chain without needing to store all the blockchain on his disk.</summary>
