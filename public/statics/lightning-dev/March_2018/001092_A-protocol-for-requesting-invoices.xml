    <summary>In a discussion about the privacy of payment transactions, ZmnSCPxj suggests using an "introduction point" for all routes to protect the payee's location from the payer. However, Andy questions how the payer would contact the payee without already knowing their location, and suggests using a TOR hidden service as the address for the lightning network node instead. ZmnSCPxj notes that onion routing on LN only protects the payer and payee from intermediate nodes, and raises the question of whether using an introduction point actually increases security or if there are other ways to locate the payee.</summary>
