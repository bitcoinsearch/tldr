    <summary>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Christian expressed concerns about the Lightning Network's state invalidation for multi-party negotiations beyond two parties. ZmnSCPxj asked Abhishek Sharma about his idea for modifying the Lightning Network to reduce the need for multiple channels and questioned how it works.Abhishek explained his idea for creating a special commitment transaction between three parties, A, B, and C, which allows them to move their funds between the three open channels between them, provided they have permission from the counterparty, making it useful for routing transactions. This mechanism can be useful in enabling parties to move funds between channels without opening new ones and waiting for the network to verify them.Christian raised concerns about how retaliation would work if misbehavior occurred in one channel and how it could impact logically independent channels. Retaliatory constructions are used to disincentivize cheating by one party in a two-party transaction in the Lightning Network. However, extending this to a three-party case is more complex since it requires identifying the misbehaving party and punishing them appropriately. DMC construction offers a good tradeoff between Decker-Wattenhofer and Poon-Dryja constructions with parameters that allow tweaking the number of invalidations, allowing for years of operation without needing to re-anchor. Abhishek Sharma proposed a modification to the Lightning Network which would require fewer total channels to be open. The proposal involves three parties creating a special commitment transaction on the network that creates three open channels between them, with a pre-specified balance in each channel. These channels would be Lightning Network channels and so the three parties could transact with each other and modify balances in their individual channels at will.To reduce total wait times in a unilateral close, techniques that increase the number of transactions in sequence in a unilateral close have the drawback. A, B, and C create a special agreement between them that allows them to move their funds between lightning network channels as long as they have permission from the counterparty they are moving their funds from. If there is collusion or trading on old balances, all funds in all three channels are forfeited to C.</summary>
