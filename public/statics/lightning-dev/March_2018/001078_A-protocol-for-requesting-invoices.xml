    <summary>In a message to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Corné Plooy proposed an idea for using Lightning for various types of payments. While he sees it as currently fine for customer/(web)shop type interactions, he believes it seems a bit inconvenient for other use cases, such as salary payments or direct pay-out of cryptocurrency bought on an exchange. He suggests having a direct line of communication between payer and payee instead of BOLT11-style interaction to address some of these issues and more (e.g. payee anonymity). The proposal is still half-baked with many details not worked out yet, but can be read at https://github.com/bitonic-cjp/lightning-rfc/blob/payment-protocol/12-payment-protocol.md. In true permissionless fashion, Corné registered bolt #12 for his idea. ZmnSCPxj responded to the message mentioning the Web Payments Working Group of W3C, of which Christian Decker of Blockstream is a member. Christian aims to make Bitcoin payments payable over Web payment protocols that W3C group is working on.</summary>
