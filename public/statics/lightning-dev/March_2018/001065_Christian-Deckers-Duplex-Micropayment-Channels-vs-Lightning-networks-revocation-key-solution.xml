    <summary>The writer, who is new to lightning dev, has been studying Christian Decker's work on duplex micropayment channels and wonders why the lightning spec went with the revocation key system instead of Decker's solution. The writer acknowledges that the revocation system was already in the whitepaper, but finds it complex to handle and potentially requiring a third party observing service to detect cheaters. The writer expresses respect for the creators of the lightning network and believes it will become history.</summary>
