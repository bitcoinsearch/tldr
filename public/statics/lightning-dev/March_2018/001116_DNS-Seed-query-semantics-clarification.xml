    <summary>Thomas Steenholdt has proposed an update to BOLT #10 in pull request #396 and is seeking feedback. He also suggests addressing some other relevant things which may not be entirely clear such as the intended direction of interpreting conditions and what happens if a condition is specified multiple times. He uses the example of r0.a2.n5.a4.n10.seed.example.com to suggest that DNS seeds should process the conditions from the seed root and "up the tree" in a logical approach. He also suggests replacing currently set conditions when new conditions with the same key are met, allowing for easy programmatically adding of a condition to a query. Christian Decker welcomes improvements to the BOLT10 specification.</summary>
