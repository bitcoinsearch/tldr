    <summary>In a discussion thread, Rusty Russell expressed concern about privacy limitations with Lightning Network, specifically relating to refund payments. He proposed a solution of including a smaller return onion with the payment to properly address this issue and added it to the brainstorming phase on Github. However, Andy Schroder questioned the practicality of this solution if routes go down or refunds are uncertain. Rusty acknowledged these concerns and noted that a general solution would require the ability to send payments to anonymous destinations, which is not currently possible.</summary>
