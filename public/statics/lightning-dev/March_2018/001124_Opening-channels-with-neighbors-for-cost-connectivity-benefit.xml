    <summary>The sender node cannot always determine the direction of a channel publicly as it can harm privacy. The Barabasi-Albert model implemented by lnd looks for hub nodes but may cause centralization of the network which would be detrimental to privacy and network availability. Cyclic superhubs are not yet implemented and may encourage a gridlike network with alternate routes but face issues when many nodes are shut down or buggy. Atomic multipath payments are necessary for spreading counterparty risk among more nodes. In response to Karan's query, if Bob wants to send money to Alice but doesn't have a route to her, he could connect with nodes that have a route to Alice through Charlie/Dave which would minimize transaction costs and maximize the number of nodes Bob can reach through this channel. It would sort the choice of nodes based on transaction fee and connectedness it brings to the origin node, benefiting both Bob and the Lightning network. Feedback on this idea is appreciated.</summary>
