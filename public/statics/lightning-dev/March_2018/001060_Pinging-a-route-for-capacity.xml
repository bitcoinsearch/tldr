    <summary>In a post to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Jim Posen discussed the benefits and downsides of using flood pinging as a protection against potential attacks. Flood pinging allows for quicker payments due to lower latency and the ability to ping multiple routes in parallel. However, it also makes it faster and cheaper for someone to extract information about channel capacities on the network through binary search.</summary>
