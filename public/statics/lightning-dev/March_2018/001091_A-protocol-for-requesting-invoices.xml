    <summary>In this conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Andy Schroder, they discuss the properties of the start point of a payment route in Lightning Network and how it resembles both an introduction point and rendezvous point in TOR network. They also discuss the issue of unknown capacity and suggest enforcing a maximum payment amount that can be refunded to make the amount not a requirement. The conversation further moves on to the topic of refunds, with Andy suggesting that a partial onion route would have to be supplied for the refund payment onion route when a partial onion route is supplied for the initial payment. In addition, they discuss the use cases for URLs containing an optional invoice ID, and ZmnSCPxj raises questions about how the payer derives the payment hash.</summary>
