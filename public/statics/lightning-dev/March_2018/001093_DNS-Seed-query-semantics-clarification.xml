    <summary>In an email conversation between Christian Decker and Thomas Steenholdt, the latter was inquiring about the DNS seeds described in BOLT10 and how the query semantics work. The BOLT specifies that the DNS seed should support a list of key-value pairs, but Thomas was unsure about how these pairs are used in a query. Christian clarified that the flags are intended to be used as subdomains, such as querying for only realm IPv4 nodes by using "dig a2.seed.bitcoinstats.com". Alternatively, if one wants to query for IPv4 or IPv6 nodes, but only nodes with realm 0, they would use "dig r0.a6.seed.bitcoinstats.com". It is important to note that query filtering has not yet been implemented.</summary>
