    <summary>The conversation between John and AJ revolves around understanding the four-step process to optimize Lightning channels. Step 3 involves Factory Optimized protocols for Lighting, which reduces the state compared to the "tunable penalties" approach in step 1, making it a strict improvement in general. The error in the paper regarding HTLC output in ComA_i is discussed and the need for an absolute delay before the output can be spent by A is suggested. Step 4 deals with resizing Lightning Channels Off-Chain / Hierarchial Channels, where dedicated users can resize Lightning channels off-chain and each casual user can work with a pair of dedicated users to send/receive payments. Both these contributions are described in detail, and three-user channels are suggested to send/receive without requiring availability from any other casual user.</summary>
