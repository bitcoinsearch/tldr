    <summary>Ben has asked a question about commitments in Lightning Network. He is curious to know what kind of witness script is required to redeem the `to_local` funds if a peer force closes a channel by sending a commitment to the blockchain and how to generate such a transaction. He has committed a transaction on a local simnet bitcoin blockchain and mined 500 blocks on top of it. The commitment transaction hash, size, vsize, weight, version, locktime, vin, vout, blockhash, confirmations, time, and blocktime have been provided. Ken Sedgwick has replied to Ben with the link where the necessary witness is described.</summary>
