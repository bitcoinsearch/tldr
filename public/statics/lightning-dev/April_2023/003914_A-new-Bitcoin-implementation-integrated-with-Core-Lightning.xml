    <summary>In an email exchange between Lisa and Michael posted on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Lisa discusses how CLN (C-lightning) is currently decoupled from the block source, allowing node runners to choose a block backend that suits their self-sovereignty goals. This provides a separation of concerns, where the block source ensures only consensus valid data is delivered to the node while CLN focuses on processing and reacting to that data. Michael suggests that a tighter coupling between the full node and the Lightning node could make sense in the future, especially if transaction fees were much higher. However, Lisa notes that breaking out the validation and peering functions into more composable parts would open up opportunities for building block sources for a wide variety of projects, not just CLN. Michael also brings up the idea of a Knots style consensus compatible fork of Core with limited additional functionality, which could integrate with a bare bones Bitcoin and Lightning implementation in one codebase. He notes that the current management of the Bitcoin Core project is not how he would like an open source project to be managed, and decisions seem to be increasingly made behind closed doors or in private IRC channels. On the other hand, Core Lightning is managed effectively in the open but doesn't have the usage that Bitcoin Core does. Michael suggests that a bare bones Knots style Bitcoin implementation integrated with Core Lightning could be an ambitious long term project, but it would require input from people who are familiar with the entirety of both codebases.</summary>
