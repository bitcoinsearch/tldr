    <summary>The email exchange between Antoine and Bastien discusses the complexities of implementing splicing, a feature that allows for adding or removing funds from a Lightning channel. The email explains how splicing works and shares changes that make the protocol simpler and more robust. The addition of a new commitment to active commitments set is explained, and a sample flow is provided. The email also highlights the need for careful implementation of 0-conf splicing due to double-spending risks. The email ends with a request to discuss the topic in more detail with other implementers.</summary>
