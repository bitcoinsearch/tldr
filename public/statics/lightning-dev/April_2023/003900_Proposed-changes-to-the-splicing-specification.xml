    <summary>In a forum conversation, ZmnSCPxj explains that spends from swap-in-potentiam addresses are safely 0-conf if Bob is the other signatory in the swap-in-potentiam address. However, ZmnSCPxj believes that swap-in-potentiam can be considered cheating since sending to this address is actually a channel open of a Spilman-like channel with `OP_CSV` instead of `OP_CLTV`. Swap-in-potentiam provides implicit protection against 0-conf double-spend risk for all operations that move from on-chain to Lightning. UTXOs with swap-in-potentiam addressed do need to be confirmed.ZmnSCPxj also suggests considering a proposal for cases where splice-in is done by an LSP and the other side is a client of that LSP. The proposal is designed for 0-conf channel funding, but the protocol is generic enough that it can be used where there is double-spend risk from an LSP, which the client wants to protect against. This proposal can be applied to splice-in and channel factory construction as the protocol is simply a promise "I the LSP will do my best to get the transaction with this TXID confirmed before some future blockheight, so you the client can rest assured that even if it is unconfirmed now (0-conf) you can always rely on it being confirmed later."</summary>
