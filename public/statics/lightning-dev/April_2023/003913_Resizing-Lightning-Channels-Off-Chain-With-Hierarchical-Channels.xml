    <summary>The email conversation discusses the difficulties in understanding routing to a "channel" rather than a node in Lightning Network. The writer suggests creating clear definitions of terms like "user", "node", "channel", and "party" to better understand how they work. They also discuss having hierarchial channels and channel factories that allow a single utxo to contain multiple channels between different users that can be reorganized without going on-chain. There is also a discussion about fees and communication of fees/max_htlc/etc. It is suggested that creating a world without factories may not be a good solution for scaling Bitcoin, but hierarchical channels can solve the problem of resizing channels off-chain. However, it is acknowledged that this is harder in practice than in theory and involves some complexity. The email concludes with a mention of implementing eltoo-like via 2-user tunable penalty channels and/or ln-symmetry, splicing, taproot funding addresses, and ptlcs.</summary>
