    <summary>The Lightning Network team has announced the development of a new protocol specification for splicing, which is intended to make it both simpler and more robust. Splicing allows users to add or remove funds from a channel without closing it first. The new protocol will use active commitments, with multiple commitment transactions, each containing an update, being sent in sequence. Revoke_and_ack will no longer be mandatory in order to sign the new commitment, and nodes will only need to store data on funding transactions as soon they send their commitment_signed message. In addition, funding amounts exchanged in splice_init and splice_ack are proposed to be relative amounts based on each peer's current channel balance. Implementing 0-conf splicing remains problematic, however, due to the risks of introducing vulnerabilities when shipping that feature.</summary>
