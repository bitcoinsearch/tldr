    <summary>The writer has a question about commitments in relation to Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Specifically, they are wondering what kind of witness script is needed to redeem the `to_local` funds if a peer force closes a channel by sending a commitment to the blockchain. While the transaction described in this GitHub link seems to be for cooperative closures, the writer believes that for force closures, the txin would need to be the `to_local` txout of the commitment.The writer then provides a concrete example of a transaction committed on a local simnet bitcoin blockchain, and mined 500 blocks on top of it. They want to spend vout[2] and are looking for guidance on how to generate such a transaction. The details of the transaction are also included in the post, including its hash, size, weight, version, locktime, vin and vout information, blockhash, confirmations, time and blocktime.</summary>
