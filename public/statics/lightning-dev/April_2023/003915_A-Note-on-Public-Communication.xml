    <summary>When the author first joined the lightning community, they were new to open source software and specification work. They were impressed by Rusty on the importance of holding conversations in public, which includes IRC, mailing lists, and GitHub issues/PRs. This helps document technical decisions and allows new participants to contribute to discussions. The author believes that it is important to reiterate the preference for public communication whenever possible, especially for specification or technical discussions, in response to recent emails posted on the list.</summary>
