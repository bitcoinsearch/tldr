    <summary>ZmnSCPxj's proposed payment points with scalars is a solution for untrusted parties attempting to sell their signature to a known message. This development is significant for future Lightning Network applications as it provides a secure and efficient way to handle transactions involving untrusted parties. The Lightning Network, an innovative solution that allows for fast and cheap Bitcoin transactions by creating a secondary layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, faces the challenge of dealing with untrusted parties. By using payment points with scalars, the buyer can be assured that they will only pay if they receive valid signatures for the CETs which are already known. This method not only ensures that the buyer is protected from fraud but also simplifies the transaction process. Complex multi-party contracts and escrow services are eliminated, making the transaction process more efficient. Nadav Kohen proposed a scheme for selling data using the Lightning Network with atomic purchase. He also addressed situations where an untrusted party tries to sell its signature to a known message, which could be useful in offering a DLC-like Option contract. To ensure that buyers pay only if they receive valid signatures, ZmnSCPxj's proposed payment points with scalars can be used. Discussions on various topics related to Lightning Network and cryptocurrency are also present in this email exchange. These include the use of payment points + scalars, path decorrelation, high AMP, escrow over Lightning, stuckless payments, and pay-for-signature. Overall, the use of payment points with scalars is an important development for future Lightning Network applications. It provides a secure and efficient way to handle transactions involving untrusted parties, which is essential for the success of the Lightning Network. With this development, the Lightning Network can continue to evolve and provide innovative solutions for fast and cheap Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
