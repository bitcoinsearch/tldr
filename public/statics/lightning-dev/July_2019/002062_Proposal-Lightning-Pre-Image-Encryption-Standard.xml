    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of monetized REST APIs for lightning payments. The proposed scheme involves sending an encrypted payload along with the invoice to reduce the number of interactions between the server and client. However, ZmnSCPxj points out that this could pose a DoS risk if clients repeatedly request data without paying. In response, Chris suggests two payment models: purchasing an auth token upfront for multiple requests or paying per request. They also discuss accounting questions and privacy implications of such a scheme. The thread ends with Chris agreeing with David Harding's analysis on DoS issues and suggesting that it is a solvable engineering problem from the server's perspective.</summary>
