    <summary>In an email thread, LL provides feedback on Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos' paper related to the Lightning Network (LN). LL notes that while they are not an academic expert, they believe that the approach of modeling the protocol relative to the G_ledger functionality seems right. LL's first comment pertains to the ideal functionalities in the UC model and suggests that F_PayNet could be simpler and more intuitive by eliminating assumptions such as malicious parties never wanting to lose funds or honest parties always following the protocol. LL also questions how transactions in the real world can be indistinguishable from those in the ideal world, and mentions that the receipt mechanism used in the OpenChannel protocol is unclear to them. Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos responds to LL's comments with additional information about their research where they formalize LN in the cryptographic framework of Universal Composition and prove its security. The authors believe that a formal proof of security was necessary to specify operating parameters for safeguarding user funds and transactions against arbitrary attackers, abstract and validate underlying cryptography, incorporate LN in the body of cryptographic protocols, and increase trust in the wider community. The paper is co-authored by Aggelos Kiayias and any feedback is welcomed.</summary>
