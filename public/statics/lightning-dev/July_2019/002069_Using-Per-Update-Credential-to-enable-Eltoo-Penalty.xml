    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a Bitcoin developer, shared his thoughts on the use of punishment in a multiparticipant setting. He specifically discussed how the lack of punishment can lead to potential issues with contracts like HTLC outputs that have shared ownership. If a participant cheats, they can arrange their funds in a way that avoids punishment. Punishment systems only work if there are two or fewer participants, which prevents channel factory scaling. As a result, ZmnSCPxj believes non-punitive constructions are the only possible option for multiparticipant constructions. He also argues that channel factories are better than multiparticipant channels as they allow limited transport of funds even if one participant is offline and arbitrary transport of funds between any participants inside the factory if all participants are online.</summary>
