    <summary>The conversation between Rusty and Pierre discusses the difference between bruteforcing on the CSV delay and a BIP32 wallet with look ahead keys. The number of variants to look for can be significant in the case of CSV since it can be specified by the counterparty, which could result in a large multiplier per key. However, restricting CSV delays to be multiples of 144 between 144 and 2016 would only be 14 variants. The issue of normal bitcoin wallets not being able to deal with this is also mentioned. It is suggested that funds are still recoverable with just the seed, which is a significant improvement compared to the current situation.In addition, the proposal in Adelaide for symmetric CSV delays is discussed. While the idea was to avoid confusing situations, Roasbeef pointed out that it undermines the usefulness of option_static_remotekey, which allows for easy disaster recovery using only a master seed. Rusty suggests abandoning the proposal altogether and asks for thoughts on the matter.The discussion also covers lightning network commitments, where it is suggested that one out of the given options is more than enough. Local commitments may not be in play most of the time, but remote commitments will come into effect if the node drops out. Refund delay after a local commitment creates an opportunity for users to do unexpected things. The idea of having a recovery tool to rescue funds from a pre-lightning wallet is considered a good approach, and the Electrum team could help in supporting this heuristic. However, there is some uncertainty with this method as it depends on the close's exact nature and whether it will appear in the user's wallet.</summary>
