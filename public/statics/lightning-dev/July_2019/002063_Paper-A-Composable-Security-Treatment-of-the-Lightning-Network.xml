    <summary>The Lightning Network promises fast, scalable, user-friendly and trustless use of bitcoin. To formalize the LN in the cryptographic framework of Universal Composition, a paper has been authored by PhD supervisor Prof. Aggelos Kiayias and Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos, which proves its security. The formal proof of security is required to specify the precise operating parameters that safeguard users' funds and transactions against arbitrary attackers. It also validates the underlying cryptography used in LN, incorporates it into cryptographic protocols, and increases the trust of the wider community. This work is believed to be a small contribution to the amazing effort made by the Lightning community on the theoretical and practical front throughout the years. The paper is available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/778. Any feedback on the paper will be appreciated.</summary>
