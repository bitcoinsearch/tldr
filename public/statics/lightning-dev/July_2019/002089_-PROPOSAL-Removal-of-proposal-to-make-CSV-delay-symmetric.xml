    <summary>In a conversation between Pierre and Rusty, Pierre asks how bruteforcing on the CSV delay would differ from a BIP32 wallet with look ahead keys. Rusty responds that the multiplier for bruteforcing on the CSV delay is significant since it can be specified by the counterparty. For example, if the counterparty accepts up to 1024 and offers 144, there are 880 variants to look for per key. Rusty also notes that this type of bruteforcing cannot be done with a normal bitcoin wallet, which is unfortunate.</summary>
