    <summary>In this context, ZmnSCPxj disagrees that he first proposed payment points with scalars for Lightning. He clarifies that Andrew Poelstra first proposed this idea, and his work on Scriptless Script was primarily motivated by a goal of eventually enabling Lightning over a MimbleWimble blockchain. The first main use of Scriptless Script was as a replacement for HTLCs, which we currently use to enable cross-channel atomic swaps. The first time ZmnSCPxj mentioned the use of payment points + scalars was in March 2018. The Multi-hop Locks paper is basically the proposal to use payment point + scalar and also provide path decorrelation. ZmnSCPxj believes that payment points + scalars will be useful for several features such as path decorrelation, high AMP, escrow over Lightning, stuckless payments, pay-for-signature, and possibly others. The efforts of Lightning over MimbleWimble have been stymied by the difficulty of implementing relative locktimes in a MimbleWimble blockchain while retaining its "magical shrinking blockchain" property. However, Andrew Poelstra has figured out how to implement absolute locktimes without strongly requiring storage linear to block height under MimbleWimble.Furthermore, Nadav Kohen posted a proposal for a scheme through which a trusted data provider can utilize the Lightning Network to privately sell data where data is received atomically with purchase. In another situation, where an untrusted party is attempting to sell its signature to a known message, the use of ZmnSCPxj's proposed payment points with scalars could ensure that the buyer pays if and only if they receive valid signatures for the CETs which are known. Overall, the use of payment points with scalars seems to be an important development for future Lightning Network applications.</summary>
