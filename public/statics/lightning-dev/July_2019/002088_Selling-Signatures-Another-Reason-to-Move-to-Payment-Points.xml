    <summary>A proposal has been made by Nadav Kohen for a scheme that allows a trusted data provider to privately sell data and receive payment atomically through the Lightning Network. However, Kohen has also been considering situations where an untrusted party attempts to sell its signature to a known message. One example of such a situation is if someone is trying to offer a Discreet Log Contract (DLC)-like option contract, where they collateralize themselves in a funding transaction and then sell their signatures to Contract Execution Transactions (CETs). In this example, it is crucial to ensure that the buyer of the signatures pays only if they receive valid signatures for the CETs which are known.Kohen believes that this can be achieved in a relatively straightforward way by using ZmnSCPxj's proposed payment points with scalars instead of payment hashes with pre-images. The signature seller could give the buyer their one-time public key, `R = k*G`, through which the buyer could compute the payment point whose scalar is the seller's signature: `sig*G = R + h(m, R)*A` where `A` is the seller's public key. By using this value as the payment point, the buyer could be assured that they pay only if they receive `sig` from the seller, where `sig` is the desired valid signature of `m`.It is worth noting that in addition to selling signatures, it is possible to sell blind Schnorr signatures and anonymous credentials. Links to further information on these topics have been provided for interested parties.</summary>
