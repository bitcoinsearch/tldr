    <summary>In this email, the sender acknowledges that they are spamming the list and thanks the recipients for their patience. The email then goes on to outline two requirements for identifying which participant initiated a unilateral close onchain. The sender proposes a construction similar to Decker-Russell-Osuntokun's "eltoo", but with some key details filled in. The proposal involves Alice, Bob, and Charlie indicating their fingerprint hash/preimage, normal pubkey, lawyer pubkey, and delay. Additionally, a common key whose private key is known to all participants is introduced. The proposal includes four transactions: funding transaction, update transaction, friendly settlement transaction, and litigation transaction. A hostile settlement transaction is also included for revocable outputs owned by the participant who initiated the unilateral close. Finally, the email notes changes to the original proposal, including the use of a hash/preimage.Moving on, the context discusses the challenge of identifying the perpetrator who attempted to steal. The revocation key is stated to be the same as the fingerprint and it is safe to publish it if only the latest Update Transaction is published, as this cannot enable any Litigation Transaction. The current state's single-ownership outputs are encumbered by a revocability clause that revokes in favor of miners, while dual-ownership outputs are encumbered by a revocability clause that revokes in favor of the non-thief participant if one of the participants is the thief. Outputs with more than two owners are not supported by this construction.It is explained that the Litigation Transaction path ensures going to the latest state, and the Hostile Settlement transaction represents the latest state, along with allowing revocability of outputs in that state. This allows punishments to be based on the latest state, compared to Poon-Dryja which punishes based on the old published state. Finally, the Friendly Settlement transaction does not allow any revocability and can only be published if no Litigation Transaction has been published.</summary>
