    <summary>In a conversation between Alexander and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the benefits of putting MAC inside the encryption to ensure data replacement over an insecure channel can be detected. They also talk about the proper use of MAC, which ZmnSCPxj plans to research further. The discussion then shifts to a monetized REST API scheme proposed by Nadav. This scheme simplifies the workflow for clients and servers and reduces the number of round trips required. However, there is no guarantee of integrity for the encrypted data, which could be a potential problem. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj highlights the possibility of a client DoS attack on the server if encryption occurs before payment is received.</summary>
