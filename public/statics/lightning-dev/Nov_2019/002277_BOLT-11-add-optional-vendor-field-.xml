    <summary>A legal requirement to list the vendor on a receipt has been pointed out at thelightningconference.com. It is suggested that it makes perfect sense to do so. However, the description field is intended for items only, therefore dividing it would create a better user experience in wallets. The spec change itself is easy and involves adding an optional name of vendor/supplier (UTF-8) to the `data_length` variable. Feedback from wallets and vendors is appreciated. A pull request is available at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/694, but the author acknowledges that it can be intimidating.</summary>
