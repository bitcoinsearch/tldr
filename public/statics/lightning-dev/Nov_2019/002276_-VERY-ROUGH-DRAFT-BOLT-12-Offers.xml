    <summary>The Lightning Network developer, Rusty Russell has released a draft version of the "BOLT 12" offer protocol for Lightning payments. The BOLT 12 protocol provides users with an inclusive, QR-code-ready protocol for dealing with invoices over Lightning. It supports two simple flows: in one, a user gets an offer and requests an invoice over the lightning network; in the other, a user gets an invoice request and sends the invoice over the lightning network. The human-readable part of a Lightning offer is `lno`. The data part consists of three parts: 0 or more TLV encoded fields, a 32-byte nodeid, and a 64-byte signature of SHA256(hrp-as-utf8 | tlv | nodeid). The TLV fields define how to get the invoice and what it's for. Each offer has a unique `offer_identifier` so the offering node can distinguish different invoice requests. For recurring payments, offers can specify what base currency they are calculated in, and the actual amount will be in the invoice.This document describes the requirements and TLV fields for invoicing in the Lightning Network. An invoice request consists of a `key`, a `recurrence` number (if it is a payment in a recurring series), and other codes as required. The `refund_proof` refers to a previous paid invoice with proof of payment (the `payment_preimage` and also a signature of the `payment_hash` from the `key`). Sender must use ISO 3166 alpha-2 code for `delivery_country`, set `offer_identifier` to match offer, include `key`, and set `recurrence` for recurring invoices. Receiver must check `offer_identifier`, `delivery_` fields, `recurrence`, and `amount`.Directed messages allow peers to use existing connections to query for invoices. The `id` is a unique, transient identifier between the peers, used to identify match messages and replies. The `directed` message includes `chain_hash`, `id`, and `onion_routing_packet`, while the `directed_reply` message includes `chain_hash`, `id`, `len`, and `reply`. Requirements are similar to update_add_htlc and update_fail_htlc.When it comes to communication, there are various factors that can affect its effectiveness. One of these is the response time. In a conversation, if one party takes too long to respond, it can lead to confusion or even forgotten messages. This brings up the question of how long is the ideal time limit for waiting before assuming that a message has been forgotten.There are varying opinions on what this time limit should be. According to some experts, such as customer service representatives, the ideal response time should be within 24 hours. This allows for the message to be acknowledged and addressed in a timely manner. However, other professionals believe that this time limit should be much shorter, ranging from a few hours to mere minutes.In terms of personal communication, the appropriate response time will largely depend on the context of the conversation and the relationship between the parties involved. For example, in a casual chat with friends, responding within a few hours or even days may be acceptable. On the other hand, in a business setting or urgent situation, a quick response is necessary to avoid misunderstandings or missed opportunities.Ultimately, the ideal response time will vary depending on the individual and the circumstances. It is important to consider the context of the conversation and the expectations of the parties involved. With proper communication etiquette and awareness of response time, effective communication can be achieved.</summary>
