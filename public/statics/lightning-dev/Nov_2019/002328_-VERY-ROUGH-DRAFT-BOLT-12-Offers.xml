    <title>[VERY ROUGH DRAFT] BOLT 12: Offers</title>

    <summary>In a recent conversation on the Lightning network mailing list, Yaacov Akiba Slama proposed integrating Universal Business Language (UBL) into the Lightning Network (LN). Rusty Russell, developer for Blockstream, responded that UBL could already be used with LN simply by setting the `d` field to "UBL:". However, Slama highlighted that an additional BOLT could be created to reference UBL as a way to exchange business information. He described a workflow where UBL documents would be cryptographically tied to the LN payments, but would not alter the property of UBL of not being machine handlable. Slama also suggested simplified workflows using UBL, such as recurring payments and payment acknowledgments between payers and payees. Russell noted that these workflows did not provide a "static invoice" flow or a donation flow, nor did they support HTTP(s) requests over LN. However, he agreed that once LN supports messaging, such flows would become possible. The conversation ended with links to two messaging proposals for LN.</summary>
