    <summary>In a discussion about addressing spam on a network, Joost Jager suggests using rate limits to isolate spammers and diminish their abilities. However, Rusty points out that this method would only work once the spammer has already jammed up the network, affecting everyone else as well. He also brings up Conner's proposal which did not work in the past. Joost then proposes a setup where trusted nodes apply a 100 htlc/sec rate limit to channels between themselves, while untrusted nodes get a rate of only 1 htlc/sec. This way, assuming the spammer isn't a trusted node, they can only spam at 1 htlc/s and won't be able to jam up the network. Rusty raises concerns about how even with this setup, a spammer could still open a channel with each of the 100 nodes and jam up the network immediately, without playing nice until gaining trust.</summary>
