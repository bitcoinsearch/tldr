    <summary>The Lightning Network is looking for ways to implement messaging in order to enhance communication mechanisms, as polling can be unreliable. The current proposal for asynchronous payments involves the payer pre-signing a transaction and sending it to their local channel partner S, who then sends the signed transaction to payee B in an end-to-end encrypted communication channel. B can decide whether or not to receive payment before a certain timeout; if they do, S receives the payment. In this way, the Rod nodes can help facilitate payment without having to lock up funds for long periods of time. However, there are potential issues with privacy, locked up capital, and the need for secure communication channels. Overall, implementing messaging in LN would help to address these concerns.</summary>
