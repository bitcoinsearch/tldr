    <summary>The proposal aims to remove the need for trusted parties by requiring peers to build up a reputation before increasing inbound limits that apply to channels with them. This system would be based on reputation and can prevent spam. However, there is concern that a reputation-based system could concentrate power in the hands of few big and strong actors like Gmail. The Lightning Network differs from email servers because emails don't traverse multiple mail nodes, and inboxes of users are centralized. If nodes enforce rate limits based on how they rate their direct peers, it could lead to the undesired concentration of power similar to email servers. There is also a question of whether rate limiting is a form of censoring. Overall, implementing a pre-payment proposal can create a distributed system that cannot be censured.</summary>
