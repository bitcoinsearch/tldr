    <summary>The proposal is for a Data Lightning Atomic Swap (DLAS), which allows for the atomic swapping of data and lightning payments. The proposal has two patterns: DLAS-down, where a payer swaps data-download with lightning payment to a payee, and DLAS-up, where a payer swaps data-upload with lightning payment to a payee. The data is embedded in the preimage, so sending and receiving the data require lightning payment at the same time. Atomic Swaps among cryptocurrencies have various ways to implement, while Atomic Swaps between data and cryptocurrencies are also proposed as part of TumbleBit mechanism, Storm mechanism, and others. A DLAS mechanism for data is useful in many use cases. There are pros and cons to the DLAS-down and DLAS-up patterns. DLAS-down allows for an atomic data download exchange with lightning payment, but it requires a better mechanism to expand data size. DLAS-up allows for an atomic data upload exchange with lightning payment, but OG AMP is needed to implement it. The author describes a way to swap data with lightning payment atomically, but does not describe a way to detect whether data is correct or not. The specification involves a Lightning Network mechanism about preimage, where the payer sends lightning payment and receives data from Payee atomically. The payer sends data and lightning payment from Payee atomically, similar to the OG AMP system.</summary>
