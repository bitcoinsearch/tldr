    <summary>In a payment channel network, it is possible for two malicious parties to engage in certain behaviors without the involvement of other nodes. For example, they can report an incorrect residual balance and still accept multiple transactions that exceed the channel capacity. However, this is not necessarily a problem for other nodes as long as the parties are cooperating. The only restriction is that they cannot advertise a channel without disclosing where it was funded on the chain due to anti-spam reasons. It is important to note that other nodes must keep track of all announced channels.</summary>
