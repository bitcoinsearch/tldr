    <summary>The discussion revolves around the possibility of channels getting stuck due to unbalanced transactions and the use of a hard-coded constant for dust relay fee. It is noted that there will never be a commitment transaction where the non-initiator pays fees, but it's theoretically possible for channels to get stuck if there is no reasonable balance. The concern is raised about the possibility of `dustRelayFee` changing in the future, making the hard-coded 294 sat anchors risky for opening new channels. Two options are discussed to make Lightning more robust: reusing `dust_limit_satoshis` or adding a new `anchor_msat` field in the opening messages. The tweakless anchor is also discussed, but it is concluded that it doesn't add anything significant.</summary>
