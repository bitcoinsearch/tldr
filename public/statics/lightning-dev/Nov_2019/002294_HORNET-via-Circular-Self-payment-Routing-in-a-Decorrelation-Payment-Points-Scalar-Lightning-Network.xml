    <summary>HORNET is a secure mix network that uses onion routing to establish sessions. The Sphinx construction is an onion-routing construction used by HORNET in its session-establishment phase. Payment Decorrelation prevents two cooperating, but distant, intermediate nodes from correlating that forwards going through them are actually the same single payment. In HORNET, communications between participants must first be packaged into abstractions called "sessions". During setup, the sender creates two paths, the "forward" path and the "return" path. In payment decorrelation, when an incoming PTLC is received by a forwarding node, the onion packet for that hop also includes a scalar. The single circular path is the entire HORNET session. To set up our HORNET session, our sender generates a path from the receiver to itself and generates a path from itself to the receiver.</summary>
