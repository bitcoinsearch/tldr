    <summary>In an email conversation, a proposal was made to remove the need for trusted parties in a network of nodes. The proposal aims to ensure that nodes are cognizant of the level of service they provide to their peers and that spam is not forwarded. To achieve this, the suggestion is to require peers to build up their reputation before increasing the inbound limits that apply to the channels with them.</summary>
