    <summary>In an email exchange, Rusty Russell and Yaacov Akiba Slama discussed the implementation of UBL (Universal Business Language) in the Lightning Network specification. While Rusty favors simplicity, he acknowledges that businesses may need standards for easy integration of POS systems with LN. Yaacov argues that using UBL is simpler than trying to understand the semantics of each field needed by businesses. However, Rusty notes that implementing UBL would require a mapping between UBL fields and invoice/offer fields specific to LN. He also highlights that many UBL fields are not amenable to machine interpretation and require explicit exposure or ignoring, which will be a significant task requiring expertise in UBL's specification. Therefore, Rusty suggests forming a sub-group to investigate this properly.</summary>
