    <summary>In a recent email thread, Rusty Russell proposed a way to turn one anchor output into an anyone-can-spend after it's mined. He suggested gratuitously mentioning the other key in the script. However, Dave pointed out that each party's funding_pubkey, which is already being revealed in the commitment transaction's input witness script, could be reused instead. By doing so, they can avoid gratuitously mentioning the other key and simplify the process.</summary>
