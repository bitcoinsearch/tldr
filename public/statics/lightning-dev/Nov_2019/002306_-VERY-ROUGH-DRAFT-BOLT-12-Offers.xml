    <summary>The discussion thread involves Rusty Russell and contributors to the LNURL, Ross and Yaacov. Ross expresses some concerns about the implementation of delivery address in the Lightning Network (LN). He believes that it would be a nightmare for network or wallet providers due to the expected user experience of consumer applications in 2019. If the offer provider handles validation, the network will have to accommodate potentially infinite validation attempts while if the wallet provider validates the inputs, they are taking on significant workload to develop a robust address input UI. Ross suggests that the address validation input is only possible via the second option but thinks it is too much workload and responsibility to expect from wallet providers. On the other hand, Yaacov suggests the use of Universal Business Language (UBL) in the LN specification as a way of creating an infrastructure that can be used by businesses when integrating LN into POS systems. While Rusty is attracted to UBL, he also acknowledges the need to avoid duplication and proposes an explicit mapping between invoices/offers and UBL. The group agrees on the need to think further on what fields should have their own existence in the invoice/offer and what should be in a general UBL field. Finally, Rusty thanks Yaacov for his work, acknowledging that LN would not have been where it is without his push.</summary>
