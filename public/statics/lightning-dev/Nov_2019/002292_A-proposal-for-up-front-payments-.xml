    <summary>The Lightning Network could be less attractive if prepayments become more frequent, according to Joost Jager in a post on the Linux Foundation's website. He explained that micro-payments could become prohibitively expensive with too many prepayments required and advised that caution should be taken where this is concerned, particularly as micro-payments are an area where the Lightning Network outperforms other payment systems. Jager said it's possible a not-yet-imagined micro-payment-based service could lead to world domination. Rusty, who commented on Jager's post, agreed and added that spam could also be resolved by using rate limits for failures, but warned that without addressing issues such as these, the network would use deanonymization to defend itself.</summary>
