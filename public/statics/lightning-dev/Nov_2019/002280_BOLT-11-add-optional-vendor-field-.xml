    <summary>In a recent email to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell proposed a spec change that would require vendors to be listed on receipts. This change would make sense both legally and practically, as it allows for better user experience in wallets. The proposed change involves adding an optional variable named `data_length` with the vendor's name encoded in UTF-8. Rusty welcomes feedback from wallets and vendors regarding this proposal and has shared a pull request on Github for those who are interested. The idea for this proposal was suggested to Rusty at thelightningconference.com, though he is currently unsure of who came up with the idea due to being jetlagged and having too much fun at the time.</summary>
