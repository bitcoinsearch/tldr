    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list experienced a downtime of 100 to 200 blocks, resulting in undeliverable messages. ZmnSCPxj sent a test email to see if the issue persisted. It was revealed that the mailing lists were undergoing a migration process to a new server. Further information on the matter is expected to be released soon. Bryan provided his contact details at the end of the message.</summary>
