    <summary>In this context, ZmnSCPxj argues that requiring a fee is equivalent to requiring proof-of-work incentive-wise. However, Orfeas points out that in a particular PoW proposal, a brand-new PoW has to be created for each intermediary, which cannot be reused later. Orfeas proposes spam-prevention schemes that differ on whether the payer gives sats or PoWs to intermediaries, such that economically rational agents are incentivized to cheat in the case of sats but not so in the case of PoWs. In essence, fees and PoW are equivalent, and the only difference is that the PoW cannot be reused by the intermediate node. To solve this issue, Orfeas suggests either burning the up-front fees or locking them for a period and then reverting them to the original sender.</summary>
