    <summary>In this email thread, the subject has been changed due to being off-topic. The discussion revolves around the topic of spam limitation via up-front fees and PoW (proof-of-work). It is argued that both methods have different dynamics, with PoW having more variance which can limit non-spam usage. The concept of money representing the allocation of available energy is introduced, with PoW being a proof that somebody allocated available energy for its production. The argument is made that a stable monetary system and market allows one to buy PoW, making PoW and fees equivalent.</summary>
