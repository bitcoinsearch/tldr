    <summary>The email thread discusses an alternative to upfront payments to prevent spam, using a PoW puzzle for each intermediate node and communicating the solution in the onion. The idea is simple and does not leak any privacy, and avoids having to create a node reputation system. The discussion also explores ways to obscure path length and break correlation, such as making amounts work like the onion or fully refunding upfront payment on success. Additionally, the possibility of using an ECC trapdoor and scriptless scripts to prevent uncooperative routing failure without revealing the preimage is discussed.</summary>
