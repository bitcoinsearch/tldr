    <summary>The security of payment channel networks in the case of malicious parties is questioned by Subhra Mazumdar. He considers a scenario where two parties controlled by the same adversary open a channel but only have a capacity of 0.2 BTC after receiving two transactions of 0.4 BTC each. In this situation, if B and C report an incorrect residual balance, they could accept the third transaction, violating the channel's capacity. The concern is that without anyone keeping track of the residual value, there would be no way to detect this violation. There was an issue of lightning-dev emails being undelivered, but it seems to be resolved now. The discussion between ZmnSCPxj and Subhra regarding routing has been shared. ZmnSCPxj explained that there is no facility to remotely report channel balances and that nobody particularly cares about the exact balance on the BC channel. Additionally, he argued that anyone creating such a chain would lose out on earnings than if they had multiple nodes creating the shortest paths between many nodes. In general, he believes that economic rationality will lead to such attacks being routed around.In a payment channel network, it is possible for two malicious parties to engage in certain behaviors without the involvement of other nodes. For example, they can report an incorrect residual balance and still accept multiple transactions that exceed the channel capacity. However, this is not necessarily a problem for other nodes as long as the parties are cooperating. The only restriction is that they cannot advertise a channel without disclosing where it was funded on the chain due to anti-spam reasons. It is important to note that other nodes must keep track of all announced channels.</summary>
