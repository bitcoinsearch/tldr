    <summary>Yaacov Akiba Slama suggests that integration between different protocols is possible without affecting their individual semantics. He proposes defining interaction points to achieve this. He gives an example of how the seller can add a prepayment invoice to an LN invoice and tie UBL documents to the LN payment cryptographically. This way, the UBL's machine handlability remains unaltered while tying it to the workflow.However, Rusty points out that setting the 'd' field to "UBL:" achieves the same result. But it does not provide a static invoice flow, donation flow, method for wallets to do recurrence, and end-to-end over LN.</summary>
