    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo expressed confusion about why a limit of 25 channels per node should cause any issues. In response, ZmnSCPxj argued that while the cost of tracking an unopened channel may be relatively low, it can become arbitrarily high if a malicious node keeps sending open_channel and funding_created messages with random transaction IDs. To avoid this, c-lightning currently limits one-channel-one-peer at opening. The proposed funding_cancelled message would allow an honest party to free up the limited resource of pending channel opens without having to wait for the timeout. It was suggested that a protocol-required minimum timeout could address the issue of varying concepts for acceptable wait times.</summary>
