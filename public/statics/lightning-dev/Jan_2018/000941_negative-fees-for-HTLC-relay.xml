    <summary>The discussion revolves around the importance of negative shadow prices for optimal constrained network markets, specifically in regard to flows in opposite directions canceling out. The example of FTRs is given to support this point. It is acknowledged that the analogy may not hold completely, but it is still worth considering. Benjamin Mord inquires about the difficulty in the routing protocol that led to the dropping of a feature. He expresses interest in reviewing documentation to potentially propose a solution to the issue. Regardless, he suggests that the protocol should allow for negative fees and individual implementations can choose to treat them as zero for simplicity, rather than being constrained by the protocol.</summary>
