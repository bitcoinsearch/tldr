    <summary>In order to safely broadcast a funding transaction, both parties involved in a channel must sign a commitment transaction spending the output from the funding transaction. However, without segwit, the funding transaction can be malleated. This leaves the commitment transaction invalid and funds locked up if one of the parties stops cooperating. A member of the Lightning-dev mailing list, Praveen Baratam, questioned the necessity of SegWit for Lightning Network, suggesting that waiting for the funding transaction to be confirmed would allow for the safe creation and updating of unconfirmed commitment transactions. Dr. Johan Halseth responded to this by emphasizing the importance of SegWit to prevent transaction malleability.</summary>
