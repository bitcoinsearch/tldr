    <summary>In a mailing list discussion, Christian and ZmnSCPxj are discussing the removal of the payment hash to further decorrelate hops in a payment route. This is being done to make it harder for forwarding nodes to collate hops into a route. However, they point out that there is still the possibility of adding information in the onion packet. For example, if a node does currency conversion, one may specify the desired exchange rate in the onion. Benjamin Mord then asks if annotations can be added to a lightning transaction that can be read by all intermediate nodes along a given route or readable only by certain specific known intermediate nodes.</summary>
