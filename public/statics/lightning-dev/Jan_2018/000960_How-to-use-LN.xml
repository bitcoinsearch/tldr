    <summary>The email thread discusses various aspects of the Lightning Network implementation, including c-lightning, lnd, and eclair. The thread also covers questions related to the deployment of merchant wallets and consumer wallets in a multi-tenant environment. Christian Decker advises against exposing lightningd to multiple tenants and suggests building a layer in between that differentiates the tenants and controls access to individual resources. It is also recommended for every user, be it customer or shop, to run their own nodes instead of relying on large managed infrastructure. There is a request for code examples related to tying up merchant wallet to an invoice and sending satoshi to that invoice id.</summary>
