    <summary>In a discussion between Matt and ZmnSCPxj on January 15, 2018, ZmnSCPxj explains the potential issue with imposing a limit of 25 channels per peer. He states that if he were to open a channel to Matt but pay too low of a fee, then bump up the fees multiple times, each bump would be perceived as another channel open from Matt's side. This means that if ZmnSCPxj were to try to open additional channels in the future, he could potentially run out of the available 25 channels due to previous perceived channel opens. ZmnSCPxj suggests using 'funding_cancelled' to avoid this issue.</summary>
