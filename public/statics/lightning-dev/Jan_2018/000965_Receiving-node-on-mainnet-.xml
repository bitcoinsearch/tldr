    <summary>Ad치n S치nchez de Pedro Crespo, the CTO of Stampery Inc., suggested the #mainnet channel on the LN Discord as a recommendation. He also offered to open a channel and play "the invoice game" back and forth if anyone shares their node_id and IP address. Stampery Inc is located in San Francisco and Madrid. A link to the LN Discord was provided for interested parties to join. The email signature included an OpenPGP digital signature attachment named 'signature.asc'.</summary>
