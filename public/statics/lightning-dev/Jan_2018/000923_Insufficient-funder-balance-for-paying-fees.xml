    <summary>Johan posted a question on how Eclair and c-lightning handle a specific scenario. In the example, Alice is funding the channel between herself and Bob and wants to add an HTLC but only has enough balance for the HTLC and its fee. Bob also wants to add an HTLC and sees that Alice has enough balance to receive it. However, both send their AddHTLC at the same time, causing Alice to not have enough funds to cover both HTLCs and their fees. This could either violate the channel reserve requirement or deplete her entire channel if the reserve is set to zero. Johan asks for the expected way of handling this situation from both Alice and Bob's perspective.</summary>
