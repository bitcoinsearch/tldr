    <summary>The email conversation between v e and Christian Decker discusses the use of Lightning Charge API for a merchant app and consumer wallet app. V e asks if they need to run a Bitcoin Core node and how to tie the merchant wallet to the invoice. Christian explains that in order to use Lightning Charge, a full bitcoind node sync'd with the network, a c-lightning node, and npm + lightning-charge running to give access to the REST API are necessary. Invoices are tracked by c-lightning and can be stored in a reference using the payment_hash. Customers need their own Lightning client and some channels open to the network to send payments. V e also asks if customers mean end clients buying goods and services. Lastly, v e is building a server-client model where multiple merchants can accept payments from end customers and inquires about whether they need a bitcoin node, c-lightning + charge node per merchant.</summary>
