    <summary>A user faces a problem where their partner has gone offline, leaving 500 MB of transactions at around 100 satoshi/byte. The user had previously assumed that 40 satoshi/byte was enough to get confirmed but since the other person is offline, their transaction may never get confirmed at this rate. The user's only hope is for the other person to come back online and use CPFPs to redeem the to_remote output, as the CSV timer won't start until the CSV containing output is confirmed. However, if they can't CPFP, the script verification will fail and the CSV timer won't start. Thus, there seems to be no solution except waiting for the other person to come online.</summary>
