    <summary>The writer is creating a merchant app and consumer wallet app using bitcoinj APIs for wallet creation, but wants to use Lightning Network (LN) built by the recipient's team. They are looking at the API provided by https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning-charge and have a few questions. Firstly, they ask if they need to run a Bitcoin core node in order to integrate with the LN. Secondly, they are curious about how invoices are generated through the invoice APIs provided by the LN and how they can tie the merchant wallet to the invoice. Lastly, they want to know how they can send coins from the consumer wallet to the created invoice. Despite being new to this area, the writer is seeking help from the recipient and appreciates any assistance given.</summary>
