    <summary>In an email exchange between Andy Schroder and Christian Decker on January 1st, 2018, they discussed the concept of promoting a healthier network in the long term by discouraging "super nodes" from existing. They suggested avoiding making connections to nodes that have large channel capacities with other parties to achieve this goal. While Christian did not see the need to care about a remote channel's capacity, Andy argued that doing so could help avoid routing through hops that violate your capacity limit. Despite Christian's interpretation of the limit as purely self-defense on how much value he is confident enough to keep in a channel, Andy believed that there is potential for a higher probability of having sufficient capacity in the desired direction to forward transfers through higher capacity channels.</summary>
