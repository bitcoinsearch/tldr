    <summary>The context revolves around the installation of btcd and segwit support for ln. The original installation instructions state that btcd with segwit support is yet to be merged into the master branch, but it is possible that they need to be updated. In response to this, Olaoluwa Osuntokun states that segwit has already been merged into btcd for some time now and encourages the reader to check out the documentation provided in the link. He further explains that in lnd, the chain backend has been abstracted, which allows it to run with any of the three supported chain backends: btcd, bitcoind, and neutrino. He invites the reader to continue the conversation on #lnd on Freenode. Benjamin Mord had initially asked if there was evidence of segwit in btcd and if one can run lnd on bitcoind. He also asks if there is a plan for the layer 2 / layer 1 protocol binding to be abstracted away from the implementation on either side via SPI or such.</summary>
