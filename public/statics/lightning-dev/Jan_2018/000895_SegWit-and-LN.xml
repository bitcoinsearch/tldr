    <summary>The Lightning Network (LN) required all BIPs, including SegWit (Softfork), to be active on the mainnet before implementation. Dr. Praveen Baratam asked why SegWit is required for LN, as he believed that waiting for a confirmed funding transaction would allow for safe creation and updating of unconfirmed commitment transactions. Johan Torås Halseth responded that without SegWit, funding transactions can be malleated, leaving commitment transactions invalid and funds locked up if one party stops cooperating. Hafeez Bana added that SegWit was necessary to fix transaction malleability. Therefore, the activation of all BIPs, including SegWit, is crucial for the successful implementation of LN.</summary>
