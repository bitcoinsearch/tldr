    <summary>In a hypothetical situation, an individual who is dissatisfied with their pizza provider could potentially take down the provider's lightning node through a distributed denial of service attack. This attack involves hiring a botnet to open as many transactions as possible with the IP address of the targeted node, causing the server to overload and go offline for new transactions. While there are ways to mitigate these attacks, such as using anycast to spread the attack around, it may not be effective due to state issues involved in lightning.The attack against Krebs demonstrated that even a 100g link, which was previously considered enough to block any DDoS against DNS root servers, is insufficient in today's world. To prevent similar attacks on the lightning network, it might be useful to consider solutions such as minimizing server-side state during session setup and designing a network of devices that can handle these problems by shifting transactions from one server to another without losing essential state.Overall, it's important to think about potential security risks and solutions to them before they happen, especially when the trust of the overall network is at stake.</summary>
