    <summary>A user named v e reached out to the Lightning development team with questions about using their Lightning Charge API. The user is building a merchant app and consumer wallet app using Bitcoinj APIs for wallet creation. They seek to use Lightning built by the Lightning development team. They asked whether they needed to run Bitcoin Core node to use Lightning Charge and how to tie the merchant wallet to the invoice. The email response from Christian outlined that to use Lightning Charge, the user needs a full bitcoind node synced with the network, c-lightning node, and npm + lightning-charge running to give access to the REST API. The developer also mentioned that they don't currently have, and may never have, bindings for bitcoinj. On invoices, Christian noted that the invoices are tracked by c-lightning, and customers will need their own Lightning client and open channels to the network to send payments.</summary>
