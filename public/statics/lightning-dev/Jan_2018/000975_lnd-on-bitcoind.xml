    <summary>The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) has merged Segwit into btcd and can now run with bitcoind. The chain backend in lnd has already been abstracted, allowing it to run with any of the three supported chain backends. The documentation for installation can be found on Github. A user named Benjamin Mord inquired about evidence of Segwit in btcd, but also expressed interest in Golang. He asked if one could run lnd on bitcoind and if there was a plan for the layer 2/layer 1 protocol binding to be abstracted away from the implementation on either side, via SPI or such. The conversation was invited to continue on #lnd on Freenode.</summary>
