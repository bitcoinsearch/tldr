    <summary>A Lightning Network developer asked a question about the payment_hash field layout in a Lightning Network BOLT specification. Specifically, they were curious why the donation payment_hash txn field layout is different in the second lines stanza, rather than using a 0x20 to indicate no bc value in txn. The developer suggested that this change could simplify optimizing for any sort of deep inspection. They provided an example of how other fields in the specification are laid out and proposed simplifying the format for none_bc_value.</summary>
