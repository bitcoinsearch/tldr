    <summary>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj explained that each peer connecting to the network is imposed with a limit of 25 channels. This is done to prevent any single peer from consuming all of the network's memory and CPU, which could lead to denial-of-service attacks. By limiting the number of channels per peer, attackers are forced to use a distributed denial-of-service approach instead. The email also discussed a potential attack surface for denial-of-service attacks when every failed channel opening attempt counts as a resource on the receiver. It was suggested that this arrangement should be done in a way that does not have fixed pools of resources or magic numbers that can be exhausted easily, thereby avoiding the possibility of someone taking down the entire network with a well-planned attack.</summary>
