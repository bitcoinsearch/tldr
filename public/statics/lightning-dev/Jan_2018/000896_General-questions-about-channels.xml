    <summary>The conversation among Christian Decker and Andy Schroder is regarding the issue of avoiding "super nodes" in the network. While Schroder believes that avoiding connections with nodes having large channel capacities could help discourage "super nodes", Decker argues that it is not a good measure since a large node can easily masquerade as smaller ones. Decker also highlights the issue of UTXO fragmentation caused by such masquerades. Decker further explains that he does not see any additional risk while routing through a channel with higher capacity since the payment is guaranteed to be atomic. He interprets the limit on capacity as purely self-defense on how much value he is confident enough to keep in a channel. The aim, according to Decker, is to safeguard against hubs having many channels open rather than simply large ones.</summary>
