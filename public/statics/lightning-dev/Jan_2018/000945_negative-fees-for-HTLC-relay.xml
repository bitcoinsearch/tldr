    <summary>After discussing the possibility of allowing negative fees in channel announcements to incent unwinding, the decision was made not to allow them due to lack of flexibility and special handling for route finding. While negative fees were intended to encourage rebalancing, it is neither required nor helpful, as nodes can simply find a cycle to rebalance themselves. Allowing only positive fees makes routing simpler and still allows for active rebalancing. Any other applications can be negotiated out of band or in the onion payload for that node.</summary>
