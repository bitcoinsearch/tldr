    <summary>There is a potential issue for sellers looking to accept Lightning Network (LN) payments, as they need someone to open a channel with them before receiving bitcoins from other LN users. However, a possible solution has been proposed to add an optional IP address field to the lntb... invoice format. This will allow the LN wallet to be smarter in routing and provide better user experience. The combined lntb... + IP address invoice format will enable scenarios such as a buyer being able to open a channel and pay the seller simultaneously with prior knowledge of the seller's IP address and required payment amount. It will also give the option for buyers to check a checkbox that prompts their wallet to do an LN transaction while opening up a new channel towards the seller through another on-chain transaction. In cases where the buyer's LN wallet fails to find a route, it will open a channel towards the seller and push the requested amount to the seller, notifying them that this essentially is an on-chain payment. The seller can then react accordingly, whether it be asking the buyer to wait for confirmations or ignoring it for zero-confirmation transactions. Overall, this new invoice format combined with channel autopilot will provide a better user experience and make it easier for sellers to have their channels opened and funded automatically by buyers.</summary>
