    <summary>The author of the message is analyzing an error message in BOLT#1, which is meant to fail the channel. The author observes that this error message appears to be a more powerful version of `funding_cancelled`, as it only fails the channel and not the peer or connection. However, the author notes that they need to investigate further to determine how each implementation reacts to an error message while awaiting lockin. It is suggested that `funding_cancelled` may not be necessary for RBF and multi-funding/coinjoined funding transactions. No other information is provided in the context.</summary>
