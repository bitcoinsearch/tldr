    <summary>The Lightning Network's c-lightning command has the ability to pay invoices without an amount, but cannot create them through the "invoice" command. The "pay" command can be used to pay an amountless invoice by specifying the Lightning Network Invoice (LNI) and the number of satoshis to pay. While the JSON-RPC command requires an amount, the rest of the code treats it as optional, meaning that the internals of c-lightning should be able to handle creating amountless invoices. ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network, stated that he will investigate how to enable the creation of amountless invoices in c-lightning. A user on the lightning-dev mailing list was seeking confirmation that the value for an invoice would be optional or if there is another way to send payment when the sender specifies an amount.</summary>
