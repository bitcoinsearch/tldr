    <summary>The sender is inquiring about the optional nature of the "amount" field in a Lightning Network invoice. They have referred to a Github link which details the payment encoding process for the Lightning Network. The sender has raised an issue that they are unable to generate an invoice without specifying the amount using lnd, which is crucial for their work with LN. They are seeking confirmation that the value can be left empty in an LN invoice or if there is another way to send payment when the sender does not specify an amount.</summary>
