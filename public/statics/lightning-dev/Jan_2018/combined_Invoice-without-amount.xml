    <summary>The issue being faced is the inability to generate an invoice using lnd, where the "amount" field is optional. C-lightning can currently pay amountless invoices through the "pay" command but cannot create them through the "invoice" command. The internals of c-lightning should be able to handle creating these invoices and an issue has been filed to make it possible. Rusty Russell also suggests that the "msatoshi" field should be a magic string rather than omitting the parameter. The user wants to know if Lightning Labs has plans to introduce this feature soon as they prefer to use lnd over c-lightning. They have already made an issue on lnd's issue tracker regarding this. Johan has updated the issue to reflect that it is a feature request instead of a bug filing.</summary>
