    <summary>The Lightning Network has been considering the idea of allowing negative fees for channel rebalancing but this was dropped due to potential complications with routing. However, Christian Decker suggests actively rebalancing by finding cycles and sending payments back to oneself instead.Will argues that negative shadow prices are important for optimality in constrained network markets where flows in opposite directions cancel. Negative fees could be useful when the network becomes too weighted on one side of the graph or when the other side is a non-routable endpoint.The discussion also considers peer-to-peer credit using self-issued IOUs and atomically swapped via a lightning HTLC. While some argue that the protocol should support negative fees, others suggest that it's obscure enough not to be worth the extra effort. However, it was mentioned that wholesale electricity distribution networks use similar techniques.The author believes that there is no technical complexity in allowing signed versus unsigned integers in the protocol and encourages not to prematurely neuter underlying protocol expressiveness. He also mentions that negative fees could be useful when the network becomes too weighted on one side of the graph or when the other side is a non-routable endpoint. In addition, the author suggests changing the topology of the network to remove the cut or balance traffic over it as a better solution. Overall, the discussion revolves around the usefulness of negative fees for channel rebalancing and whether the protocol should support it despite potential complications with routing.</summary>
