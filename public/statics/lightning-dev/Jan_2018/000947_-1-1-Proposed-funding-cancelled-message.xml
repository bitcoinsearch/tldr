    <summary>The context describes a scenario where a limit of 25 channels per peer is imposed and a user tries to open a channel but pays too low a fee. They then become impatient and bump up the fee, which results in it being perceived as another open, leading to 2/25 channels. The writer notes that this example could be extended to any number and raises an important point regarding the potential for a denial of service attack if every failed attempt counts as resources on the receiver.The writer suggests that this issue needs to be addressed in a way that avoids fixed pools of resources that can be exhausted and cause network failure. They emphasize the importance of preventing well-planned and executed attacks that could exhaust resources across critical nodes of the network.</summary>
