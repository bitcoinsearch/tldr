    <summary>Mark Friedenbach expressed concern that protocol limits would make Lightning useless for his intended applications, and he stated that he would immediately begin work on an alternative fork if such limits were not just training wheels. Rusty Russell responded to Mark's comment, noting that it was unnecessarily aggressive and that everyone needs to take care not to let Bitcoin's mode of discussion leak into Lightning development. Rusty encouraged Mark to contribute to the spec process instead of resorting to creating an alternative fork.</summary>
