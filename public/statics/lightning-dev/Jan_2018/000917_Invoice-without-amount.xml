    <summary>A user, Cezary Dziemian, requested for the introduction of an option in lnd to create amountless invoices. Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested that he make an issue on lnd's issue tracker instead of posting requests on a list. Rusty Russell added to this thread, stating that c-lightning could currently PAY amountless invoices using the "pay" command but couldn't CREATE them via the c-lightning "invoice" command. He filed an issue for this on Github. He also noted that he would prefer the "msatoshi" field to be a magic string rather than omitting the parameter as it could lead to a bug.</summary>
