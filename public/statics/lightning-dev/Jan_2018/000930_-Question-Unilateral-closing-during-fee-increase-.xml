    <summary>The email exchange between Richard and ZmnSCPxj on the Lightning-dev mailing list discusses the possibility of one side of a channel having complete control over the channel. The only trustless way to transfer control of the funds from one-sided back to both parties would be an on-chain transaction, which is equivalent to closing the channel and reopening it when the other side comes back online. However, this puts trust into the system and assumes that the other party will inform you of any pending shutdown and cooperatively close the channel. The question also arises about changing the fee size when one party wants to close the channel, but this would require trust in the other party as well. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of trust in the Lightning Network.</summary>
