    <summary>In an email to the lightning-dev mailing list, Benjamin asked if there are or will be annotations that can be added to a Lightning transaction that can be read by all intermediate nodes along a given route. ZmnSCPxj responded, suggesting that it may be possible to embed this information in the hash preimage of the receiver. Alternatively, it would be possible to create a new realm to provide such annotations to specific nodes on the route that support that realm, while nodes that do not support this annotation realm would not need to be aware of it. The email was sent using ProtonMail Secure Email.</summary>
