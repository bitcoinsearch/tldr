    <summary>A user on the Lightning Network community forum is wondering if a proposed idea has been propagated to other wallets. The idea is that if a recipient of a payment waiting for a specific r_hash receives an open_channel message with push_msat greater than or equal to the value of the request where the temporary_channel_id contains the r_hash, that payment will be set to a WAITING_OPEN status. Once the channel is open, the payment moves to a PAID status. If a routed payment is received with the r_hash while waiting for the channel to open, the payment status changes to PAID. The reason for this proposal is due to the fact that open_channel can take up to 10 minutes, but most smartphone apps kill background network processes for apps after 5 minutes or so. Additionally, if routing fails to pay someone and a wallet UI should ask the user whether they would like to open a channel and send, send on-chain, or give up, choosing option 1 in current implementations means opening a channel and then waiting, remembering to re-open the app as soon as the channel is open, and pasting the payment request again. By allowing people to "pay" with an open_channel, it allows people to signal intent to pay and payment processors that generate payment requests with short expiration times to react to that intent accordingly.The user suggests that this feature might be good to add into BOLT 2, but is unsure. They thank others for their input on the matter.</summary>
