    <summary>The author argues that the traditional approach to protocol design presumes cooperative nodes before retrofitting security, leading implementers to lower their guard. The use of 'MUST' in RFC 2119 invites lazy thought in protocol design, where details need not be sold as beneficial to individuals. Instead, the author suggests that there is no RFC 2119 MUST - there is only self-interest. The lightning network embraces this idea and aims to maintain integrity despite the presence of adversarial nodes. When a BOLT states that a lightning node MUST do something, it means that non-compliance should be stigmatized as "non-compliant" with protocol consensus, and violation of a MUST should be considered hostile. However, a MUST does not guarantee that remote nodes will respect it since it is not the purpose of MUST to convey cryptographic safeguards or such. The correct interpretation of RFC 2119 MUST is that implementations MUST follow MUSTs, but enforcement is by the community at large rather than vendors or authorities.</summary>
