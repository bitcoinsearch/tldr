    <summary>The discussion begins with a question about whether one side of the channel can gain complete control over it if they have 100% of the funds. The idea is that this would allow them to close the channel unilaterally without input from the other side, and potentially change the fee size when closing. Another scenario is presented where one party has gone offline and the remaining party needs to close the channel but the transaction will not confirm due to insufficient fees. One solution offered is to use out-of-band fee payment mechanisms such as Confirmtx.com or Pushtx.btc.com to get the transaction mined without an on-blockchain payment. Alternatively, a Lightning transaction could be used to pay for the service more cheaply than on-chain payments. Overall, the discussion revolves around potential issues with closing channels and possible solutions to overcome those issues.</summary>
