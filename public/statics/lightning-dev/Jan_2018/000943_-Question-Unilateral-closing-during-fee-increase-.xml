    <summary>In a mailing list post, Johan describes the problem of having a mainnet channel force closed two weeks ago that is still not mined. While there may not be much to do with current specifications, he suggests that in future specs someone could come up with some SIGHASH flag magic to allow adding an extra input that could go to fees or add both a new input and output where the difference goes to fees. If keeping the TXID intact is important, one solution would be to always add a small (1 satoshi?) output to every commitment transaction that anyone can spend. Meanwhile, Jonathan describes another problem of unilateral close with his output on CSV timelock but finds out that there are 500 MB of transactions at around 100 satoshi/byte and his transaction will never get confirmed at 40 sat/byte. The only remedy he can think of is to hope that the other person comes back online to CPFPs his to_remote output for him. However, since the CSV will cause script verification to fail, a CPFP transaction will not be propagated. If they can't use CPFP, the CSV timer won't start. This seems like a problem, and Jonathan asks if anyone has any solutions.</summary>
