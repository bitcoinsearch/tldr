    <summary>In a recent email conversation, Pierre is discussing the possibility of using Lightning Network to receive Bitcoin payments. He believes that it should work as long as both ends support channels multiplexing, which implementations like lnd or eclair do. However, he is hesitant about being the accepting node and receiving too many channel requests that never confirm. Pierre also expresses his opinion that the opening of a channel should not necessarily be considered a time-sensitive operation. While there may be exceptions to this, in general, he doesn't believe it is an urgent matter.</summary>
