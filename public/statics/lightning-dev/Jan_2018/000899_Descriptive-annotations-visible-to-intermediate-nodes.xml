    <summary>In the context, the question is raised about the possibility of adding annotations to a lightning transaction that can be read by all intermediate nodes along a given route. It is also questioned whether it is possible to add annotations that are readable only by certain specific known intermediate nodes, as perceived by the sender.The Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, which enables faster and cheaper transactions. When a transaction is made on the Lightning Network, it travels through various intermediate nodes before reaching its final destination. These nodes facilitate the transfer of funds between the sender and receiver.Annotations are additional information that can be added to a transaction. They can provide context and help identify the purpose of a transaction. Annotations in a Lightning Network transaction could potentially benefit merchants who wish to track payments or users who want to add notes to their transactions.While there is no standard way to add annotations to a Lightning Network transaction, it is technically possible. However, the annotations would need to be added to the onion routing packet, which contains encrypted information about the transaction's path through the network. This means that any annotation added to a Lightning Network transaction would be visible to all intermediate nodes along the route.It is not clear whether it is possible to add annotations that are readable only by certain specific known intermediate nodes. The Lightning Network protocol does not currently support this feature, but it may be possible to achieve this functionality through custom implementations.Overall, the addition of annotations to Lightning Network transactions could potentially provide valuable information to users and merchants. However, it is important to consider the privacy implications of adding annotations that can be read by all intermediate nodes along a given route.</summary>
