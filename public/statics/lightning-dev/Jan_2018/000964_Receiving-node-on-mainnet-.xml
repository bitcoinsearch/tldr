    <summary>If you're looking to test mainnet Lightning Network nodes, the Lightning Network subreddit is a great place to start. The subreddit features plenty of discussion among those with mainnet nodes and could provide an ample amount of people for testing. A user named Cezary Dziemian reached out to the Lightning-dev mailing list asking for advice on how to become a receiving node on the mainnet, suggesting he needs to talk with existing nodes to convince them to "lock" funds on their side.</summary>
