    <summary>A user on Lightning-dev has raised a point that c-lightning currently does not allow users to create amountless invoices via the "invoice" command. They note that c-lightning is capable of paying amountless invoices using the "pay" command and request for this issue to be addressed.The user offers a solution for those looking to pay an amountless invoice in c-lightning, which involves using the "pay" command with the lntb code and desired amount in satoshis. However, Rusty, the developer, recommends using a magic string such as "any" instead of omitting the parameter for the msatoshi field to avoid potential bugs.Rusty acknowledges the issue and mentions that he has filed an issue report on GitHub for it. The link to the issue report is provided for reference.</summary>
