    <summary>The conversation between Bitcoin developers Christian Decker and Andy Schroder discuss the issue of large nodes and their impact on the Bitcoin network. Schroder suggests that many small channels would be partially self-regulating because people would have to pay more for on-chain transaction fees when opening and closing channels. Decker questions the effectiveness of this method since it is easy for a large node to masquerade as smaller ones, resulting in UTXO fragmentation. He also emphasizes the importance of guarding against hubs with many open channels rather than large nodes. Schroder argues that avoiding connections to nodes that have large channel capacities with other parties could promote a healthier network long-term. Decker disagrees, noting that he doesn't see why he would care about a remote channel's capacity aside from it being large enough to cover the amount he wants to transfer. He also sees the limit as purely self-defense on how much value he's confident enough to keep in a channel.</summary>
