    <summary>In an email exchange between Cezary Dziemian and Rusty Russell, Cezary asked if Lightning Labs had plans to introduce a feature soon or if they would have to switch to c-lightning. Rusty pointed out that the issue should be addressed on lnd's issue tracker rather than through emails. ZmnSCPxj via Lightning-dev mentioned that currently, c-lightning can pay amountless invoices but cannot create them via the invoice command. Rusty filed an issue for this on Github and provided a solution to pay an amountless invoice in c-lightning. He also suggested that the "msatoshi" field should be a magic string rather than omitting the parameter since it could lead to bugs. The email exchange ended with a disclaimer about not using the mailing list for support requests or features for individual implementations and a link to lnd's issue tracker.</summary>
