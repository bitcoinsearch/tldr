    <summary>In a recent discussion, it was confirmed that link-level payment splitting is accepted and the provisonal acceptance of rendez-vous routing was discussed. The idea of link-level payment splitting/re-routing was also raised. Even if a node has only one channel to the next node, re-routing or payment splitting over multiple hops is possible. For example, if node C cannot send to D due to saturated channel direction, it can route to D via A instead if node A supports rendez-vous routing. This allows for partial route-to-payee under rendez-vous routing and gives a chance for success in sending the payment to the final destination.</summary>
