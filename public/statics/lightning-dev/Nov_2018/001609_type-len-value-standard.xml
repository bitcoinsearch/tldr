    <summary>In a conversation among Conner et al, the topic of byte length was brought up, specifically regarding the use of one or two bytes for various lengths. One member suggested using varint instead, as one byte would not suffice for all lengths and two bytes may be excessive. Another member questioned the need for such a large size given that messages are currently only up to 65536 bytes total. The original member clarified that they were indeed suggesting the use of varint and provided a link to learn more about it. They also noted that Lightning does not currently have varint and suggested creating a section or part in a different BOLT to describe it.</summary>
