    <summary>In a Lightning-dev post, user ZmnSCPxj highlights an attack vector where the second customer pays fees and designates inputs to create a large transaction with too low of a fee rate to be mined but too large of a total fee to get over the RBF rule 1. This could make it difficult for the first customer to confirm their channel without paying an uneconomical on-chain fee. Rusty suggests noting this in the proposal and alternatively recommends that liquidity providers not have a change output on the funding transaction, though it should not be required.</summary>
