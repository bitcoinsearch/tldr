    <summary>The email thread discusses the technicalities of payments made through Lightning Network. The discussion revolves around proving payment and delivering goods in exchange. The participants talk about the use of private and public keys and how only the payee and payer know the payment preimage q (Q=qG). They discuss how a statement signed by "Q" can be verified publicly with only the original invoice information. Later, ZmnSCPxj suggests using revocable invoices to purchase items from Lizard Master Rusty, which involves two secrets: a payment-proof-secret known initially by Rusty and a revocation-secret known initially by the buyer. Upon payment, the buyer receives the payment proof secret that can be used as proof-of-obligation. The discussion ends with the idea that higher levels can be created on top of Lightning for such exchanges.</summary>
