    <summary>During a summit, a proposal was brought up for "type,len,value" to be added to the end of messages and other intercommunication structures in order to allow for transition to future additional fields while maintaining backward compatibility. It was agreed upon that each "type" must be unique and there was discussion as to whether or not the "type"s should be in ascending order. The group also discussed various aspects of the proposal including whether the "type" should be one byte or two, what to do if an unknown even "type" is found, and whether the "len" should be one or two bytes. There was also a proposal to create a separate BOLT for "type,len,value" which other messages and structures could refer to. The group considered fleshing out what sub-TLV structures would look like, but it was unclear if this was necessary.</summary>
