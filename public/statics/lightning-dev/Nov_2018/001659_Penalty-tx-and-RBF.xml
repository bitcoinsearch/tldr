    <summary>Cezary Dziemian has two questions related to penalty transactions. He assumes that when someone commits an obsolete commitment transaction, his node automatically commits a penalty transaction. However, he is not sure what happens if fees suddenly increase and if his node can use RBF to increase the fee. He is also curious if there is a common approach among the major three implementations and if there is a set amount of time or blocks his node has to commit the penalty transaction.</summary>
