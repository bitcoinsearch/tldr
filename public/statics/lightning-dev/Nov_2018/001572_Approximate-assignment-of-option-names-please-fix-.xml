    <summary>The email thread discusses the feature masks for local and global bits in Lightning Network. Rusty suggests promoting local bits to global bits, but if every node will eventually support a bit, it should stay local. The OG AMP feature is spontaneous and may not have an invoice, so it should be a global feature. It is questioned whether to tie spontaneous payment to OG AMP or support one that is payable by base AMP or normal singlepath. Additionally, merging `option_switch_ephkey` and `option_og_amp` into `option_extra_onion_packet_types` is suggested as both require understanding extended onion packet types. The discussion aims to assign bit numbers soon and can be found on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
