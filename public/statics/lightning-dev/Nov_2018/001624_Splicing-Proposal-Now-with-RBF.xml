    <title>Splicing Proposal: Now with RBF</title>

    <summary>In this message, ZmnSCPxj discusses the complexity of RBF and its impact on fee payment responsibilities. They propose the idea that only the initiator of a splice (who pays the fees) should be allowed to add splice-ins and outs. Once they indicate satisfaction with the splice, the other party can add their own splice-ins and outs. However, RBF adds a new dimension as it requires multiple exclusive splices at once, which will require a lot of testing. ZmnSCPxj suggests defining a dual-funding RBF protocol first to practice for splice RBF.</summary>
