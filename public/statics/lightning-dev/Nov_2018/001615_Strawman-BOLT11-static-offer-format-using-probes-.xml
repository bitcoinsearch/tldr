    <summary>During a conversation on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, user ZmnSCPxj apologized for not fully fleshing out the power of Scriptless Scripts before the summit. Another user commented that their understanding was that Scriptless Scripts were as powerful as they thought, at least for some applications. However, implementing Scriptless Scripts is difficult without Schnorr due to script magic with OP_CODESEPARATOR, and progress has been stalled in anticipation of Schnorr. Rusty, another user, clarified that static invoices are not possible without an extra interaction.</summary>
