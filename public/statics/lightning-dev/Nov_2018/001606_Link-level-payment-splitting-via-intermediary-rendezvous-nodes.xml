    <summary>In a discussion between ZmnSCPxj and Christian, they compare the flexibility and security of their own rendezvous construction to that of HORNET. While HORNET's construction only allows for a single rendezvous node due to its reliance on a variable sized payload in a Sphinx packet from the RV to R, Christian believes their construction is identical to HORNET's with the exception of having an ephemeral key switch at the rendez-vous point. This key is hidden inside the routing information and the remainder of the route is in what would otherwise be padding. Despite the locations being different, Christian states that the constructions are no different. The only issue mentioned is that HMAC verification won't work if a specified shared secret can't be generated at the RV.</summary>
