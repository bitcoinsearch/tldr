    <summary>The Lightning Network developers have deferred the implementation of packet switching in the BOLT specification, but some features that could enable packet switching were not deferred. These features include multi-hop onion packets, identifying the "next" node by node-ID instead of short-channel-ID, and onion ephemeral key switching. A new packettype is proposed where the "next" node is identified by its node-ID. This would enable packet switching, increase anonymity set of rendezvous routing, allow mapless Lightning nodes to ask a peer to be their pathfinding provider with some uncertainty, and justify multiple features having a single feature bit. The switch-ephemeral-key packettype is used for these scenarios. The use of packet switching allows for some uncertainty about the destination, and it can be used when the channel has no capacity or when there is no channel with the node.</summary>
