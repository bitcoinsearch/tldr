    <summary>In a message posted on November 27, 2018, Matt Corallo expressed his preference for substantive discussions to happen on GitHub or mailing list instead of live meetings. While he was in favor of IRC meetings, he argued that finalization during a live meeting is unfair to those who cannot attend regularly or missed the discussion. Additionally, he pointed out that textual communication poses fewer barriers than audio/visual meetings as not everyone wants their face or voice to be seen or heard. This message was posted on Peter Todd's website, with his contact information provided in the signature block.</summary>
