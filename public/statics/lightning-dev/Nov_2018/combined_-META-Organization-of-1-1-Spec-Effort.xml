    <summary>In a mailing list thread, Rusty Russell asked whether Lightning should move from its current biweekly Google Hangout to an IRC meeting. The current process rules require unanimous approval at the meeting before any substantive spec changes are applied. Any implementation changes generally require two interoperable implementations before they are considered final. Fixes of typo, formatting and spelling can be applied after two acknowledgements without a meeting necessary. Russell proposed that Lightning should have a more formal approval method for PRs. He suggested having a "CONSENSUS:YES" tag which would be applied once there are two acknowledgments from two teams and no Naks. Then, a meeting would review consensus followed by a "FINAL" tag and commit in the next meeting. Matt Corallo replied that he would prefer substantive discussion to happen on GitHub or the mailing list and added that doing finalization in a live meeting is unfair to those who cannot find the time to attend regularly. Peter Todd pointed out that textual communication poses fewer barriers for many people versus audio/visual meetings because not everyone wants their face to be seen or voice heard.</summary>
