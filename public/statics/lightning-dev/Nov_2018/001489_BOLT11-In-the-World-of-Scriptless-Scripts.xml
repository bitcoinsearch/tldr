    <summary>In a recent discussion, Rusty Russell proposed looking at the lightning payment flow in the future. Currently, one invoice can be paid either 0 or 1 times, with no safe invoice reuse. This means that an invoice should have enough information to link it to the payer, or else the payer and the merchant may not agree on what was paid for. Ideally, one invoice should be able to be paid multiple times by different individuals, such as a donation invoice, or a monthly invoice. Scriptless scripts are suggested as a possible solution to this issue. An HTLC signature would commit to the invoice/payment hash as well as "something I sent to you in the payment onion". The "something" would need to be well-defined in the protocol, so the merchant can parse it and understand the conditions it presents before accepting the payment. This also enables full AMP, where the payment proof is received despite using AMP, which is called "High AMP." Rusty suggests that none of this is currently supported in the 1.0 protocol, but there will likely be vigorous debate over how much of this gets into 1.1 at the Summit next week.</summary>
