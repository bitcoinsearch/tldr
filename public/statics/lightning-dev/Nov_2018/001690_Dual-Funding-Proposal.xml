    <summary>In this email exchange, ZmnSCPxj provides minor comments on two messages related to the Lightning Network protocol. In regards to `accept_channel2`, ZmnSCPxj suggests that the `options_tlv` type should be even instead of odd to ensure proper shutdown script enforcement. They clarify that being inside an `options_tlv` does not preclude the need for even/oddness designation. Regarding `funding_puts2`, ZmnSCPxj notes that this message exchanges input and output information needed for composing a funding transaction. They ask for clarification on whether `script` refers to `scriptPubKey` and what `wscript` is. The requirements for the sending node are stated, including ensuring each `input_info` refers to an existing UTXO and not spending any UTXOs specified in funding_puts2 until/unless channel establishment has failed. However, it is unclear what action must be taken if a violation is detected. Finally, ZmnSCPxj mentions that the message borrows heavily from Rusty's splicing proposal and non-SegWit inputs should be assumed to be disallowed.</summary>
