    <summary>In a channel announcement thread, the question was raised about whether or not secp256k1 is supported for hashes or just sha256. A response from ZmnSCPxj suggested that both the 2p-ECDSA and Schnorr contingent payment schemes can effectively encode "I will pay you N satoshi if you give me the private key of the public key P on the secp256k1 curve, before time B", which can be composed with another contingent payment of either 2p-ECDSA or Schnorr. Therefore, it would be possible to have a route with channels alternating between the two schemes.</summary>
