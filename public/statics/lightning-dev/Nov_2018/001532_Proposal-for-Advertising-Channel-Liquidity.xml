    <summary>The current problem faced by vendors and nodes is the difficulty in sourcing inbound capacity for their node without out of band negotiation. The proposal to solve this liquidity discovery problem is to allow nodes to advertise initial liquidity matching, which would enable independent sourcing of inbound capacity from a market of advertised liquidity rates, as set by other nodes. This would be done via the node_announcement, which will advertise that they will match liquidity and a fee rate that they will provide to any incoming open_channel request that indicates requests it. The proposal depends on dual funding being possible. Allowing nodes to advertise liquidity creates a market of inbound capacity that any node can take advantage of, reducing the amount of out-of-band negotiation needed to get the inbound capacity that you need.</summary>
