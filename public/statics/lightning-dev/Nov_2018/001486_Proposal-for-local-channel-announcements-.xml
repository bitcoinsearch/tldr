    <summary>A proposal has been made to increase payment deniability for nodes with only private channels, which currently lose deniability of payments. The proposal involves creating "local" channel announcements that only propagate one hop, increasing deniability. The public node would suggest a fake short channel id and the private node would reply with a fake node id and its signature on the local_channel_announcement message using that key. The announcement would be generated by the public node and sent to its peers but it cannot be propagated. Channel_update works as before with a similar non-propagation rule. Feedback is welcome.</summary>
