    <summary>In the context provided, a node is seeking to bootstrap connections to the network as a new node with no existing channels. However, most implementations today ignore node announcements from nodes that don't have any channels in order to maintain the smallest routing set possible and avoid zombies. Therefore, it is not clear how these announcements would propagate globally to be useful for nodes without incoming capacity of their own. This discussion took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list and can be found in the attached email thread.</summary>
