    <summary>Varunram Ganesh, in a post, suggests that the error encoding format bech32 is under-optimized for invoices whose lengths are greater than 71. He also questions the reason for using hex encoded pubkeys in lightning instead of bech32. Rusty Russell responds by affirming that Varunram Ganesh is right in thinking that bech32 is better for this context. However, he explains that hex encoded pubkeys were chosen because it is an existing encoding that already exists in the bitcoin ecosystem. Furthermore, he asserts that the signature on an invoice provides a stronger guarantee than the 6-char checksum anyway.</summary>
