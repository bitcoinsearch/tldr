    <summary>In an email thread regarding charging for liquidity in Bitcoin's Lightning Network, Jim Posen suggested that charging for the amount (in mSAT/BTC) times time would be a fair model. Another participant in the conversation proposed establishing a channel with the terms "I'll pay 32 msat per 500 satoshi per hour for the first 3 days." This means that upon opening the channel with a donation of 500,000 satoshi by the other party, the sender would be obligated to transfer 32 satoshi every hour for three days to the recipient, totaling around 14 cents. If the channel fails beforehand, the recipient would not receive payment, but if the sender stops paying, a mutual close could still be done. However, this proposal may be seen as a complicated addition to the protocol.</summary>
