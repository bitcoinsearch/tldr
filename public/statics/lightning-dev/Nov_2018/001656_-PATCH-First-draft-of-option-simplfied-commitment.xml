    <summary>Matt Corallo and Rusty are discussing a proposed change to the Bitcoin protocol. The proposal involves using CSVs in HTLC output scripts. Specifically, the non-revoked branch of the HTLC output script would include `1 OP_CSV OP_DROP`. Additionally, the HTLC-Success tx and self-generated fulfillment tx would require nSequence = 1. Rusty suggests a new RBF rule where if a transaction has a feerate that is twice the current package rate, it can be accepted, overriding RBF rules 3, 4 &amp; 5. This proposal would simplify the process and reduce blockchain spam. Rusty plans to debate this on bitcoin-dev.</summary>
