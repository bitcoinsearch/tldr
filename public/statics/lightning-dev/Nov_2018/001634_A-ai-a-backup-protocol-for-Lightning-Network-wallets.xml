    <summary>Margherita, a Master Thesis student, has provided an update on her project related to the recovery mechanism of false positives in the Lightning Network. The problem she is addressing is the recovery of unspent bitcoins that are stuck inside the network after a wallet failure. Her solution, named Açai Protocol, aims to use watchtowers not only for monitoring channels but also as backup services to solve this problem. The protocol adopts the concepts of txid, hint, and blob to maintain the privacy and security of nodes. Margherita has created a project on Github where all the details about the Açai Protocol can be found and feedback can be given. Margherita welcomes collaboration on this research topic and invites interested individuals to contact her at s170065@student.dtu.dk.</summary>
