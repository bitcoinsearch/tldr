    <summary>During a summit, a proposed "type,len,value" feature was discussed, which would be added to the end of messages and intercommunication structures like invoices. This would allow for future additional fields while maintaining backward compatibility. Two rules were brought up: each "type" in a sequence of "type,len,value" must be unique (accepted), and the types must be in ascending order (not explicitly accepted or rejected). Some questions were raised about the implementation of this feature, including whether the "type" should be one or two bytes, whether it should be named something other than "type," and whether odd numbered types should be allowed. Additionally, there was discussion around whether the "len" should be one or two bytes, and a proposal was made to create a separate BOLT for "type,len,value."</summary>
