    <summary>In a recent email conversation between Matt Corallo and Rusty Russell, the two discussed the use of CLTV as a sufficient measure for HTLCs. They considered scenarios where there are two HTLCs with different values and CLTVs, stating that using soon-CLTV could delay the commitment transaction further if it is broadcasted right after the sooner HTLC expires. However, this may be an edge case. The two agreed to simplify the analysis and implement CSV for everything by 1. Rusty also proposed a new RBF rule where a transaction is accepted if the payer pays twice the current package fee rate, overriding RBF rules 3, 4 &amp; 5. He suggested increasing the effective minrelay feerate for any transactions adding to that package. This proposal would lead to less blockchain spam and a return to a single P2WSH(OP_TRUE). The discussion will continue on bitcoin-dev.</summary>
