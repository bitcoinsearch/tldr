    <title>[META] Organization of 1.1 Spec Effort</title>

    <summary>The author of the message informs that for the 1.0 spec, a biweekly Google Hangout was held at 5:30 am Adelaide time, and provides a link to the minutes of all meetings. The current process rules are also listed in the message which includes unanimous approval for substantive spec changes, two interoperable implementations for implementation changes, and typo fixes with just two acks. As they approach version 1.1, the author suggests revisiting these rules. Two questions are proposed: whether to move to an IRC meeting as Bitcoin development does, and whether to have a more formal approval method for PRs with a "CONSENSUS:YES" tag. The author notes that milestones have been added to PRs as 1.0/1.1 and hopes to clear all 1.0 PRs this week for tagging in the next meeting before starting on 1.1 commits.</summary>
