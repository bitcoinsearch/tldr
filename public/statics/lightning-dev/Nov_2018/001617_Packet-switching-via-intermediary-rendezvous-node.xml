    <summary>During a discussion on Lightning-dev mailing list, Christian Decker pointed out that it won't be possible to have spontaneous ephemeral key switches while forwarding a payment. This would prevent nodes from creating unbounded path lengths and sidestepping the 20 hop limit, which could lead to null-routing attacks. However, ZmnSCPxj suggested using packet switching as a way to route payments through multiple channels, allowing for more anonymity and increasing the network's capacity. This method involves using onion packets with different packet types, such as identifying the next node by node-id or using ephemeral key switching. It also allows for uncertainty about the destination and can justify multiple features having a single feature bit.</summary>
