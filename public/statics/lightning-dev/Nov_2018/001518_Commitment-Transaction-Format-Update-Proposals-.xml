    <summary>The Lightning Network's commitment transaction format may be seeing changes, according to Rusty Russell. Among the proposed changes are a P2WSH OP_TRUE output of 1000 satoshi and symmetrical timeouts on the CLTV. The feerate for commitment transactions would also be set at 253 satoshi/Sipa, with fees and OP_TRUE paid by the initial funder in most cases. There are also changes coming to HTLC-timeout and HTLC-success txs sigs, which will be SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE so that users can bring their own fees. Additionally, the derivation of keys like `localpubkey`, `remotepubkey`, `local_htlcpubkey`, `remote_htlcpubkey`, `local_delayedpubkey`, and `remote_delayedpubkey` will now use a two-stage unhardened BIP-32 derivation based on the commitment number.</summary>
