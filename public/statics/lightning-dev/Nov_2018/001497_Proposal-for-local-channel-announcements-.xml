    <summary>ZmnSCPxj is seeking clarification from Rusty on a topic related to private and public nodes in a channel. According to ZmnSCPxj, there is a "private" node with all non-published channels, and a public node that has an advantage of knowing that everything passing through the channel with the "private" node comes only from it. This protocol is initiated by the public node, and if the public node doesn't initiate it, then the "private" node can do nothing. Rusty confirms that this understanding is correct.Rusty also notes that having more routes means more fees, but a peer can always offer substandard service, so he doesn't believe that this situation is worse.</summary>
