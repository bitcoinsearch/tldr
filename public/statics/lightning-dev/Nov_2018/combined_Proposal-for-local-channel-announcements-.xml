    <summary>A proposal has been made to increase deniability of payments through the creation of "local" channel announcements, which only propagate one hop. The mechanism would involve a fake short channel id suggested by the public node and a reply from the private node with a fake node id for the channel announcement. Non-public channels have been noted as having poor incentives, with users paying for their non-public channels by revealing that they are the only possible source/destination of payments. A different mechanism has been proposed where on channel open, the initiator indicates a "local" or "global" channel, with local channels gossiped up to some small number of nodes away. The issue of more routes meaning more fees was also acknowledged. Feedback has been welcomed.</summary>
