    <summary>Rusty Russell from Blockstream has written about the benefits and drawbacks of various methods for sending payments through Lightning Network. He notes that payment splitting and joining could be possible if instructions on how to do it were encoded in the onion message. Rusty also says PoP is vital for usability, and that decorrelation can improve privacy at every step. He suggests naming a 'write-once/accept-by-anyone' deal an "offer", and proposes adding a nonce to allow Atomic Multi-Path (AMP). AMP should increase reliability of payments through capacity bottlenecks, but he does not see the benefit of complicated AMP schemes without decorrelation.</summary>
