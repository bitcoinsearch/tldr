    <summary>The Lightning Network is a decentralized network that facilitates off-chain transactions at a low cost and high speed. However, there is currently difficulty in reliably sourcing inbound capacity for a node. Most solutions require out-of-band negotiations to find other nodes that can help with capacity needs. To solve this liquidity discovery problem, a new proposal has been put forward to allow nodes to advertise initial liquidity matching. This would enable nodes to independently source inbound capacity from a 'market' of advertised liquidity rates set by other nodes. A node, via their node_announcement, can advertise that they will match liquidity and a fee rate that they will provide to any incoming open_channel request that indicates requests it. There are certain conditions that need to be met, such as errata to consider whether a liquidity advertising node should also include a maximum amount of liquidity that they will match/provide, and whether a node should be able to request more liquidity than they put into the channel on their half. This proposal depends on dual funding being possible. The market creates a source of inbound capacity that any node can take advantage of, reducing the amount of out-of-band negotiation needed to get the inbound capacity needed. The idea was initially proposed by Casey Rodamor, and it opens up the possibility of automated node re-balancing.</summary>
