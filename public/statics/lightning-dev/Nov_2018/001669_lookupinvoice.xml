    <summary>Sarat G has been working on the LN repository and is looking for a way for a payee to look up an invoice that has been paid, similar to the 'lookupinvoice' command provided by lnd (Golang). However, it is unclear which LN repository Sarat is referring to as there are several. Rusty provides information on the different APIs available for LN repositories and mentions that lnd has 'lookupinvoice', eclair has 'checkpayment', and c-lightning has 'listinvoices' or 'wait(any)invoice'. Rusty also suggests someone write a rosetta stone for the different APIs.</summary>
