    <summary>In an email exchange between David A. Harding and ZmnSCPxj on November 7, 2018, a discussion arose regarding Lightning implementations being "walletless". ZmnSCPxj had suggested that SIGHASH_NOINPUT would allow for this, but David A. Harding pointed out that without a wallet, committing to transaction fees for delayed-broadcast transactions would be necessary as additional fees cannot be added through RBF without a wallet. Therefore, they agreed that better integration of onchain wallets with protocols that delay between signing and broadcast should be considered instead.</summary>
