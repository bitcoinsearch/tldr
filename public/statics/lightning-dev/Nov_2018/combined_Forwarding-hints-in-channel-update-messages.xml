    <summary>The Lightning Network has allowed additional channel_update in error replies, with the decision to document that scid is not binding and allow extra channel_updates in errors for "upselling". However, it was noted that this is a deeply weird case, as sending a channel_update doesn't help if another channel doesn't have capacity. If there's a channel available at a higher feerate or longer timeout, it raises the question of why you're doing that rather than just taking the offer in front of you; that value clearly used to be acceptable, and now you risk them routing around you. Joost Jager suggested repurposing the `channel_update` message in non-strict forwarding fails as a 'forwarding hint'. The intermediate node would then iterate over all its channels to the next hop and determine what would be the 'best' channel to use from the sender point of view. Best could be defined as a tradeoff between minimum fee and time lock delta, similar to the weight function used during path finding.</summary>
