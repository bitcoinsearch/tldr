    <summary>The email thread discussed the Lightning Network's eltoo update protocol and its implications for watchtowers. ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about watchtowers compatible with Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels, highlighting the need to identify users to prevent attacks and leaks of user privacy. Conner Fromknecht updated the group on the progress of a working watchtower design that utilizes a two-level bucketing structure to ensure different clients cannot overwrite each other.The server side of the watchtower has been implemented to accept encrypted blobs from clients and store them. However, integrating the client to back up states properly after receiving revocations from the remote peer remains a task. The tower will only store one blob for a given txid per client, and sessions grant the client the ability to store up to several thousand blobs. Clients would have to pay the tower for multiple sessions tied to different ephemeral session keys to perform an attack against the tower, making the cost high.To maintain adequate privacy, it is recommended that all prior encrypted blobs should be stored, although this privacy/space tradeoff may be acceptable on private towers but not on public ones. The update-and-replace model is criticized for leaking timing information about a particular channel to the tower, making it difficult to maintain privacy. However, the session-based, encrypted-blob approach would work for eltoo towers as well.The discussion also talks about paying watchtowers by simulating breaches and giving them txid+blob pairs. Watchtowers are required to keep all encrypted blobs that are keyed to the same partial txid. ZmnSCPxj asked the other lnd developers, particularly Conner, who he believes is responsible for much of the watchtowers code and design in lnd, about their plans regarding these issues.</summary>
