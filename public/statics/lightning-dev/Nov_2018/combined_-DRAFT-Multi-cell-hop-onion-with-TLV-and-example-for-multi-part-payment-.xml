    <summary>The Lightning Network specification will include a multi-cell structure for onion routing that uses TLV. The proposal suggests an expanded 'realm' or 'per_hop_type', which includes a lower 4 bits representing the number of extra cells to use, while the upper 4 bits are reserved for dropping. HMAC covers that many per-hops, and padding contains TLV. The TLVs follow the unknown-odd-is-ok rule and are in lexicographical order. There is no 0-type, which terminates backward compatibility. Additionally, the proposal defines a new onion error value called "tlv_element_invalid". The TLVs defined for the initial onion include the chain_id of the new chain and are used to switch chains during transit or at the final hop. Type 4 is used for the total payment, with a variable length. ZmnSCPxj suggested using the existence of this TLV to signal the use of base AMP instead of a separate flags byte. They also propose two new types, type 6: `application_data` and type 8: `spontaneous_payment`. Type 6 is used for the final hop only, and only if it knows that the final hop has a specific application that it is compatible with. Type 8 is used only for the final hop and sacrifices proof-of-payment. Rusty Russell believes that the invoice should not specify it as it will create confusion and could lead to people doing dumb things. The writer suggests using it for games of chance where the user can put in a random number.In addition, the proposal extends the use of multi-part payments, allowing payments to be split into smaller amounts and sent as separate payments. It was mentioned that spontaneous payment would be useful when interacting with trust-demanding third parties, like Bitcoin banks, that hold Bitcoin on behalf of their customers. Rusty suggested using "multi-part-payment" over "base AMP," which he believed was too specific and might limit future developments.The proposed multi-cell structure includes a realm or per-hop type, which expands on the current four bits for 'per_hop_type' to allocate 1-16 cells. An upper four bits are reserved to drop invalid messages. A HMAC is applied to cover the number of per-hops, and padding is expanded to 12 bytes plus 65 bytes per extra cell. The padding will contain TLVs in lexicographical order with shortest winning on tiebreaks.The writer must only use the total payment field for the final hop, if flagged as available, and the reader should reject it if not the final hop. It was suggested that the bank would provide a multi-use offer containing the application data, which the customer would use by providing a spontaneous payment below. Finally, the writer agrees that readers should reject spontaneous payments and wonders if it should be advertised on global features.</summary>
