    <summary>In a discussion between Rusty Russell and Matt Corallo on 26th November 2018, the idea of using CLTV as sufficient for delaying commitment transaction was brought up. However, Russell noted that if the commitment transaction is not on-chain by the time the HTLC expires, trouble may arise. Despite this, Russell suggests that it would be simpler to prepend `1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP` to the start of each script, which would simplify analysis and separation of concerns. The cost for doing so would be only three witness bytes.</summary>
