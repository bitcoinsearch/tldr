    <title>Strawman BOLT11 static "offer" format using probes.</title>

    <summary>In the context, ZmnSCPxj proposes a new method of having reusable BOLT11 "offers" that provide almost-spontaneous payments without generating a BOLT11 invoice for each potential sale. He suggests making a new BOLT document for how to generate a BOLT11 invoice and use the term "BOLT15 advertisement." The proposal includes using a return lightning message that contains a new bolt11 invoice. ZmnSCPxj also raises a concern regarding the canonical ordering for tagged fields in the generated bolt11 invoice and suggests a proposal for types to have an absolute order, which would be useful for unique parts of something. Bolt11 invoices have a signature so the order of the tagged fields matters.</summary>
