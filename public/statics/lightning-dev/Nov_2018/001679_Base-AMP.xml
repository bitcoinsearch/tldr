    <summary>In this email thread, Johan Torås Halseth suggests adding an optional field to the invoice and letting the recipient wait until all funds have been received before pulling the payment. He argues that not adding an extra bit to the onion would make the implementation of Partial Payments near trivial, and he doesn't see the downsides of not adding it. Rusty Russell disagrees and proposes a flag on BOLT11 and inside the onion to explicitly opt-in for both sides and to avoid affecting existing nodes. ZmnSCPxj suggests that Rusty is referring to a probe by an intermediate node rather than a probe by the source node. The discussion revolves around Base AMP and the need for certain changes in BOLT11 to support Partial Payments (PP) in the spontaneous payments case.</summary>
