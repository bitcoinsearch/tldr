    <summary>In an email conversation between Johan Torås Halseth and Rusty Russell, they discuss the implementation of Base AMP (BAMP) in BOLT11. It is suggested that the receiver should assume NAMP for incoming payments, but this could result in partial payment errors if the recipient doesn't support Base AMP. Rusty suggests using a flag both on BOLT11 and inside the onion to explicitly opt-in for both sides and not affect existing nodes. Johan responds saying that it shouldn't be a problem as invoices will already indicate BAMP support, and non-BAMPy behavior can be adopted when receiving payments without specifying BAMP support in the invoice. Both parties agree that the implementation should be opt-in for both sides.</summary>
