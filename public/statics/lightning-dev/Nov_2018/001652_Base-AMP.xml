    <summary>The email thread discusses the issue of how much information is necessary for the recipient to know when it comes to payments. While the sender may not need to specify the total amount they intended to pay, doing so provides a more robust method of payment, as it gives an order invariant hint for when the receiver can safely settle. However, if the sender uses amount fuzzing or adds a tip, there is the possibility that the final partial payment may be less than the amount to pay, causing the sender to settle too early. For this reason, it may be necessary to specify that no split should be less than the amount overpaid. The discussion also touches on how to implement Base AMP, with the suggestion being to have an opt-in flag rather than relying on assumptions about incoming payments.</summary>
