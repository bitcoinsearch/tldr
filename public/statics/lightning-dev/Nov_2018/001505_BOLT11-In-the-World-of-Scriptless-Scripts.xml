    <summary>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj suggests that in the payer-supplied data case, a signature for a key only the payer knows should be included to prove they made the payment. However, another participant thinks it's unnecessary as long as there was a payment for delivery of the widget to "aj" in "Australia". The discussion goes on to explain that AJ in Australia only needs to show that he or she knows the private key behind the public key indicated on the invoice. Before payment, only the payee knows this private key, and after payment, both AJ in Australia and the payee know this private key. ZmnSCPxj proposes an interactive proof to show payment, consisting of 200 steps where the court asks AJ in Australia to sign random numbers with the public key on the invoice. The discussion ends with a question about the theoretical workability of this approach without the need for identifying AJ in Australia other than via its ability to sign using the private key.</summary>
