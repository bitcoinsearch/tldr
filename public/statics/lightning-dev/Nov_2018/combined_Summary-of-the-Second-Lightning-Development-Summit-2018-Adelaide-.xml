    <summary>The Lightning Specification 1.1 has been kicked off with the gathering of 18 active spec contributors in Adelaide. The new version has accepted changes including dual-funded channels, multi-path payments, splicing, wumbo and many gossip improvements. Wumbo is the study of all things wumbological, meaning "maxi" or removing the channel capacity limit. Hidden destinations are basically "rendezvous routing". The work points have been transferred to the Wiki for further discussion. The Lightning implementers met in Milan two years ago to start the Lightning Specification 1.0. There were 30 accepted changes for the next version, some requiring further on-list refinement. Unfortunately, attendees cannot learn who to blame for the term 'wumbo' due to rules imposed. It is suggested that we should not impose normal grammar on wumbo, as it is a made-up word and has the opportunity to define its own grammar.</summary>
