    <summary>ZmnSCPxj and Olaoluwa Osuntokun are discussing the nature of OG AMP payments in Lightning. ZmnSCPxj argues that OG AMP payments are spontaneous and may not require an invoice to tag a payment, whereas Osuntokun believes that invoices can still be used to tag payments. The use of an 8-byte identifier in the invoice can signal a service or good to be dispersed once a payment is received. ZmnSCPxj also suggests merging the `option_switch_ephkey` and `option_og_amp` features into `option_extra_onion_packet_types`. Rusty Russell prompts the developers to edit their feature bits as appropriate before he assigns bit numbers. The discussion takes place on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
