    <summary>ZmnSCPxj has proposed an improvement in the reduction of `fee_base_msat` in the C-&gt;D path. The proposal allows arbitrary merges of paths but not splits, making the receiver wait for the total intended payment before forwarding or claiming the payment. Christian Decker argues that as long as intermediate merges are not attempted, the routes remain independent, and failures of one HTLC do not impact any other parts. A is rationally choosing between a lower fee and better payment reliability. If fees rise later, it can be revisited.</summary>
