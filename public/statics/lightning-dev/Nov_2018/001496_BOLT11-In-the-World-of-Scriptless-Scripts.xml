    <summary>The email conversation between Rusty Russell and Jonas Nick revolves around a proposed scheme for Schnorr signatures for Lightning Network. The proposal aims to enable recurrent payments and integrate Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP) into the scheme. However, there are some challenges with adding a nonce to allow for AMP since R already acts as a unique nonce under the hash.To verify proof-of-payment, the proposal suggests using a verification algorithm that takes m, P, and sig as inputs. For current-style invoices without payer-supplied data, the payee knows 'm', so no interactivity is needed. But in the case of payer-supplied data, 'm' should include a signature for a key only the payer knows to prove that they made the payment. The preimage required for this can be obtained over lightning, which is affected by AMP. The proposal includes a way of turning a preimage into a third-party-verifiable PoP (with Schnorr or whatever).The conversation also delves into different levels of payment on the Lightning Network, such as low AMP, multiple payments with the same hash, and high AMP. High AMP requires secp256k1 preimages, improves privacy at every step, and provides proof-of-payment through accepting partial payment. The possibility of source-directed splits and joins in a graph form is also mentioned.Additionally, the discussion touches upon future BOLT11 features that may require interaction messages and error messages.</summary>
