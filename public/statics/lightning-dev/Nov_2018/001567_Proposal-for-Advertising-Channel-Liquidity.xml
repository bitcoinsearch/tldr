    <summary>In a recent discussion, a proposal was made to charge for liquidity based on the amount of time that it's used. It was suggested that a market could be established by setting a rate per hour and paying the other party accordingly. However, there was concern that this could be gamed by a second node making payments through the channel and capturing the fees. The solution proposed was to charge higher transmission fees to make such an attack infeasible. The mechanism was seen as superior to CLTV-encumberance and any activity through it did not appear to matter. Overall, the discussion revolved around finding a fair and secure way to charge for liquidity.</summary>
