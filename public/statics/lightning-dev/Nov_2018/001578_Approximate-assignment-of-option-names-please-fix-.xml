    <summary>Pierre suggests that the current definition of local and global feature masks does not make sense. He argues that he would like to advertise the fact that his node supports 'option_data_loss_protect,' which is a local feature. He further states that just because he supports a feature does not mean that he wants to apply it to any peer that connects to his node. Pierre proposes getting rid of the global/local distinction and use node_features in the node_announcement message, which describes the features that his node supports/requires and connection_features in the init message set for this particular connection. He suggests that node_features/connection_features are related and must match, particularly if they use things like option_anyone_can_wumbo.</summary>
