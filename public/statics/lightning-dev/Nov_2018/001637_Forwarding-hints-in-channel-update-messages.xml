    <title>Forwarding hints in channel update messages</title>

    <summary>The Lightning Network protocol has been updated to allow additional channel_updates in error messages for "upselling". Every node should be non-strict and the scid is used as a cheap way of specifying the next hop. The extra channel_updates allow a node to indicate that there are alternate channels which could be used instead, presumably at a higher fee rate. A suggestion was made to communicate non-strict forwarding as a global feature bit and not through forwarding hints, but Rusty Russell said this should remain an internal matter.</summary>
