    <summary>The proposal allows nodes to advertise initial liquidity matching, which would solve the problem of finding channel liquidity as an offline problem. A node can advertise that they will match liquidity and a fee rate that they will provide to any incoming open_channel request that indicates requests it. The proposed protocol has three new feature flags which are option_liquidity_provider, option_liquidity_buy, and channel_flags. This proposal depends on dual funding being possible. If a node cannot provide the liquidity requested in open_channel, it must return an error. Advertised liquidity creates a market of inbound capacity that any node can take advantage of, reducing the amount of out-of-band negotiation needed to get the inbound capacity that you need. The proposal credits Casey Rodamor for the initial idea.</summary>
