    <summary>A team from Nayuta has developed a Wireshark plug-in for the Lightning Network (BOLT) protocol, which is currently in alpha version. The software can decode some BOLT messages and currently works for Nayuta's implementation (ptarmigan) and Ã‰clair. To make interoperability testing easier, the team proposes adding a compile option to every implementation that enables an output key information file. This file would allow communication logs of BOLT messages to be viewed in the same format (.pcap). The team hopes their project will be useful to the Lightning Network ecosystem. In response to the proposal, Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggests creating canned protocol transcripts for other implementations to assert their responses and thinks the proposal is a great first step towards that.</summary>
