    <summary>Rusty Russell, a developer of bitcoin and lightning network protocol, discussed some potential improvements to the lightning network protocol in an email. The discussion included sending multiple payments with the same hash, partial payment theft by intermediaries, a new way to do secp256k1 AMP, and the implementation of HORNET. Russell also suggested a BOLT 11 v1.1 "offer" that includes a URL for a website where users can enter their personal information for the order. He concludes the email with a suggestion about including crypto keys in the invoice for generating an on-chain fallback payment between payer/payee.</summary>
