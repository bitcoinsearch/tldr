    <summary>In a recent discussion on Bitcoin's mailing list, Matt Corallo questioned whether the current CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) feature is sufficient to address the issue of timelocking in Bitcoin's lightning network. He raised concerns about the possibility of using CLTV to delay commitment transactions when there are multiple HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) of varying values with different CLTVs. Corallo emphasized the importance of ensuring that commitment transactions are made before the expiry time of HTLCs to avoid any issues. Corallo also suggested a simpler alternative to deal with timelocking by appending `1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP` to the start of each script without any difference in script length. The idea was supported by Rusty Russell who acknowledged the simplicity of this approach. The conversation highlights the ongoing efforts to improve the lightning network and ensure its scalability and security.</summary>
