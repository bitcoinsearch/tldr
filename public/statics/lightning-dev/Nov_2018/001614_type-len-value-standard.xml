    <summary>A proposal was made to address the max message size of 65KB. One option suggested was to allow the varint to be max 2 bytes. The varint would have different values depending on whether the 8th bit is set or not. If the 8th bit is not set, the lowest 7 bits of the first byte translate to 0 - 127. If the 8th bit is set, this implies that the second byte is also treated as part of the length, and the total value is 0x7f &amp; first byte + second byte. The discussion revolved around the idea of using varint in Lightning since it is currently not being used. It was proposed that a section or part could be created in a different BOLT to describe varint.</summary>
