    <summary>In an email discussion, ZmnSCPxj suggested a separate BOLT for the type, len, data format in the final-hop lightning onion. He also proposed that various consistent designs of messages should be documented in the BOLT, such as var-length fields using a prefixed 16-bit length measuring number of items in the field. ZmnSCPxj admitted to overestimating the power of Scriptless Scripts before the summit, and had mentally deferred some issues. SS is as powerful as it was thought to be, but implementing it is hard without Schnorr. The use of script magic with `OP_CODESEPARATOR` is magic, and they stalled out on its implementation, waiting for Schnorr instead.</summary>
