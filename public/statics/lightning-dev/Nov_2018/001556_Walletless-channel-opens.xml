    <title>Walletless channel opens</title>

    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a user suggested that SIGHASH_NOINPUT could allow for walletless Lightning implementations. However, another user pointed out that this would require committing to transaction fees for delayed-broadcast transactions, such as the Eltoo trigger transaction, since adding additional inputs through RBF would not be possible without a wallet. This could lead to committing to high fees for a channel that may be open for weeks or months but needs to be closed quickly to prevent fraud.</summary>
