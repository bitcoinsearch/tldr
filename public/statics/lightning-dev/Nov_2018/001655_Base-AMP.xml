    <summary>In a discussion thread, Conner Fromknecht raises a point regarding whether the recipient needs to know the total amount intended to be paid or not. Rusty Russell believes that sending the intended amount is more robust since it provides an order invariant hint for when the receiver can safely settle. However, if the sender does amount fuzzing, it's possible for the final partial payment to be less than the invoice_amount, causing the sender to settle prematurely. Rusty also points out that adding option_simplfied_commitment code might add complexity and thinks that static invoices should be aimed for in the donate case. Although partial-payment donations might want the feature, Rusty believes that it is marginal.</summary>
