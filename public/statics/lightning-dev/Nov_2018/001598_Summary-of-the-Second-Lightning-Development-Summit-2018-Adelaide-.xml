    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of the made-up word 'wumbo' and whether it should follow typical grammar rules or have its own grammar. The question arises if imposing normal grammar on a made-up word is necessary. The concern is that if we limit ourselves to traditional grammar, it may restrict our ability to define novel grammar for made-up words in the future. However, it is suggested that we should not create our own grammar without ensuring that it is understandable. The conversation appears to be light-hearted, with one participant playfully using incorrect grammar while the other corrects them.</summary>
