    <summary>The email conversation discusses various issues related to payment routing in the Lightning Network. The author mentions that C must ensure that the detour route taken by a payment stays within the fee limit. Even if the detour route charges a fee that is slightly lower than what C would charge, it could still be rational to take that route as there is a chance to earn some fees. However, there is a risk of pushing off a hop packet at the end by inserting a switch-ephemeral-keys hop packet, which C cannot know beforehand. Christian Decker suggests rebalancing the D-&gt;C-&gt;A cycle so that the CD link can pass the payment through, which neither earns nor loses money for C. This technique also increases the anonymity set of rendezvous routing as a rendezvous supporting node can be used for link-level payment rerouting.</summary>
