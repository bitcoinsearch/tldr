    <summary>The Lightning Specification 1.1 was recently kicked off by the 18 most active spec contributors who met in Adelaide. This meeting resulted in 30 accepted changes for the next version, including multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations and many gossip improvements. Wumbo is the study of all things wumbological, which is a term used to mean "maxi" or removing the channel capacity limit. Hidden destinations refer to rendezvous routing, as explained in the Rendez-vous Routing thread by CJP on the list and the discussion on thread "Link-level payment splitting via intermediary rendezvous nodes" on the list. The work points have been transferred to the Wiki where further discussion can take place.</summary>
