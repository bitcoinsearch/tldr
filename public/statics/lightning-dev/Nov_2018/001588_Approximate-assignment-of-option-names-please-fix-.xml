    <summary>In a conversation between Pierre and Rusty, they discuss the concept of feature masks in relation to local and global features. Rusty explains that the theory behind distinguishing local and global features is that local features only affect the protocol between direct peers, whereas global features can affect HTLCs and are therefore advertised to other nodes. However, Pierre challenges this definition, stating that he would want to advertise his support for a local feature such as option_data_loss_protect. Rusty originally thought that local features would become ubiquitous over time, making it unnecessary to pre-filter by them. He poses two questions: whether people want to pre-filter by local features, and if so, whether only some or all local features should be made global.</summary>
