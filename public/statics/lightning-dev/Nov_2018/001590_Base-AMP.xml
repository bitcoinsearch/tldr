    <summary>In a proposal shared on Lightning-dev, ZmnSCPxj suggests a new method to support Base AMP. However, Rusty Russell argues that the complexity of this proposal outweighs its benefits for now. Instead, he suggests sticking with BOLT #4 which defines the per hop data structure for payments. He proposes defining bit 0 of `flags` as `incomplete_payment` in BOLT #4 and allowing it only for final nodes who put it in their BOLT11 field. BOLT #11 is also updated to include a variable `data_length` for features supported for receiving payments and specifies that unknown odd bits set in the `9` field should be ignored by the payer. Additionally, writers are encouraged to use the minimum possible `data_length` for fields `x`, `c`, and `9`, and omit them entirely if possible.</summary>
