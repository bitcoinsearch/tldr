    <summary>The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It aims to solve the scalability issues that Bitcoin faces by allowing faster and cheaper transactions. However, it has been noted that the Lightning Network is at risk of being split into a compliant and non-compliant part, which could lead to centralization.To address this issue, several proposals have been made, including private channels and rendezvous routing. Private channels, while they can provide some level of privacy, are not ideal solutions as they can result in penalties and do not offer complete anonymity. Rendezvous routing, on the other hand, allows payees to choose routes from third-party nodes without revealing their identity.BOLT 4, a proposed update to the Lightning Network protocol, assumes source routing is done, but rendezvous routing may allow the blinding key to be provided while hiding everything beyond the first hop on the destination half of the route. In a conversation between CJP and Rusty Russell about rendezvous routing, Rusty suggested a "merchant forward" service where Alice can remain anonymous by using Bob's node as a forwarding service.However, CJP expressed concerns about the risks Bob might face by providing such a service. Rusty also provided a hint on how Alice can sign an invoice with pubkey=Bob and short_channel_id=BobAliceSCID. This arrangement is not visible to the payer and appears as if Alice has a private channel with Bob. Still, it highlights the need for a separate invoice key in the future.</summary>
