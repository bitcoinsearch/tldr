    <summary>ZmnSCPxj discusses the mechanism of generating a `payment_hash` from random data and sending it to the payee, who cannot claim the funds as they do not know the preimage. He proposes using this mechanism to stream invoices instead of anime. ZmnSCPxj explains that the payer generates a random hash and the error response contains the "real" BOLT11 invoice, plus some extra data. He also proposes adding separate BOLT15 offers that let users get any number of BOLT11 invoices. ZmnSCPxj also suggests including a connection-oriented communication layer on top of the current protocol to allow for more efficient payment communication. This was the reason for pushing for HORNET implementation on Lightning, which is essentially a proposed connection communication layer with improved privacy. However, ZmnSCPxj believes that payments or forwarding fees should be attached to each such message due to concerns over abuse of network capacity.</summary>
