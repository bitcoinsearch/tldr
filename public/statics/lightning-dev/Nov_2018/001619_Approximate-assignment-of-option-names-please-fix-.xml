    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a member named Laolu corrected an earlier statement that OG AMP payments cannot be accompanied by an invoice. He explained that an invoice can be used with AMP as is, to tag a payment. For instance, if one wanted to deposit funds into an exchange, they could get an invoice from the exchange which includes a new field indicating that they accept AMP payments, along with an 8-byte identifier. Each of the payment shards sent to the exchange would carry this identifier, signalling to them to credit the account once all payments arrive. This approach can be generalized for any case where a service or good is to be dispensed upon receipt of payment. Meanwhile, another member named ZmnSCPxj suggested tying spontaneous payments to OG AMP and making it a global feature, but also questioned merging `option_switch_ephkey` and `option_og_amp` into `option_extra_onion_packet_types`. Rusty Russell proposed assigning bit numbers to the options and asked members to edit their bits as appropriate.</summary>
