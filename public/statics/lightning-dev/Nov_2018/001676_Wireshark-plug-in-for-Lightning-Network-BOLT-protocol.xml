    <summary>The Nayuta team has developed a Wireshark plug-in for the Lightning Network (BOLT) protocol. The software can decode some BOLT messages and currently works for Nayuta's implementation (ptarmigan) and Éclair. When ptarmigan is compiled with certain options, it writes out a key information file that the Wireshark plug-in can use to decode packets. With Éclair, the software parses a log file. The team proposes that every implementation has a compile option that enables outputting a key information file. Interoperability testing is a time-consuming task, and if people can see communication logs of BOLT message on the same format (.pcap), it will be useful for interoperability testing. On the Lightning-dev mailing list, Christian Decker asked if it would be possible to query a command line program or a JSON-RPC call to get the secret. The secret could then be added to the `listpeers` output. Tock203 replied that they had implemented a scheme that lightning-dissector already supports key rotation. Key rotation occurs whenever nonce equals zero, and the lightning node software writes 16byteMAC and key of "first BOLT packet". Whenever a .pcap message starts with a message whose nonce is not equal to zero, the messages cannot be decrypted until the next key rotation.</summary>
