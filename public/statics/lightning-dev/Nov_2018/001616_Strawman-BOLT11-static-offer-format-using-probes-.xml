    <summary>In a recent email exchange, ZmnSCPxj acknowledged that he had overestimated the power of Scriptless Scripts before the summit and thus deferred discussing it. However, he now recognizes that SS is indeed powerful, albeit difficult to implement without Schnorr. This difficulty arises due to script magic with `OP_CODESEPARATOR`, which led to the idea of waiting for Schnorr instead. In response to a query about static invoices, ZmnSCPxj clarified that there are no static invoices for proof-of-payment. Initially, he hoped that static invoicing would be possible without an extra interaction, but this was not feasible. The payee needs to dynamically provide a new payment hash or payment point under SS as our proof-of-payment entails the payer learning a secret. If we want the static invoice to be sharable among multiple payers, we cannot commit to a fixed secret. Thus, the payee generates new secrets each time they want to get paid and provides a unique secret to each payer as separate proof-of-payment.</summary>
