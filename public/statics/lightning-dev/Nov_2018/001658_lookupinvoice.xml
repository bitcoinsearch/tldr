    <summary>Sarat G, who has been working on the LN repo, is looking for a way for a payee to lookup the invoice they receive, similar to the 'lookupinvoice' command provided by lnd (Golang). Sarat's problem is that there is a hub where players make payments of different amounts, and the hub node needs to keep track of which player paid which invoice. Sarat is seeking assistance in finding a combination of commands that can help with this task.</summary>
