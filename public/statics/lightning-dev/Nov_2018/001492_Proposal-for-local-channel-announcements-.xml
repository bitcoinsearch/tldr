    <summary>A proposal by Rusty Russell suggests creating "local" channel announcements in order to increase deniability of payments. Currently, nodes with only private channels lose deniability of payments as unannounced channels reveal the sender. The proposed mechanism would allow a public node to suggest a fake short channel id unique to it. If the private node wants to use this id for the channel announcement, it replies with a signature on the `local_channel_announcement` message using its chosen key. This creates a `local_channel_announcement`, which is generated by the public node and sent to its peers. They MAY treat it as a valid `channel_announcement`, but SHOULD NOT propagate it. `Channel_update` works as before, with a similar non-propagation rule.</summary>
