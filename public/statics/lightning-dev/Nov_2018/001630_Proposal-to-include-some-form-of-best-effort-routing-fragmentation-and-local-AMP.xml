    <summary>In a Lightning-dev email thread, Ren√© Pickhardt proposed the implementation of a second routing algorithm to improve payment reliability and mitigate slow payments or failures. The proposal involves local payment fragmentation, also known as local AMP, which would allow intermediate nodes to fragment an HTLC and find alternative paths to forward a payment. One suggested strategy is to use friend-of-a-friend information to determine if the original HTLC can be forwarded from Alice to Bob in a fragmented way. This approach could benefit from the autopilot, which creates many triangles in the network for friend-of-a-friend nodes to exist. The sender can still select the basic route, and the full route remains private. Another solution suggested was for two nodes that fail to forward the HTLCs to work collaboratively to find a path between them and return this information as a routing suggestion to the payer. To improve payment reliability further, ZmnSCPxj suggested using active probing and ping before commitment. Ping before commit reduces the window for stuck payments by pinging the next node before offering an HTLC, allowing us to figure out if the connection dropped before sending the HTLC.</summary>
