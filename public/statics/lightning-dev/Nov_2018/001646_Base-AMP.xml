    <summary>The discussion on changes to BOLT11 continues in the mailing list of Lightning-dev. One participant suggests restricting the changes by having the receiver assume NAMP for incoming payments. Another participant responds to a previous comment regarding not playing with the `amount_to_forward` field, stating that it can be retained for its previous use. The participant proposes rewriting the current pre-AMP spec and provides details on the `amt_to_forward` and `amt_to_pay` fields for non-final and final nodes. For Base AMP, the `amt_to_pay` field is explained for final nodes, including scenarios when the `incomplete_payment` flag is set. The participant suggests using two fields for AMP instead of one, which could spark further discussion.</summary>
