    <summary>On November 21, 2018, Rusty Russell shared that he was implementing a feerate of 253 satoshis per 1,000 weight to see what he had missed. This fee is just over Bitcoin Core's default minimum relay fee of 0.00001000 BTC/vByte. However, if BIP133 feefilters are increased by any amount and mempools fill up again, nodes will no longer relay transactions with minimum feerates. This raises concerns about how the commitment transaction gets relayed in order for its `to_*_pushme` outputs to be spent for CPFP fee bumping. There is currently some text in the PR about using sighash_single|sighash_anyonecanpay for use with RBF, but this may not apply to spending the commitment transaction as it would allow theft of its value. Additionally, it is unclear whether Bitcoin Core currently relays transaction packages consisting of parents below the relay fee limit and children sufficiently above the limit to pay for their parents. This feature has been discussed, so it may be available in the future.</summary>
