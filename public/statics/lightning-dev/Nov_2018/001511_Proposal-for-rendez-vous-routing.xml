    <summary>In this email exchange, Rusty Russell is responding to CJP's suggestion of using blinding keys in rendezvous routing instead of source routing. Rusty presents a "merchant forward" service design where Alice can remain anonymous from the lightning network by using Bob's forwarding service. Alice pays Bob and gives him a path to her node via a short-channel-id and privkey. Bob then issues an invoice using Alice's identity, and when payment arrives at Bob's node, he creates a new HTLC to pay Alice. The payer doesn't know about this arrangement between Alice and Bob. ZmnSCPxj disagrees with the use of rendezvous routing in this scenario since Bob knows about Alice and can always route payments through her. Instead, ZmnSCPxj suggests that Alice provides a route from another node to her node as an encrypted onion to maintain anonymity.</summary>
