    <title>Proposal for updateable / revokable proofs of payment</title>

    <summary>The sender of the email thinks that most of their proposal can be achieved by writing things in human-readable form in the description field, as this would put things into a machine-readable form and aid automated processing and a better UI experience. The one thing their proposal does that is non-trivial is the inclusion of a payer pubkey in the original invoice, which has benefits such as turning a "proof-that-someone-paid" into a "proof-that-I-paid", and making it clear who is authorized to issue another invoice that says "this original invoice is nullified". They note that requiring two signatures (payer and payee) on each update is more generic than allowing one party to unilaterally nullify an old contract, and allows for obligations on both parties. They suggest that allowing more than two parties could be possible in more complex business arrangements but should be tackled later.</summary>
