    <title>Splicing Proposal: Now with RBF</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses various aspects related to the 'splice_confirm' function in Lightning Network. It is suggested that the 'signature' field may not be required as signatures for inputs can be provided through witness stack. The sender must ensure sufficient funds post-splice above its reserve to pay for the splice transaction at the new feerate. Splicing is risky as it may lead to channel closure due to extenuating circumstances like a fee spike. During splicing, each commitment transaction needs to be duplicated for every splice transaction. It is questioned whether HTLCs are to be duplicated as well and if CPFP could be used instead of RBF. It is suggested to move towards using TLV.</summary>
