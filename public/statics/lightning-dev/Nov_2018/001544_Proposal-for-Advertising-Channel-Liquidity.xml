    <summary>In a discussion about node announcements on the Lightning Network, Olaoluwa Osuntokun mentions that most implementations currently ignore node announcements from nodes that do not have any channels. This is done to maintain a small routing set and avoid "zombies." However, in order for node announcements to propagate globally, this behavior would need to be undone at a global scale. Another participant in the discussion, with the username "aj," questions the usefulness of having incoming capacity from a random node with no other channels. It is noted that such capacity would not be useful for nodes that do not have incoming capacity of their own.</summary>
