    <summary>In a message to Rusty, ZmnSCPxj has suggested that `amt_to_forward` is not being played with as it retains its previous use. The pre-AMP specification states that for non-final nodes, `amt_to_forward` is the value to forward to the next node and that incoming_htlc_amt - fee &gt;= amt_to_forward should be checked. For final nodes, `amt_to_pay` is the value intended to reach it and incoming_htlc_amt &gt;= amt_to_pay must be checked. In Base AMP, if incomplete_payment flag is not set, final nodes must check incoming_htlc_amt &gt;= amt_to_pay. If incomplete_payment flag is set, final nodes must claim HTLCs only if sum(incoming_htlc_amt) &gt;= amt_to_pay where sum(incoming_htlc_amt) is the total incoming_htlc_amt for all incoming HTLCs terminating at this final node with the same payment_hash. ZmnSCPxj suggests that perhaps two fields, `amt_to_pay_for_this_partial_payment` and `amt_to_pay_for_total_payment`, should be used instead for AMP.</summary>
