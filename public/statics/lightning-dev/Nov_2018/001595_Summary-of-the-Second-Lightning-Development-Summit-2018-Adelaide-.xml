    <summary>A group of Lightning implementers met in Milan two years ago to start the Lightning Specification 1.0 and last week, the 18 most active spec contributors gathered in Adelaide to kick off version 1.1. After two days, they emerged with 30 accepted changes for the next version, many detailed and some requiring further on-list refinement. The highlights include multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and many gossip improvements. The work points have been transferred to the Wiki and interested people can join in the continuing discussion. In a response email, Cezary Dziemian expressed excitement about dual-funded channels but was unsure about "Wumbo" and "hidden destinations", requesting Rusty Russell to explain or provide links.</summary>
