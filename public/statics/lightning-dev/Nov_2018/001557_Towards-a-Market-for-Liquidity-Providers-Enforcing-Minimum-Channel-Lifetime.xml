    <summary>In a conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Pierre, they discuss the possibility of adding an additional CLTV constraint to determine the minimum channel lifetime after Symmetric CSV. However, Pierre raises a concern that parties have to exchange the first commitment txes before the funding tx is even published. As a result, the absolute CLTV delay wouldn't really constrain the duration of the channel because the timer starts running before the channel is created. They end the conversation with Pierre asking if ZmnSCPxj thinks this matters.</summary>
