    <summary>In a post on Lightning-dev, Corn√© Plooy suggests that the global/local distinction in routing might not be necessary as current features don't seem to require it. However, such distinctions are important for compulsory features. For instance, if c-lightning made option_simplified_commitment compulsory in version 13.0, it would prevent nodes from routing through the software which is a lie. To avoid this issue, Rusty suggests that users should not set compulsory feature bits in their node_announcements unless they want to stop routing. Therefore, while there may not be a bitmap distinction between local and global feature bits, there still exists a mental distinction.</summary>
