    <summary>In this discussion, List is proposing a PR for BOLT04 and BOLT11 for Base AMP. The proposal involves verifying and clarifying a few aspects of the payment protocol. The receiving node signals support for Base AMP by setting a "mode of operation or option" bit in the BOLT11 string and the sending node signals a multipath payment by setting a feature bit and using the same `amount to forward` value in the last hop of the onion for all paths. Senders must not create paths that would have to be merged by intermediary nodes since an incomplete payment can only be signaled for final nodes. An algorithm for executing a multipath payment for the sending node is proposed, but it may not work well with some tests and issues like fees becoming a problem.</summary>
