    <summary>Two years ago, a group of Lightning implementers gathered in Milan to start the Lightning Specification 1.0. Recently, the 18 most active spec contributors met in Adelaide to kick off version 1.1. After two days of discussion, 30 changes were accepted for the next version, including multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and many gossip improvements. These changes are now available for further refinement on the Wiki. The contributors worked hard to address some difficult questions and their expertise was greatly appreciated. A group photo was taken to commemorate the event.</summary>
