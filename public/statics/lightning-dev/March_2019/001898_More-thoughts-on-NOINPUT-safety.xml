    <summary>In this email exchange, the writer is seeking clarification on whether Taproot can be used in conjunction with output tagging. They had previously assumed that output tagging would conflict with Taproot, but are open to being corrected. The writer also mentions the need to allow for NOINPUT sigs when using scriptless scripts for HTLCs, and notes that bilateral/cooperative close is not allowed when an HTLC is in-flight. However, they realize that a non-cheating unilateral close does not require NOINPUT. Overall, the email seeks to clarify technical details related to Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
