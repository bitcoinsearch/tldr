    <summary>Anthony Towns proposed the idea of "taproot plus" outputs, which would allow users to include noinput signatures in addition to normal taproot address features. The examples provided show the different types of transactions that can be made with tagged outputs, including cooperative claims and settlements. However, a question arose about how to bind update 3 to the funding tx output when it is not tagged. One suggestion was to keep each update in multiple separate states, one bound to the funding tx output and another signed with noinput. But this would double storage and communication requirements. An alternative is adding a trigger transaction for unilateral cases, but that would increase on-chain footprint.</summary>
