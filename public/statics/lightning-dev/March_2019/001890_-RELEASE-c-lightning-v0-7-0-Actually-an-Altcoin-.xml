    <summary>The c-lightning team has released version 0.7, which includes several new features and bug fixes. The release introduces plugins with frameworks for C, Python, and Go, allowing users to write their own extensions. A pay implementation plugin is also included, following route hints and giving ongoing pay status. All amount parameters now accept 'msat', 'sat', or 'btc' to avoid confusion. Fixes include issues with gossipd consuming 100% of CPU memory and several other crashes. Reproducible builds for Ubuntu have been added, based on Ubuntu 18.04.1. For the network, option_dataloss_protect has been fixed and re-enabled for everyone, while some known lnd protocol oddities are accepted rather than closing the channel. Unpayable "wumbo" invoices can no longer be made. Details can be found in the changelog.</summary>
