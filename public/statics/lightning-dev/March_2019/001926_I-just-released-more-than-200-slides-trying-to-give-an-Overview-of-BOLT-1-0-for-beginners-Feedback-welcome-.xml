    <summary>Rene Pickhardt, a mathematician interested in the Lightning Network Protocol, has released an open-source slide presentation on the protocol and BOLT 1.0. He decided to share his slides with the community after holding a four-hour workshop giving an extensive overview of the network and BOLT 1.0. The slides are designed for newbies who found reading the BOLTs difficult like he did initially. The presentation is available in PDF form on Wikimedia Commons, and users can fork the Google Docs version to suggest improvements. Pickhardt hopes to receive feedback before presenting the slides at Chaincode Labs' Lightning residency in late June.</summary>
