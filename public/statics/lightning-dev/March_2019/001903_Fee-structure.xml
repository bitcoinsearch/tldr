    <summary>In a conversation between John-John and ZmnSCPxj, the former asks about the size of payments and its relation to fees. ZmnSCPxj clarifies that the fee paid is proportional to the size of the payment being forwarded. This means that a larger payment passing through a channel will result in a greater fee paid. ZmnSCPxj also mentions that assuming the current balance on the channel is perfect, a large payment would need to be significantly greater than the channel capacity in order to upset the balance. Therefore, the proportional fee paid does consider the size of the payment being made.</summary>
