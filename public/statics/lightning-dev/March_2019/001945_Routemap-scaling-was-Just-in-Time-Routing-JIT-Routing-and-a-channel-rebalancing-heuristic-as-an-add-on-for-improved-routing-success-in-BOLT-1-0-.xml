    <summary>The conversation revolves around the discussion of non-existent channels being spammed on the network and the importance of keeping channels with large capacity in the routemap. An idea is proposed to delete channels with low capacity when the routemap memory is becoming full, but concerns are raised about the potential for nodes to game the heuristic and neglect low capacity but reliable channels. The suggestion is made to replace "aggregate-channel" with "high-capacity-channel" as it would still work effectively. Nodes need to track direct channels, and payee nodes can provide routes in invoices from nodes with high-capacity channels to ensure payments can be made even if intermediate channels are pruned due to low capacity. The need for someone with complete knowledge of the network is also mentioned.</summary>
