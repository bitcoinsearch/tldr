    <summary>The conversation starts with the forking of a thread as a reply was not related to JIT-Routing. The discussion then moves on to the topic of nonexistent channels and their impact on network security, which can be spammable and waste network bandwidth. The idea of blind routing is discussed, but it is not favored due to fee calculations being complete guesses. A good pruning heuristic for the routemap is suggested, which is based on channel capacity, where low-capacity channels are deleted when the memory becomes full, while high-capacity channels are kept because they are more likely to successfully route a payment. However, gaming of such heuristics can occur, and low-capacity but reliable channels may be neglected. The conversation then moves on to the possibility of using high-capacity channels in JIT-Routing, where intermediate nodes can use other lower-capacity channels to improve the directionality of high-capacity channels if needed. Direct channels still need to be tracked, but payee nodes can provide `r` routes in BOLT1 invoices from nodes with high-capacity channels, so even if intermediate channels are pruned due to low capacity, it is possible to get paid. The importance of low-capacity channels for spontaneous payments is highlighted, and it is suggested that someone with complete knowledge of the network needs to be employed at some point.</summary>
