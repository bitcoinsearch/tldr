    <summary>The Linux Foundation, which hosts the Lightning-dev mailing list, is migrating its lists to groups.io due to the deprecation of their mailing list infrastructure. Rusty Russell, a member of the Lightning Network development team, expects this list to follow suit within a week and has asked subscribers who wish to unsubscribe to do so before then. ZmnSCPxj, another subscriber, inquired if they need to take any action to remain on the list, to which Rusty replied that as long as they don't unsubscribe, they shouldn't notice any changes.</summary>
