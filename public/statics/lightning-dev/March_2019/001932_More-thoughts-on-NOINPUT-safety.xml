    <summary>The email conversation discusses the usage of codeseparator and OP_CSV in settlement transactions. It is suggested that a settlement signature can only take the settlement branch by having a distinct public key for the branch. This would require `A_s` and `B_s` without rolling them for each `i`. The use of `OP_CSV` in the settlement branch of the update transaction outputs allows later update transactions to have higher priority over settlement transactions. It is noted that using codeseparator is not necessary and `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` can be used instead. Additionally, there is a need for some flag that allows committing to scriptcode even when not committing to input tx or scriptpubkey.</summary>
