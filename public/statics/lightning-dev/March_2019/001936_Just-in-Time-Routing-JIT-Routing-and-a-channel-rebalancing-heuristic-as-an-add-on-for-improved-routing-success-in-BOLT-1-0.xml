    <summary>ZmnSCPxj discusses the concept of JIT-Routing in unidirectional channels, specifically in the context of Eclair Mobile. Unidirectional-only nodes in Eclair Mobile cannot forward or be intermediate nodes, but they can still be used as the ultimate source of payment. The original formulation of JIT-Routing, which requires a separate completed rebalance before performing a payment, cannot be used in unidirectional mode since it requires the channel to be boosted by the rebalance, which is disallowed in unidirectional mode. However, the Luaces-Pickhardt JIT-Routing which has a conditional rebalance does not require that the channel receives, and so it appears that it can work with Eclair. ZmnSCPxj then goes on to provide an example sequence of events where an Eclair Mobile client creates a 1mBTC channel and makes successful and unsuccessful payments of 0.5 mBTC and 0.6 mBTC respectively. He explains that the new Luaces-Pickhardt formulation of JIT-Routing should be safe for unidirectional Eclair Mobile nodes and even if the payment fails, it would not pose any significant problems. Thus, the Luaces-Pickhardt JIT-Routing could be a plausible replacement for all forms of multipart payments.</summary>
