    <summary>The Linux Foundation, which is currently hosting the mailing list infrastructure, has decided to deprecate their services. They have stated that mailman2 is unmaintained and v3 is a mess, leading them to migrate lists to groups.io. According to Rusty, this is the direction that bitcoin-dev is heading in. Unless any objections are raised, Rusty expects this list to follow suit within a week. If anyone wishes to unsubscribe before then, he advises doing so immediately.</summary>
