    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a user mentioned a potential conflict between output tagging and Taproot. Another user responded that they view tagged outputs as "taproot plus," which would allow for normal taproot functions as well as noinput signatures. They provided examples of different funding transactions and settlement scenarios that could utilize this feature. In cases where unilateral closes are possible, all update transactions must be tagged to allow for noinput signatures, which could affect privacy. The discussion also touched on the use of scriptless scripts for handling HTLCs and the need for multiple signatures in active channels.</summary>
