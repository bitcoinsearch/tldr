    <summary>On March 16, 2019 Rusty Russell announced that Linux Foundation is deprecating their mailing list infrastructure and migrating lists to groups.io. Lightning-dev mailing list was also expected to follow within a week. The migration was automatic as long as users did not unsubscribe. ZmnSCPxj inquired if there was anything he needed to do to remain on the lightning-dev list. Rusty reassured him that no action was required.</summary>
