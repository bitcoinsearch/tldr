    <summary>On March 16, 2019, Rusty Russell announced that Linux Foundation is deprecating their mailing list infrastructure and migrating lists to groups.io, including the Lightning-dev mailing list. Rusty expects this list to follow suit within a week unless people raise concerns. The migration was automatic as long as users did not unsubscribe. ZmnSCPxj inquired if there was anything he needed to do to remain on the lightning-dev list, to which Rusty replied that no action was required.The reason behind this move is due to mailman2 being unmaintained and v3 being messy, according to the Linux Foundation who hosts the list. Following bitcoin-dev's direction, Rusty stated that this is the direction that Lightning-dev is heading in. Anyone who wishes to unsubscribe can do so before then. However, Rusty has asked subscribers who wish to remain on the list to simply stay subscribed without any action.</summary>
