    <summary>In a recent conversation, it was discussed that maximizing privacy in the Lightning Network has the disadvantage of requiring a new signature for every in-flight HTLC each time the state is updated. This could result in a lot of signatures for highly active channels. However, this is already true for current Poon-Dryja channels in BOLT 1.0, so it does not degrade performance. This modified form of Decker-Russell-Osuntokun may be less attractive for use with DLC as Fulgurite effort would like, but the Fulgurite effort has already mitigated this by splitting a channel into two sub-channels for high-activity LN payments and rare-activity DLC bets.</summary>
