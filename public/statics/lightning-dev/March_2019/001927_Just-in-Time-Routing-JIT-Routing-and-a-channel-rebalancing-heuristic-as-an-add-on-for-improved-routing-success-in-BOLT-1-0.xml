    <summary>The author discusses the concept of JIT-Routing and its extension proposed by Rene based on the idea of Ariel. The use of the same payment hash creates a "local bass amplifier" multipath payment. The author suggests considering the possibility of multiple HTLCs for nodes who may not have enough liquidity in a single channel to fulfill the forward. The implementation-wise approach includes associating an outgoing HTLC with multiple incoming HTLCs, deleting an outgoing HTLC, and re-associating all its associated incoming HTLCs. The author then discusses the need for JIT-Routing for multipart payments that succeed without much coordination at the source and how it could synergize well with bass amplifier and AMP. The author proposes overpaying fees at each intermediate node to help JIT-Routing. Finally, the author suggests that widespread JIT-Routing support makes multipart payment support unnecessary. It provides benefits such as local payment splitting, which removes the need for a higher-level payment-splitting mechanism.</summary>
