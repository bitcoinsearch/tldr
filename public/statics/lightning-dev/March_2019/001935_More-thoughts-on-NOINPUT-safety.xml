    <summary>The conversation is about the use of OP_CSV in the settlement branch. ZmnSCPxj expresses concern over the lack of OP_CSV in the settlement branch and suggests enforcing relative timelock by setting timelocks on update txs and absolute or relative timelocks on settlement txs. Anthony Towns, however, argues that relative timelock can be enforced in the settlement branch simply by refusing to sign a settlement tx without the timelock set. This is because nsequence was set as per BIP-68 when settlement-1 was signed, and NOINPUT sigs commit to nsequence. Therefore, if anyone tries to change nsequence after the fact, the sig isn't valid. Finally, aj confirms that update-1 isn't immediately spendable by settlement-1 due to the enforcement of BIP-68 by consensus.</summary>
