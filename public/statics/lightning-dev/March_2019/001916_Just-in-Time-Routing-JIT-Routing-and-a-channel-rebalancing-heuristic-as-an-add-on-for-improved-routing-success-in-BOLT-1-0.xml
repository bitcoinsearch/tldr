    <summary>The email thread discussed Just-In-Time (JIT) routing, a process used in the Lightning Network protocol to optimize payment forwarding. One participant responded to concerns raised by others regarding introducing a `success_rate` for JIT routing in the protocol specifications. They advised against it as it is not the protocol specifications that run on the network but actual implementations. Additionally, node operators may be willing to pay a fee for rebalancing even if there is no outstanding routing event taking place. The participant also addressed the issue of reusing payment hashes with JIT Routing. While this produces technical issues, they believe these can be mitigated and could result in situations where the entire payment was routed successfully. However, using the same payment hash for JIT routing results in a deadlock problem due to two HTLCs in opposing directions on the same channel. This problem can be fixed with a MUST-rule to discard old HTLCs and create new ones.Furthermore, the participant suggested that rebalancing amounts must not exceed the original payment amount if the payment hash is being reused. Otherwise, the preimage could be released before setting up the final HTLC to fulfill the rebalancing request. Finally, they noted that invoices with no particular amount pose a risk as recipients might assume any offered value is correct and grab the value without completing the payment process.In addition to this discussion, the context provided mentions a loss of lnd, which could refer to Lightning Network Daemon, a software implementation of the Lightning Network protocol. The speaker notes that forwarding payments through lnd would result in a smaller rebalance value compared to forwarding payments through c-lightning, another Lightning Network implementation. The speaker then notes that they are both c-lightning developers and may have expertise in optimizing payment forwarding to avoid any losses.</summary>
