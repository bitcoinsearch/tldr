    <title>[META] Mailing list move</title>
    <updated>2023-06-02T18:01:15.958156+00:00</updated>

    <summary>One of the members of Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj, asked if there is anything that needs to be done in order to remain on the list as it moves to groups.io. Linux Foundation, who hosts the list, has decided to deprecate their mailing list infrastructure and migrate lists to groups.io due to mailman2 being unmaintained and v3 being messy. Bitcoin-dev is also reportedly moving in this direction. Rusty Russell, the sender of the original message, expects this list to follow within the week unless people raise concerns. Those who wish to unsubscribe before then are free to do so.</summary>
