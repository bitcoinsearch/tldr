    <summary>The context of the conversation revolves around a problem called "failed HTLCs are free and HODL invoices are free" which is magnified because most cryptocurrency assets are very volatile, exchange rate changes can be exploited to leak economic power from exchange nodes. The discussion suggests that fixing the "free HOLD invoices" problem by creating a palatable upfront payment scheme should also fix the American Call Option problem. However, if an upfront payment scheme cannot be created and the "free HODL invoices" problem needs to be solved by other means, then the American Call Option problem may need to be solved separately. The email link provided in the conversation sheds light on this issue, and Suredbits blog explains related things as well.</summary>
