    <summary>The Bitcoin Core dust limit has been a topic of active discussion on the mailing list since August 2021. The dust limit is determined arbitrarily by each node, making it unreliable for security purposes. Relying on it as a default value is a security vulnerability in itself. Unfortunately, an increasing number of funds are being secured based on assumptions about mempool behavior, which may increase with the growth of Lightning and deployment of other L2s. It has been suggested to dry-up some policy rules in consensus like the dust limit to address this issue. Additionally, there is a need to update the CVEs wiki page for Bitcoin Core.</summary>
