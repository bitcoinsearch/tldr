    <summary>The discussion revolves around the definition of Bitcoin's base-layer security and the strength of its assumptions. The conversation also touches upon the adoption of policies that could restrict transaction relays, making the network unusable. The dust limit, which is arbitrary for each node, cannot be relied on for security, and an increasing number of funds are secured by assumptions around mempool behavior. This trend is expected to increase with the growth of Lightning Network and other L2 solutions. However, building L2s on flawed assumptions is not recommended. While some propose to dry-up policy rules in consensus like the dust limit, others are skeptical as policies can always be set higher than any consensus rule. The economic compatibility of policies should be considered, and economically rational node operators should follow them.</summary>
