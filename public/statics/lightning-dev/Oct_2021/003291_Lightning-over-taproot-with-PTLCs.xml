    <summary>In an email sent on October 11th, Lloyd Fournier suggested adjusting the protocol so that in-flight transactions are reciprocated. The proposal would allow for the forwarding of a HTLC before lazily sending the signature for the in-flight transaction. This would eliminate the need to wait for the HTLC to be added to the blockchain and prevent early channel closures. However, Fournier later retracted this suggestion due to the possibility of stale in-flight transactions. The email also mentions the challenges associated with eltoo and achieving similar results with honest parties.</summary>
