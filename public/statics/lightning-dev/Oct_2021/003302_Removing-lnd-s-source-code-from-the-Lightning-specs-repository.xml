    <title>Removing lnd's source code from the Lightning specs repository</title>

    <summary>A proposal has been made to move Lightning Network Daemon (lnd)'s source code from the lightningnetwork GitHub organization (org) to a new one, such as lightninglabs. This is due to the confusion caused by mixing an open-source protocol's specifications and white paper with the source code for one of its implementations. The recent report by Arcane Research on the state of the Lightning Network incorrectly referred to lnd as the reference client for the network. It was suggested that moving lnd's source code would help alleviate this confusion. The lightningnetwork org was originally created by Joseph, with the lightningnetwork/paper repo added, followed by the lightningnetwork/lnd repo. During a meeting in Milan, it was decided to converge on a single specification, which led to the addition of the BOLTs to the same repo. A new lightninglabs org was created to keep lnd distinct from any future commercial products/services. The proposal suggests moving the spec to an independent repo owned by the community, potentially called "lightning-specs," and having it be the home for any other community-backed/owned projects. Laolu Osuntokun offered to donate github.com/lightning to the community. Nifty expressed support for the idea of moving the specs to a new org due to difficulties with ownership in the existing org. Fabrice Drouin thanked Laolu for offering to donate the GitHub organization and strongly supported the proposal.</summary>
