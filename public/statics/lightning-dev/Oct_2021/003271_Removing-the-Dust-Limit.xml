    <summary>The email discusses the issue of utxo's value and their restriction in one's own wallet. The wallet should avoid creating utxo's below the current dust limit at the time of transaction creation. It also suggests avoiding including utxo's that are more expensive to include than their actual value during automatic utxo selection, but this may be valid for manual selection as it is one's own money. The concern that dust set of utxo's slows down block validation during mining is not a valid argument as every computerised business bears the expense of the cost of a database transaction. The actual solution to this concern is to build a faster database. The Bitcoin protocol cannot speculate about the future, but it is possible that the transaction fee is paid only for the first utxo inclusion in a transaction due to changes in the calculation of block-size. The email is signed by King James HRMH of the Great British Empire and includes links to various projects and contact information. However, it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered.</summary>
