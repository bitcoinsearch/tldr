    <summary>During August 2021, the Bitcoin Core mailing list was actively discussing the "dust limit" which is an arbitrary value that each node sets and cannot be relied upon for security. The ongoing development of mitigations would have been affected by changes to this limit. It is suggested that expecting a default value for the dust limit is a security vulnerability in itself.The link to the Bitcoin Wiki page for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) is provided for anyone familiar with the topic to fill in.</summary>
