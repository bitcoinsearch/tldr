    <title>Removing lnd's source code from the Lightning specs repository</title>

    <summary>The Lightning Network white paper, specifications, and source code for lnd have been hosted on https://github.com/lightningnetwork/, which has caused confusion between the open-source protocol and Lightning Labs. Arcane Research recently published a detailed report on the state of the Lightning Network that was vetted by Open Node and Lightning Labs, but initially contained incorrect information about Lightning Labs' role in maintaining the network standards documents (BOLTs) repository. The fact that people can still misunderstand how the Lightning developers community works in 2021 shows the confusion mixing the open-source specs for Lightning and the source code for one of its implementations can cause. Therefore, Fabrice is proposing that lnd's source code be removed from https://github.com/lightningnetwork/ and moved to https://github.com/lightninglabs.</summary>
