    <summary>In a recent email exchange between ZmnSCPxj and Matt, the former suggested using two hashes instead of one in HTLCs (hashed time-locked contracts) to enhance security on the Lightning Network. The second hash would be from a preimage generated by the sender and sent encrypted via onion to the receiver. ZmnSCPxj proposed this as an alternative to using PTLCs (probabilistic time-locked contracts), which require every hop along the path to be informed and adapted accordingly. However, both parties agreed that implementing two hashes for every HTLC would also require adaptation by every node in the path, making PTLCs a simpler and more practical solution. Nonetheless, ZmnSCPxj recommended incorporating PTLCs for all payments, suggesting that adding a random nonce * G to the PTLC would further enhance security.</summary>
