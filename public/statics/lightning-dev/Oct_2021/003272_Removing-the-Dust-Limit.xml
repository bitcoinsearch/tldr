    <summary>The email is discussing the handling of 1c and 2c coins in an economy, comparing it to Bitcoin and its denominations. In traditional currency, the solution is to round the value of the transaction per line of goods or per total before calculating the Grand Total. In Bitcoin, however, there is no effective way to round transactions without accepting overpayments as valid. The email suggests that it may be difficult to distribute overpayments where the transaction has multiple outputs. The email then discusses the value of utxo's in one's own wallet, stating that there should be no restriction to their value. The wallet should avoid creating utxo's below the current dust limit at the time the transaction is created but cannot guarantee it. The wallet should also avoid including utxo's that are more expensive to include than their value at the time of the transaction. The email argues that complaining about the dust set of utxo's slowing down the process of block validation during mining is not productive, and that the actual solution to this business concern is to build a faster database. The email concludes by stating that while the Bitcoin protocol cannot speculate on the future, it is conceivable that the inclusion of what is today considered dust may not be ill-considered in the future.</summary>
