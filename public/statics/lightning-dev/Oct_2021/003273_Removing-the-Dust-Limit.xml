    <summary>The email thread concerns the removal of the dust limit in Bitcoin protocol. LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH argues that utxo's that are considered dust should not be prevented from being created, and suggests providing a solution to transfer the value of any dust utxo created in a transaction to the fee. He believes that preventing the creation of dust utxo is equivalent to robbing the future value of the wallet. The discussion also touches upon the handling of 1c and 2c coins in traditional currency, where the denominations available are effectively the utxo set, making it difficult to round the transactions without accepting overpayments as valid. The issue becomes more complicated when the transaction has multiple outputs, and one could argue to distribute the overpayment to all outputs. LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH further emphasizes that there should be no restriction to the value of utxo's that are kept in one's own wallet, and the wallet should avoid creating utxo's below the current dust limit at the time the transaction is created. He also dismisses the idea that the dust set of utxo's slows down the process of block validation during mining, stating that every conceivable computerized business bears the expense of the cost of a database transaction. Finally, he speculates that changes to the calculation of block-size could lead to scenarios where the inclusion of what is today considered dust may not be ill-considered.</summary>
