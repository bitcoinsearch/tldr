    <summary>In an email conversation on October 12, 2021, Martin Habov≈°tiak confirmed that he had successfully moved a repository and all the links continued to work properly. The ease of moving repositories on Github was noted, with issues, pull requests, and stars remaining intact. However, it was mentioned that developers may need to rename packages, which can be a simple process but is sometimes necessary for languages like Java or Scala. Despite the technical simplicity of repository moving, the issue at hand was not related to technology.</summary>
