    <summary>In an email conversation between Owen Gunden and Joost Jager, they discussed a proposal to make probing free but require senders to pay for failed payment attempts. Jager suggested combining both proposals and questioned if this would fix the upfront fees issue. Gunden raised concerns about malicious routing nodes succeeding the probe and failing the payment to collect the failed payment fee. While this could happen occasionally, senders should be suspicious and may want to ban the routing node for a long time if it keeps happening. This could disincentivize the routing node enough to respond honestly to probes.</summary>
