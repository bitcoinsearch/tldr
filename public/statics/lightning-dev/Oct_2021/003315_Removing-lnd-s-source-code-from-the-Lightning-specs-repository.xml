    <summary>In an email discussion about the Lightning Network Github organization, Olaoluwa Osuntokun clarified that lnd has never referred to itself as the "reference" implementation. Though other implementations have adopted this title in the past, they have since adopted softer language. The conversation then shifted towards revisiting the history of the Github organization and how it came into existence. Originally created by Joseph with lightningnetwork/paper repo added, lightningnetwork/lnd was later created where developers began working on an initial implementation before the BOLTs existed in their current form. Eventually, all developers converged on a single specification and added the BOLTs to the same repo, despite it being used for lnd and knowingly so.While discussing the primary grievance regarding collocating an implementation of Lightning along with the specification of the protocol, it was suggested to move the spec to an independent repo owned by the community. Osuntokun offered to donate github.com/lightning to the community, or a new org like "lightning-specs" could be created. Everyone seemed pleased with the idea, including Fabrice, who stated that he likes Damian's idea of using github.com/lightning/bolts. Although it was acknowledged that changing things from the pre-BOLTS era would create some friction, it was still believed that it should be done.</summary>
