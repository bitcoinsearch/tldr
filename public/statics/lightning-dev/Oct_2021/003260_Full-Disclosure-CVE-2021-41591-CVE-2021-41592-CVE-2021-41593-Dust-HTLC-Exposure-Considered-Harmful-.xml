    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Antoine Riard expressed concerns about relying on the "dust limit" as a security measure for Bitcoin transactions. The dust limit is set by each node and refers to the minimum amount of Bitcoin that can be sent in a transaction. Riard argues that this limit is arbitrary and cannot be relied upon for security. He goes on to say that an increasing number of funds are secured by assumptions around mempool behavior, which is not a secure way to handle transactions.Riard also expresses concern about the deployment of Lightning Network and other Layer 2 scaling solutions that may be built on flawed assumptions. He suggests that consensus rules could be put in place to address these issues, but acknowledges that this may not be effective since policies can always be set to a higher dust limit than any consensus rule.Overall, Riard's comments highlight the importance of ensuring that Bitcoin transactions are secure and not relying on flawed assumptions. As Bitcoin continues to grow and evolve, it will be important for developers to address these issues and ensure that the network remains secure and reliable.</summary>
