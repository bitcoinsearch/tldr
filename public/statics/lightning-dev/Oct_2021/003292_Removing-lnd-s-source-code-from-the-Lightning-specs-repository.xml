    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, the possibility of moving a repository was brought up by Andrés G. Aragoneses. Bryan Bishop expressed agreement with the idea, but also raised concerns about broken links. Matt Corallo chimed in, stating that he had moved a repository a few months ago and all links continued to work fine. He also mentioned that the "move repository" feature on GitHub should make all old links auto-redirect. While this information is a few years old, it suggests that broken links may not be a significant concern when moving repositories on GitHub.</summary>
