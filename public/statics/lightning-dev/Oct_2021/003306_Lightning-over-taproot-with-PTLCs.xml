    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal for a new Lightning Network payment channel update mechanism to allow low-latency payments while also ensuring security in case of revoked states. The proposed transaction structure involves a commitment tx with funding inputs and balance outputs, a low-latency inflight tx with Alice's balance as input and (1) or (2) as output, Bob claim with (1) as input and checksigverify checksig ifdup notif csv endif as output, and Too-slow with (2) as input and Alice as output. The proposal involves Bob forwarding the low-latency inflight tx immediately, updating the base channel state with Alice to void the inflight tx, and closing the channel prior to payment-timeout minus payment-recover-delay if Alice is unavailable to confirm the update. In case of revoked states, Alice can claim the funds via the timeout path or Bob claim provided she notices within the channel-recovery-delay. Further discussions involve lifting HTLCs into the commitment tx to allow multiple low-latency payments and going on-chain at T - to_self_delay if necessary.</summary>
