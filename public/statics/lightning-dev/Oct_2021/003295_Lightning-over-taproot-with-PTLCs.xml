    <summary>In an email exchange, Lloyd Fournier suggested that using revocable signatures enables scorched earth punishments. However, ZmnSCPxj proposed a simulation of eltoo's behavior instead, where in the event of an old state being posted, Alice's justice transaction would pay A+P + max(0, B'-B)*0.1 to Alice and B-f - max(0, B'-B)*0.1 to Bob. This strategy is more akin to "two tits for a tat", where one chance is given before someone switches to tit for tat. If this proposal were to become widespread, theft attempts would be costless, but if theft is unlikely enough to succeed, even a costless attempt would still be worthless due to onchain fees.</summary>
