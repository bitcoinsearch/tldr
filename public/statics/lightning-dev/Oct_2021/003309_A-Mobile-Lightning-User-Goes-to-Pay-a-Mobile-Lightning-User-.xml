    <summary>In an email conversation on October 12th, 2021, Andr√©s G. Aragoneses asked Matt to clarify what he meant by a particular paragraph in relation to the use of lightning for tips and accepting payments on mobile devices. Matt responded that the issue is not just limited to users having their phones locked but also arises when they don't have the lightning app open and in the foreground upon receiving a payment. He stated that several lightning apps already attempt to solve this problem with meager CPU time allocated in response to notifications, however, there's no guarantee that even a microsecond of CPU time will be available on both Android and iOS platforms. Furthermore, Matt lamented that relying on users to open the app immediately upon receiving a notification is not an ideal solution, but it seems to be the best option currently available. This approach may not be recommended by UX designers. Therefore, it appears that the challenge is to find a better solution to the problem of how to accept lightning payments on mobile devices without requiring users to keep their lightning app open and in the foreground at all times.</summary>
