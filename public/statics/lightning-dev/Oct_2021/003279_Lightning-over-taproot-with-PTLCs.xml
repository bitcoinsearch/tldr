    <summary>ZmnSCPxj proposes a way to transition from the BOLT#3 format to a new scheme without requiring an onchain transaction. Instead, an existing channel can sign a transitioning transaction and invalidate the last valid commitment transactions in the BOLT3 scheme. The transitioning transaction can be kept offchain, and its output used as the funding outpoint of all "internal" states between the two counterparties directly in the channel. This method is suitable for all transitions from Poon-Dryja, but may be too complicated for transitioning from Decker-Russell-Osuntokun to a hypothetical future offchain updatable cryptocurrency system that does not need or want `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`. This approach has the advantage of maintaining the historical longevity of the channel, which is important for pathfinding and autopilot heuristics that use channel lifetime as a positive indicator of desirability. An onchain transitioning transaction is undesirable since it marks a closure of the previous channel, and the exact scheme of channels between forwarding nodes are not particularly the business of anyone else.</summary>
