    <summary>There is a proposal to remove the source code for Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) from the Github repository of the Lightning Network protocol. The proposal comes after confusion between the open-source protocol and Lightning Labs, one of the companies specifying and implementing this protocol, led to misinformation in a report by Arcane Research. The report inaccurately referred to lnd as the "reference" implementation, prompting the proposal to separate the code from the specification. Additionally, concerns were raised that automations, dependencies, dockerfiles, or direct links to files that rely on the location of the Github repo could be affected by Github redirect. Moving the code to another Github repository, such as lightninglabs, would help clarify the distinction between the code and the specification. The proposal suggests moving the specification to an independent repository owned by the community, potentially creating a new Github organization called "lightning-specs."</summary>
