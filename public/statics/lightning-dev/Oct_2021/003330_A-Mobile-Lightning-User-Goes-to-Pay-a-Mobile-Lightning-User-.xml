    <summary>The Lightning Network community has been discussing proposals to improve payment security without compromising on non-custodial payments. One proposal was to use onion messages and notifications to build a better solution than holding HTLCs at the recipient's LSP. However, it was noted that both senders and recipients need to be online during the payment settlement period, or there is a risk of losing channels. A suggestion was made to have a huge CLTV on that hop, giving the sender a longer time to go online and clear the HTLC before it times out. Another proposal suggested using two hashes instead of one for every HTLC, even in current "online RPi user pays online RPi user" scenarios. This would use the `payment_secret` for the preimage of the second hash, providing similar protection to what `payment_secret` provides. However, it was noted that if every node in the path had to be adapted to handle this, it might be better to simply use PTLCs instead. Overall, the Lightning Network community is actively discussing ways to improve payment security while maintaining non-custodial payments.</summary>
