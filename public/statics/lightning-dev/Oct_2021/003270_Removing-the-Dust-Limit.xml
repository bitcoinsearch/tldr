    <title>Removing the Dust Limit</title>

    <summary>In a forum post, ZmnSCPxj contemplates the idea of a "lightweight" node that ignores UTXOs below the dust limit and doesn't validate dust transactions but still validates POW and other transactions. ZmnSCPxj questions how such a node would treat a transaction that spends multiple dust UTXOs and creates a single non-dust UTXO out of them after fees. He presumes that such a node never stores dust UTXOs, so it cannot know if the UTXO being spent by such a transaction is spending dust, trying to spend an already-spent TXO, or even inventing a TXO out of `/dev/random`. ZmnSCPxj notes that while these nodes could possibly get forked, accepting a series of valid, mined blocks where there is an invalid but ignored dust transaction, this attack seems just as expensive as a 51% attack.</summary>
