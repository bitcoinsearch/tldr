    <summary>In a conversation about the externality of UTXO set size and Bitcoin's consensus rules, Pieter Wuille suggests having a relay policy to avoid economically irrational behavior. However, he acknowledges that it is not obvious how consensus rules could deal with this issue without hardcoded prices/feerates. One possibility could be transactions getting a size/weight bonus or penalty, but this would require a hard fork and bad incentives may be introduced. In response to Pieter's comments, ZmnSCPxj raises questions about the difficulty of implementing a +weight malus and its potential effect on mining nodes. It is suggested that miners may refuse to activate such a fork if they see fewer transactions per block on average.</summary>
