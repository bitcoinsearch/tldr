    <summary>On 17th July 2015, Rusty Russell proposed a construction to deploy lightning on Bitcoin. The proposal included the use of OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY which could make the deployment much quicker. Joseph Poon expressed his excitement about the proposal and stated that it would create a usable way to try out lightning on Bitcoin. Poon mentioned that he will update his paper with these changes as they are significant. The current version of his paper can be found at http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper-0.5.9.pdf.</summary>
