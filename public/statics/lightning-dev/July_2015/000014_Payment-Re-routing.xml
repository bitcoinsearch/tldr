    <summary>It is suggested that a set of authorities for directory nodes could open payment channels with all known lightning processors and use a protocol to periodically move money back and forth to verify connectivity. However, verifying connectivity on the Lightning network is not as simple as connecting to a Tor node. Unlike Tor, Lightning would not need to require everyone to use the same directory authority. A rating system could be implemented to enforce the reputation of Lightning nodes, similar to what Visa does with banks in its network. The incentives are slightly skewed in favor of dishonesty, but breaking payments into smaller chunks and across diverse paths can minimize the impact of dishonesty at the cost of bandwidth and speed. Some sort of cryptographic solution may also be possible.</summary>
