    <summary>BIP62 is believed to be abandoned as the PR based on it was never merged. However, BIP66 implements some of its rules, but rules 2-7 have been nonstandard for a while and are not enforced against new blocks. Rusty Russell posted a draft regarding ln-deploy which has not been proofread properly as of yet and script examples have not yet been checked. The post was made on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
