    <summary>A proposal for an onion routing system was made by Rusty Russell. In this system, each node would only be able to see the next hop, the R hash, the amount, the timeout, and the fee being offered. The source or final destination would not be visible. This system requires source routing, which is a privacy disadvantage as it requires everyone to know the shape of the network. It is possible to combine both concepts in a single design. The node is given the next hop, the fee the transaction is prepared to pay there, and the time delta. "Next hop" need not be adjacent. A powerful attacker could be monitoring transactions on several "regulated" nodes and gain the ability, every once in a while, to initiate transactions from an "illegal" node that should have been censored. If such transactions are routed over "regulated" nodes, it would immediately recognize this, because the transaction hash would be the same.</summary>
