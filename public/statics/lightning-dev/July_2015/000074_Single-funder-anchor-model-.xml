    <summary>In a post by Joseph Poon, it was mentioned that OP_CSV still requires BIP 62. However, a model can be constructed with OP_CLTV without BIP 62 using single-funder with some OP_CLTV'd output. This output returns the full balance to the original funder at a date very far in the future after the expiration of all commitments and its dependent outputs. There seem to be no objections to assuming BIP62 at this stage, but it is good to know that there is a backup if that proves overly optimistic.</summary>
