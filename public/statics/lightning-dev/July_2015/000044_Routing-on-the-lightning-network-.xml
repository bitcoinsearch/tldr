    <summary>In this email thread, Rusty Russell discusses the idea of extensible source-routing in lightning network. The extensible source-routing protocol offers several advantages such as adaptability to changing network conditions and anonymity for source and destination to intermediaries, but it also has some drawbacks like the inability to avoid nodes. To overcome these limitations, a global routing announcement service is suggested that can perform cheapest path finding among available channels. A possible routed transaction structure is proposed as well. The fee structure is discussed, and it is suggested that the intermediary should be offered satoshi inversely proportional to how long finalization takes. However, offering insufficient fees can render a transaction unroutable. Furthermore, the issue of concurrent independent transactions on a channel is discussed, and it is suggested that very short timeouts may be required to keep things flowing.</summary>
