    <summary>In an email exchange between Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon, they discussed the feasibility of implementing a basic lightning implementation in real bitcoin after OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY soft-forks into it. However, there were significant caveats that prevented this from being a reality. Joseph suggested that OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (relative CTLV) could reduce these caveats enough to make the implementation possible. During the private email conversation, Rusty realized that the malleability issue could cause the commitment transaction to be useless. However, he came up with another variant that Joseph approved of and improved upon. Rusty is currently writing up the final result.</summary>
