    <summary>In an email conversation between Nick ODell and a Bitcoin developer, concerns were raised regarding the deployment timeline for BIP62. The developer explained that at present, only one soft fork vote can be pushed out at a time. BIP66 was rushed out in response to an undisclosed vulnerability, with the uncontroversial aspects of BIP62 included. However, it was noted that BIP65: CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY has higher deployment priority and will be next. As BIP62 is considered low priority, there is no deployment timeline for it. The developer also asked for specifics on BIP62 being out of date, as any issues identified would be fixed.</summary>
