    <summary>A unique way of implementing a time lock has been shared in a post on roberts.pm. The method could prove useful for different implementations of HTLC's or time-sensitive rewards/penalties. Additionally, the authors are working on integrating adjustable difficulty and distribution for rewards which is equivalent to creating micro POW mining environments. This could potentially be used as a tool for payment channels. The details can be found in the Bitcointalk forum link provided in the post.</summary>
