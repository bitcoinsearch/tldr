    <summary>In a recent discussion, Christopher Jamthagen proposed the implementation of timestop feature for CLTV to make the difference between the number of blocks until either expiration the same in case of a block-filling attack. This would be a softfork add and should apply to both. Rusty also suggested that outsourcing is possible for checking the blockchain and miners can be incentivized with a fee to keep an extra eye for cheaters on the blockchain. Outsourcability scales well and can be automated by including it in the "steal" transaction. However, he noted that outsourcing needs a new sighash op mode or normalized txids, so it's not something to design a deployable system around today.</summary>
