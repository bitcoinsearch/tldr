    <summary>In this email exchange, Eric Lombrozo and Joseph Poon discuss the possibility of outsourcing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs over the Lightning Network (LN). Eric suggests using an OP_CHECKSPVPROOFVERIFY opcode to allow for the creation of a contract requesting payment from the SPV client, along with an enforcement mechanism in case of non-payment. However, Eric clarifies that the goal is not to provide better security than current SPV proofs, but rather to enable outsourceability. Joseph asks for more information on the proposed opcode, but Eric does not provide any links or details.</summary>
