    <summary>The author of the context suggests that the major issue with Bitcoin is how to incentivize nodes to construct SPV proofs and wonders if any research has been done in this area. They propose that it might be practical to outsource SPV proofs from other nodes using the Lightning Network (LN). The author acknowledges that including SPV proofs in the blockchain would be prohibitive and self-defeating, but suggests it could be necessary when the SPV client fails to pay the prover. The context ends with the author's name and a non-text attachment containing their signature.</summary>
