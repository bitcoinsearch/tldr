    <summary>The Lightning Network uses a private key sending function to send signed messages efficiently. The sender can provide the other end of the channel with their private key to sign it themselves. However, Rusty generalized this approach by using a hypercube multi-dimensional array of preimages to have a lower setup. This method requires computing all the hash preimages at setup. The use of preimages replaces the need for private keys in revoking transactions. CJP was not aware of this design change but finds it to be an improvement.</summary>
