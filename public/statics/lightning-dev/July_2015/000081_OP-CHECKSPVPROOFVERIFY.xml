    <summary>On July 29, 2015, Eric Lombrozo forwarded a message to the group about outsourcing Simple Payment Verification (SPV) proofs over Lightning Network (LN). Although it might not offer significantly better security than current SPV proofs, outsourcing is desirable as it leads to quantifiable incentives for running nodes to serve SPV clients. This makes it possible to reason about the economic security model of the network. While there is no mention of a specific opcode for SPV proof, using OP_CHECKSPVPROOFVERIFY in crafting a contract requesting payment from the SPV client along with an enforcement mechanism could be practical. However, the goal is to avoid actually using this opcode in the blockchain.</summary>
