    <summary>Nick ODell and Kevin Greene discuss the possibility of directory authorities for the Lightning network. One way to create a list of peers would be through the use of getaddr.bitnodes.io or by the node telling all of the directory authorities it knows about itself.The Lightning network is similar to Tor in being able to detect various sorts of accidental connectivity issues, but cannot detect intentional misbehavior, such as stealing money, without actually sending money through the network. The conversation discusses the reliability of Lightning Network and its potential for dishonesty. The network lacks a central processor to enforce node reputations, similar to Tor's nine "directory authorities." However, it is suggested that Lightning could use a similar system without requiring everyone to use the same directory authority. One issue discussed is the possibility of collusion between nodes to steal funds, especially if one of the nodes experiences an outage. Delaying the entire payment is not considered a favorable option, so alternatives such as re-routing 99% of the payment or breaking up payments into smaller chunks across diverse paths are suggested. A rating system based on node trustworthiness is also proposed as a potential solution.From a privacy perspective, active scanning is much easier to secure than passive scanning. If someone stole one out of every million payments, the directories would never notice. In the ABCD example, the only nodes that C should know about are B and D. Therefore, the routes EBCD and ABCD are equivalent from C's point of view. However, routing in the Lightning network remains a question.</summary>
