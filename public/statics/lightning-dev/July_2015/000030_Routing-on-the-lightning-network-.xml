    <summary>The proposal for an onion routing system has been made where each node would only see the next hop, the R hash, the amount, the timeout and the fee being offered. It will not be able to see the source or the final destination. However, this approach requires source routing which means that everyone must know the shape of the network. This is not necessary in TOR as every node can connect to every other node. The two concepts can be combined into a single design where the protocol carries arbitrary payload data to the next waypoint. In-between waypoints, routers are free to use non-source routing.Several thousand hubs model does not pose more sensitivity to centralization/censorship than other routing models. Any routing model has routable addresses and risks addresses being censored by a part of the network. A powerful attacker (government) could monitor transactions on several regulated nodes and gain the ability to initiate transactions from illegal nodes that should have been censored. If such transactions are routed over regulated nodes, it would immediately recognize this because the transaction hash would be the same. It may be impossible to eliminate this attack mode.Each-hop routing reveals the final destination hub to all nodes, which may be forwarded, but the source may not be revealed to all nodes. Fees are tricky and adaptable to changing network conditions. End clients need not know anything. On the other hand, source routing does not reveal the final source or destination to intermediary nodes and fees are known in advance. It requires retransmission from the source if routes change and end clients need routing/fee information. It allows selection of nodes from the source which may let you avoid bad/tracking/unreliable nodes.</summary>
