    <summary>Rusty Russell made a statement that it takes twice the time to get a full two-way channel. However, this statement was corrected by go1111111 who pointed out that the atomic swap tx can hit the bitcoin blockchain about the same time as the anchor tx. The correction was made on a thread found on bitcointalk.org.</summary>
