    <summary>The soft fork process is currently undergoing some significant changes, causing a backlog in the system. Additionally, there were already major concerns about the process before these changes. The version bits BIP, which would allow multiple concurrent soft forks, is still in progress. Furthermore, the BIP66 fork revealed further problems with the process. Meanwhile, the block size hard fork remains a contentious issue. In an email exchange between Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon, the former expressed contentment with assuming BIP62 for OP_CSV, but noted that there was not much motivation behind it. Poon suggested an alternative model without BIP62.</summary>
