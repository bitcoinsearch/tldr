    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 62 is not abandoned, and it requires time to implement significant changes and ensure their safety. The BIP66 implementation includes some of the features in BIP62, while rules 2-7 have been nonstandard for a while, but they are not enforced against new blocks. On July 18, 2015, Nick ODell expressed his uncertainty regarding BIP62's status, stating that the PR based on it was never merged. Rusty Russell also posted a draft of Lightning Network Deployment guidelines on July 17, 2015, for feedback from the Lightning-dev mailing list. Despite lacking sufficient proofreading, Rusty wanted to share it before the weekend for interested parties to review.</summary>
