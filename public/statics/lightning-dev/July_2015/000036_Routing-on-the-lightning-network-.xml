    <summary>The idea of offering negative fees for transactions that bring a channel back to equilibrium has been proposed, which could create a market for individuals to make money by bringing other channels back to equilibrium. This concept would require stepping away from "net neutrality" or implementing source routing and explicitly setting fees for intermediate nodes. The idea was suggested by Joseph Poon in a conversation with the author, who found it mind-blowing. However, the author is unsure if they invented the concept themselves, as someone in the audience of their talk about Amiko Pay at the Bitcoinference in Amsterdam also came up with the idea.</summary>
