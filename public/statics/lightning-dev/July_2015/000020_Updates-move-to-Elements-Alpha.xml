    <summary>Last week, the Bitcoin code repository gained ifdefs to support Blockstream's Elements Alpha sidechain. This was done because it already has the features Lightning Network wants which aren't soft-forked into bitcoin yet. However, alpha contains many "cool features" that are not needed for Lightning Network such as Confidential Transactions, which made the port a bit trickier than expected. Bug fixes were also made along the way.The implementation of HTLCs is currently being worked on with the use of hashes for revocation instead of exposing private keys and using OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Rusty plans to post an update once he has something that's not obviously wrong.</summary>
