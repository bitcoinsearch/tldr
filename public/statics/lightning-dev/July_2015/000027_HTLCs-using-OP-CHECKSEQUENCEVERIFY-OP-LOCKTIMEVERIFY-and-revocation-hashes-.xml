    <summary>The Lightning Network paper introduced the concept of revocable transactions, which allows outputs to be spent by either the owner or a counterparty who knows a secret. The secret in the original paper was a temporary private key, but it could have been a pre-signed 2-of-2 transaction. However, using hashes instead of private keys is even easier and more efficient. In fact, Rusty Russell generalized this idea further by using a hypercube multi-dimensional array of preimages to reduce setup time. The implementation can be found in the ccan/crypto/shachain module on Github.</summary>
