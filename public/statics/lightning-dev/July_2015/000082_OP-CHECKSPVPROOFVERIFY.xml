    <summary>In a recent post by Eric Lombrozo, he raises concerns over incentivizing nodes to construct SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) proofs. Lombrozo is uncertain if any research or publications have been made on this matter. He notes that the issue can be partially solved through P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash), but there are still obstacles. For example, OP_CAT is currently disabled, and the txlen limit may pose problems. Lombrozo's concerns highlight the ongoing need for innovation and problem-solving within the Bitcoin community. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it is important for developers and researchers to address potential roadblocks in order to ensure the continued success and adoption of Bitcoin.</summary>
