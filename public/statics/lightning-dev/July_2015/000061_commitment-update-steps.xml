    <summary>The author discusses the technical details of using OP_RETURN metadata for transactions. He notes that using this method is objectively better than just having the nonstandard non-P2SH output when considering transaction size. The author also explains the use of 16-bit and 32-bit values for timeouts and commitment transactions, respectively. For each HTLC output per Commitment, 48-bits (6 bytes) are required, plus 20-bytes for the hash(R), resulting in a total of 26 bytes. If someone broadcasts an old Commitment, they can check the OP_RETURN data for the 6-bytes, then compute the revocation data and compute a couple hundred revocations to find the relevant data. The tradeoff between using OP_RETURN and local storage is discussed, with the former being preferable for large hubs. Regardless of the chosen method, it is better than having the entire script as part of the output.</summary>
