    <summary>A recent discussion on #lightning-dev has pointed out that a single-funder anchor can be done without requiring new sighash ops nor losing outsourcability. The other end can transfer funds in two ways, either through the lightning network or via atomic cross-blockchain idea. The dual-anchor proposal features an asymmetric risk where either side could abort with no penalty and make the other side wait for the escape timeout anyway. Although we've handwaved over the incentives for channel creation so far, they're tied with routing, and not immediately clear. If you connect to a hub, it's reasonable that you front the funds.</summary>
