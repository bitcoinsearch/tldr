    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning Development mailing list, ZmnSCPxj expresses concerns about the effectiveness of a proposed mitigation to address issues with barrier escrows. Nadav Kohen offers a solution in the form of an interface for implementing a barrier escrow that involves each participant contributing a point commitment, and any cheating can be detected by the other parties. The proposal includes two methods: barrier-commit and barrier-reveal. Barrier-commit takes a list of points as input and returns a point if the inputs have not been seen before. Barrier-reveal takes a scalar as input and waits to receive barrier-reveal requests for each of the n points before returning the scalar pre-image to E.Nadav suggests using invoice offers as a means of initiating the first interaction, but acknowledges that trust would still be required in the barrier escrow. He also provides two blog post links on the topic of Barrier Escrows. While the author of the email agrees that additional checks could prevent the above-mentioned issue, they highlight the need for trust in the barrier escrow. Overall, the discussion revolves around finding solutions to improve the effectiveness of barrier escrows in Lightning Network transactions.</summary>
