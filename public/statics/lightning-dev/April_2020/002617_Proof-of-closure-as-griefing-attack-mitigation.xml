    <summary>In a conversation between Nadav and ZmnSCPxj, Nadav raises some questions about the effectiveness of "Purely Falsified Proof-Of-Closure." ZmnSCPxj argues that it is an economic mechanism rather than an information-theoretic one. While Nadav proposes using up-front payments on payments with abnormally high soft timeouts, ZmnSCPxj believes that this would increase the complexity of the proposal even further. Lastly, they discuss the potential problem of giving out a proof of closure for Poon-Dryja channels, as it is equivalent to actually closing the channel. However, ZmnSCPxj explains that what is desired is to plausibly say "I punished somebody else by closing on them, please do not punish me for punishing them."</summary>
