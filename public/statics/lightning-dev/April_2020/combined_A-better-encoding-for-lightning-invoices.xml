    <summary>Bolt 11 invoices, which use bech32 encoding for lightning transactions, are too large and difficult to share when routing hints or rendezvous onions are added. This has impacted the development of new features for lightning since Twitter only allows up to 280 characters per tweet, where most transactions take place. To solve this problem, Acinq Research developed an efficient invoice encoding optimized primarily for Twitter, which uses an AI-optimized mapping from 11-bit words to Twitter emojis. Early results show that emoji invoices are more than 2 times smaller than legacy invoices. The same encoding could also be used to compress the bitcoin blockchain and allow blocks to fit in a single tweet, thereby storing the whole blockchain in Twitter feeds. Reckless users are already using this in production, with plans to release this feature in the next update of their Phoenix wallet. Feedback is appreciated on how to improve this further.In a recent email conversation, an individual claimed that the same encoding used to compress images could be applied to compress the Bitcoin blockchain. With more training data, it was believed that this AI-optimized mapping could enable Bitcoin blocks to fit in a single tweet. However, one person questioned the validity of this claim and compared it to a fable about a 1-bit image compressor. It remains unclear where the blockchain data would be stored if compressed into a tweet, raising questions about the feasibility of this proposal.</summary>
