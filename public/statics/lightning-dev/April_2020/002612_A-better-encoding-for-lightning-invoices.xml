    <summary>In a recent email conversation, an individual claimed that the same encoding used to compress images could be applied to compress the Bitcoin blockchain. The individual stated that with more training data, it was believed that this AI-optimized mapping could enable Bitcoin blocks to fit in a single tweet. This would then make it possible to use Twitter feeds to store the entire blockchain. However, one person questioned the validity of this claim and compared it to a fable about a 1-bit image compressor. They asserted that the only requirement for publication in a journal is to correctly compress and decompress the Lenna test image. While it remains unclear where the blockchain data would be stored if compressed into a tweet, the idea of using Twitter feeds to store the entire blockchain raises questions about the feasibility of this proposal.</summary>
