    <summary>Thibaut, Ichiro Kuwahara, and Takatoshi Nakagawa from Crypto Garage have proposed a solution to integrate Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) channels into the Lightning Network. Their paper discusses the implementation of DLC channels without the need for additional on-chain transactions after a contract expires. They propose a solution to the "free option" problem where neither party can pick the most favorable outcome from a previous or latest contract result. Their proposal also permits multiple concurrent channels, using a single fund transaction, and it does not require any changes to the Bitcoin transaction structure. The proposed DLC channel construction is standalone and can be deployed outside or alongside the Lightning Network. It also allows for more separation of concerns between the channels, as they can be updated separately without influencing each other. The approach differs from Juraj Bednár and René Pickhardt's Lightning DLC channel construction.They propose using update transactions that are revokable, and a buffer transaction which solves the "free option" problem. This involves generating the set of transactions for the new contract, sending signatures for the update, CETs and refund transactions between Alice and Bob, revoking the previous update transaction, and signing buffer transactions. The proposed solution to integrate DLC channels in the Lightning Network is simple, but not previously suggested. A "split" transaction is used, which spends the output of the fund transaction and contains a single output for every channel to be created.The advantage of this construction is the ability to support as many sub-channels as desired for a single fund transaction and rebalance between channels. However, twice as many transactions need to be created and tracked due to the revocation mechanism in the split transaction. The authors welcome feedback on the approach, its implementation complexity, and whether it should be pursued given recent developments.</summary>
