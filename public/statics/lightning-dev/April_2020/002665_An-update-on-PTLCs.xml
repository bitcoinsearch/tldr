    <title>An update on PTLCs</title>

    <summary>Matheus Degiovani, the maintainer of Decred's port of lnd, introduced himself on a list and expressed interest in Proof-of-Concepting PTLCs. Despite playing catch-up with the entirety of the Lightning Network ecosystem, the chain already has Schnorr signatures but no taproot yet. With a small network, there is more room to experiment with base protocols. Matheus invited anyone interested in details or spit-balling ideas for a prototype to contact him and plans to provide an update once he has some minimal work done.</summary>
