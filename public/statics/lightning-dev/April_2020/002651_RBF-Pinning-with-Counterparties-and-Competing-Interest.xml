    <summary>In a discussion about implementing a feature to return the transaction IDs of any conflicts, it was pointed out that an attacker could create a local conflict in a mempool. However, it was noted that a mempool is not necessary to send a transaction as one can open connections to random Bitcoin nodes directly and try sending the transaction. To find if the pinned transaction is in the mempools of a significant number of Bitcoin nodes, one can connect to random nodes until the pinned transaction is found. Alternatively, other methods such as BIP35 mempool messages or reusing the payment hash in a bunch of 1 msat probes to LN nodes who opt-in to scanning their bitcoind's mempools for a corresponding preimage could be used to poll a significant number of people with mempools.</summary>
