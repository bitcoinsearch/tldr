    <summary>In an email exchange between ZmnSCPxj and Subhra Mazumdar, privacy and security concerns in payment systems are discussed, with a focus on PTLC-based payments. Both individuals emphasize the importance of protecting privacy and security in payment systems. They propose a partial, blinded path for the receiver to provide, which would protect privacy against the sender and make it harder for the sender to locate the receiver's node and perform an eclipse attack at the Bitcoin layer. ZmnSCPxj also discusses griefing attacks and how both sender and receiver should control the secrets used in PTLCs to prevent vulnerabilities if either entity becomes corrupted.In another conversation with Bastien, ZmnSCPxj suggests a modification to the current path blinding proposal for multi-hop locks, which would require the recipient to give all blinding points for each hop in the blinded path instead of just one blinding point. However, this change may open up some attack vectors on the sender and requires further verification. Rusty Russell explores a scheme for blinded paths proposed by t-bast, which can be used to simplify the rendezvous routing process. The proposed solution includes a new invoice letter `b` that encodes one or more pubkey/feebase/feeprop/cltvdelta/features/encblob, an additional (tlv of course) field to update_add_htlc, `blinding`, a new `tlv_payload` field `encblob`. Christian suggests encrypting a general payload instead of using the secret to XOR the scid.Bastien Teinturier has proposed a route blinding scheme to improve wallet users' privacy in the Lightning Network. The proposal is designed to simplify the scheme and make it clear that it uses the same secrets derivation as Sphinx. Some parts of the proposal, such as invoice fields and encrypted blob format, are kept vague so they can be enriched based on early prototype implementations. In response to comments made by Rusty Russell, Bastien notes that the goal of payment_secret is to avoid having the next-to-last node discover it to prevent probing, and he does not think that using blinding to replace it would work. Additionally, Bastien notes that the secrets established with anonymous multi-hops locks are between the sender and each of the hops, whereas the secrets added in route blinding are between the recipient and the hops, and the sender should not influence those secrets.ZmnSCPxj suggests that since the payment point and scalar along with path decorrelation require establishing a secret with each hop, it may be possible to reuse this secret for each hop instead of using a payment secret. The email conversation between Subhra Mazumdar and ZmnSCPxj discusses the issue of privacy and security in anonymous multi-hop locks. ZmnSCPxj argues that if both the sender and receiver are corrupted, there is no security or privacy possible, and the payment is already totally compromised. The forwarding nodes cannot be attacked easily as they advertise themselves in order to be forwarded through. When considering privacy, it is the payment as a whole that needs to have privacy, and if the sender leaks who it is paying to, it results in the entire loss of privacy. In a recent discussion between tbast, rusty and list on the topic of anonymous multi-hop locks, ZmnSCPxj put forward a suggestion that was met with some skepticism. The issue in question is the establishment of secrets between the sender and each of the hops, which could be disrupted if the sender were able to influence those secrets. This is essentially a reverse Sphinx scenario where the secrets are established between the recipient and the hops instead. While there is uncertainty about whether the recipient can safely contribute to these secrets, it may be possible to find a solution in the future.</summary>
