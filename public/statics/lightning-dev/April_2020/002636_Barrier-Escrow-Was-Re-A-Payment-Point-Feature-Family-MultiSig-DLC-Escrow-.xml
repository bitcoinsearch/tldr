    <summary>The author of this email is bringing up the topic of barrier escrows, which they have been thinking about lately. They reference an old thread and discuss a mitigation mentioned in it that does not work because one participant can still make a payment of the entire amount with their own generated `Z`. The author suggests additional checks could be implemented to prevent this, but this would require trust in the barrier escrow.</summary>
