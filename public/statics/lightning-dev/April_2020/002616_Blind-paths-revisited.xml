    <summary>In a conversation about anonymous multi-hop locks and route blinding, ZmnSCPxj explains that in the context of PTLCs, both sender and receiver control the secrets, so it is not controlled by a single entity. They also argue that if both sender and receiver are corrupted, no security or privacy is possible, and the payment is compromised. When considering privacy, we should always consider that it is the payment as a whole which we want to have privacy - we want third parties to be unable to identify which particular sender sent to which particular receiver. Currently on Lightning, the exact receiver node has to be known by the sender for them to make a route to it, which may be concerning since there could be layer-crossing shenanigans performed. The proposal to have a receiver provide a partial, blinded path gives the receiver better privacy protection against the sender. In this context, the argument made is that while the blinding factors in a decorrelated PTLC-based payment may be generated by the sender for path privacy, it is safe for the receiver to provide blinding factors to a partial path as well.</summary>
