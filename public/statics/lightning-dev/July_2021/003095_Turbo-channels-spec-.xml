    <summary>Rusty Russell, a member of Lightning-dev mailing list, proposed a new feature to allow zeroconf channels. This comes after Roasbeef pointed out that not all implementations accept them. The proposal suggests assigning a new feature bit "I accept zeroconf channels" and if both parties accept it, update_add_htlc can be sent before funding_locked without causing any issues. However, there is a different threat model between someone spending dual-funded or push_msat balance vs classic channel-funding balance, so it may make sense to negotiate this per-direction in the channel init message(s). Nodes are advised not to forward HTLCs from an unconfirmed channel unless they have explicit reason to trust that node. The proposal is a simple change which would create a new set of channel types and Rusty plans to draft something this week.</summary>
