    <summary>There has been a discussion on whether it makes sense to merge layer 2 and layer 3 protocols such as BOLT, RGB, Volts, etc. into the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) system. In response to this, Luke Dashjr suggests adding editors and revising the BIP process as needed. He also notes that the BIP 2xx range was set aside for Lightning years ago, and similar things can be done to help keep things organized within BIPs. Kalle Alm suggests using BIP "L###" instead if there are likely to be several sub-namespaces. There is also a wishlist of improvements that can be made aside from Lightning BIPs, so it makes sense to address everything at once. One suggestion made by Michael Folkson is to add a third BIP editor more involved with Lightning. Alternatively, Bastien would be a great additional BIP editor to cover Lightning related BIPs if BOLTs were subsumed into BIPs. Nathanael questions whether lightning improvements in the end bitcoin improvements too, and compares BIPs to the RFCs of the internet.</summary>
