    <summary>The author of a Lightning Network-related proposal has suggested that the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) could be used to support new additions to the network. However, they raised concerns about how these new BIPs would be implemented without the basis of the Lightning technology to support them. They also questioned whether each Bolt should be its own BIP or if they should all be combined into one. In addition, they reviewed a list of BIP proposals and found most to be positive, except for BIP versioning. The author suggests revising the BIP process and adding editors as necessary. They propose using the BIP 2xx range for Lightning, and possibly doing BIP "L###" instead, in case there are several sub-namespaces. Another member agreed that adding a third BIP editor more involved with Lightning would be a good idea. The author believes that Lightning improvements ultimately benefit the Bitcoin network as a whole and compares BIPs to RFCs of the internet.</summary>
