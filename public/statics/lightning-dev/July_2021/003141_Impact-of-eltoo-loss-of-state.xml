    <summary>In a discussion about the size of a resolution during a contested close scenario, a user suggests that worrying too much about the resolution's size is not worth it. The safest option would be to encode the necessary state in an op_return or similar method, which guarantees the availability of the closing transaction data in the protocol with no external dependencies. To make it cheaper, Alice could choose to cooperate with a contesting Bob to replace the transaction with something smaller, but it should be mandatory for Bob to at least reveal the state if they want to use the transaction unilaterally. The user also suggests getting rid of the mempool absolute fee increase rule for RBF to facilitate this process.</summary>
