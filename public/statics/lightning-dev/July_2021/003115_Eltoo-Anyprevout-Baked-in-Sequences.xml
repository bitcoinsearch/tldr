    <summary>The discussion is about the use of relative locktime and absolute locktime for the same input in a given scenario. The author states that disallowing such a use case seems suboptimal, although they have not come across any relevant use case yet. Another participant in the discussion points out that the correct term should be disallowing a relative locktime and a sequence locktime. The author agrees with this correction and further asks for opinions on the use of sequence tagged keys.</summary>
