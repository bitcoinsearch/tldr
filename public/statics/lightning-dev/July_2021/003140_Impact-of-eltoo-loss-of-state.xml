    <summary>The article discusses how to prevent loss of funds due to forgetting state in Lightning Network. The reason behind hiding the fact that state has been forgotten is to prevent obsolete state from being passed off on-chain by a peer, which can result in stealing funds before data recovery. However, if a completely random node with no channels advertises to remember state, there is no need to worry. A solution to this problem is nodes providing a "will remember for you" flag in the feature bits.Nodes can then use a secret distance measurement to locate the nearest node and contact it to remember the memento. A throwaway keypair should be used instead of the normal pubkey while contacting the selected node. After amnesia, the privkey can be entered to re-download the gossip map and find the nearest 100 nodes with the "will remember for you" feature. Even if peers conspire with the "will remember for you" node, it cannot identify which node suffered amnesia.However, the anonymous nature of the client requesting data storage is vulnerable to abuse and DDoS. To prevent spam, a "will remember for you" node can use techniques developed for anonymously paying to watchtowers.</summary>
