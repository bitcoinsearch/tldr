    <summary>In a discussion about the potential addition of a third BIP editor to focus on Lightning, Michael Folkson suggested that it might be a good idea to subsume BOLTs into BIPs, with Bastien being a great candidate for covering Lightning-related BIPs. However, he expressed pessimism about this happening, noting how alphabet soups in the legacy financial system only expand rather than simplify. Nathanael then asked if Lightning improvements weren't ultimately Bitcoin improvements as well, and made an analogy to BIPs being like the RFCs of the internet.</summary>
