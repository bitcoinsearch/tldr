    <summary>The Lightning Network community is currently discussing the idea of adding a new process called bLIPs or SPARKs on top of the existing BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) process. This new process would allow for app layer best practices to be succinctly described and organized, especially those that require coordination. The primary purpose of bLIPs is to promote more loosely coupled evolution of the network and can be a descriptive home for optional standards/proposals. The discussion revolves around the idea of migrating BOLTs to BIPs or having a third BIP editor more involved with Lightning. BIPs allow for flexibility and coordination/interoperability, whereas BOLTs must be followed strictly for interoperability with the network. Any alternatives or optional features should be extracted out of BOLTs and written as BIPs. BOLTs specify what base functionality is required for a routing node in a prescriptive manner, while bLIPs can be reserved for descriptive measures. Some potential bLIP ideas mentioned include each lnurl variant, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast payment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, remote node connection standards, etc. Historically, new standardization documents are proposed initially as issues or PR's when they are ultimately accepted. Therefore, the need for another repository has been questioned by some members of the community. However, proponents of the bLIP process believe that it would bring features built outside of the BOLT process into the fold instead of leaving them buried in old ML posts or not documented at all. There are also new BOLTs being offered like BOLT 12 and BOLT 14, with topics to be included such as dual funding, splicing, and the examples given by Ryan. Rene Pickhardt, who previously proposed a similar idea called LIP in 2018, does not see how a new repo would reduce the barrier to participate in the BOLTs but believes that all the points addressed in Ryan's email could very well be formalized into BOLTs. He suggests rethinking the current process of the BOLTs to make it more accessible for new ideas to find their way into the BOLTs.In conclusion, the Lightning Network community is discussing the addition of a new process called bLIPs or SPARKs on top of the existing BOLT process to add a place for app layer best practices to be organized and described. While some members question the need for another repository, proponents believe that it would bring features built outside of the BOLT process into the fold.
