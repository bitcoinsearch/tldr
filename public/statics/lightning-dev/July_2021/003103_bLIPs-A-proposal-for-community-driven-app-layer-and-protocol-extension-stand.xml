    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson proposed the idea of adding a third BIP editor to cover Lightning related BIPs. Another suggestion was to subsume BOLTs into BIPs, but Folkson expressed pessimism about this happening, likening it to the expansion of alphabet soups in legislation and regulation. Nathanael pointed out that Lightning improvements ultimately benefit Bitcoin as well, and compared BIPs to the RFCs of the internet. The discussion also touched upon the many layer 2 and possibly layer 3 protocols such as BOLT, RGB, and Volts, questioning whether it made sense to merge them all into the BIPs system.</summary>
