    <summary>The email thread discusses embedding a bitcoin address into a Lightning Network (LN) invoice. A link to an example of this feature is provided, which shows a BTC address embedded in a Lightning URI. The possibility of the invoice being serialized is also mentioned as a potential reason for not seeing it. The email is signed off with the sender's contact information and links to their schedule, chat, and social media accounts.</summary>
