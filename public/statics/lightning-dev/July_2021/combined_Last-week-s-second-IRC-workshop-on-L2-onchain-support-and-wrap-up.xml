    <summary>The recent online Sydney Socratic Seminar discussed L2 onchain support and proposed ideas such as SIGHASH_IOMAP, fee sponsorship, and transaction mutation. The second workshop focused on fee bumping and package relay, with attendees agreeing that enabling two transaction packages would be sufficient for Lightning and DLCs. Tapscripts can be unlimited in size so a future soft fork could give meaning to the annex in Taproot which could be used for inflating the fee rate of a witness. L2 protocols should seek to minimize assumptions on the base layer. Package relay is potentially useful for L2 protocols to address the inherent unpredictability of future fees. CPFP seeks to ensure that a justice transaction gets confirmed in a more timely manner because miners are incentivized to include the child transaction in a block. Gloria Zhao has been advancing package relay in Bitcoin Core. The participants suggested that instead of creating two packages, it is perhaps better to just broadcast a high fee CPFP transaction for the {A,B} package rather than creating two packages. Furthermore, darosior suggested the idea of a package-based CBlockPolicyEstimator in Bitcoin Core if CPFP is going to be increasingly used on the network.</summary>
