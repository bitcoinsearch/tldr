    <summary>In a discussion about the evaluation of scripts, Jeremy suggests that only one bit of information should be returned from the evaluation process, specifically whether the transaction is invalid or not. He argues that all other relevant information such as fees, transaction finality, and currency forks should be easily parsed from the transaction itself. However, he notes that the current system does not have this property and provides an example of a transaction that fails due to the "top stack item is greater than the transaction input sequence" rule. When asked how to determine if a transaction can be included without running the script, it is explained that while the script must be run at some point, it is not necessary to do so in order to differentiate between the transaction being valid on one chain versus another. Additionally, it is noted that while timelocks always go from invalid to valid, it is valuable that transactions cannot go from valid to invalid as it limits the number of cases where transactions (and their descendents) must be removed from the mempool.</summary>
