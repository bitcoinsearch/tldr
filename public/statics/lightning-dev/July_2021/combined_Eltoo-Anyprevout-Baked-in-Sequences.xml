    <summary>In a series of emails between Jeremy and AJ, they discuss different aspects of Bitcoin's scripting system. They suggest that sequencing restrictions should be obvious from a simple parsing of the transaction, and that evaluating a script should only return one bit of information: whether the transaction is invalid or not. They also discuss a new CSV type called 'eltoo sequences' which would give a per-input sequence but cannot be used with a sequence tag. Additionally, they talk about how adding a per-input absolute locktime to the annex could be used to cheaply add a commitment to an historical block hash, which could help disambiguate which branch of a chain split or reorg a transaction is valid for. Finally, they mention that it is already impossible to simultaneously spend two inputs if one requires a locktime specified by mediantime and the other by block height, and adding per-input locktimes would satisfy both concerns.</summary>
