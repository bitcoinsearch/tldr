    <summary>A new terminal based wallet/node manager for c-lightning has been developed by F.A. Hayek. The alpha version of the software, called Cluster, offers node information, profit/loss statistics, available funds on-chain and LN, recent activity pane, and a list of channels ordered by channel balance showing inbound/outbound capacity, local/remote fees set and earned, last forward, peer status, alias and opener. Users can sort the channel list by different criteria and use keyboard shortcuts for easy navigation. However, the Receive/Pay pages are currently broken and should not be used until the next release. Future plans for Cluster include robust Pay/Receive functions, ability to rebalance/auto rebalance according to preset rules, detailed channel info page with channel specific functions (open/close/rebalance etc.), more useful stats, and an emphasis on the terminal UI for a lean and fast app. The alpha version of Cluster can be downloaded from https://github.com/f-hayek/cluster.</summary>
