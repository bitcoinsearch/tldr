    <summary>The author commented on a Github pull request about the use of anyprevout for eltoo. They noted that the current script overloads the CLTV clause, making it impossible to use Eltoo and an absolute lock time, as well as limiting the number of sequences that can be used. The author proposed several options to better serve the eltoo use case, including defining a new CSV type or using a sequenced signature. They also suggested something in the annex or doing nothing at all. The author was partial to option 3 as it seemed to be the closest to designing ANYPREVOUT to support Eltoo.</summary>
