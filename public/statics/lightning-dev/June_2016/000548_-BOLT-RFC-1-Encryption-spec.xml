    <summary>In an email sent by CJP to Peter Todd, he mentions the work being done by Jonas Schnelli for Bitcoin on P at P layer encryption. He provides a link to the encryption scheme OpenSSH uses, which Schnelli is using as well, giving him the benefit of all the review that's been done for OpenSSH. CJP suggests that if one uses it, they will get that benefit as well as a review from the Bitcoin Core team. In response, Peter Todd informs CJP that he is about to start implementing an encryption layer for Amiko Pay and has some questions after reading the BOLT for encryption.</summary>
