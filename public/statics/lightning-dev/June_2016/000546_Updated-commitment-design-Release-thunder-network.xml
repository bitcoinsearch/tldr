    <summary>The discussion revolves around the dual-tx approach and its backward compatibility in relaying payments with old setups. The revocation value is a private arrangement, but nodes need to publish their HTLC time subtraction anyway. The prototype started using times everywhere but switched to blocks later due to complexity. Block counts are what active nodes care about, particularly for tight timings. However, it can get significantly harder to transact sub-dust amounts with this approach. For a 1 satoshi payment, one would often pay more than 500 satoshis for claiming it on-chain.</summary>
