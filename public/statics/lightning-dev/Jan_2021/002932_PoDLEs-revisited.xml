    <summary>The concern raised is about the ownership of other inputs when only one signaling transaction is performed out of the whole group of inputs. Adding inputs from a chain that you don't own can be risky as it may allow adding whale output from the chain to trick the peer's algorithm for deciding how much they want to add to the funding. The regulators of the future might check whether the LN node is following their directive to ban certain inputs on a blacklist, and if it carries on after the funding_add_input from a blacklisted input, it must not be running the government approved node. If there is no such concern, then a single 1-input-1-output signaling transaction should be fine. However, requiring 1-input-1-output signaling tx for each input the opener adds may be prudent. Lisa promises to publish RSN so that the derived points proposal can be added to it.</summary>
