    <summary>The article discusses different proposals for establishing Lightning Network channels to prevent griefing by malicious non-initiating peers. One proposed solution involves using signaling transactions that share inputs and confirm the funding of a new channel. These transactions can be replaced with a higher fee rate, giving the initiator time to use their input before the transaction confirms. Another proposal is PoDLE, which uses DLEQ proof to prevent attackers from learning which available UTXOs are controlled by LN users. However, this protocol is more complex than the signaling transaction approach.To achieve all desired properties for dual-funded channels, one proposed solution involves using the SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY signature as backups. This solution is close to the ideal in terms of privacy and security, but it involves six rounds of communication and cannot use the "interactive tx building" protocol developed for the original proposal.There are concerns that the PoDLE proposal creates a new bit of data that can be used for chainalysis, making it redundant. Additionally, chainalysis techniques are effective at associating funding UTXOs to nodes for common usage patterns. To solve the problem of malicious initiators using the same UTXOs in parallel with multiple peers, Waxwing suggested turning knowledge of a secret key for a particular UTXO into an unlinkable credential. Darosior's proposal is to have the taker provide their inputs in a ready-to-broadcast state using SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. In an email exchange between Lloyd Fournier and Rusty Russell, the issue of proving ownership of inputs when using a signaling transaction was discussed. The post presents a simple but unintuitive protocol that achieves roughly the same properties as the PoDLE protocol but without lightning gossip messages. The real question is whether it's worth trying to stop sequential attacks if parallel attacks are unstoppable. PoDLE might have an advantage in parallel attacks if the scheme was changed. The lightning proposal has a weakness in that the h2 point is not broadcast immediately, but rather waits for failure before broadcasting it. Overall, the choice of protocol depends on balancing the need to prevent griefing with simplicity and ease of use. Refinement is needed to make proposals more effective in protecting against parallel attacks.</summary>
