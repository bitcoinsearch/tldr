    <summary>The article proposes a design for a gambling system similar to Satoshi Dice, which would be provably fair on the Lightning Network with the use of PTLCs. The system is designed to be more friendly to the Lightning Network and requires less capital to run than other methods. Bob and Carol agree to a standard bet with a 1.8% chance of winning and a 50x payout, with up to 200 satoshi stake. The winner is decided based on the relationship between two random numbers picked by Bob and Carol. The protocol discusses potential cheating by Bob, who could potentially abort the protocol with a winning bet before requesting the payout from Carol. One solution proposed is to vet Bob's claim by sending relevant information to Carol to verify if she pays out the PTLC. However, this protocol may not work without better spam defenses in lightning since PTLC payments have to be serialized or there is a risk of multiple payouts being sent to Bob. Additionally, multiple verifiers can delay the process by forcing Carol to wait for the PTLC timeout to be reached.The author suggests that stuckless payments could be a possible solution to allow parallelism of validation at least.</summary>
