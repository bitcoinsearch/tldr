    <summary>In an email conversation, David A. Harding raises a question about the feasibility of implementing self-payment of invoices in Lightning Network (LN) node implementations. He suggests that if developers of the underlying LN node implementations don't already support this feature, it would be worthwhile to consider implementing it. As far as he knows, no Lightning node currently has this ability, which he finds unfortunate. David believes that enabling self-payment of invoices would be a significant feature for custodial Lightning service providers, making it a highly desirable addition to the LN ecosystem.</summary>
