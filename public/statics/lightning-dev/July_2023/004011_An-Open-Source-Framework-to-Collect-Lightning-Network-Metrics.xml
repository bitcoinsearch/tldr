    <summary>Vincent shares one of his side projects where he focuses on collecting data on the Lightning Network. The purpose of this project is to track the evolution of the network, assess potential solutions like channel jamming, and support university research that lacks access to real data. The idea revolves around defining and gathering information that can be shared among individuals to evaluate proposals and ideas. A more detailed explanation of the concept can be found in [1], and Vincent has created an experimental explorer at [2]. Additionally, there is a public Graphql API available at [3]. Vincent hopes that his project will be beneficial to others who are interested in studying the Lightning Network.[1] provides detailed information: https://github.com/LNOpenMetrics/lnmetrics.rfc[2] offers an experimental explorer: https://lnmetrics.info/[3] provides access to the public Graphql API: https://api.lnmetrics.info/</summary>
