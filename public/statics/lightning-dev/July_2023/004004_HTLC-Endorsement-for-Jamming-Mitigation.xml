    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, participants explored the potential damage that could occur in the protocol due to routing fees and on-chain fees. The suggestion was made to choose a different threshold for routing fees based on the preference of each node. It was acknowledged that the reaction of a target node to an attack is not standardized by the BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) protocol and can vary depending on factors such as node activity. Therefore, it was proposed to focus on solving simpler cases first before addressing more complex scenarios.The concept of reputation-based mitigation strategies was introduced, with the idea that the difficulty to gain reputation should be proportional to the amount of damage an attacker can inflict. However, there was a divergence of opinions regarding the soundness of relying solely on reputation as a mitigation solution. The cost function of an adversary is difficult to formalize, as factors such as the adversary's capabilities, source of information, and attacking strategy are unknown or hard to predict. It was argued that a monetary-based mitigation strategy, which quantifies the worst possible damage inflicted from the perspective of the target node, would be more ideal.Compensating the victim of an attack was seen as a positive direction. However, it was noted that measuring reputation solely in monetary terms may have limitations. The discussion also touched on the challenges of proving theorems in the context of soft criteria, such as user experience and ease of implementation. The participants mentioned ongoing simulations to test the quantifiable criteria and determine if theory aligns with practice.The difficulty of mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks was highlighted, and it was acknowledged that the available tools for dealing with such attacks within the Lightning Network context may not provide perfect solutions. The possibility of using blockchain-based tokens as a basis for a monetary strategy in DDoS attack mitigations was mentioned, citing the Tor project blog as an example. The participants emphasized the need for a rigorous analysis of any jamming solution, similar to modern cryptanalysis, in order to provide measurable bounds and effectively evaluate their effectiveness.In conclusion, the participants recognized the importance of further simulations to assess the impact of proposed solutions on HTLC routing traffic. It was noted that DDoS attacks are notoriously challenging to mitigate, and the Lightning Network community is striving to do its best within the available tools and knowledge.</summary>
