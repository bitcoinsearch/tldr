    <summary>The Lightning Network community is proposing a reputation-based mitigation strategy to address channel jamming attacks. Nodes will track local reputation for their direct peers based on their history with all HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) forwarded to them. Reputation will be slow and expensive to build, fast to degrade, and examined relative to recent routing activity.Nodes that forward fewer HTLCs will have difficulty building a good reputation with active routing nodes. However, this should not significantly impact their activity as they don't require much from their peers. Small and low-activity nodes may face competition for liquidity during an attack but can still interact with similar nodes to build a good reputation.To gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking, the Lightning Network community plans to observe the effect of endorsement in steady state, collect real-world data for simulation work, and experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. Nodes will allocate slots and liquidity for endorsed HTLCs based on reputation and risk tolerance.The discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list also explores the limitations of reputation systems in providing security guarantees. While reputation data can be valuable, sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks make it unreliable for guarantees. Nonetheless, choosing a channel counterparty with a demonstrated track record of competence and reliability is preferable.The Lightning-dev mailing list, hosted by the Linux Foundation, serves as a platform for developers and enthusiasts to discuss and develop the Lightning Network. The email includes links to relevant GitHub pages, such as Carla's gist page and a pull request for Bolts by Lightning, as well as a circuit breaker equipment page. The mailing list subscription link is provided at the end of the email.In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Christian expresses skepticism about the usefulness of reputation systems in lightning due to their vulnerability to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks. Antoine Riard suggests that reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic is necessary to address vulnerabilities in the HTLC endorsement scheme. Carla Kirk-Cohen shares updates on channel jamming and proposes data gathering for HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking. The conversation discusses the impact of attacks on large routing nodes and the importance of differentiating between fees and reputation revenue. A discussion also arises regarding gossiping about reputations in a decentralized network and the potential issues that may arise. The email thread concludes with an update on an upcoming call for channel jamming and offers to help with implementation details.The Lightning Network community focuses on mitigating channel jamming through the proposed two-part scheme of HTLC endorsement and reputation. Antoine emphasizes the need for reputational transitivity and equal acquisition cost between hops in a payment path. Carla provides updates on channel jamming efforts and invites further discussion during an upcoming call. The community aims to gather data for simulation work and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. Antoine also mentions Staking Credentials as an approach to mitigate channel jamming and provides a link for more information.The email thread highlights the vulnerability of the HTLC endorsement scheme and the importance of reputation acquisition cost. It discusses the impact of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability and the challenges of coupling historical liquidity buckets with the endorsement scheme. Carla's updates focus on channel jamming, data gathering, and the proposed two-part mitigation scheme. Antoine adds insights on upfront fees and reputation acquisition cost based on market forces. The thread concludes with an invitation to discuss implementation details and an expression of gratitude for helpful updates.Overall, the Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming through the HTLC endorsement scheme and reputation systems. They emphasize the need for transitivity and equal acquisition cost between hops in a payment path. Data gathering and experimentation are key components of their efforts, with the aim of developing effective algorithms for tracking local reputation. The community values open communication and collaboration through channels like the Lightning-dev mailing list to drive innovation and progress in Lightning technology.The email thread discusses the usefulness of reputation systems in the Lightning Network and their vulnerability to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks. However, it is suggested that fees can be used to put a price on having a good reputation, and nodes can go rogue but the price of a good reputation would be similar to the damage they can cause. Gossiping about reputations is not done, only whether an HTLC should be granted access to all resources or just the restricted part.The discussion then focuses on the data collected from individual senders and how it can inform decision-making. It is proposed that large routing nodes may have sufficient data to make informed decisions, while edges may be more vulnerable. However, edges are also used by fewer senders, making the impact of an attack smaller. The hope is that data collected from volunteers will provide more insight into these issues.Another aspect of the discussion revolves around the proposed HTLC endorsement system for compensating for damages caused by jamming attacks. Questions are raised about whether the fees paid through the endorsement system fully compensate for the damage and if the ratio between fees and reputation is static</summary>
