    <summary>Michael Folkson, a developer, recently expressed his interest in a Knots-style fork of Bitcoin Core in C++ integrated with Core Lightning in C. He believes that it is the better option for serious production use cases as it avoids reimplementing consensus code in a different language. According to him, if you are ultra-conservative about consensus code, you either want to run Core in parallel with your alternative implementation to check they don't go out of consensus or you want to run the same consensus code as Core in a Knots like fork. Michael also mentioned the dysfunction on the Bitcoin Core project this week and how the current way the project is being managed is not how he would like an open-source project to be managed. He further added that the libbitcoinkernel project was (is?) an attempt to extract the consensus engine out of Core but it seems like it won't achieve that as consensus is just too slippery a concept and Knots style consensus compatible codebase forks of Bitcoin Core seem to still the model. He is floating the idea to hear from people who are much more familiar with the entirety of the Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases. He admitted that it would be an ambitious long-term project but it would be nice to focus on some ambitious projects for a while. In response to Michael's tweet, Fabian suggested Mako as a good starting point for what Michael wants to achieve.
