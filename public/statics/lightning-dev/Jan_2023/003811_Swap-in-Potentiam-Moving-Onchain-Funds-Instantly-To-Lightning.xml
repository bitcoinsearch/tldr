    <summary>In a proposal shared on Lightning-dev, ZmnSCPxj detailed a contract with two participants, Alice and Bob. The contract has two branches: an onchain/channel branch for Alice and Bob and a timelock branch for Alice with a relative timelock measurable in weeks via `OP_CSV`. The proposal was compared to splice outs and Dave raised concerns about the proposal's advantages over splice-outs. While the proposal allows Alice's LN wallet to remain offline indefinitely, it only provides the benefits of sending onchain payments before the first LN transaction, whereas splice-outs can be used any time in a channel's lifetime to immediately send on-chain payments.</summary>
