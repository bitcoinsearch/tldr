    <summary>During the recent fortnightly channel jamming mitigation calls, several topics were discussed. The meeting focused on introducing a "proof of forward" approach to prevent hop colluding, implementing upfront fees to nodes without them adding up along the route, and deploying a simple solution for economically-efficient solutions in a decentralized marketplace. The group also discussed the need for a reputation system for LSP Specification Group that is working on standard metrics about what makes a node good/bad to connect to in a decentralized marketplace.Any changes to the Lightning Network that aim to address channel jamming attacks will be significant, and cross-layer consensus building may be needed if cross-layer mitigation design is required in the future.In another recent Lightning Network developer meeting, two major topics were discussed. The first topic was the introduction of an optional jamming mitigation feature for relaying nodes. The group agreed that it was fair for relaying nodes to initially upgrade but not enforce the feature, and later forward traffic to determine whether it is appropriate to require the feature. It was also noted that wallets tend to upgrade less frequently, so this type of network upgrade would require input from wallets, designers, and application developers.The discussion then moved to the proposal for upfront fees as part of the jamming mitigation strategy. The group discussed several shortcomings of this approach and potential solutions, including a "proof of forwarding" mechanism using a locking mechanism or a taproot tree for all HTLCs. The group also discussed how to address spamming in the network.Other updates include a Circuit Breaker UI providing node operators with information about payment failures on their nodes, a Tokens Update architecture document added to the proposal, and Reputation discussions in LSP Specification aimed at providing standard metrics for good/bad nodes in a decentralized marketplace.The Lightning Network development team recently held a call to discuss channel jamming attacks and potential solutions. Attendees agreed to continue with calls every two weeks, aiming for a 30 minute meeting with the option to extend to an hour if necessary. The Lightning Network is looking for input from stakeholders as any change to address channel jamming attacks will be significant but necessary. There are many questions to be discussed, so the team plans to break down the problem into smaller parts to make progress. Links to meeting transcripts, pull requests, and other relevant information are provided in the email. Those interested in contributing can reach out to Carla and Clara via email.</summary>
