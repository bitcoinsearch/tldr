    <summary>Michael Folkson, a member of the Lightning-dev community, expressed his interest in creating a bare bones Bitcoin implementation integrated with Core Lightning. He believes that the current management of the Bitcoin Core project is not how he would like an open source project to be managed as very little discussion is public anymore and decisions seem to be increasingly made behind closed doors or in private IRC channels. Michael thinks that Knots style consensus compatible codebase forks of Bitcoin Core are the model for the future. However, there are questions regarding whether it makes sense to mix C and C++ code that people have different views on. Furthermore, the libbitcoinkernel project was (is?) an attempt to extract the consensus engine out of Core but it seems like it won't achieve that as consensus is just too slippery a concept. Michael is floating the idea to hear from people who are much more familiar with the entirety of the Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases. The creation of this implementation would be an ambitious long term project but it would be nice to focus on some ambitious projects for a while given that there seems to be a lull in soft fork activation chaos. Fabian suggested that Mako could be a good start for what Michael would like to achieve.</summary>
