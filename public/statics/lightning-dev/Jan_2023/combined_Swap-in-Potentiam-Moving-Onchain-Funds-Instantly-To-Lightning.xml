    <summary>The article discusses a new protocol called Swap-in-Potentiam that aims to solve the slow process of moving funds from an on-chain-only address to the Lightning Network while minimizing trust requirements. The protocol allows immediate transfer of already-confirmed-received on-chain funds to Lightning and enables atomic swaps between different blockchains without the need for an intermediary or exchange service.The contract has two participants, Alice (the funds owner) and Bob (its potential swap partner), and requires a cooperating LSP. The message protocol involves several messages sent between Alice and Bob, and the plan is to reserve only one odd BOLT1 message ID and embed the actual swap-in-potentiam message ID as the first two bytes of the BOLT1 message. ZmnSCPxj proposed a contract with two participants, Alice and Bob, which has an on-chain/channel branch for Alice and Bob and a timelock branch for Alice. This proposal was compared to splice-outs, and Dave raised concerns about the proposal's advantages over splice-outs. The email thread also discusses the advantages of using a covenant in establishing a channel. To solve the problem of mobile wallet apps not being able to perform a splice-in until it is opened, users can receive on-chain funds with a swap-in-potentiam address. The potentiam swap is a deferred two-stage swap that can only be completed after three transactions, making it less efficient from an on-chain perspective compared to the Loop In swap. However, it gives Alice more optionality and enables the final step of sweeping on the chain to be batched with other related or distinct swaps.Laolu suggested that the Loop In swap addr can be made pseudo-reusable by adding a "cancel" leaf in the rooted tapscript, but it would slow down the process. In another proposal, at some point x blocks before Alice expects she might want to spend her funds on LN, she enters into a contract protocol with Bob. At any time, with Bob's cooperation, she can send an onchain transaction or fund a fully initialized LN channel from which she can immediately send LN payments. The proposal's advantages include allowing Alice's LN wallet to remain offline indefinitely and being easier to implement than splice-outs, but it only provides the benefits of sending on-chain payments before the first LN transaction is made. Actual splice-out can be used any time in a channel's lifetime to immediately send on-chain payments. Finally, the email thread discusses how the swap-in-potentiam protocol has potential benefits, but further research and development are needed to refine and improve the protocol for wider adoption and use cases.</summary>
