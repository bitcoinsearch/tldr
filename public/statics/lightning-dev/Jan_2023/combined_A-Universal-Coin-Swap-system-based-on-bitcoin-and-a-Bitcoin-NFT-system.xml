    <summary>Aymeric Vitte has proposed a simple NFT system and a universal coin swap system based on Bitcoin blockchain. The NFT system is intended to be sold or bought and can serve as proof of ownership. The proposal explains the advantages of using Bitcoin over Ethereum or any other blockchain/sidechain in detail. Both systems aim to be simple, secure, decentralized, easy to implement/use, and not expensive for users. The NFT system proposed by Aymeric is stored in OP_RETURN and does not flood the Bitcoin network with unnecessary data. The trust model here is reputation-based, where if someone cheats, they lose their Bitcoin or get tagged as a cheater, which can have consequences later. In comparison to Lightning, Aymeric sees the NFT system as more suitable for one-time deals, where buyers and sellers don't know if they'll transact again.The Universal Coin Swap system proposed by Aymeric is similar to the Lightning network but less sophisticated. The proof of deals in this system is also stored in OP_RETURN, and the trust is based on a reputation model. This system aims to work for all blockchains/tokens and is not expensive for users. Both proposals are intended to be decentralized, but some tools/wallets must ease the process for users.The author expresses confusion about the current discussion on ordinals and states their opposition to using them as an NFT system or for storing things in witness. They clarify that NFTs can be real things and proposes a simple NFT system based on the Bitcoin blockchain that is easy to implement, secure, decentralized, and not expensive for users. The author also proposes a Universal Coin Swap system based on Bitcoin that works for all blockchains/tokens. This system is meant to be simple, understandable, and show that Bitcoin can do what Ethereum is doing in a much simpler manner. The proof of deals is stored in OP_RETURN and is decentralized. Aymeric invites comments and review on his proposals and provides links to his CV, LinkedIn, GitHub, and other projects he has worked on.</summary>
