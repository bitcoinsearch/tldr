    <summary>The Lightning Network email discussed various topics related to the network. One of the main topics was upgrading the network to support an anti-jamming mitigation that requires a network-wide upgrade. It was suggested that relaying nodes initially upgrade but not enforce the feature until later when they can determine whether it is appropriate to require the feature. Wallets tend to upgrade less frequently, and upfront fees were also discussed, specifically a draft proposal for upfront fees that implements the first of a two-part jamming mitigation.The discussion on upfront fees focused on various solutions to address issues such as spamming in the network. A "proof of forwarding" mechanism was proposed, and attendees debated whether to deploy a simple, capped upfront fee or wait for a future steady state where nodes have significant traffic. The Circuit Breaker was also updated and now has a UI that provides node operators with information about payment failures on their nodes. Finally, an architecture document was added to the proposal for Tokens.Another key topic discussed in the Lightning Network email was channel jamming attacks and potential solutions. Attendees proposed implementing fees for opening channels to dissociate those paying the fees from those benefiting from the credentials. They also discussed developing a reputation system to provide standard metrics about what makes a node good or bad to connect to in the context of a decentralized marketplace. The LSP specification group has bi-weekly calls and welcomes additional participants. Any change to the Lightning Network that aims to address channel jamming attacks will be a significant change to the protocol and will require input from many different stakeholders. Interested parties are encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns, and links to relevant resources are provided throughout the post for further information. The next call for channel jamming mitigation will be held on Monday, February 6th, 2023, at 18:00 UTC.</summary>
