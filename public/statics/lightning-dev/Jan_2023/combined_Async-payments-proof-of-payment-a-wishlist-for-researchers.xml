    <summary>The Lightning Development mailing list recently discussed an open research question regarding how invoices can be sent and received in an offline environment when supporting "async payments" in the Lightning Network. The proposed solution involves using keysend, but with additional data encoded by the sender in the form of a nonce, payment time and amount. However, this scheme wouldn't provide proof-of-payment but it would allow the sender to prove when and how much they sent. Several solutions were presented, including PTLCs and Trampoline payments, that could solve this problem. AMP provides reusable invoices that can be posted anywhere on the internet, enabling a sender to attempt payment without the receiver being online. However, there is no standard that has emerged yet to encode proof-of-payment information. The research question is about creating a scheme that allows a regularly-offline receiver to create a reusable invoice for their LSP to provide to senders while maintaining proof-of-payment. One possible direction suggested is to stick with keysend, but have the sender encode a nonce + the time they sent the payment + the payment amount as a tweak to the keysend PTLC point, and make the receiver tweak their point with the same data when fulfilling the payment. Another solution is using BIP340 signature or AMP extension called "invoice tunneling." The setup also allows for separate LSPs: one to issue nonces while the recipient is offline and the other to hold onto incoming PTLCs. Previous discussions on this topic can be found in the provided links.</summary>
