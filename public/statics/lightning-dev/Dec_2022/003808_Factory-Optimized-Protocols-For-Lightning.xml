    <summary>In this post, John makes two corrections. Firstly, he corrects the link for reference [8] to be https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-February/003479.html as pointed out by David A. Harding. Secondly, John describes an extension of the FFO protocol, which is not feasible due to a problem where revealing the per-commitment key would allow the other party to spend the output. The issue can be resolved by having the party that put their State transaction on-chain create a new Individual transaction that spends the first output of their State transaction.</summary>
