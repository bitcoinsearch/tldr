    <summary>The email exchange discussed the framework for evaluating attack mitigations and other dimensions that could be integrated into the evaluation framework. One of the proposed frameworks was to consider centralization, protocol evolvability, and ecosystem impacts. The proposal to combat jamming in Lightning Network was also shared by Sergei Tikhomirov and Clara Shikhelman. Their proposal suggests using a combination of unconditional fees and local reputation to fight against DoS attacks. During the discussion, the trade-offs between privacy, fees, and success rate when routing payments on the Lightning Network were also highlighted. The researchers acknowledged concerns around the unconditional fee policy and timing asymmetries, but believe that their proposal strikes a good balance and is relatively straightforward to implement. Other aspects that were considered for any mitigation strategy included effectiveness, incentive compatibility, user experience, privacy and security, and ease of implementation. The proposal has been well received thus far, with some discussion around the use of upfront fees in the Lightning UX and the need for a good formula to calculate reputation. The researchers plan to discuss their proposal at the next spec meeting. They also emphasized the importance of evaluating any mitigation framework not only based on its ability to protect and compensate attackers and victims, but also considering its impact on centralization, protocol evolvability, and ecosystem.</summary>
