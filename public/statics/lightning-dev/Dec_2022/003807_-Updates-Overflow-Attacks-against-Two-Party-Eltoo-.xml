    <summary>The email conversation discusses the use of two-party eltoo with punishment and Mallory's ability to generate signatures for UA.0 through UA.n. The scriptPubKeys are defined as taproot(AB), taproot(AB/1, "IF CODESEP  CLTV DROP ENDIF OP_1 CHECKSIG") for UA.n and WB.n, and taproot(AB/2, "IF CODESEP  CLTV DROP ENDIF OP_1 CHECKSIG") for UB.n and WA.n. The setup allows each transaction to only spend from the transactions it is supposed to. It also mentions that lightning nodes can gossip mempool state for channel closes by pattern matching on the close transaction. Additionally, there is a discussion about how MEV miners will include the final state if it is at a reasonable feerate, even if it has too many in-mempool descendants. However, it is still an open question whether eltoo can work in a laboratory environment or in the wild.</summary>
