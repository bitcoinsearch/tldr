    <summary>The email conversation between Antoine and ZmnSCPxj discusses the issue of protecting against channel jamming in the Lightning Network. Antoine suggests that any mechanism to protect against channel jamming would lead to accidental instances of channel jamming due to spontaneous congestion. He also points out that with the present credential tokens scheme, the rate of spontaneous failure should still have to be encumbered by some entity, which would be the HTLC sender by default. Regarding the issue of a node B accepting node A credentials to provoke a jamming attack against A, Antoine doesn't think it is plausible because as long as node A is requesting its own tokens to accept HTLC forward, there is a compensation for the risk. The behavior of node B accepting node A to drain traffic through node A, in an attempt to jam it, would benefit node A due to the credentials acquisition cost.ZmnSCPxj suggests using the WabiSabi technique to make token transfer non-double-spendable. This could make it feasible for a forwarding node to accept tokens issued by a different forwarding node if the sender also transfers control of those tokens to the forwarding node. Both node A and B can then peacefully resolve the difference without attacking via a "clearing house" where they reveal how much of the credential issued by the other they have, in much the same way as free banks would resolve paper bearer bonds.</summary>
