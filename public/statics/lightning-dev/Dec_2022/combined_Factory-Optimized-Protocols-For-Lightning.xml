    <summary>The Lightning Network is a solution for Bitcoin that makes micropayments faster and more efficient. However, scalability issues arise when one party is unresponsive, which creates delays in payment receipts and can force the closure of an entire factory. To solve these problems, factory-optimized channel protocols have been presented, including the PFO, FFO, and FFO-WF protocols. These protocols make the resolution of HTLCs in channels independent of the latency to close the channel factory and allow HTLCs to be resolved on-chain without closing the channel factory. The FFO-WF protocol modifies the FFO protocol to add a relative delay before Alice can time out an HTLC offered to Bob, allowing Bob to stay off-chain after the HTLC's expiry. These developments are based on the TP protocol presented by Law and inspired by Lightning's use of HTLC-timeout and HTLC-success transactions. Recent proposals such as TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY covenant opcode and Channel Eviction from Channel Factories by New Covenant Operations highlight how Bitcoin developers are working on improvements to the Lightning Network. Overall, the protocols are a significant improvement to the Lightning Network, allowing factories to scale Bitcoin efficiently.</summary>
