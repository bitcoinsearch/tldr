    <summary>Antoine Riard discusses the eltoo/chia variant in comparison to lightning over bitcoin, liquid, ethereum, etc. The main innovation is to make it simple enough to be easily implemented. They also discuss the limitation of the publication of eltoo and how it can be overcome through a TLUV-like mechanism. Breaking symmetry in fully symmetric transactions allows Bob to distinguish between Alice's unilateral close and Bob's own unilateral close, which prevents cheating. Fast forwards protocol upgrade proposal based on update-turn in the LN-penalty paradigm could improve UX by reducing HTLC propagation latency. Asymmetric transactions proposed here prevent chains from building up in the mempool by requiring relative timelock. Watchtower-specific transactions do not break the 2*to_self_delay assumption, but they might leak watchtower topology to an adversary.The email discusses various methods for claiming funds in a new state scenario when broadcasting UB.n and CA.n. One approach is to use an adaptor signature or CTV-like approach. Additionally, the "sig-in-the-script" trick may work if UB.n scriptpubkey contains the signature for CB.n, SB.n, RB.n, although there may be issues with re-generating the witnessscript in case of state loss. The email also mentions the challenge of paying watchtowers and ensuring fair and reliable compensation for their fees. The suggestion is to give the watchtower a pre-signed transaction WA.n to set up a new lightning channel with initial capacity of "my funds". The channel's state can be updated off-chain so that the watchtower's balance reflects the contribution in fees the user is willing to make. If the watchtower acts, the user can claim a penalty via WA.n-&gt;RA.n. This method does not generalize to redundant untrusted watchtowers, but it may still be profitable even if the user gives up to the penalty to the watchtower. To allow fast-forwards, when Alice proposes a new state, she needs to send her partial signatures to allow Bob to unilaterally accept the new state.</summary>
