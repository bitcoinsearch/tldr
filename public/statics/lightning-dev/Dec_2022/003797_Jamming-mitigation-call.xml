    <summary>A Lightning-dev mailing list has been discussing various strategies to mitigate spam on the network. One suggestion is to charge for services and account for the consumption of prepaid services. This approach is similar to the Indranet lighting project and would discourage attackers who prey on networks where the economics favor them. The use of onion routing is seen as a loss-leader unless anonymous payments are included, which itself is considered a utility for LN.The upcoming meeting's agenda includes three items: reputation-based solutions parameters, circuit breaker congestion control of HTLC flows, and onion relay network uses. Developers have suggested that meetings be held monthly instead of biweekly, but a summary will be provided for those who can't attend. There have also been suggestions for maintaining a community repository for issues, problems, and ideas.The email exchanges between Clara Shikhelman and Antoine Riard revolve around the agenda for an upcoming meeting regarding unjamming Lightning Network. One of the main points discussed is which parameters should be considered in reputation-based solutions. Antoine suggests that before thinking about these parameters, they should first discuss the security goal they aim to achieve with any potential jamming solutions.Different solutions have been proposed to tackle jamming on the network, such as increasing the opportunity cost for attackers, reducing jamming intensity, inflicting on-chain fee damage cost back to the adversary, or achieving economic hedge of the routing hops. Circuit-breaker and congestion control of HTLC flows are also discussed during the meeting. Another topic under discussion is the onion relay network and its potential uses and rate-limits. They suggest leveraging more the channel-network topology for the design of a solution. Finally, reliable transcripts are recommended to maintain a community repository where issues, problems, and ideas can be recorded. The frequency of the meeting is also discussed, with some developers raising concerns that biweekly might be too much and suggesting once a month could work well if there is a sound agenda.</summary>
