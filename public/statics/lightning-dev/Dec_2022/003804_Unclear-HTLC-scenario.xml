    <title>Unclear HTLC scenario</title>
    <updated>2023-06-03T11:17:02.357542+00:00</updated>

    <summary>A user named Ben sent a question to the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding how update_fail_htlc messages are handled in the case of an HTLC being forwarded along a channel that does not have the funds to support a payment of that size. The response from SomberNight is that this scenario is handled earlier than update_fail_htlc, as sanity checks will fail and the recipient will not commit it to the commitment tx. The specific section of BOLT #2 that addresses this is also provided as a link for reference. If the recipient decides to simply close the transport connection, the update_add_htlc message is forgotten, and the channel returns to a usable state. The original email from Ben is included for context.</summary>
