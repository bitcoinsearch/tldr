    <summary>In this context, John clarifies that he was not arguing to make Taro a BOLT or move things from the edge. He explains that the capabilities which will allow Taro to interact with LN should be designed to accommodate any outside layer/network. He gives specific examples of requirements that are really just new features for LN nodes that do not need to be network/layer-specific. He does not care whether this is framed as BOLT or BLIP content, but he cares that this is framed and designed correctly, so they aren't locked into one specific outside layer. ZmnSCPxj explains the difference between "the edge" vs "the core" and discusses two topics: Advertising Exchange Rates and Routing Between Channels Of Different Asset Types. In the case of Advertising Exchange Rates, without changing the BOLT protocol, a particular odd featurebit can be defined that cross-asset exchanges can set. Whereas in the case of Routing Between Channels Of Different Asset Types, ZmnSCPxj suggests dropping the 'realm' byte and instead adding a new type for TLV, which would have 20 bytes. Finally, ZmnSCPxj points out that this is a change in "the core", and it is possible to do, but it needs implementation from at least one other implementation.</summary>
