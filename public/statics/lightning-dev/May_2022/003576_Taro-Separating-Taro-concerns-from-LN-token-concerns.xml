    <summary>In a recent email exchange between Lightning Network developers, it was revealed that there is a difference in vision between the parties involved. Instead of updating the core network to accommodate Taro assets, the plan is to leave the protocol unchanged and add new TLV extensions so that edges can be aware of and interact with Taro assets. This approach avoids the need to advertise exchange rates over the existing gossip protocol. Additionally, the team discussed problems that arise when using H/PTLCs and American Call Options. As a result, multi-asset "on the edge" is being proposed as an alternative to widespread deployment in the published Lightning Network.</summary>
