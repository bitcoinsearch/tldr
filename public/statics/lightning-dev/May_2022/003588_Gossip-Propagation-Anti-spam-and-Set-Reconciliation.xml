    <summary>In this conversation between Rusty Russell and Matt Corallo, they discuss using a single sketch for all peers and the potential issues with per-peer handling. They also debate on whether or not rough consensus should be enforced globally and if it is possible to solve the problem of updates being rejected by some peers but accepted by others. Additionally, they talk about non-update based sketches and how channel_updates are a large portion of gossip. Overall, the conversation revolves around optimizing peer handling and gossip updates in order to ensure smooth synchronization across the network.</summary>
