    <summary>In this conversation, the speaker clarifies that they are not arguing for moving things from the edge or making Taro a BOLT. Rather, they are explaining that the capabilities needed for Taro to interact with LN should be designed to accommodate any outside layer/network. They give specific examples of requirements that LL is portraying as Taro Layer design, but which are really just new features for LN nodes that do not need to be network/layer-specific. These include making LN nodes aware of assets on other networks, establishing commitments for atomic swapping for payments/routing, supporting the ability to exchange and advertise exchange rates for asset pairs, and supporting other multi-asset routes when considering routing paths, bridging nodes with alternate assets. The speaker emphasizes that they do not care whether this is framed as BOLT or BLIP content, as long as it is framed and designed correctly to avoid being locked into one specific outside layer. The speaker argues that an LN node that wants to be aware of an outside network, and extra assets in addition to Bitcoin, will need such features, and such features are not Taro-specific. Additionally, the speaker links to a discussion about the American Call Option problem that arises when using H/PTLCs, which is one reason for proposing multi-asset "on the edge" rather than widely deploying it in the published Lightning Network.</summary>
