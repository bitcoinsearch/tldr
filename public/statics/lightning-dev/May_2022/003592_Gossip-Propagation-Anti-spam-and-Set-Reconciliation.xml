    <summary>The discussion is about improving set reconciliation, a process for ensuring that all nodes in the Lightning Network have a consistent view of the network state. One proposal involves rate-limiting updates to 100 blocks and including a block height TLV with each update. Another proposal involves creating sketches based on recently received gossip rather than the full gossip store. There is concern about what happens when nodes receive conflicting updates due to rate-limiting violations. A possible solution is to offer a spam proof to the offending node with both messages signed as evidence and then removing both from the sketch. There is also discussion about the benefits of a single global sketch versus per-peer sketches. Finally, there is disagreement about whether these proposals require a gossip "hard fork" and how much extra cost might be incurred.</summary>
