    <summary>In a recent blog post, Lightning Network developer René Pickhardt discusses how selfish behavior of nodes sending Bitcoin over the Lightning Network can lead to higher drain on channels, resulting in higher depletion and failure rates for payments on the network. These observations were derived purely from statistical measures and computations on the data that the Gossip Protocol and Bitcoin Network provides about the topology of the Lightning Network. Pickhardt hopes that these effects won't be too strong for the expected traffic and usage of the network so that the technology will work properly at the required scale. He welcomes thoughts, feedback, comments, and questions on his findings. In response to Pickhardt's article, Gregorio writes a letter discussing an idealized scenario in which the Lightning Network (or any similar payment network) has scaled to the size and volume of a self-sustained economy. In this scenario, there is a tendency towards a state where exactly n-1 channels have perfectly balanced flows in the two directions ("self-balancing" channels), while all other channels are either unused, or have a permanent tendency towards imbalance. Gregorio notes that the "self-balancing" channels form a spanning tree of the network graph, which he calls the "core spanning tree" of the payment network. He wonders if rebalancing and fee management tools are really enough to contrast the tendency toward imbalance and suggests considering other strategies to “work with the imbalances” instead of fighting them.</summary>
