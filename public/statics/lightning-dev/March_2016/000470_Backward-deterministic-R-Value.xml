    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a participant named CJP posed a question regarding how deriving R values from a tree structure works for larger Lightning networks. Specifically, CJP asks if different transactions follow different routes, does that mean the tree structure has to be shared across all nodes? Nicolas Dorier responded to this query and expressed his own confusion about how it solves the problem of hashing in advance. Rusty Russell then chimed in and revealed that shachain is a variant of the idea which avoids generating several million hashes in advance, though he did not spell out the idea in his Deployable Lightning paper. The thread also includes a link to a post by Adam Back where the concept was initially introduced.</summary>
