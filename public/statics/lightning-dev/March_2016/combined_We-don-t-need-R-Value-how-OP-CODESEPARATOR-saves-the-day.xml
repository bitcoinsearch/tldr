    <summary>In a discussion that took place on March 8, 2016, Joseph Poon and Nicolas Dorier discussed the use of signatures for revocation in payment channels. They explored a proposed change to the script which would involve adding OP_CODESEPARATOR and reducing the byte count for removing duplication. One suggestion was made to disclose temporary private keys instead of signatures for compactness. To demonstrate, a compact, revocable example script was provided.During the conversation, they also discussed adapting the payment channel script to save space, with a comparison provided between the old and new versions. The need to store one R value per commitment was mentioned, as well as how nodes would react when old commit tx are published, as they would have to fetch the signatures.Furthermore, there was a reference to a post on bitcoin-dev about SIGHASH_NOINPUT and the problem it was trying to fix. They noted that it is possible to make it just a multisig output with the child transaction spending from it pre-signed as well using nSequence, but that requires more storage and more on-chain transactions. While this design is not necessary for this particular instance if there's OP_CSV.It was also mentioned that the use of OP_CODESEPARATOR may become useful if there is SIGHASH_NOINPUT inside segregated witness in the future.</summary>
