    <summary>A member of the Lightning-dev mailing list wrote a message questioning how nodes would react when old commit tx are published with the new scheme instead of R+shachain/elkrem. The author of the script responded by stating that they managed to adapt the payment channel script to use less space. They claimed that this version is winning around 32 bytes in the scriptpubkey for the R value, as well as 70 bytes in the signature when Alice closes the channel. The author provided links to show how Alice closing the channel and Bob using revocation works with the new script. In total, the savings amount to 100 bytes between the anchor transaction + commitment broadcasted.</summary>
