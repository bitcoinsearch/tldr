    <summary>Jerome, a member of the Lightning Network community, has proposed the idea of multi-party channels, which he calls JoinChannels. These payment channels involve more than two participants and offer several benefits over traditional 2-2 payment channels. One significant advantage is that JoinChannels take up less blockchain space; for example, a JoinChannel with three parties linked together requires only one multisig(3/3) transaction on the blockchain, whereas three 2-2 channels would require three multisig(2/2) transactions. Another benefit is that JoinChannels enable bigger transfers of value through LN since an intermediate LN node can put the sum of their funds in a JoinChannel instead of spreading them across multiple 2-2 channels.However, a downside to using JoinChannels is that all participants must be online to participate in an LN transfer, which could be problematic if the payment needs to go through multiple JoinChannels with hundreds or thousands of participants. Jerome also provides an example showing that JoinChannels enable bigger transfers of value through LN.Additionally, another member of the Lightning Network community suggests a way to address the issue of all participants needing to be online for JoinChannels to work effectively. They propose a consensus-enforced sequence number system that would lock transaction outputs similar to coinbase outputs rather than preventing a transaction from being included in the blockchain. Transactions could double-spend these transactions as long as they had higher sequence numbers. This idea could be implemented through a soft fork, and there would be fees to pay to get into the pending list. To sign a state change, you would need the moderator's agreement and anyone who would lose money by the change. The hub would likely act as the moderator, and there would have to be a penalty if the moderator signs the same state number twice.</summary>
