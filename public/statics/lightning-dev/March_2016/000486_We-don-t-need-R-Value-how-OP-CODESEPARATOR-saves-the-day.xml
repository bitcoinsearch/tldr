    <summary>In an email conversation between Joseph Poon and Nicolas Dorier, the former clarified that SIGHASH_NOINPUT was intended to address storage requirements. Meanwhile, Dorier discovered an unusual use of OP_CODESEPARATOR where it can be used to enforce branch execution. This means that a single pubkey can enforce the execution of a particular code path by selecting which part of the script to sign. While this doesn't offer new possibilities for Bitcoin, it provides potential space savings. It's also useful in multi-party multi-signature situations where parties only want to sign off on particular conditions that are guaranteed to be executed.</summary>
