    <summary>In an email conversation between Nicolas Dorier and Mats Jerratsch, Dorier mentions that Alice could potentially want to receive more money and accept other payments, but not a particular one. However, by doing so, she would automatically disclose R for any old payment. Mats Jerratsch responds by stating that he is not sure what Dorier means as Alice does not have to disclose R if she does not want to. The email includes contact information for Mats Jerratsch as well as his PGP signature.</summary>
