    <summary>Alice has a channel with Bob which ends up with 100BTC in Bob’s favour. Alice then broadcasts the obsolete 50/50BTC commitment tx as well as her revocable tx. Bob sees this and breaches, but his breach tx is not picked up in blocks. Alice follows up by broadcasting (or privately sending to major pools) the tx: Alice 50BTC -&gt; Alice 25BTC. She is offering miners to share Bob’s 50BTC with her. For miner M, Alice's tx is worth 25BTC * P(M mines block) * P(nobody else mines Bob's tx). If everyone is locally profit maximizing, that last term depends on how many small miners there are.</summary>
