    <summary>On March 8, 2016, Martijn Meijering, a member of the Lightning Network development team, proposed the introduction of a new opcode for signature verification in Bitcoin's scripting system. The proposed opcode would be used for verifying arbitrary but appropriately length-restricted messages and could simplify the Lightning Network protocol by eliminating the need to reveal hash preimages and maintain mirror images of transactions. Instead, users could sign a message that revokes a previous balance with a hash and sequence number. Meijering asked if he was overlooking anything and suggested that the new opcode could substantially simplify the LN protocol. This proposal was discussed on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
