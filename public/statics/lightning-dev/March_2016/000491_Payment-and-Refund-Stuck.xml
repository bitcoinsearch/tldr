    <summary>A GitHub repository has been set up to document the Lightning protocol, which allows developers to collaborate on the implementation of the protocol. The repository was created by Matsjj and given admin access to a number of users. However, Ajtowns believes that the layout is too nested and proposes a simple way to move ideas into and through the repo without politicising proposals. Rusty's two BOLT proposals, the shachain design txt and other early drafts such as Joseph's 2-of-3 Instant Escrow are among the documents that will be added to the repository.</summary>
