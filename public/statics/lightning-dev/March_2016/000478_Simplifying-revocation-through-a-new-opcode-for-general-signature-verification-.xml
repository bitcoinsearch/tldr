    <summary>The author proposes the introduction of a new opcode for signature verification for appropriately length-restricted messages as a means of simplifying the Lightning Network protocol. This would eliminate the need to maintain mirror images of transactions and reveal hash preimages. Instead, signing a message that revokes a previous balance with a hash and sequence number would suffice. The author questions whether they are overlooking anything and suggests that this new opcode has the potential to substantially simplify the LN protocol.</summary>
