    <summary>In a 2016 email thread, Rusty Russell discusses Peter Todd's belief that small miners are more important than big miners. According to Peter Todd, while miners provide the service of "mining a block," their most valuable service is being independent from other miners. This independence ensures that no single entity controls over 50% of the hashing power in the network. Small miners are actually the most efficient at providing this independent hashing power. The email thread also includes a link to a relevant Bitcointalk forum discussion from 2012. Despite its age, the thread remains interesting and relevant to the topic at hand.</summary>
