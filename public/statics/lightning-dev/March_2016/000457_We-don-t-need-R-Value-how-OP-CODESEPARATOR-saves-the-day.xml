    <summary>The payment channel script has been modified to consume less space, with the version saving around 32 bytes in the scriptpubkey and 70 bytes in the signature when Alice closes the channel. The updated script can be viewed through two checkscript links provided for Alice closing the channel and Bob using revocation. In total, this amounts to 100 bytes being saved between the anchor transaction and commitment broadcasted.</summary>
