    <summary>In this email thread, Fabrice Drouin asks about the reaction of nodes when old commit transactions are published using a scheme without R + shachain/elkrem. Nicolas Dorier responds that he has adapted the payment channel script to use less space and provides links to checkscript for Alice closing the channel and Bob using revocation. He states that this adaptation results in 100 bytes saved between the anchor transaction and commitment broadcasted. The email is part of the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
