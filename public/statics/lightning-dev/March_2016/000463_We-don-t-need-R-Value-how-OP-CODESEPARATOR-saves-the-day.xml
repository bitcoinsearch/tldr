    <summary>Nicolas Dorier and Rusty are discussing a useful case for the OP_CODESEPARATOR. This hack has a caveat: ensuring that no commit transaction is identical to a previous one. Additionally, all previous signatures must be stored to avoid problems with both the original draft scheme and the deployable lightning chain-of-hashes. However, since these scripts will hardly ever hit the chain, it may be considered a premature optimization. Despite this, Rusty commends Nicolas on his great work.</summary>
