    <summary>The concept of one way deterministic RValue Generation is discussed in a post by Nicolas Dorier. Rusty Russell, in response to the post, confirms that shachain is a variant of this method which avoids generating several million hashes in advance. Interestingly, Russell had suggested using hashing in the Deployable Lightning paper but did not elaborate on the idea. The post also includes a link to Adam Back's contribution to the discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list in May 2015.</summary>
