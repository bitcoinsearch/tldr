    <summary>Rusty Russell, a bitcoin developer, and Mats Jerratsch have been discussing the use of protocols for payment channels. Rusty has proposed using binary protocol over JSON for wire formats to ensure only one possible representation of any given message and make parsing as simple as possible. They also discussed the use of an open-coded messaging system versus protobufs for efficiency. They have agreed on using a length word prefix for initial key exchange and network ID prefix for packets. The conversation also addressed HTLC pipelining and aborting stages, version bits, anchor tx renegotiation, R value vs. keypair, and multi-sig txs. Finally, they talked about connection/node failures and the need for a new crypto handshake and state saving to resume conversations.</summary>
