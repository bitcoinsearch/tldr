    <summary>A new scala implementation of "deployable lightning" has been released on Github by ACINQ. The implementation is intended to have an actor per lightning channel and keep everything non-blocking, making it fully compatible with Rusty&amp;aj's implementation. It uses the same protobuf messages and a similar state machine. There is also some prototyping on the soon-to-be-replaced onion routing. In addition, Bryan Bishop shared several other related git repositories on the Lightning-dev mailing list, including lnd, lightning-onion, lightning, and thundernetwork. However, he has not reviewed any of the source code for quality, security, or functionality. Pierre expressed his excitement for an agreement on the wire protocol.</summary>
