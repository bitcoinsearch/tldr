    <summary>In a message thread on January 27, 2016, Rusty Russell discusses the differences between shachain and elkrem, which are used to generate revocation secrets in order to minimize storage. They are similar but elkrem is easier to understand. In another part of the thread, they discuss the difference between using an R value and keypair scheme versus a simple secret "redeemhash," which allows easy tracing of transactions through the network. The group also talks about multi-sig txs, where more than one hash can be allowed, enabling escrow-style services such as GreenAddress.it. There is some discussion around indexing with regards to shachain and elkrem, with the group preferring Rusty's construction for its simplicity. There is also a debate around adding this feature to version 1.0 of the protocol.</summary>
