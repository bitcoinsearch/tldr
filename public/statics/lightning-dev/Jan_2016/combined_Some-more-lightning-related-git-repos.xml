    <summary>Bryan Bishop shared some links to various repositories related to Lightning Network, including two he found on the -wizards IRC channel: https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd and https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion. He mentioned that he hasn't reviewed the source code for quality, security or functionality. Bryan also shared other repositories that have related work: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning and https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork. In a separate email, Pierre shared another repository that is a scala implementation of "deployable lightning" called https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair. It should be fully compatible with rusty&amp;aj's implementation and uses the same protobuf messages and a similar state machine. There is also some prototyping on the soon-to-be replaced onion routing.</summary>
