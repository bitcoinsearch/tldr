    <summary>The new release of Lightning Network, named by a new contributor Anthony Towns, has been announced. The release features a daemon that performs the crypto handshake, creates connections with other daemons, negotiates and fulfills HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts), and closes them. However, the daemon lacks the capability to steal old transactions if they are published, handle unilateral close with HTLCs, or negotiate routing or fee negotiation. Currently, there are many known bugs and only a few tests have been conducted. Plans for the next release include fixing all remaining unhandled inter-node protocol cases, more testing and bug fixes. Additionally, the developers plan to revisit the crypto and packet format in comparison to https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd. A guide to the source can be found at https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/HACKING.md.</summary>
