    <summary>The author of the 02-wire-protocol.md draft has created a protocol simulator to test the draft and ensure its reasonableness. The simulator also generates timing diagrams as a bonus. The author concludes that we don't need acknowledgement numbers because the revocation reply provides everything necessary. The revocation reply is when incoming changes are added to the other side as "acked". The author states that this process seems to work well in all corner cases, and it's wire-optimal. For those interested in a layman's write-up, the author has provided one at https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/lightning-inter-node-protocol-a-primer-c642816c8b8#.8skw6hfar. The full spec can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/rustyrussell/lightning-rfc/blob/master/bolts/02-wire-protocol.md, and tests are available at https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/test-protocol/test/test_protocol.c and https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/test-protocol/test/commits. Feedback is welcomed by the author, Rusty.</summary>
