    <summary>The author of the email is about to modify the HTLC scripts for the first time in a while by prepending "OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUALVERIFY". This change means that timing out an HTLC requires a 32 byte value, but it is the simplest and shortest change. Without this change, the length of a scriptsig which redeems a transaction was ill-defined because an attacker could create an HTLC with different preimage sizes that wouldn't work with nodes using wire protocol. Additionally, the per-side HTLC limit will be dropped from 1500 to 450 in BOLT #2. The purpose of this is to ensure that a single "steal" transaction that spends all the inputs is still under 400k cost, simplifying the protocol. A responder on the mailing list mentions that the Segwit's witness program validation logic ensures that each element of the passed witness stack is less-than-or-equal-to the maximum script element size (520 bytes). Therefore, even without the additional OP_SIZE check, Script will enforce a ceiling on the pre-image size. The responder also notes that they have made similar observations about the scripts recently.</summary>
