    <summary>Kumaigorodskiy Anton suggested that the current limitations of Lightning Network could be addressed by implementing a channel refill procedure which would allow users to receive payments larger than what is currently locked in a channel, issue multiple small invoices and make payments even after their side of channel balance reaches zero. Rusty Russell, an expert in Bitcoin and Lightning Network, agreed with this idea and referred to it as "re-anchoring." Essentially, re-anchoring involves creating a new funding transaction that spends the old one plus additional inputs and providing signatures for both transactions until the new one has become deep enough to drop the old signatures. This process could also be used to pay non-Lightning bitcoin addresses. Russell believes that re-anchoring will likely be the first extension implemented once the basics of Lightning Network are sorted out.</summary>
