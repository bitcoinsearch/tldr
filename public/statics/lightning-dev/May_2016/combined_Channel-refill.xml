    <summary>The Lightning Network (LN) has some edge cases such as not being able to receive a single payment larger than what is currently locked in a channel, or making payments once one's side of the channel balance reaches zero. However, Kumaigorodskiy Anton proposed a "channel refill" procedure that could be implemented. This would work by using the same pair of commit_keys, resulting in a second utxo on the anchor address, and creating a separate "refill commitment tx" which does not invalidate the current "main commitment tx". Once the on-chain refill tx reaches the required depth, a new "main commitment tx" is created which takes into account the new utxo and old "main commitment tx", and the "refill commitment tx" is invalidated. One advantage of refill over new channel creation is that overall channel capacity would grow each time so after a number of refills no more of them may be needed for a long time. Rusty Russell agreed that this was a good idea and had been calling it "re-anchoring" since it is more general than refilling the channel. The new funding transaction would spend the old one, plus some additional input(s). For the duration, signatures are provided for both the old funding transaction and the new one. When the new one is deep enough, the old signatures can be dropped. This is also how you would pay non-lightning bitcoin addresses: the new funding transaction spends the old one, has one output to the address and one to the 2of2. Re-anchoring is expected to be the first extension once the basics are sorted out.</summary>
