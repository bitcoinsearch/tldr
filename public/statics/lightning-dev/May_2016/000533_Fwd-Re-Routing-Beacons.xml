    <summary>In an email exchange between Rusty Russell and LaurentMT, they discuss the update of routing tables in relation to the Lightning Network (LN). LaurentMT references a protocol called Pulse Protocol which sends periodic messages from landmark nodes to update routing tables. Rusty suggests that the landmark would be a channel as this is easier to select on, but he finds LaurentMT's idea of temporal framing new. Temporal framing involves the periodic message sent by landmark nodes to initiate a new frame and update routing tables. When a node receives the first message associated with a new temporal frame for a given landmark, it waits for a delay before forwarding the message to its own neighbors, giving them a chance to receive the same message from a better route. After the delay has elapsed, the node computes the best route to the landmark node and forwards the message, defining the temporal frame and best route to the landmark node, to its neighbors.Every node repeats this process, resulting in every node knowing the best route to/from a given landmark. This information can be used for onion routing when a node needs to send a payment, where the receiver sends their best routes to each landmark node, allowing the sender to compute the best route to reach the receiver.LaurentMT raises several questions, including how fees are associated with nodes, what models could be used for fees, and whether simulations would be useful. They agree that fees should be collected by the node pushing the HTLC into the channel, which implies that they set the fee unilaterally for that direction. They also suggest that simulations could offer insight into routing table updates in the Lightning Network.</summary>
