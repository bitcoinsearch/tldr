    <summary>On May 12, 2016, the Lightning team held a meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine to discuss potential improvements for the Lightning Network. One topic discussed was the issue of edge cases where one cannot receive a single payment that exceeds the currently locked-in channel capacity. The proposed solution was to implement a "re-anchoring" or "channel refill" procedure. This would involve creating a new funding transaction that spends the old one, plus additional inputs. Signatures would be provided for both the old and new funding transactions until the new one is deep enough, at which point the old signatures can be dropped. Re-anchoring could also be used to pay non-Lightning bitcoin addresses.Rusty Russell, a member of the Lightning team, expressed support for the idea of re-anchoring and suggested it may be the first extension implemented once the basics are sorted out. The proposed advantage of re-anchoring over creating a new channel is that overall channel capacity would grow each time, reducing the need for repeated refills in the future.</summary>
