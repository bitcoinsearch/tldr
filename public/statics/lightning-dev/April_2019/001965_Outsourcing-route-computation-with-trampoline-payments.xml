    <summary>ZmnSCPxj has proposed a design for a trampoline-level onion that would allow replacement of the first hop of the onion. In this design, the first hop of the "inner" trampoline-level onion is sent "in the clear" while the outer link-level onion still encrypts it. The node receiving the trampoline-level onion checks if it is the first hop and decrypts the rest of the onion to route to the next trampoline-level node. If the node cannot find the front of the trampoline-level onion, then it can route it to another node that it suspects is more likely to know the destination. ZmnSCPxj provided a concrete example to illustrate his proposal. However, he is uncertain about the details and security implications of this proposal as he is neither a cryptographer nor a mathematician.</summary>
