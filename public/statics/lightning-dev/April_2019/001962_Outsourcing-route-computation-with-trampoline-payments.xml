    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list recently discussed an issue with trampoline nodes unintentionally creating overlapping routes. This occurs when a trampoline onion is created and the node receiving it finds that the direction with low capacity, so it routes over the outer onion instead. This creates an overall route that may skip some nodes, including the trampoline. However, it was determined that this is not actually an issue as HTLCs still resolve correctly and the overall payment remains atomic and secure. The skipped nodes may lose some fees, but this is no different than a failed payment attempt being retried from the sender.</summary>
