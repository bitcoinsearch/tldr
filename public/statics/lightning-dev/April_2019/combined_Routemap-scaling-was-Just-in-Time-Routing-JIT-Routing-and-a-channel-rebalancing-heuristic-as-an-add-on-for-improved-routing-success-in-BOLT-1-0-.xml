    <summary>The Lightning Network's gossip protocol has been a topic of discussion, specifically around how nodes filter incoming information and whether they leak hints about their stored data. One proposal suggests that nodes probabilistically filter incoming information or signal their peers to do so based on the given filter. The current proposal for organizing nodes involves using a global quadtree, where each bucket represents a view over its four children. However, some members are hesitant to divide the world in such a way as it could lead to undesirable separation between endpoints and core networks. Instead, they propose synthesizing an artificial "distance" measure based on hashing a node's public key and treating it as a signed number. This would allow nodes to determine their own depth in the tree based on the amount of information they want to gossip.Pruning heuristics in the Lightning Network were also discussed, with suggestions to probabilistically prune channels based on channel capacity. However, this approach loses determinism and makes testing difficult. ZmnSCPxj proposes concatenating a node's public key with the short-channel-id of the channel, hashing the combination, then using the hash as the seed of a random number generator (RNG) to prune the channel if the generated bit is cleared. One proposal suggests replacing "aggregate-channels" with "high-capacity channels" to improve routing efficiency. Nodes would still need to track their direct channels, but payee nodes making BOLT1 invoices could also provide 'r' routes in the invoice from nodes with high-capacity channels so that even if intermediate channels are pruned due to low capacity, payment can still be made.Finally, the potential dangers of using buckets or subsections to organize gossip in the Lightning Network were discussed. It was noted that this approach could split up the network, leading to undesirable separation between endpoints and core networks. The proposed quadtree-based solution aims to reduce the maximum or typical route length to query and improve efficiency. It involves treating the problem as a spatial indexing problem, using the lexicographical space of node ids (or hashes of), similar to DHTs. Payments within a bucket can be made without querying, and payments to another bucket can rely on local routemaps, with JIT routing for the second half if required. To address the issue of unbalanced trees due to population density, an equal-population-per-area projection can be used. Autopilot implementations may also need adjusting to consider distance. However, privacy concerns must be addressed, and a convention could be created where each bucket represents an approximate physical location. The globe can be spatially-indexed as a quadtree using a tetrahedral map projection, potentially improving routing for local trade.</summary>
