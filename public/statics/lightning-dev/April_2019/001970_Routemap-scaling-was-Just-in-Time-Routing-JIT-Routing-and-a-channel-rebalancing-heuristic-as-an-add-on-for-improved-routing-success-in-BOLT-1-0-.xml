    <summary>In an email exchange between m.a.holden and ZmnSCPxj on April 6, 2019, they discussed proposals related to octrees. ZmnSCPxj proposed a global tree with each node having a bucket and four child nodes, while the theoretical maximum depth is HASHLEN/2. On the other hand, m.a.holden raised concerns about taking down or taking over a node near the root of the tree in such a proposal. In response, ZmnSCPxj argued that in his approach, there is no tree, and therefore each node is far less important.</summary>
