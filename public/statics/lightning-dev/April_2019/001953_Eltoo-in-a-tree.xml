    <summary>The email discusses the concept of channel factories, which are a type of cryptocurrency system. It references the Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer Channel Factories and the Fulgurite discussion. The email suggests that channel factories will be created after Decker-Russell-Osuntokun ("eltoo") is online, which requires a `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`. The email goes on to provide a hierarchy of types for cryptocurrency systems, which includes blockchain and offchain cryptocurrency systems. The Decker-Wattenhofer system is mentioned as a multiparty option that requires long locktimes on unilateral, while Decker-Russell-Osuntokun is a multiparty option that requires short locktimes on unilateral. The email concludes by stating that the NOctaHub is another offchain cryptocurrency system that allows for nesting other offchain cryptocurrency systems inside it, similar to how Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channels work.</summary>
