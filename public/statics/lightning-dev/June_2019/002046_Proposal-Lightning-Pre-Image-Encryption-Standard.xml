    <summary>In a recent conversation, Stepan and ZmnSCPxj discussed the issue of incompatibility in lightning applications. While Stepan suggested that it is up to app developers to decide on compatibility, ZmnSCPxj expressed concerns over the proliferation of incompatible applications or apps that only work with specific wallets. However, both parties agreed that this is still an early stage of development, and creativity may be more important than optimization. In addition, ZmnSCPxj proposed the idea of creating guidelines for different lightning use-cases. He suggested that a separate Lightning Application Protocol Proposals (LAPP) repository could be created, which would be dependent on BOLT but not vice versa. Furthermore, existing protocols like WebLN and Thor could be included in this repository. Regarding the original topic of data providers being trusted to provide accurate data, ZmnSCPxj raised concerns over the difficulty of proving that data provided by a data provider is bogus. While an escrow system might be useful, it requires integration with proof-of-payment. ZmnSCPxj also noted that switching to payment points/scalars could help with integrating proof-of-payment. However, this is delayed by Bitcoin getting Schnorr, unless they want to use 2p-ECDSA today and reimplement under Schnorr when Bitcoin gets it.</summary>
