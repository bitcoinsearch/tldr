    <summary>In this email thread, Ugam asks for clarification on the BOLT #3 protocol for Lightning Network. Pierre responds that the HTLC-Timeout transaction is timelocked. However, Ugam is still unsure and shares his thought process. Nadav also chimes in, sharing a pull request he opened to clarify the issue. Ugam later realizes his mistake and thanks everyone for their help. The discussion highlights the complexity of the Lightning Network protocol and the importance of clear communication and collaboration among developers.</summary>
