    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list has been discussing proposals to change the Lightning Network specification to add new BOLTs. One proposal suggests using PTLCs instead of HTLCs, which would be possible with Taproot. An interactive shared secret generation between buyer and escrow could allow spontaneous payment to the seller. Another construction called “Bitcoin-compatible Virtual Channels” was discussed in the same thread. This construction ensures that no party loses funds when the virtual channel needs to be closed. ZmnSCPxj and Pedro also discuss the mechanics of virtual channels and the importance of widespread upgrade.ZmnSCPxj proposes a new twist to an old idea in a recent email exchange. He suggests making two payments of the same amount instead of using a logical OR operator for escrow-related cases. The initial stake required from buyers could make it difficult to onboard new users who do not already have bitcoin. However, he believes that parents could provide their children with the initial stakes needed to start transacting over such a system.In another email thread, the participants discuss various aspects of payment channels and escrows on the Lightning Network. The first message praises a previous post about accomplishing ORing points without verifiable encryption. Nadav suggests using barrier escrows to accomplish this. The second message follows up on the topic of dual-hash HTLCs and their support in the current LN spec. ZmnSCPxj explains that while they are not supported and PTLCs are overall superior, it is possible to develop a 2HTLC extension for L2 wallets to work with the current version of Bitcoin.The article discusses the use of payments and Barrier Escrows to implement Boolean logic, showcasing its potential for complex use-cases. Another proposal on the lightning-dev mailing list suggests implementing escrow over Lightning using a 2-of-3 multisig amongst two participants and the escrow, where the escrow only learns about an escrowed trade if a dispute arises. The proposal also discusses optimizing the scheme under bip-taproot and the use of ECDH shared secrets between escrow, buyer, and seller. In a separate conversation, the author proposes adding a new BOLT to support a Lightning-based escrow system without modifying existing implementations. Lastly, Pedro explains the use cases and benefits of virtual channels, including situations where Alice may want to try out a new web service or participate in two-party computation with Bob.In an email thread, ZmnSCPxj proposed a new twist to the old idea of Payment-Point Time-Locked Contracts (PTLCs) that involves inverting the logic by making two payments of the same amount. The first payment is from the seller to the buyer, claimable by the buyer and escrow key, while the second payment is from the buyer to the seller, claimable by the seller key. The seller hands over the item once both payments are made, and if the buyer is satisfied, they fail the seller-to-buyer payment after the seller claims the buyer-to-seller payment, and the seller is paid with no more obligations. If the buyer is dissatisfied, they can ask the escrow to judge, and the escrow will either reveal the escrow key to the buyer, who can then clawback the payment to the seller if the escrow judges in their favor, or delete the escrow private key, and the Seller-to-Buyer payment eventually times out, ending the obligation of the seller.The article discusses how Boolean logic can be converted into two standard forms, sum-of-products and product-of-sums, and proposes the use of reversal payments and "option not to release scalar" to express any Boolean logic. The article provides an example of creating a binary oracle that can provide two points based on the outcome of a coin flip and demonstrates how to set up a bet using two oracles. Nadav shared his thoughts on constructing a composable negation operation, while Christian Decker spoke about functional completeness and how any Boolean logic can be expressed using a set of payments in various directions and Barrier Escrows.In a situation where there are multiple participants involved in making payments, it can be challenging to represent the logic of payments going back and forth between them. However, it is still possible to do so. The key challenge lies in finding a minimal representation for a given expression, which would then minimize the funds committed to a particular instance of the expression.This process involves representing the flow of payments between the participants. It may be difficult to visualize this flow, but with the right tools and techniques, it can be achieved. The ultimate goal is to ensure that each participant contributes the minimum amount necessary to fulfill their obligations in the payment system.One of the key considerations in this process is the minimization of risk. By reducing the amount of funds committed to a particular instance of the expression, the risk associated with the transaction can be significantly reduced. This is particularly important when dealing with large transactions or complex payment systems.Overall,</summary>
