    <summary>The vending machine generates a new ephemeral key for every invoice, including for spontaneous payments. Additional information can be provided to the node about the payment by misusing the short channel id field, such as including a "payment purpose" or user ID. However, this is a workaround and has a limit of 8 bytes. The preferred method would be to have a metadata field in the invoice that can be passed to the payee in the onion packet, but this requires changes in the bolt 11 and is already on the roadmap.</summary>
