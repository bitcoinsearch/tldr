    <summary>Nadav proposes adding encrypt-then-mac on chunks of data for users to authenticate that they received the intended data. Stepan suggests leaving the details to app developers, but ZmnSCPxj worries about incompatible applications and suggests creating a Lightning Application Protocol Proposals (LAPP) repository for LAPP developers. They also discuss the issue of trusting data providers and the need for an escrow system. ZmnSCPxj suggests using 2p-ECDSA Scriptless Script until Bitcoin gets Schnorr, which has more security. Nadav clarifies that the proposal is intended for use cases in which a data provider is trusted. They all agree it would be great to have a good place to put proposals on a git repository.</summary>
