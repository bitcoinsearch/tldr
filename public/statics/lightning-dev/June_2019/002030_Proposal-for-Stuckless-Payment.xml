    <summary>In a message to Hiroki, ZmnSCPxj suggests that the `y0+y1+...` sums used for payment decorrelation will be sent in onion packets in a new phase called Pre-Settlement. This modification adds the cost of three new messages but reduces other preventive messages. However, adding the ACK-key turnaround may allow intermediate nodes to guess the payer's distance. ZmnSCPxj is uncertain how to weigh this as getting some information about the payer may lead to attempts at censorship. Additionally, the added latency of payments may worsen with the use of ACK-key turnaround despite multiple tries in parallel being possible. Finally, ZmnSCPxj believes that the "American Call Option" problem may be solved by this solution, but further consideration is required for correctness.</summary>
