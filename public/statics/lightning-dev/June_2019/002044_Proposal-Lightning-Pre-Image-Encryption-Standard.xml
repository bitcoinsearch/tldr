    <summary>The idea of splitting large data and FEC-encoding it in chunks with each chunk having a separate MAC is considered great by the author. The process of error correction and checking MAC before decryption should be ideally done, so for larger data, it makes sense to split it into smaller chunks and MAC each of them. The receiver will use error correction to deal with errors and check MAC of the chunk before decrypting it. However, the details regarding this depend on the application and communication channel, which is left to the app developers. The author suggests having proposals and interesting ideas from the mailing list in some kind of guidelines for different lightning use-cases. They feel that the BOLTs repo is not the right place to put it and propose organizing some kind of lightning-guidelines repo for lapp developers. This would prove to be useful for developers.</summary>
