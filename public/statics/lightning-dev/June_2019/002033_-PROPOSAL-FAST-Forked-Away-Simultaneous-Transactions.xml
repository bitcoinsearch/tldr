    <summary>The email thread discusses a proposal by Ugam Kamat for simultaneous payments to multiple parties using the same partial route. The proposal suggests repurposing the onion blob in a similar way as the Spontaneous Payment proposal with slight modification, which can lead to no path duplication and lower fees for on-chain settlements. However, there are concerns raised regarding the probability of transaction failures increasing as the transaction is dependent on 2/3 branches. Additionally, it is noted that the proposal can only work for spontaneous payments as it would be impossible to bundle the hashes generated by the invoices and extract the pre-image. The advantages of the proposal include lower routing fees for Alice and fewer HTLCs added, while the deployment can be done by nodes that can handle branching of payments. The proposal may need some balance to strike, and further research is required to resolve some issues with proof of payment.</summary>
