    <summary>The conversation starts with a proposal to ensure accuracy of nodes in recording events by adding timestamps for certain events. However, it raises concerns about strong synchronization of all nodes' clocks to some global clock and the possibility of error if any node's clock is off. The concern is that if a later hop delays a successful payment, an early or late node along the route can be "dinged" for it. The sender can decide to tolerate slight variations or abandon the synchronization requirement altogether. Joost suggests that the held duration is enough to identify a pair of nodes from which one of the nodes is responsible for the delay. In the given example, either B or C is delaying the payment, and the channel between B and C would be penalized.</summary>
