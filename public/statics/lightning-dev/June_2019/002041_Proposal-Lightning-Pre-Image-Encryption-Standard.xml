    <summary>In a conversation between Stepan, Nadav, and ZmnSCPxj, the group agrees that two suggested additions are good ideas. One addition involves Sally generating an invoice with the preimage `S`, which is the x-coordinate of a point made to be 32 bytes long. However, there is some confusion about whether Bob needs to attempt both positive and negative signs for the y-coordinate. Alternatively, Sally could always use a scalar such that the generated point has a fixed sign or some other property to derive the sign of the missing coordinate.</summary>
