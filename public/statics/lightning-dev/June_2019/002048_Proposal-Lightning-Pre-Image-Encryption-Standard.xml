    <summary>The conversation between Nadav and ZmnSCPxj is about adding extra protection to a payment protocol to make sure only the buyer can decrypt the data. Although sending encrypted data over a secure channel like HTTPS already provides some level of security, it also imposes an encryption/decryption overhead. This added protection will allow for sending data over both secure and insecure channels, without hinder use of secure channels. However, putting MAC inside the encryption would help ensure that we can detect data replacement over the insecure channel, and the use of shared secret ensures only the intended recipient can decrypt the data.</summary>
