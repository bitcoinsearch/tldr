    <summary>In this conversation, Joost and ZmnSCPxj discuss concerns about the synchronization requirement between nodes in the Lightning Network. They suggest an alternative solution of using active probing and tracking persistent data per node to record total imposed delay and number of attempts. This would allow for more accurate cost adjustments when finding a route for a "real" payment, as well as penalizing specific nodes for failures. They also mention the possibility of penalizing channels between nodes if a delay is detected on a payment route. Finally, they recommend that the unit of measurement be milliseconds and state that these changes would not require any alterations to the current spec.</summary>
