    <title>Proposal: Lightning Application Standards [LAS]</title>

    <summary>Recently, a proposal was made for a standard to encrypt data with the pre-image that is being revealed over Lightning. After discussing with various people in the ecosystem, it has been suggested that a repository should be created for organizing Lightning Application Standards (LAS). The aim is to build standards so that Lightning app developers can design their LAPPs to be compatible with other LAPPs, making it easier for wallet developers to hook into different LAPPs with a standard.It has been proposed that LAS's should be kept separate from the BOLTs, which are designed to define the low-level Lightning protocol. Compliance with BOLT standards is imperative for Lightning implementations, while LAS's are more like suggestions to make communication and interaction between different apps more standardized. This encourages the idea of separating backbone implementations of the Lightning network from higher level wallet software, making it easier for library developers to distinguish what they want to support versus what BOLT compliant implementations need to support. For now, it has been suggested to reuse the current lightning-rfc repo for pragmatic reasons.The author believes that BOLT11 could be considered a LAS since it does not talk about the actual Lightning protocol but rather provides a canonical way to encode information about the protocol to end users, similar to bitcoin addresses.</summary>
