    <summary>The discussion begins with the proposal of nodes putting timestamps for certain events to ensure that nodes can be forced to be accurate about what happened. However, a concern arises about whether all nodes along the route must have their clocks synchronized to some global clock and what would happen if some global clock service is attacked in order to convince nodes to route to particular nodes on the Lightning network. It is up to senders how to interpret the received timestamps and they can decide to tolerate slight variations. Additionally, the held duration is enough to identify a pair of nodes responsible for the delay in payment. In the given example, either node B or C is delaying the payment and the channel between them would be penalized.</summary>
