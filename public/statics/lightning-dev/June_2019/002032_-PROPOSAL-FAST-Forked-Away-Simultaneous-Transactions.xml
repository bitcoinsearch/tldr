    <title>[PROPOSAL]: FAST - Forked Away Simultaneous Transactions</title>

    <summary>In an email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Ugam Kamat proposed a new idea for simultaneous payments to multiple parties using the same partial route. The proposal works in a similar fashion to Olaoluwa Osuntokun's Spontaneous Payment proposal by packing additional data into unused hops. The proposal reduces the number of commitment transactions and therefore lowers fees in case of on-chain settlement and routing fees for the sender as Bob and Charlie would not get to charge for two routings. On the other hand, it increases the probability of transaction failures since the transaction is dependent on 2/3 branches. Not all nodes need to support this feature, and the nodes that can handle branching of payments can signal that using global features.</summary>
