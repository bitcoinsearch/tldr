    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, has opened a pull request on Github to implement BIP 2 and mark it as active. This also implies activation and implementation of BIP 123. Luke plans to merge this on December 14th, and anyone with hard objections to this change is requested to bring it up on the bitcoin-dev mailing list before then. In the meantime, further reviews of the implementation are welcome, but any requests for changes to the BIPs themselves should only be made if they are a blocker or trivial. In the process of implementing BIP 2, Luke found a number of BIPs that were added to the repository without a proper license. Authors of any of these BIPs are requested to open a pull request adding the necessary Copyright section and License header(s). The affected BIPs are listed in the context above. If there are other contributors to the document in the BIP git logs, Luke will try to reach out to them to get permission. Overall, the implementation of BIP 2 and the need for licenses for various BIPs have been addressed by Luke Dashjr, and interested parties are encouraged to review and provide feedback.</summary>
