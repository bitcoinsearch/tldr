    <summary>The idea of a special payment request protocol that allows for negotiation of multiple routes and details between payer and payee has been proposed. This would involve the payee's QR code containing a server address and other information necessary for the payer to establish a connection with their device. The payer could then ask for H(R)+routing, and continue to re-ask for more routes or retry failed payments if necessary. The use of maintenance servers could facilitate this process, with each coffee shop potentially having its own. While there is currently no complete retry logic in place for multipath transfers, clients may soon be able to decide whether to perform such payments if the recipient signals acceptance.</summary>
