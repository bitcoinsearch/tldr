    <summary>The email conversation discusses the benefits and challenges of maintaining multiple channels in lightning network. Having a single channel has drawbacks such as relying on a single peer, which can be a possible point of failure. However, opening multiple channels is beneficial for fault tolerance and privacy. Wallets opening a single channel by default would leak all its user's transfer amounts, making profiling very simple. There are several questions that need to be addressed, including how many channels should be opened, what the fee per channel should be and how many funds can be relayed at max. The issue of insufficient capacity along the path from the sender to the recipient needs to be dealt with anyway. The client may construct a route that has insufficient capacity at some point. Abstracting the underlying mechanics away can cause confusion for users, and it is suggested that the Bitcoin model of having an available balance and an unconfirmed balance (across all channels, not per channel) be adopted. This simplifies the design since it makes channels unique per endpoint-tuple. Although a single channel does not solve all the issues, it makes them obvious to the user. It is suggested that wallets start with a simple system and add features as they go along.</summary>
