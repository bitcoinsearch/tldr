    <summary>The discussion on whether a mobile Lightning Network (LN) wallet should support only a single payment channel or multiple channels was debated by Anton Kumaigorodskiy and Christian. Christian believed that multiple channels would increase fault tolerance and privacy, while Anton argued that there were many annoying details and edge cases with opening multiple channels. However, they both agreed that multiple channels could increase connectivity in the network and lower the barrier for adoption.It is suggested that a mobile LN wallet should only support a single payment channel due to several reasons, including the fact that most LN nodes on mobile devices will be offline 99% of the time and thus not be of much use in relaying payments. Additionally, having one channel with a larger amount is better than having two smaller channels. It improves UX, simplifies UI, and lowers the barrier for adoption. However, adding multiple channel support later may be necessary.The use of multiple channels for relaying 3rd party payments is problematic as it can lead to a single point of failure. Having only one channel may not be efficient and could result in the user's funds being locked in HTLC. To deal with insufficient capacity in a path, signaling that multipath transfers are acceptable and retrying with a different path can mitigate this. Adopting the Bitcoin model of having an available balance and an unconfirmed balance across all channels instead of per channel is also suggested.It is important for wallet developers to understand that most users want an app that works seamlessly and do not necessarily need to know how things work. Therefore, it is crucial to consider end-user needs and simplify the process of using a mobile LN wallet.</summary>
