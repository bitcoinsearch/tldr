    <summary>In a recent discussion among Lightning Network developers, it was suggested that providing stake certificates in a point-to-point manner can increase privacy by reducing the likelihood of remote nodes tracking the payer. It is argued that since the node offering the HTLC already has funds locked in their channel which are known to the receiver, no proof is necessary for this model. However, some have doubts about the effectiveness of this model as it appears to be similar to the current Lightning Network which is vulnerable to "griefing" attacks. To address this vulnerability, payers or payees must set aside a separate non-trivial stake tied only to the stake certificate mechanism to alleviate forwarding nodes' concerns about delayed HTLC claims.</summary>
