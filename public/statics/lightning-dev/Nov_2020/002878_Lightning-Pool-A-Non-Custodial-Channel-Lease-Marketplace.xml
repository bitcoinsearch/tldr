    <summary>In a recent conversation, participants discussed the possibility of charging 0 fees for initially leased channels. However, this idea raised concerns about enforcing such a policy and ensuring that both parties sign off on each other's advertisements. To address these issues, the protocol may need to be extended to allow nodes to advertise certain pair-wise channel updates only valid if both sides sign off on them. Lightning Pool can use a node rating system to protect lease buyers from nodes that ramp up their fees after selling a lease. Effective utilization of the leased capital is another factor to consider. In rebalancing away incoming capacity, the channel lessor pays the lessee the forwarding fee and creates incoming capacity on another channel of the lessee. However, if the lessor provides a feerate assurance, this could lead to an actual loss. Rebouncing is good for the network as a whole and should be supported well.</summary>
