    <summary>João Valente has come up with a new concept for routing in the lightning network that uses information nodes have on the distribution of funds in their channels to try and maximize the probability of success for a payment. Each node shares the information they have about the distribution of funds in their own neighbourhood through the form of a routing table, which associates destination addresses (representing nodes in the network) to the next hop in the maximum capacity path to these nodes. If a new payment is to be made, a payment probe is forwarded by the payer and through every node in the path, collecting the path information along the way and reaching the payee who returns it to the payer. The payer can then use this knowledge and confidently use the discovered path to route LN payments through. However, Bastien has raised some concerns that the nodes might not honestly cooperate and could gossip biased or invalid information to their peers to attract more payments through their nodes and collect more fees or put honest routing nodes out of business. Bastien's main negative feedback is that João seems to assume that nodes will honestly cooperate.</summary>
