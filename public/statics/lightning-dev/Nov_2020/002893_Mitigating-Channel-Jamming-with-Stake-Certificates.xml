    <summary>In this email thread, several individuals are discussing a proposal for a new cryptosystem. One participant expresses appreciation for the innovative thinking behind the proposal but notes that the lack of a strong argument as to why this system is better than existing alternatives is concerning. Specifically, there is a question about whether channel jamming attacks are actually economically viable and whether the proposed system would prevent such attacks without inhibiting normal usage. Another participant raises concerns about the restriction on holding Bitcoins only in LN channels for stake certificates, as malicious users could potentially open channels with themselves or use taproot wallets. Additionally, there is discussion about the cost-effectiveness of using stake certificates to prevent attacks, as an attacker could potentially rent access to them for a relatively low cost. The thread concludes with further questions about the feasibility and potential drawbacks of the proposed system.</summary>
