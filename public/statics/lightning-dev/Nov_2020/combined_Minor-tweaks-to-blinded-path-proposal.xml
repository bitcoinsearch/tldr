    <summary>Rusty Russell, a developer working on the Lightning Network, has suggested using additive tweaks instead of multiplicative ones to improve the efficiency of the network. In a conversation with Bastien Teinturier, Rusty suggests that additive tweaks are faster and supported by the x-only secp API. He also proposes the use of x-only pubkeys, which can save space in the protocol. However, there are concerns about the security of the tweak and whether it is as secure as the multiplicative version. The proposed change involves replacing a multiplication operation with an addition operation in a specific step of the protocol. Rusty agrees to have a real crypto expert review the proposal to ensure its security. Overall, the discussion revolves around finding ways to improve the efficiency and security of the lightning network without sacrificing one for the other.</summary>
