    <summary>Rusty Russell, a developer working on the Lightning Network, has proposed using additive tweaks instead of multiplicative tweaks in a recent GitHub post. According to Russell, additive tweaks are faster and supported by the x-only secp API. He also suggests that using x-only pubkeys is generally trivial and can save a byte. He claims to have used them in offers to great effect. The link provided leads to the proposal for route blinding on the Lightning Network.</summary>
