    <summary>In an email thread, Gleb Naumenko proposed allowing any UTXO to be used for Stake Certificates, but faced pushback from Dave who pointed out the potential for malicious users to open channels with themselves and questioned how a stake certificate would prove that the UTXO was generated for LN. Dave also raised concerns about the effectiveness of preventing attacks if a user could rent access to stake certificates at a low cost. The current total channel balance of the public LN is estimated to be around 1,000 BTC, but this is expected to grow over time.</summary>
