    <summary>The author thanks Laolu for their hard work and inquires about the documentation and stability of the client/server intercommunications protocol. The author proposes a new idea for leased channels to improve risk-sharing and system health by charging 0 fees initially and then setting a nonzero channel feerate once the "should" fee matches the original lease cost. However, enforcing this is difficult since channel updates are unilateral and the lessee cannot afford to close the channel it leased if the lessor sets a nonzero feerate ahead of time. This idea reflects the expected low-risk rate of return and may be useful for market discovery. Additionally, the author notes that if all onchain UTXOs were signed with n-of-n, there would be no need for a fixed orchestrator, as all n participants would cooperatively act as an orchestrator. However, this requires cooperation and a broadcast medium, which could be achieved by electing a participant to receive and broadcast messages, similar to what an orchestrator does. Thus, there is a tradeoff to consider.</summary>
