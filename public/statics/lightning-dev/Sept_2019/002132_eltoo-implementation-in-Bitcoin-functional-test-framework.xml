    <summary>In an email exchange, Bastien from Acinq raised a question about the use of miniscript for lightning and how it could be more future-proof and extensible than directly using Bitcoin script. Richard Myers replied, mentioning that he had implemented the eltoo update scheme in the Bitcoin functional test framework to better understand and refine the Bitcoin scripts and message passing protocol for eltoo. The simulations exercise a concrete implementation of the eltoo Bitcoin scripts and explore the data flow between nodes that use eltoo to update their channel state. His motivation for creating these tests is to have a framework for understanding and refining the Bitcoin scripts and message passing protocol for eltoo. Richard also asked if anyone knew of any other eltoo implementations and expressed his desire to compare notes and get the ball rolling on a detailed specification.Richard's simulation uses a fork of Bitcoin with cdeckerâ€™s SIGHASH_NOINPUT patch applied to the signet2 fork fjahr created with patches applied for signet (kallewoof), taproot (sipa) and anyprevout* (ajtowns). The next steps include adding bidirectional channel updates and deriving public keys for settle transactions from a pre-shared basepoint. Richard also gave special thanks to the Chaincode Summer Residency and Christian Decker for their helpful advice and encouragement while he worked on this project.</summary>
