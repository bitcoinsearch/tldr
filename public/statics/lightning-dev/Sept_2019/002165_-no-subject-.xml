    <summary>Recently, there have been complaints about receiving blank emails. A user named Nongluck Loyha sent a blank email to the Lightning-dev mailing list on September 20th, 2019 at 02:19. The email contained only the standard mailing list information. The Lightning-dev mailing list is hosted by the Linux Foundation and can be subscribed to through their website. The issue of blank emails has caused frustration for some recipients, leading to calls for someone to put a stop to them.</summary>
