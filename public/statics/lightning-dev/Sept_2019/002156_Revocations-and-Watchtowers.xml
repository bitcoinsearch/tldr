    <summary>The email thread discusses the storage advantages of using SIGHASH_NOINPUT in lightning, which allows one to keep state around in just one transaction. Rusty created shachain to store O(n) transactions in O(1) space and O(log n) time to extract in case of breach. Watchtowers need to store all O(n) transactions they receive for a channel to protect against "poisoned blob" attacks. Even Decker-Russell-Osuntokun watchtowers either need to identify their clients or store all encrypted blobs related to a channel. There is no work done on watchtowers to allow them to have O(1) storage of channel state without leaking channel activity to the watchtower. The main advantage of Decker-Russell-Osuntokun is the possibility of having multiparticipant offchain updateable cryptocurrency systems.</summary>
