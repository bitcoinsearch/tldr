    <title>Proposal: AMPs With Proof of Payment</title>

    <summary>Nadav, a member of the Lightning Network mailing list, expressed excitement about AMPs (Atomic Multi-Path Payments) hitting the Lightning Network. However, he noted that it is not currently possible to do AMPs with Proof of Payment (PoP) since payment pre-images must be fully known to the payer. Nadav proposed that Payment Points could enable PoP-enabled AMPs. Once the Lightning Network moves to support Payment Points and PTLCs instead of Payment Hashes with their HTLCs, OG AMP can be modified in a simple way by adding a Payment Point, PP = pop*G, to each partial payment point. This will allow AMPs to enjoy all the benefits that come with PoP. Nadav believes that this is yet another compelling reason to move to Payment Points as soon as possible.</summary>
