    <summary>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal was made to create a new opcode called `OP_CHECKSIG_WITHOUT_INPUT` instead of using `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`. One member argued that there is no significant difference between creating a new opcode and creating a new tapscript public key type. They believe the difference is only in the encoding. The proposed new opcode would ignore any `SIGHASH` flags present on a signature, which can be redefined by new public key types.</summary>
