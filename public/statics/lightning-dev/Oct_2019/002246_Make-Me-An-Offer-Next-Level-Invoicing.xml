    <summary>At the Lightning Conference in Berlin, Rusty asked for use cases and feature requests for the next-generation Lightning invoicing. A contributor shared their previous work on an interactive protocol for direct communication between payer and payee. They proposed a way of thinking about payer/payee interaction as a virtual payment channel that can be updated by both parties, with desirable properties such as a state that can be updated, full refunds, partial refunds, and updates to what goods are to be delivered. The state updating mechanism requires special attention to aid in conflict resolution. Some advanced ideas include contracts between three or more parties and merging and joining of contracts in state updates.</summary>
