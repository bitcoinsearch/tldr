    <summary>The message contains a discussion about the possible use of Decker-Russell-Osuntokun, a transaction building technique used in off-chain payment networks. It is suggested that any update transaction could spend the funding transaction output directly, and thereby start the relative timelock. A trigger transaction is not necessary for Decker-Russell-Osuntokun if the funding transaction output can be arranged to be spendable directly using SIGHASH_NOINPUT or variants thereof. The message also discusses the use of special blockchain constructions only in the "bad" unilateral close case. In the cooperative case, it is recommended to use simple plain bip-schnorr-signed outputs getting spent to further bip-schnor/Taproot SegWit v1 addresses, to increase the anonymity set of all uses of Decker-Russell-Osuntokun and other applications that might use SIGHASH_NOINPUT in some edge case. The existence of unpublished channels in the Lightning network is mentioned, as well as the fact that historical channels that have been cooperatively closed are no longer normally gossiped. Finally, the importance of striving towards ideal cases is stressed, as well as the need to retain information about outpoints that used to be channels but have now been closed using cooperative closes.</summary>
