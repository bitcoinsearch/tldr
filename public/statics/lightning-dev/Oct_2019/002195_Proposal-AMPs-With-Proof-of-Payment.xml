    <title>Proposal: AMPs With Proof of Payment</title>

    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of implementing Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMPs) on the Lightning Network with Proof of Payment (PoP). It is stated that PoP is not compatible with AMPs because the payment pre-images must be fully known to the payer in advance, leaving nothing for them to learn atomically with payment completion. However, Payment Points and PTLCs can potentially allow for PoP-enabled AMPs. A proposed modification to OG AMP involves adding a Payment Point, PP = pop*G, to each partial payment point. This makes each payment scalar r_i + pop, allowing the receiver to add pop to each r_i which is required to complete each payment. The use of Payment Points is seen as a compelling reason to move to them as soon as possible.</summary>
