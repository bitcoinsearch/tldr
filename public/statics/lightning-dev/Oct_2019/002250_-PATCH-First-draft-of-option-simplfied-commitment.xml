    <summary>The context describes an additional spending path proposed for the P2WKH output type with a 10 block csv lock to prevent utxo set pollution. However, this proposal also opens up the possibility of an attacker using up the cpfp carve-out after the 10 blocks, affecting the important htlc expiration. The attack scenario doesn't make sense as the spend path is closed when the commitment tx is unconfirmed, but user A may not appreciate their anchor output taken when offline for more than 10 blocks. Therefore, it is suggested that this utxo set clean up path should be applied to every near-dust output on the commitment tx, including small htlcs.</summary>
