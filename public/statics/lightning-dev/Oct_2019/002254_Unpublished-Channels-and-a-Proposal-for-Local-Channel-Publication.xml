    <title>Unpublished Channels, and a Proposal for Local Channel Publication</title>

    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network protocol mailing list, has proposed a new method for nodes on the network to share information about unpublished channels. The current system allows one node to ask another if it can reveal information about a shared channel to friends of the asking node. However, the new proposal suggests that nodes could whisper to each other about unpublished channels they have with other nodes, which would allow them to break the Axiom of Terminus and share information about unpublished channels more widely. The proposal also suggests ways to mitigate the risk of LittleNode's history being learned by looking up the short-channel-id on the blockchain. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj highlights the possibility of creating subnets on the Lightning Network via Channel Factory, which could behave much like a node composed of nodelets. The tradeoffs between using channel factories and nodelets are discussed as well.</summary>
