    <summary>The debate around output tagging in the context of Taproot continues, as some express concerns about the potential impact on uniformity of UTXOs. However, others argue that it could be a useful tool to minimize the need for creative workarounds and reduce on-chain footprint. A proposed implementation plan for Decker-Russell-Osuntokun (DRO) includes the use of a translator transaction and SIGHASH_NOINPUT to separate timeout start and update/settlement pairs, with bip-schnorr-signed outputs getting spent to further bip-schnorr/Taproot SegWit v1 addresses in the cooperative case. Some also question the value of introducing chaperone signatures or output tagging if they can be sidestepped anyway. Open questions include general agreement on the usefulness of noinput/anyprevoutanyscript/anyprevout, support/opposition to chaperone signatures and output tagging, merging BIP-118 and bip-anyprevout, and any other considerations. While some express opposition to output tagging, others are ambivalent and mildly supportive of merging BIP-118 and bip-anyprevout. In conclusion, while cats may not be relevant to the discussion at hand, they are definitely cute.</summary>
