    <summary>In a Lightning Network discussion, Boomerang payment was compared to ZmnSCPxj's High AMP + Stuckless proposal. The former requires two layers of PTLCs and is based on pay-for-contract construction involving two PTLC layers, where the first layer has a pointlocked branch involving the signatures of both channel endpoints, while the latter combines High AMP with Stuckless to provide a similar facility. ZmnSCPxj raised several points against Boomerang which included more layers of PTLCs than their proposal, no incentive for the payer to fail the second-layer PTLC, and lack of cool hacks like Barrier Escrows. They believed that High AMP + Stuckless would be better than Boomerang.</summary>
