    <summary>The discussion among the participants is centered around the use of barrier escrows for payment points on LN. They are mainly focusing on pay-for-payment-setup and payment re-negotiation using barrier escrows. Payment points are conditional on some discrete logarithm-based access structures, including multisig-like access structures and oracle-dependent options.The proposed scheme involves grouping shares of a payment into parallel attempts, which requires locking up units of the payment amount. For instance, if a 10 mBTC invoice is divided into two sub-payments of 5 mBTC each and one gets stuck, the payer can use spare funds in another channel to make a new attempt. The stuckless ACK allows for precise control over how much the receiver can claim from these attempts.Creating more complex access structures using arbitrary AND-OR combinations would require further exploration and the use of verifiable secret sharing. Atomic multi-payment setup via barrier escrows can be used for return payment setup, cross-currency lightning nodes to avoid Free Option Problem, Lightning DLCs, and Lightning DLC options or one-way DLCs with a premium.Payment re-negotiation using barrier escrows can be used for selling DLC positions. Additionally, High AMP is interoperable with "Stuckless" payments. One possible milestone would be enabling atomic payments where the paying wallet specifies known paths with specific capacities to transfer the desired value in aggregate. A language like miniscript (perhaps called "Improv") that compiled to "Layer 3" protocol specifications would be useful. The participants plan to start writing these things up and adding them to the scriptless scripts repository. The Stuckless scheme could potentially achieve this by being composed with AMP.</summary>
