    <summary>The article discusses the Axiom of Terminus and how it affects payment analysis on the Lightning Network. The axiom states that a payment route may have an unpublished channel at one or both termini but not in the middle of the route. The article also goes on to explain how entities controlling large amounts of Bitcoin can closely monitor participants in the network, especially if they have significant numbers of unpublished channels. The article then proposes methods of breaking the axiom of terminus, such as local publication. It introduces new messages like the `request_local_unpublished_channels` and the `respond_local_unpublished_channels` that provide data about local unpublished channels. Finally, the article concludes with the usage and operation of these messages.</summary>
