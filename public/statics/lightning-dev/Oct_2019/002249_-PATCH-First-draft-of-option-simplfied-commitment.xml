    <summary>The Lightning Network is a protocol that allows for the establishment of payment channels between two parties and their use off-chain. To generate the commitment transaction, both peers must agree on `option_simplified_commitment`. This option simplifies the transaction and ensures minimal fees.Developers are considering adding a CSV time lock to every non-anchor output on the commitment transaction. This would involve adding 'to_remote_delay OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP' to the 'to_remote' output, and '1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP' to the non-revocation clause of the HTLC outputs. The anchor outputs will have new addresses that both parties communicate in the `open_channel` and `accept_channel` messages. Moreover, the anchor outputs will always have equal values and be paid for by the initiator.Once the funding transaction has reached the minimum depth asked for in `accept_channel`, the `funding_locked` message indicates this, and the channel enters normal operating mode. Each commitment transaction uses a unique `localpubkey` and a `remotepubkey`. The expected weight of a commitment transaction is calculated based on its various outputs, such as the local and remote nodes' main output, the local and remote nodes' push output, and the htlc_output.There are two types of HTLCs in the commitment transaction: local node's offered HTLCs and remote node's offered HTLCs. Without `option_simplified_commitment`, the two commitment transactions are not identical, but they are with this option applied. The `revocationpubkey` is a blinded key derived by the local node when creating a new commitment transaction. The document aims to ensure the safety and security of the Lightning Network protocol. Other flags assigned to `globalfeatures` include `initial_routing_sync`, `option_upfront_shutdown_script`, and `gossip_queries`. A node may monitor the blockchain for unspent `to_local_pushme` and `to_remote_pushme` outputs and try to spend them after 10 confirmations.</summary>
