    <summary>In the Lightning-dev mailing list, a proposal has been made to change default lightning network fees on new channels from 1000 msat + 1 ppm to 5000 msat + 500 ppm. This change is intended to address issues such as low reliability and tarpitting routing caused by the current lower fees. Rusty Russell proposed this change and suggested that raising fees could be a signal of better routing node operation because those who put effort into their node are likely to have more reliable nodes. However, Olaoluwa Osuntokun expressed concern about making sweeping changes to default values like fees, arguing that this could promote the notion that developers decide on fees. He also believes that there is no meaningful market signal in fees yet because a true market hasn't emerged as routing node operators are mostly hands off and have yet to begin factoring in the various costs of operating a node into their fee schedules. Nevertheless, Rusty suggests that changing defaults should move the noise floor up gradually over time, with the hope of raising the market tolerance for higher fees.</summary>
