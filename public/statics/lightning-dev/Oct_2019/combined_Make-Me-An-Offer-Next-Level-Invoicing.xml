    <summary>The Lightning Network is a circular system that allows for atomic transactions between hops through the use of HTLCs. Conflict resolution is facilitated through revealing the latest state, which can be aided by including sequence numbers or hash values in states. Forking channels can also cause issues that need to be resolved semantically. Contracts between multiple parties and merging and joining of contracts in state updates are advanced concepts that come with their own challenges.During the Lightning Conference in Berlin, Rusty solicited use cases and feature requests for the next-generation Lightning invoicing. One contributor shared their work on an interactive protocol for direct communication between payer and payee. This proposed virtual payment channel would allow both parties to update the state, issue full or partial refunds, and make changes to goods delivery. The state updating mechanism would require special attention to facilitate conflict resolution, and advanced ideas such as contracts between multiple parties and merging and joining of contracts in state updates were discussed.</summary>
