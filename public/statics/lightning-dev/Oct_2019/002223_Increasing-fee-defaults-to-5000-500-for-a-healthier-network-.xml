    <summary>A proposal has been made to change the default fee for lightning network channels. Currently, 2/3 of channel fees are set at the default rate of 1000 msat and 1 ppm. However, this rate is causing issues such as low reliability and tarpitting routing. Lightningpowerusers.com charges a higher rate of 10000 msat and 5000 ppm, indicating market tolerance for higher fees. The proposal is to change the default rate for new channels to 5000 msat and 500 ppm in the next release of c-lighting, with the hope of raising the noise floor over time. The proposed rate table shows minimal centralization at 1% for 20 hops, with the base rate of 5000 msat chosen for less quantifiable reasons.</summary>
