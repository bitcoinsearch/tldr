    <summary>The Lightning network developers are exploring the use of a new language called Improv, which is similar to miniscript. This language allows for the specification of rules for spending outputs on transactions and can compile those rules into a protocol for secure key and signature exchange. This could be particularly beneficial for formal specifications of layer-2 protocols.In addition to this, the possibility of DLCs routed through Lightning was discussed, with a proposed "barrier escrow" solution to ensure both payments are set up simultaneously in case of lack of trust between parties. A payment point + scalar scheme could also be reconsidered as a pay-for-scalar scheme. Regarding the Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) feature, there is a challenge in providing proof-of-payment as the recipient only receives some of the parts and not the full payment. One proposed solution is to use an intermediary node E that charges a premium for its service and forwards the payments. Each receiver sends their portion of the payment to E once their incoming payment has been set up. E remains unaware of the exact details of the arrangement but only cares that it is paid, with the use of High AMP being the "coordination." This scheme can be extended to more than just two simultaneous transactions and may solve more problems than expected.Finally, it is suggested that the High AMP scheme could be used to implement the escrow E, with no additional code needed on top of High AMP except some way to request invoices from E. The assumption underlying Bass Amplifier's claim to atomicity is that a perfectly rational economic agent will not claim any payments conditional on the revelation of `s` that sum up to less than `m` millisatoshi, but only claim all of them when they can get multiple payments conditional on the revelation of `s` that sum up to `m` millisatoshi or more.</summary>
