    <summary>The Lightning Network development team is considering adding a CSV time lock to every non-anchor output on the commitment transaction. The team is looking at making changes to include `to_remote_delay OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP` to the `to_remote` output, which ensures the carve-out works and removes the incentive to game the other party into force-closing. The team is also considering adding 1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP to the non-revocation clause of the HTLC outputs. For anchor outputs, normal P2WKH output type is being considered with both anchors always having equal values and paid for by the initiator. The value of the anchors is the dust limit that was negotiated in the `open_channel` or `accept_channel` message of the publishing party. The team has decided not to tweak the keys since there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason anymore for tweaking the keys. However, this decision seems to be based on forgotten insights rather than new insights.</summary>
