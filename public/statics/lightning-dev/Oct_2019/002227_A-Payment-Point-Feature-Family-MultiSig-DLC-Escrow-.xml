    <summary>The email discusses the concept of sub-payment and payment, where a sub-payment semantically pays for the same thing for the same value and can have multiple attempts running in parallel, but only one attempt will be claimable. A payment is one or more sub-payments, each of which semantically pay for different parts of an entire thing and can have multiple sub-payments, with all sub-payments being claimed atomically. The email also talks about the generalization of arbitrary AND-OR combinations and enabling atomic payments where the paying wallet specifies known paths with certain capacities to transfer the desired value. Verifiable secret sharing is used to create more complex access structures.</summary>
