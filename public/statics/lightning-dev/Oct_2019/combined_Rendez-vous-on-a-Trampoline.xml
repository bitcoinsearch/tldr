    <summary>Bastien Teinturier, a member of the Eclair team, has proposed using Bitcoin Trampoline to improve rendezvous routing in Lightning Network payments. Trampoline routing is designed to enable high AMP easily and allows each intermediate node to make more informed decisions on how to efficiently split payments. Additionally, Trampoline enables better rendezvous routing than normal payments by doing pre-encryption on a smaller Trampoline onion, which reduces the size of the invoice. However, Trampoline itself has trade-offs that may impact privacy when paying to legacy nodes that don't understand the Trampoline onion. The Lightning Network team is working to converge on a spec that minimizes trade-offs and maximizes performance while addressing potential privacy concerns. The team is also proposing a new mechanism called rendez-vous routing on top of Sphinx, which would allow nodes to negotiate payment routes with each other before sending payments. The cryptographic details of the proposal are not provided, but feedback and ideas are welcome.In addition, the community is exploring ways to address issues with payment failures by providing a communication channel between the sender and receiver to exchange further payment information and decrypt opaque errors. The community is also discussing off-protocol solutions to address shortcomings of current rendezvous proposals and enhance privacy features incrementally.Overall, Trampoline routing has the potential to enable wide-scale networking without huge routing tables for everyone, but its design and deployment should be carefully done to avoid false promises of privacy like those experienced on the base layer, e.g., bloom-filters.</summary>
