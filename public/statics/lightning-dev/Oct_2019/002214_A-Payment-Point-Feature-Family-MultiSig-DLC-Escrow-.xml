    <summary>The article describes a framework for creating a miniscript-like language for SCRIPT-based `OP_CHECKSIG`s and Lightning. It proposes a barrier escrow that ensures both parties have set up payments at the same time in case they do not trust each other. The scheme can be used not only for DLC but also for other purposes like an alternate solution to the Premium-free American Call Option Problem. The author introduces the concept of economically-rational atomicity, which can be used to ensure the escrow entity operates as intended. The High AMP scheme can be used to implement the escrow entity, and all that is needed is some way to request invoices from it. The article concludes by stating that this scheme is flexible and can solve more problems than one might think.</summary>
