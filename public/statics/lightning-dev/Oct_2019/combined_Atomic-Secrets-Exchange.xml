    <summary>The Lightning network has identified a problem in the protocol for placing bets, which could result in a one-sided bet if the second transaction is not created. A proposed solution called the Atomic Secrets Exchange involves atomically exchanging two secrets instead of locking two transactions. Alice locks in a Lightning tx to Bob that requires Bob to know sa and sb, and reveal at least sb to Alice. Bob then locks in a Lightning tx back to Alice that requires Alice to know sa and reveal sa to Bob, which must time out sooner than the first tx. The solution ensures that the transactions are bound to time out or be voluntarily canceled even after the oracle has spoken, making them safe to be locked in any order.Bob can choose not to redeem the first transaction, but he receives a penalty that roughly equals the transaction amount if he does so, moving his incentives towards honest behavior. The correct order of time-outs for the three transactions is Locking in the bet txes, Locking in the secrets exchange txes, Time-out of the secrets exchange txes, Publication by the oracle, and Time-out of the bet txes. The elliptic curve magic involves calculating P=p*G, Q=q*G, SA=sa*G, and SB=sb*G, with Bob needing to know SA to verify the value of PP_x0 and to generate PP_x1. Similarly, Alice has to know SB to generate PP_x0. A user named CJP suggested an idea regarding generating PP_x1 where Bob could calculate SA by subtracting P from PP_b0 if a subtract operation exists for elliptic curve points. Otherwise, Alice could just tell Bob SA as metadata included in the first bet transaction. Similarly, to generate PP_x0, Alice needs to know SB. She could calculate SB by subtracting Q from PP_b1 or Bob could tell her SB as metadata included in the second bet transaction.Overall, the proposed solution of Atomic Secrets Exchange provides a safe and secure way for placing bets in the Lightning network by ensuring that both parties are bound to time out or be voluntarily canceled even after the oracle has spoken.</summary>
