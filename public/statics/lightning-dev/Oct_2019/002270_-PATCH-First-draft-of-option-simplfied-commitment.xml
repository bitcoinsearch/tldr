    <summary>Matt Corallo suggests sticking with the original design from Adelaide for Bitcoin's spending path. The original design was a single anyone-can-spend anchor output. However, if two anchor outputs are needed and the other needs to turn into an anyone-can-spend after it's mined, it is possible through gratuitously mentioning the other key in the script. The suggested script includes revealing the other key to spend the other anchor, dropping the OP and enabling anyone to spend after 1 block. Rusty approves of this idea.</summary>
