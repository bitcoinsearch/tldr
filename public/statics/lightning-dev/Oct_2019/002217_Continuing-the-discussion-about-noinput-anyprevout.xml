    <summary>In a discussion thread on bitcoin-dev, Anthony Towns shared his thoughts on anyprevout signatures. He believed that such signatures could make the address less safe and may cause fund loss when additional coins are sent to the same address. However, another participant in the discussion pointed out that address re-use is often outside the control of the address owner. For instance, if a counterparty sends a transaction to an address, the owner has no control over whether the counterparty re-uses that address or not. This could create problems for users, especially if they care about losing funds due to address reuse. While wallet implementations try to enforce address reuse prevention, it is not always possible as some smart contracts are designed to be re-used multiple times over time. Therefore, discouraging address re-use may not be feasible without hurting the economic interests of users.</summary>
