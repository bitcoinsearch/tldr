    <summary>In a discussion about Lightning Network channel funding, it was confirmed that each channel is funded by one party only, but payments can be made in both directions. The `push_msat` field allows for an initial payment to be made as part of the channel opening. One-sided channel funding was chosen for simplicity in version 1.0 of the protocol, but a pull request for dual funding is currently being worked on. The pull request can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/184.</summary>
