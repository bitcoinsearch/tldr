    <summary>The email conversation between Mark Friedenbach and Cezary Dziemian is about the current state of Bitcoin payments system, which is not functioning well due to high fees and unconfirmed transactions. Dziemian believes that Lightning Network (LN) is the only solution to this problem and it should be implemented as soon as possible. However, Friedenbach mentions that teams are waiting for cross-implementation comparability to be demonstrated before announcing any deployment to customers. He suggests that more tests may be needed before LN can be used in the mainnet.</summary>
