    <summary>The email exchange between Cezary Dziemian and Mark Friedenbach revolves around the issue of Bitcoin's high transaction fees and unconfirmed transactions. Cezary expresses concern about the current state of Bitcoin and believes that Lightning Network (LN) is the best solution to this problem. He asks Mark if some of the LN implementation could be used in mainnet right now, or if more tests are needed. Mark responds by saying that cross-implementation comparability needs to be demonstrated before teams can announce anything. He advises against deploying systems to customers until this is done, but assures Cezary that he wouldn't be in excessive danger of losing his money. Overall, the conversation highlights the urgency of implementing LN as a solution to Bitcoin's problems with high fees and unconfirmed transactions. While there may be some issues to solve and tests to run, it is clear that LN is seen as the best way forward.</summary>
