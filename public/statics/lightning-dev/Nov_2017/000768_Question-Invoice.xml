    <summary>Cezary Dziemian, a fan of Lightning Network (LN) technology for over a year, has some questions regarding its functionality. Firstly, he wonders how to receive payments using LN if some users prefer on-chain payments instead. He suggests showing the buyer a QR code containing both public address and LN invoice so that their wallet can choose how to pay. However, it is not possible to do so currently. Secondly, Dziemian asks what to do if someone in the middle of an LN payment does not cooperate quickly, causing his payment to be stuck in limbo until the time lock period lapses. Lastly, he ponders whether the decremental time lock is related to block confirmation time and whether a currency with faster confirmation times could potentially solve the problem described in paragraph two.</summary>
