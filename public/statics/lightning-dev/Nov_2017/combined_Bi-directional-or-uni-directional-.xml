    <summary>A question was asked on Lightning-dev about whether the channels in Lightning were bidirectional or unidirectional only. The confusion arose due to discrepancies between tutorials and the draft RFC. Rusty replied that the channels were indeed bidirectional, but each side sent a batch of updates followed by a commitment, and the other side replied with an acknowledgement. The field 'push_msat' allowed the initial payment to be made as part of the channel opening. Alan further questioned whether each channel was funded by one party only, but both parties could make payments in both directions. Pierre clarified that it was indeed so for v1.0, but a PR for dual funding was already in the works.</summary>
