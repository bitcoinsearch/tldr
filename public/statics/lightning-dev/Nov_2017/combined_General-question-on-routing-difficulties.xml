    <summary>The Lightning Network (LN) is a payment network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows for off-chain transactions and reduced transaction fees. However, the routing protocol used in the network is still in flux, and various potential solutions have been proposed. One approach is to extend the header in Sphinx to include per-hop payloads, allowing for greater control over the payment path and enabling higher-level protocols to be constructed on top of the system. However, there are concerns about the need for all nodes to have an identical set of landmarks for the scheme to work, which introduces fragility into the network. Furthermore, value privacy within the scheme seems weak, and there is no strong requirement for the network to use a single routing protocol.One possible solution to these issues is the SpeedyMurmurs protocol developed by researchers from Purdue University and the University of Waterloo. The algorithm assigns coordinates to nodes within the network and uses these coordinates to efficiently route payments through the system. The protocol achieves value, sender, and receiver privacy and has been shown to be faster and more efficient than other routing algorithms available in the literature. However, there are still issues with the need for all nodes to have an identical set of landmarks and the potential fragility this introduces into the network.In addition to these technical challenges, there are also issues around the scalability and centralization of the Lightning Network. While the network can easily scale to about 1 million channels even on limited devices, there are concerns about the formation of hubs and the high fees associated with them. Some have suggested using distance vector routing such as BGP, while others have pointed out that off-chain channel rebalancing and fund re-allocation based solely on Bitcoin is possible. Despite these challenges, many believe that the Lightning Network is a key first step towards improving the scalability and efficiency of cryptocurrency transactions.Finally, there are broader concerns within the cryptocurrency community about the need for an inventory of unproven mathematical assumptions and cryptographic primitives cataloged by the technologies that require them. This resource could help respond more quickly and transparently to any cryptanalytic surprises that may arise over time.</summary>
