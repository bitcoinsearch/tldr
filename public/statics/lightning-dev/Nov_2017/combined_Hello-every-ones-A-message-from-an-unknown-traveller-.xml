    <summary>On November 15, 2017 at 04:41, Matt Corallo wrote a brief email stating "Keep Bitcoin Weird" with no additional context. The email was in response to a hard fork related to hair color that did not have consensus. The email was sent to the Lightning-dev mailing list, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation. Prior to this email, there was a longer message from an individual claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto. In the message, they expressed optimism and encouraged others to be kind to each other while trying to achieve something greater than others. The message also touched on the idea of finding a perfect algorithm to complete a mission.</summary>
