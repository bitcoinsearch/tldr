    <summary>The email exchange between Cezary Dziemian and Rusty explains the difficulties faced with the Lightning Network (LN) in terms of payments. Cezary raises concerns regarding how to verify if a user is using LN or not when making a payment, since it is difficult to ask every user about their payment preference. Rusty suggests using a BOLT 11 QR code with a fallback address or the BIP70 payment protocol with an alternate payment mechanism. In response to Cezary's second question, Rusty acknowledges that there may be cases where a payment might fail due to a non-cooperative party in the middle, but assures him that it is rare. He suggests that if the payment has succeeded, then the recipient will receive the goods regardless of the delay. On the other hand, if it fails, the payer can wait or try again with a new invoice, but cannot pay the same one twice unless it definitely failed.Cezary also queries whether the decremental time lock on the network is related to block confirmation time and whether having a currency with a faster confirmation rate would solve the problem described in his second question. Rusty responds that while there is some relationship between the two, a fast confirmation time does not necessarily mean a short time lock period.</summary>
