    <summary>A developer named Alan Carbery asked a question about Lightning's bi-directional channels. He was curious if the protocol is uni-directional only, based on the draft RFC. Rusty Russell responded to his query saying that Lightning's channels are actually bidirectional. However, each side of the channel sends a batch of updates followed by a commitment, and then the other side replies with an acknowledgement. Both sides operate independently in this process.</summary>
