    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list recently discussed how to handle the transition to Lightning Network (LN) payments. One issue raised was whether a vendor needs to know if a buyer wants to make an on-chain or LN payment. The consensus was that using a BOLT 11 QR code with a fallback address is one solution, but this still requires the recipient's app to understand BOLT11. Another suggestion was to use the BIP70 payment protocol which includes an alternate payment mechanism. However, it appears that this is not widely used.Regarding the handling of failed transactions or time lock periods, if a payment has succeeded but hasn't been deducted yet, the recipient will receive their goods eventually so there is no need to worry. If the payment has failed, the payer can either wait or try again with a new invoice. The decremental time lock was also discussed and its relationship with block confirmation time. It was suggested that even with a fast confirmation time of five seconds, there would still need to be a margin for turning around payments.Rusty Russell responded to a question about invoices on the Lightning Network, stating that it is difficult to know if someone is using LN or not and suggested using a BOLT11 QR code which can contain a fallback address. However, this still requires their app to understand BOLT11 enough to extract it. Alternatively, the BIP70 payment protocol could include an alternate payment mechanism but it seems nobody uses this. For 1.1, users would be able to reuse the same invoice safely as long as the merchant was honest if it received two payments and rejects the second.In a separate post, Rusty Russell discussed the lack of adoption of the BIP70-72 collection, suggesting it doesn't offer sufficient advantages over existing bitcoin addresses. The general consensus was that if payments are unreliable enough to warrant worrying about these issues, then something is wrong.</summary>
