    <summary>In this message, Cezary Dziemian is asking if any LN (Lightning Network) implementation could be used in the mainnet at present. The mainnet refers to the live blockchain network of a cryptocurrency. He is inquiring whether there are any important issues that need to be solved or if more tests are required before implementing LN in the mainnet.LN is a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which aims to increase transaction speed and reduce fees. It operates by creating payment channels between users that allow for instant, off-chain transactions. LN is still in development and testing stages, and there are multiple implementations available such as LND, c-lightning, and Eclair.The question posed by Dziemian raises concerns about the readiness of these LN implementations for deployment on the mainnet. This indicates that there may be some technical issues or challenges that need to be addressed before implementing LN on the mainnet. Overall, the message highlights the need for further testing and development of LN implementation to ensure readiness for deployment on the mainnet.</summary>
