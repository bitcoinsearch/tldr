    <summary>A comment on a Reddit thread discussing the Lightning Network has raised concerns regarding its scalability and potential centralization. The commenter argues that the Lightning Network's routing difficulties prevent it from scaling to 100,000 users and that it lacks a plan to prevent hypercentralization to liquidity providers or banks. Additionally, the commenter claims that the Lightning Network does not have any plans for actual security on a congested blockchain with high fees. These issues lead the commenter to conclude that the Lightning Network is currently a worse scaling solution than the blockchain itself.</summary>
