    <summary>In an email exchange, Pedro Moreno Sanchez asks about the mechanism in place for Lightning Network's routing hints. He suggests separating the base layer from the onion layer to better understand the necessary guarantees required for LN to work. However, there is confusion around how onion routing can complete a transfer if there isn't a direct path. Laolu explains two possible paths, including using a cooperative signature or a joint key to update the channel, which he outlined at his talk at Scaling Bitcoin.</summary>
