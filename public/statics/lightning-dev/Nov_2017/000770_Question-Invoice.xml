    <summary>A user named Johan suggested adding a lightning parameter to the bitcoin: url to make QR codes backwards compatible. Cezary Dziemian asked Rusty Russell questions regarding the use of Lightning Network (LN) and its transition from on-chain payments. Rusty replied that a BOLT 11 QR code can contain a fallback address, but it still requires the app to understand BOLT11 enough to extract it. The BIP70 payment protocol could include an alternate payment mechanism, but it seems nobody actually uses this. Rusty also explained the two worst case scenarios for LN payments - one where the payment fails, and the other where it has succeeded but the payer doesn't know yet. If the latter happens, the payer will get their goods and won't care about waiting for the money to be deducted. If the payment fails, the payer can either wait or try again with a new invoice. Finally, Rusty stated that although the decremental time lock is somewhat related to block confirmation time, if payments are so unreliable that this case needs to be worried about, then something is horribly wrong.</summary>
