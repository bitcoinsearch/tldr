    <summary>In this email thread, the participants discuss various aspects of payment channels and escrows on the Lightning Network. The first message praises a previous post about accomplishing ORing points without verifiable encryption, which involves a clever general NOT operation that can be added to the toolkit for PTLC DLC schemes. However, the mechanism requires atomic setup of multiple payments to avoid free options being kept by buyers. Nadav suggests using barrier escrows to accomplish this. The second message follows up on the topic of dual-hash HTLCs and their support in the current LN spec. ZmnSCPxj explains that while they are not supported and PTLCs are overall superior, it is possible to develop a 2HTLC extension for L2 wallets to work with the current version of Bitcoin. However, because every forwarding node needs to support either 2HTLC or PTLC, it would be preferable to upgrade once from HTLCs to PTLCs, rather than multiple network-wide upgrades.</summary>
