    <title>Escrow Over Lightning?</title>

    <summary>The context of the message is a proposal to change the spec or add a new BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) so that all lightning implementations can support a new feature. The author wonders if it's possible to implement a Lightning-based escrow system without modifying existing implementations, and suggests simplifying the requirements by removing the "Escrow only learns of dispute cases, never learns non-dispute case" aspect. This requirement is considered good to have but not necessary for an interim solution for non-custodial exchanges to start adopting this. Without this, they would have to resort to custodial-based escrows, which lacks the escrow privacy brought by the requirement above.</summary>
