    <summary>The conversation revolves around the idea of making an exchange atomic in a commercial application. The advantage of the idea is that it prevents a malicious credential server from stealing money selectively while being honest with others. In this scheme, payment for a credential is anonymous and cannot be distinguished from other payments. A trustful exchange with LN eliminates the need for distinguishing users, and the server can choose one private channel to be dishonest with. Even if the server acts honestly, the user may claim they did not receive credentials, undermining the serviceâ€™s reputation. The blind-show protocol can be used to verify if the server is acting honestly during credential presentation. Making an exchange atomic in this way is necessary for a commercial application.</summary>
