    <summary>The discussions about the Lightning Network have been missing any sort of threat model or attacker profile. As it is primarily a griefing attack, and the attacker doesn't stand to gain anything directly, the question arises as to how high a fee is considered adequate deterrence without dramatically increasing the cost of node operation in the average case. It is believed that the first instances of this attack will be executed by routing node operators who operate in a gray area, given the potential for earning thousands of dollars per month in routing fees. By jamming the competition's channels, these operators can capture their traffic and command a higher fee rate, since senders still want their payments to go through.</summary>
