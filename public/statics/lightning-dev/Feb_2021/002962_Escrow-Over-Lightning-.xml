    <summary>In an email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Pedro, they discuss the mechanics of virtual channels in a blockchain protocol. Pedro confirms that an intermediary, Ingrid, needs to hold a certain amount of coins to allow the virtual channel between Alice and Bob. The protocol ensures that Ingrid will be paid whatever fee she decides to charge for creating the virtual channel, but there is no guarantee that enough payments would be routed through her node to gain the same fee in the same amount of time.ZmnSCPxj raises a concern about the unilateral closure of the actual Alice-Ingrid or Ingrid-Bob channels before the lifetime of the virtual channel. Pedro explains that, as a safe fallback, the protocol allows time for Ingrid or Bob to put the other channel onchain before punishment can be triggered.</summary>
