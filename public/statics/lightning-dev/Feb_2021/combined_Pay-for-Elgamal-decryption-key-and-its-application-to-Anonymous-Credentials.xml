    <summary>The article discusses the potential application of Discrete-Log selling on PTLC lightning, which could impact the way people make anonymity-focused applications with LN. The author explains protocols for pay-for ElGamal decryption key and Pay for Keyed Verification Anonymous Credential (KVAC). KVAC is seen to have great potential as a building block of anonymous web apps due to its MAC-based construction being more performant and easy to prove security compared to similar systems. However, it has not been used widely in the past due to the absence of a means to charge users anonymously, leading to DoS protection concerns and Sybil attack. These problems can be fixed by LN-based payment and KVAC-based app, making them suitable for granting server resource rights to users in an unlinkable fashion.The idea of making an exchange atomic in a commercial application is discussed, which prevents a malicious credential server from stealing money selectively while being honest with others. In this scheme, payment for a credential is anonymous and cannot be distinguished from other payments. A trustful exchange with LN eliminates the need for distinguishing users, and the server can choose one private channel to be dishonest with. Even if the server acts honestly, the user may claim they did not receive credentials, undermining the service’s reputation. The blind-show protocol can be used to verify if the server is acting honestly during credential presentation.Miyamoto proposed an idea for anonymous credentials that utilizes ElGamal encryption and discrete-log selling on PTLC. Miyamoto provided protocols for two scenarios: paying for an ElGamal decryption key and paying for a Keyed Verification Anonymous Credential (KVAC). In both cases, the buyer can purchase the item anonymously without revealing their identity. Miyamoto believes that KVAC has great potential as a building block for anonymous web apps due to its MAC-based construction, which is more performant and easier to prove security compared to similar systems for PKI-based anonymous credentials.The participants of the conversation discuss the idea of an anonymous credential scheme and its potential vulnerabilities. The scheme allows for anonymity during payment and receipt of credentials, but this anonymity can be exploited by a malicious credential server who can selectively steal money from users without being detected. Even in a trustful exchange with Lightning Network (LN), the server can still choose to be dishonest to a private channel connected to itself, leaving the victim with no way to prove that they did not receive the credential after payment. Furthermore, even if the server acts honestly, the user may falsely claim that they did not receive the credentials after payment, undermining the reputation of the service. The blind-show protocol is suggested as a way to check if the server is acting honestly when presenting credentials. The participants agree that making the exchange atomic is necessary for a commercial application to prevent exploitation of the anonymity feature.</summary>
