    <summary>In a conversation between Pedro and Nadav, they discuss the intermediary, Ingrid, who needs to hold a certain amount of coins to allow the virtual channel between Alice and Bob. The protocol ensures that Ingrid will get paid whatever fee she decides to charge for the service of creating a virtual channel. However, Ingrid does not have the guarantee that enough payments would be routed through her node to gain the same fee in the same amount of time. ZmnSCPxj asks what happens if any of the actual Alice-Ingrid or Ingrid-Bob channels are forced unilaterally onchain before the purported lifetime of the virtual channel.</summary>
