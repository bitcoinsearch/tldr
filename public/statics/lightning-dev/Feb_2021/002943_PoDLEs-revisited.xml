    <summary>In an email thread, Rusty Russell asked if a heuristic from a paper is less true after Taproot. The response was that the heuristic is not affected by Taproot. However, Taproot will be useful for keeping private channels private against a certain method. The core idea of this method involves funding public channels and using the change to fund another public channel. By doing so, it is possible to identify the owner of the node that funded both channels. A variant of this method involves using the output of a cooperative close of the first channel to fund the second channel. This allows for identification of the node that funded the first channel as well as the owner of the other UTXO from the close of the first channel. The point of this method is to associate UTXOs with a node ID and any descendant UTXOs, making UTXO probing useless.</summary>
