    <summary>When selecting nodes to peer with, users can choose their own selection criteria. lnd offers an "auto-pilot" feature that selects peers to channel with using some heuristic, while c-lightning may eventually offer a similar feature in the future. Node gossip allows users to learn of other nodes they may channel with in the future. Currently, channels are single-funded, but there is a proposal for dual-funded channel setup that did not make it into 1.0. If users have onchain bitcoins to invest and intend to become a hub and earn routing fees, it is in their interest to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. By doing so, they increase their chances of being routed through if those nodes become prolific users of the network in the future. When someone wants to connect to a user, their node connects to the user's and sends channel funding messages.</summary>
