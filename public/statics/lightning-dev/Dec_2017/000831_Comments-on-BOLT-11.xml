    <summary>In an email exchange, Jonathan Underwood and Johan Torås Halseth discuss potential improvements to BOLT#11, a proposed standard for Bitcoin Lightning Network invoices. Underwood shares a payment request he made using UTF-8 description and provides the code he used to separate encode from sign. Torås Halseth offers several suggestions for improvement, including setting a max length for invoices and adding UTF-8 support. They also discuss the purpose of the description hash URL and whether it should be part of the invoice. Underwood expresses concern that users may not bother with using the hash correctly and suggests that the wallet could fetch it instead.</summary>
