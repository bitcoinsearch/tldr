    <summary>In a discussion on opening channels to arbitrary nodes, Stan Kladko suggests that if you have a reason to do so, other nodes may also have a reason to open channels with you. However, if you are only connected to other nodes and no one is connected to you, then your deposit is only used by you and not other nodes. Routing nodes through your node could potentially negatively affect the availability of your deposit for your own transactions. Therefore, Stan thinks it's best to connect but accept no incoming connections. Rusty disagrees with this strategy and believes that routing through your node doesn't affect your total capacity if you have two channels. It just shifts them between the channels.</summary>
