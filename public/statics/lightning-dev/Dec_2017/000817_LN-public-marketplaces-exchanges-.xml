    <summary>The writer is enquiring about whether Lightning Network (LN) would allow for the creation of marketplaces or exchanges where users can offer to take over someone else's payment obligation quasi-instantly, and earn a little income from transaction fees. The idea is that the regular network (such as Bitcoin) would first check if an intermediary is available in the exchange's order book who is willing to instantly take over the payer's obligation. This way, intermediaries or credit-givers could generate a small income stream without risking their funds. The writer believes that many users would be interested in such an idea, and many exchanges offering this service could open up and announce their presence on the underlying network(s). Additionally, the writer suggests that if such an exchange were to go down, it would have no negative consequences for the participants. Overall, the writer is asking whether such an infrastructure can be built on top of LN.</summary>
