    <summary>The upper 32 bits of amount_msat must be zero for channels with chain_hash identifying the Bitcoin blockchain. This gives a maximum HTLC value of .04294967295 BTC. The limit is not imposed on other similar cryptocurrencies, and payments of hundreds of whole coins may be practical for those currencies. The channel size limit is 0.16777215 BTC, or 16777215 satoshi (2^24 - 1). An exchange might support opening a new channel between the node and exchange's node, with push_msat equivalent to the amount spent minus fees. Presumably, users would want to spend their funds on Lightning for things within a short time frame. The alternative would be two onchain transactions unlike the case where the exchange does a single open and reassigns the funds via push_msat.</summary>
