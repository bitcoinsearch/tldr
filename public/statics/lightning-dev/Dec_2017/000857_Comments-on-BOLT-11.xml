    <summary>In a discussion thread, Jonathan Underwood suggests that "they" (referring to an unknown group or platform) may be using the invoice description as a way to link user data and payment hashes. However, Rusty notes that when he sends payments, only the payment hash is received, not the description. Htlc me, which is a node that separates its balance into user accounts outside of Lightning, uses the identifier in order to store user information locally rather than separately. Rusty believes that this practice is understandable, but not ideal for an API. In contrast, c-lightning does not store descriptions in the database at all; instead, each invoice uses a label specified by the creator, which must be unique and is not exposed to customers.</summary>
