    <summary>The upper 32 bits must be zero for channels with |chain_hash| identifying the Bitcoin blockchain, giving a maximum HTLC value of .04294967295 BTC. This limit is not imposed for other similar cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin because payments of hundreds of whole coins may be practical. The channel size limit is 0.16777215 BTC, or 16777215 satoshi (2^24 - 1). A single payment can be up to 0.04294967295, but a channel is up to 0.16777215. An exchange might support the optional initial push of millisatoshis during the channel creation where you buy for example $100 worth of BTC and indicate a desire to open a new channel between your node to the exchange's. Both the exchange and you would want to do this to capture routing fees and start out in Lightning without touching the chain at all.</summary>
