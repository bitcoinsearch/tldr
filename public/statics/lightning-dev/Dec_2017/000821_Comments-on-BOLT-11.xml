    <summary>The context involves a discussion about the support of full unicode via UTF8 in descriptions, which is deemed as nonsense by one party. However, it is noted that caution should be exercised in implementing such support and precision should be maintained in choosing the variant of UTF8. A naive implementation can lead to correct behavior, but the use of so-called Modified UTF8 or disallowance of null characters must be considered. The issue of Unicode normalization also arises with the adoption of UTF8, and the need for specification and imposition of such normalization is questioned. The use of ASCII does not avoid these issues, but it has no alternative to null characters.</summary>
