    <summary>A member of Lightning-dev mailing list named Johan has suggested setting a reasonable maximum length for invoices that must be met. This suggestion would simplify internal database logic and ensure fair error detection for all supported lengths. He is not sure if 1023 is enough, considering possibly multiple `r` tags and a juicy description. The member also agrees with UTF-8 support and up to 640 bytes length. The description hash URL being part of the invoice is questioned by Johan as he always imagined this would be used between clients who had already agreed on payment for some kind of data, and that this hash would just ensure the correct payment. In another email, Jonathan Underwood shared code he used to make a payment request using UTF-8 descriptions. The results of the request are also provided in the email.</summary>
