    <summary>In a forum post, Jonathan Underwood suggests that a requirement be made to hide certain text in the description of payment requests under certain conditions. He proposes that information surrounded by curly brackets {} be hidden from the user interface (UI) and only available internally. Underwood believes that many people will want to include extra data in their payment request descriptions. He cites HTLC.ME as an example of a site that uses this feature. However, he notes that the generic_id field used by HTLC.ME is designed solely for display to the user and is never returned to the recipient. Rusty Russell, who responds to the post, suggests that HTLC.ME should add a description entry field to its Request Payment form to avoid violating specifications. Russell also proposes adding an "extra data" tag if the reason for wanting it is provided.</summary>
