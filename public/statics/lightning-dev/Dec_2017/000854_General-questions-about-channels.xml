    <summary>The use of millisatoshis as the units for lightning channels allows for the opportunity to accumulate revenue from small transactions, even if it may result in the loss of up to 1/2 of a satoshi when the channel is closed. There is no maximum channel funding size due to the use of millisatoshis. The optional initial push of millisatoshis during channel creation is not meant to motivate the other party, but its purpose is unclear. It is unknown how to define the timeout for closing out a channel when someone does not cooperate, and it is uncertain if there is a fixed value for this or if most clients have a default that they enforce over all channels that they create.</summary>
