    <summary>The email thread is a discussion about the use of Lightning Network (LN) for short-term loans and multi-hop payments. The original sender suggests setting up a marketplace where users can offer to act as middlemen, paying out funds instantly and getting their money back from the original sender after confirmation. Christian Decker responds by pointing out that all payments on LN are fully backed by Bitcoin, so there is no support for short-term loans yet. ZmnSCPxj jumps in to suggest that the original sender could run an LN node themselves and make future payments for low fees without having to make a new onchain transaction each time. He also questions the benefit of using a middleman service given this option. The conversation ends with the suggestion that the idea of a marketplace for middlemen may not be feasible or beneficial in the current state of LN technology.</summary>
