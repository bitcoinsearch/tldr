    <summary>The context discusses the use of payment request descriptions in lightning network transactions. The description is used as a way to join the user data and payment hash on the backend. HTLC.me, which separates its balance into user accounts that exist outside lightning, uses an identifier in the description so when their backend checks the payment request status, the user info is right there in their local lnd RPC response rather than having to store their own database separately. In the conversation, Jonathan Underwood suggests making a requirement to hide text in the description under certain conditions and adding an "extra data" tag. Rusty Russell, who responds to Underwood's comments, explains that HTLC.me uses a specific description field to display to the user but doesn't understand why it's used. He believes that HTLC.me should have a description entry field in their "Request Payment" form to avoid violating spec. Overall, the discussion revolves around the best practices for using payment request descriptions in lightning network transactions.</summary>
