    <summary>In a discussion between ZmnSCPxj and Andy Schroder, the topic of channel closing costs in relation to cheating was brought up. When asked if there was a maximum channel funding size due to using millisatoshis, Schroder responded that the upper 32 bits must be zero as stated in BOLT #2, limiting the HTLC value to .04294967295 BTC. Schroder explained that this limit was set to prevent significant losses in case of trouble on Lightning, while also encouraging decentralization by encouraging people to make many small channels instead of one large one. The use of satoshis versus millisatoshis was also discussed.</summary>
