    <title>Section 7 Query: Timestamps &amp; Pruning</title>

    <summary>In a lightning-dev email, Rusty Russell has pointed out an issue with the current Lightning Network specification. According to Section 7 of the document, nodes may prune channels if the latest `channel_update` timestamp is older than two weeks (1209600 seconds). However, timestamps are only required to be sequential and not necessarily actual timestamps, making it impossible to know the age of a timestamp just by looking at it. As a result, Rusty has suggested that the specification should be updated to include more specific language on how to determine whether a channel is eligible for pruning. He has opened a bug report on the matter, which can be found on GitHub.</summary>
