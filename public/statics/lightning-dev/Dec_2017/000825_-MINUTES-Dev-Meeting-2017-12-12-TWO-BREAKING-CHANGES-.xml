    <summary>During the freeze, two minor breaking changes were made. Firstly, the `r` fee field is now base+millionths like channel_update. This change fixes cases where there is no amount ('donation address'). No one had implemented using this yet, so old versions will parse, but they will have the wrong fee now. Secondly, nVersion for closing tx is 2, not 1. It turns out that everyone implemented that since every other tx is version 2, and using the latest supported nVersion is best practice according to advice from Mark Friedenbach.There were a lot of bug-and-quirk fixing as each team sees issues on the now-heterogeneous testnet network, but it has been generally really stable and usable (as much as testnet can be). Rusty promised that the major churn from all the copyediting should be almost over. The big BOLTs have been refactored, and it should now be more minor stuff.There will be no meeting in two weeks, as that would be Christmas Day for most. The master document for all minutes can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oU4wxzGsYd0T084rTXJbedb7Gvdtj4ax638nMkYUmco/edit#.</summary>
