    <summary>When opening a channel to an arbitrary node, it is important to remember that other nodes may also have a reason to open a channel to your node. To maximize profits, it is recommended to make outgoing channels private, but this means that you will not be able to receive money on Lightning or earn any money from routing fees. While this method does ensure that you will not lose funds due to internet connectivity issues, it effectively makes you a second-class member of the network and results in higher onchain fees. In the long run, it is preferable to accept incoming channels and at least some routing attempts to earn fees and offset transaction fees. This leads to a more mesh-like network and allows for the possibility of receiving funds via Lightning in the future.</summary>
