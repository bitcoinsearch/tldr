    <summary>A developer, Jonathan Underwood, has implemented BOLT11 in node JS and shared it on Github. In response to this, a user made some comments regarding the implementation. The user suggested that tags_length integer should be added before the first tag to quickly detect poorly encoded data. A debate ensued as to whether the description or description commit hash should be a MUST or SHOULD include tag. It was agreed that full unicode support via UTF8 should be supported for the 'd' field, and a requirement that the writer MUST use valid UTF-8 should be added. Also, there should be a maximum length (in bytes) for the description. The lightning payment requests can get pretty long, but there should be a limit. The conversation then turned to the BOLT document itself. The user made a pull request for adding signature preimage hex data to the examples to help people writing decoders. There was a need for a fuller set of test cases on the RFC, and the developer planned to work on some cases to increase coverage on the bitcoinjs repo.</summary>
