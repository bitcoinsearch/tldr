    <summary>The Lightning Network protocol refers to a channel by its short channel ID, which means that it is possible for a single transaction to fund multiple channels. While this feature is not yet implemented in any wallets, it should not be too difficult to do so. However, coordinating the fund-channel process for all channels in parallel can initially be a challenge, so it may only be used to fund channels from a single initiator. ZmnSCPxj suggests creating a "multifundchannel" command that accepts multiple node ID and msatoshi pairs to create a transaction with multiple channel outputs and negotiate with each node. It would also need to consider what to do if some of the target nodes are not contactable - whether to fail hard and not make any channels or to fail soft and make channels only with nodes that are alive. The same command could be modified in the future to utilize Decker-Burchert-Wattenhofer channel factories. These channel factories are initially funded by a single party, but new protocol messages can be added for channel factory operations.</summary>
