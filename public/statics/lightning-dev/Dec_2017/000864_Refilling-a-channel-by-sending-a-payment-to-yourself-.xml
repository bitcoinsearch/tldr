    <summary>The Lightning Network payment protocol does not currently implement a technique for transferring funds between channels, which would be useful for rebalancing purposes. However, there is a "pay yourself" technique that can work as an "almost-good-enough" solution to splice-in. This involves creating a new channel to another node and routing a payment from the new channel to the current channel. While splice-in is still more efficient, it requires new specs and node software capable of coordinating with one's own. The original message inquired about refilling a channel by sending a payment to oneself, and the proposed solution involved sending a payment from A to C, who sends it to B and back to A again. This method saves on base fees and can potentially save a couple of dollars. The author suggests adding a "refill" button near a channel name in UI terms.</summary>
