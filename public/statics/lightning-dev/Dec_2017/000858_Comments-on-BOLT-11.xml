    <summary>The Lightning Network Daemon API did not include the data in the payment request which led to htlc.me storing data in the description. Rusty Russell expressed that this seems like a wrong API. He stated that c-lightning does not store the description in the database at all and instead uses a label specified by the invoice creator. The label must be unique and is not exposed to customers. Htlc me separates its balance into user accounts that exist outside lightning, and the identifier is used so that when their backend checks the payment request status, the user information is readily available in their local lnd RPC response rather than having to store their own database separately.</summary>
