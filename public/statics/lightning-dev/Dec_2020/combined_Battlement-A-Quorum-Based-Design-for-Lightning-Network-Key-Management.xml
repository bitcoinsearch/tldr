    <summary>In an email exchange, Omer Shlomovits brought up the topic of quorum key management for Lightning nodes and its importance in securing them. The current attacker model assumes that the attacker is not part of the network but only attacks a machine running a lightning node. However, it would be more secure if we defended against arbitrary compromise as well. Implementing a large set of controls in the key management layer can help defend against all these risks, such as the "HTLC receive channel validity" control.Omer has also shared his project on a traditional cybersecurity approach and its implementation in writing. The paper analyzes different scenarios and what an attacker can achieve. Due to the unique key structure and usage in lightning, it is not trivial for an attacker to profit from this situation, unlike bitcoin. The second part of the project offers a quorum-based design that mitigates attacks using threshold cryptography, which allows reusing existing watchtowers. However, there are tradeoffs that need to be discussed. The last part presents a simple bribing attack on the current watchtower design, and hand waves on how game theory shows that a quorum structure like theirs may provide a path to solving it.The paper is written at a high level so that readers can focus on the several new ideas mentioned above. The work is far from complete, as no formal security arguments are given, and real-world considerations like fee structure and parameters are avoided. Omer is seeking feedback on this project. For further reading, the link to the writeup is provided.</summary>
