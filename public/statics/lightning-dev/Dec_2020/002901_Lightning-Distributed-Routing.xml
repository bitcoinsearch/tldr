    <summary>The author thanks ZmnSCPxj for providing feedback on their paper and notes the importance of receiving it. They compare the `feeadjuster` plugin for C-Lightning to their proposed Lightning Distributed Routing (LDR) solution, noting that both aim to improve routing by signaling channel balance availability. However, LDR is more explicit and directly shares channel balance information. The author believes that sharing more information would give LDR a performance edge over `feeadjuster`. They also mention that there is no need for a spec change, as LDR could work as a separate Lightning Network overlay network. The author agrees with ZmnSCPxj on the idea of false signaling and notes that nodes would not gain any additional routing traffic by signaling better fees or larger capacity routes.</summary>
