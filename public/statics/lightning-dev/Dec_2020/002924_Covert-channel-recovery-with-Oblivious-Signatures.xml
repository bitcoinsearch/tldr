    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proof-of-discrete-log equivalency and its security. The author suggests that a ZKCP (Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment) on the payment point and scalar can be used to gate part of the proof, without revealing 'z' - thereby making it even more secure. However, another participant disagrees and mentions that the creation of a secure conditional payment for the proof itself would always prove the existence of the proof. Therefore, there would be no need to pay for the proof in such a case.</summary>
