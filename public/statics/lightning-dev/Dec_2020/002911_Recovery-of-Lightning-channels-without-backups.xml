    <summary>In an email exchange, Rusty Russell and LL discuss a way to eliminate all basepoints using something like SHA256(ss || counter || 0) and SHA256(ss || counter || 1). They also discuss the best way to implement "recovery mode" and the idea of peers supplying storage for each other. LL suggests that if encrypted backups are stored in different places, one could find an honest channel partner to get encrypted hints to find them all.</summary>
