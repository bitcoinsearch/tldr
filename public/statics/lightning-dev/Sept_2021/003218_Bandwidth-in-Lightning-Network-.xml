    <summary>The author of the post highlights the limitations of the micropayment system that is LN today, particularly in terms of pathfinding with hops accommodating the necessary liquidity for larger amounts. They argue that probability and cost for larger amounts will not have any gain compared to going on-chain. To facilitate a near-instantaneous settlement using LN regularly, one would need to set up LN-Nodes in aggregate to facilitate transactions with such profiles.The post also mentions a hypothetical scenario where Lady Gaga wants to send remuneration of 0.6 to Madonna in a LN tx for a designer purse. The author argues that they would need to onboard them first to facilitate the transaction. In a non-anticipated recurring flow, one would just go on-chain or open a channel with push amount to minimize cost.The author proposes changing the protocol to accommodate an algorithm to do pathfinding and make larger payments possible in LN. However, they argue that the proposal fails directly because it has a non-real world scenario as an argument. The post also mentions calculating the total cost in a balance transfer involving a MPP split to 500 120K tx to use a hop sequence as a-b-c-d, which would require 4000 ledger entries in 1002 LN-Nodes, and the probability of success is uncertain.Finally, the author highlights the need to refine existing protocol and implementations rather than spending time on hypothetical non-real world scenarios. They argue that there are more pressing needs as an application developer wishing to use LN protocol pure and interoperable whole.</summary>
