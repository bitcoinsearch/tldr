    <summary>Recent logs reveal that some newer Tor clients are refusing to connect to v2 onion services. The Lightning Network daemon (lnd) is planning to disallow users from creating v2 onion service in its next major release and may upgrade them to v3 onion service if their node supports it. A tracking issue has been created for this purpose. A na√Øve script was run to determine how much of the network uses Tor, and 8793 out of 12844 nodes were found to use Tor. Only around 60 v2 addresses seem to be advertised on the network, so this change should not cause much disruption. Over half of all advertised addresses on the network are now onion services, which could affect payment latency, connection stability, and gossip announcement propagation.Tor v2 hidden services have been deprecated for almost nine months, and the Tor project plans to drop support by October 2021. Bitcoin Core defaults to v3 since version 0.21.0 and is planning to drop v2 support for version 0.22. The Lightning network is also likely to follow suit. C-lightning is deprecating the configuration of Tor v2 services starting with its next release, and according to its deprecation policy, it should be able to entirely drop its support three releases after that. Other implementations of the Lightning network have not yet shared their plans for Tor v2 support. At the spec level, it is suggested to advise implementations to ignore the v2 addr type in the node_announcement message's addrs section.</summary>
