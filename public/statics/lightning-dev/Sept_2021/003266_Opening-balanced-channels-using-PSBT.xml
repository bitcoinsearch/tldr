    <summary>Ole Henrik Skogstrøm shared his discovery of opening balanced channels using LND's psbt option. He explained that he essentially joins funded PSBTs before signing and submitting them, which enables him to open a balanced channel between two nodes or a ring of balanced channels between multiple nodes. However, he was unsure if this method is unsafe or not. To do this efficiently, nodes need to collaborate by sending PSBTs back and forth to each other, and automating it through a client would be best. Ole Henrik then provided an example of the complete flow for a single channel and a ring of channels between multiple nodes.Bastien TEINTURIER responded to Ole Henrik's email and informed him that the dual funding proposal provides exactly what he was looking for. Bastien also shared a link to the proposal on Github.Overall, Ole Henrik Skogstrøm shared his discovery of opening balanced channels using LND's psbt option and provided an example of how it works.
