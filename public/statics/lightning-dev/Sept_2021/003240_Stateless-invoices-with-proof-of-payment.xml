    <summary>The context explains a payment protocol using Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) in which the sender locks an HTLC to a hash of a preimage constructed using node_secret, payment_secret, payment_amount, and encoded_order_details. Upon receiving the HTLC, the recipient reconstructs the preimage and settles the payment if H(preimage) matches the HTLC hash. The preimage serves as proof of payment and is returned to the sender. The invoice_hash is learned by the sender from the recipient via an ordinary HTTP request and is part of the bolt11 payment request. The goal of the scheme is to alleviate the recipient from storing the invoices that they generate.</summary>
