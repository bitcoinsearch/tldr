    <summary>In a conversation between ZmnSCPxj and SomberNight, they discuss the privacy implications of using a static key as payment_basepoint for all channels. The possibility of tweaking this approach for each channel is also suggested, but it requires a counter to avoid reuse between multiple channels with the same counterparty. Additionally, users should be able to open new channels after restoring from seed, which may result in a need for a random nonce instead of a counter. An OP_RETURN containing the encrypted counterparty node id is also mentioned as an optional solution, but it is not ideal.</summary>
