    <summary>A proposal has been made to create DNS records that can serve the same information as the @host format for defining a connection to an LN node. These records would allow for alternate host names and storing the pubkey for the LN node in a DNS record, making it easier to connect to machines in the physical world with a human-readable string without QR codes or NFC. The proposal suggests using DNS records to provide information about LN nodes and make connections easier, complementing the peer-to-peer gossip protocol. While this approach has its flaws due to the centralized nature of DNS root servers, implementing DNSSEC may help, and it could be complementary to the peer-to-peer gossip protocol and more efficient long-term. The proposal also acknowledges the limitations of DNS and the need for additional security measures such as DNSSEC. The proposed definition could fit better in lnurl-rfc or as part of a BOLT. Overall, this proposal aims to provide an easier and more reliable way to connect to LN nodes.</summary>
