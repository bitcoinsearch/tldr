    <summary>ZmnSCPxj suggests a solution to address the privacy concerns associated with deriving a static key to be used as payment_basepoint and reused between all channels. The proposed solution involves tweaking the static_payment_basepoint_key using hash(seed | counterparty_node_id) for each channel, which should result in a unique key for each counterparty, but prevent individual counterparties from being able to predict this tweak. This would ensure that privacy is maintained, while still allowing for effective monitoring of p2wsh scripts on-chain.</summary>
