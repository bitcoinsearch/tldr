    <summary>In a recent forum post, ZmnSCPxj cautioned against accepting the proposed algorithm as "optimal," stating that it is only optimal under a specific heuristic used to approximate user preference. Various considerations, from CLTV to fees, need to be balanced in reality, making it challenging to arrive at an optimal solution. However, ZmnSCPxj suggests that it may be possible to translate these considerations into a single unit of measurement: the millisatoshi.ZmnSCPxj went on to explain how CLTV-delta, node failure probability, and fees could be converted into millisatoshis. For instance, the total CLTV-delta time can be calculated based on the worst-case amount of time that an outgoing payment will be stalled. The expected nominal rate of return can be computed by putting the funds in a Bitcoin-denominated investment, which can then be converted into a percentage of the funds. Meanwhile, node failure probability can be multiplied with channel failure probability to determine the effective cost of this path. Finally, fees are already denominated in millisatoshis.</summary>
