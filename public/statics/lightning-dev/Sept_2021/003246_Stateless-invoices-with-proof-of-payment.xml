    <summary>In an email exchange between Bastien TEINTURIER and Joost Jager, they discuss the potential usefulness of invoice storage as a vector for DoS attacks for merchants/hubs. Joost suggests that metadata could be attached to Lightning Network payments in the future, which would lead to rethinking design patterns for ecommerce applications. He gives the example of tlvshop.com, a site he formerly ran with colleagues, which encoded data into a tlv field. However, he acknowledges that too much metadata could decrease payment success rates. They also discuss the size of the field and its impact on onions, but Joost is unsure if forcing shorter routes could have any negative consequences.</summary>
