    <summary>The proposal suggests creating a decentralised integration lab where different Lightning Network implementations, such as CL, Eclair, LDK, and LND, can run on separate "box" setups. The rBOX setup for each implementation would have channels to the other implementation's rBOX, and the same setup goes for rcBOX. Both setups will run on the mainnet and can be tested against by the respective teams either in orchestration or individually. Each team would provide their implementation of BOX with managed channels between all other implementations to ensure thorough testing before any release candidate is made public. This initiative aims to ensure that the Lightning Network is at a point where it is due to be released and is critical to the business.</summary>
