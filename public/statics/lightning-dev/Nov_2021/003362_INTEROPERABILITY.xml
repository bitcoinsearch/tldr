    <summary>Acinq, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs have been suggested to not have enough funds to run a box or two. However, the company already has a main node that runs with real economic activity and has a lot of channels to various nodes implementations and versions.

The company stated that they "eat our own dog food" and will experience force closes before their users do.</summary>
