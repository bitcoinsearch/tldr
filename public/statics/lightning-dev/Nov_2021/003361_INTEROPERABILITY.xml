    <summary>The context describes the process of testing before a public release in open-source projects. Developers run tests on local machines before pushing to the repository, and repository maintainers do their own tests before doing an acceptance test in the proposed system to verify against all other implementations. There are dedicated test machines that have nano granularity, which can specify unix.ts(start)-range-unix.ts(end) of box xyz independently to see if others and own implementation behaves as expected. In response to x-raid's suggestion that each team should provide boxes and channel liquidity as stake on mainnet for tests before announcing a public release, ZmnSCPxj explains that not all members of all teams are independently wealthy and cannot afford significant liquidity on mainnet or good internet connection and keeping a device operational 24/7. He argues that if you have the skill but not the money, you can contribute directly, and if you do not have the skill but have the money, you can contribute by hiring developers to work on the project you want. The Real Issue (TM) here is how to aggregate the will of a group of people without risking that some centralized "manager" of resources gets incentives that diverge from the group of people and starts allocating resources in ways that the group of people would disagree with.ZmnSCPxj also points out that if the money on the node is his own and not contributed by the group that is going to receive the logs, he is not going to send the logs verbatim to them because logs leak information like who his channel counterparties are and how often he forwards HTLCs and exact dates and times of each event, which can be used to locate his node. He suggests redacting sensitive information from the logs, but automated redaction is needed, and if the implementation changes log messages, it needs to ensure that changed log messages do not leak information that gets past the automated redaction.</summary>
