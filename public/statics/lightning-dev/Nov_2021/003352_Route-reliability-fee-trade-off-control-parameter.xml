    <summary>The Lightning Network Software may allow for software to choose a series of attempts that are 95% reliable and provide users with options displaying estimated seconds required for a payment and corresponding fees. This system could make it easier for wallet software to move towards a world where there is no user-visible difference between onchain and offchain payments. However, the estimate provided may not be accurate in the event of "black swan" events or sudden spikes in network traffic. Additionally, the processing required to figure out a payment plan becomes significant at the "seconds" level and may cause issues related to CPU speed or server load. Thus, asking for a fee budget for a payment instead of committing to paying within a certain number of seconds may be more efficient.</summary>
