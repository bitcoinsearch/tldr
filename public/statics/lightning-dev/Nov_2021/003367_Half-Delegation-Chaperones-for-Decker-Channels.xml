    <summary>The context discusses the composition of delegations and AnyPrevOut (APO) in the context of scriptless multisigs. There are three types of delegation discussed: full delegation, partial delegation, and half-delegation. In full delegation, a script S is signed which then signs for transaction T. In partial delegation, a tuple (script R, transaction T) is signed and R may sign T. In half-delegation, a tuple (script R, transaction T) is signed, R may sign T, and revealing T/R grants authorization to any other party. Under the model of scriptless multisigs where S signs T and onion encrypts to the signers of R and distributes the shares, if T is signed by S with APO, then T becomes arbitrarily rebindable. For "correct" use, R should sign with SIGHASH_ALL, binding the transaction to a single instance. A tuple script R + transaction T can often be represented by script R || CTV, and therefore half-delegation can be derived from full delegation and a covenant. The combination of delegation, CTV, and APO may be sufficient for making chaperone signatures work, but APO's design discussion should consider how it might compose with Delegation proposals and CTV instead of revisiting Chaperone signatures.</summary>
