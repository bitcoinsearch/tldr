    <summary>In a discussion on Lightning-dev, ZmnSCPxj questioned whether the hardware and internet connection would be provided for boxes used in testing the Lightning Network. However, it was suggested that testing on the mainnet is more likely to catch complex issues and that release candidates and nightly builds, along with lnprototest, would be a better approach. While some interop bugs may be caught through tracking nodes that are popular on the network, deeper issues can still occur. The need for spec compliance and compatibility of extensions was also highlighted as essential for the continued growth and development of the Lightning Network. Links were provided to the lightning integration testing framework, which has been implemented and operated in the past, and to lnprototest.</summary>
