    <summary>A recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list has resulted in several updates and changes to the Lightning Network protocol's GitHub organization. The Lightning Network is a layer-two payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin that aims to enable faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions. During the discussion, it was suggested that an official logo or avatar for the project would be beneficial. There is currently a placeholder logo from an earlier era that is used as the org's avatar/image, but it was suggested that an official logo would give the project a real symbol. The discussion also covered several other updates and changes to the GitHub organization. The new GitHub org (https://github.com/lightning) now exists, and all the major implementation maintainers have been added to the organization as admins. A new blips repo (https://github.com/lightning/blips) has been created to continue the PR that was originally started in the lightning-rfc repo. The old lightning-rfc repo has been moved over and renamed to "bolts" (https://github.com/lightning/bolts).The Lightning Network GitHub organization was originally created by Joseph, and the lightningnetwork/paper repo was added, the manuscript that kicked off this entire thing. Later lightningnetwork/lnd was created where they started to work on an initial implementation. Eventually, the developers of current implementations all met up in Milan and decided to converge on a single specification, thus adding the BOLTs to the same repo, despite it being used for lnd and knowingly so.There was some discussion around potential admin rights issues on the current specs repos which would be solved by moving them to a new clean repo. As it seems the primary grievance here is collocating an implementation of Lightning along with the specification of the protocol, and given that the spec was added last, it was suggested to move the spec to an independent repo owned by the community. It was suggested that github.com/lightning could be used, or a new org like "lightning-specs" could be created.</summary>
