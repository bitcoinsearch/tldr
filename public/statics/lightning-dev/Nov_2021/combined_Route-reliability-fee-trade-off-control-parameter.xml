    <summary>Lightning pathfinding requires optimizing for routing fee and reliability. Routing fee is the amount paid when a payment is successful, while reliability is expressed as a probability of success for a specific route. Finding a way to balance these two variables in a simple manner for users remains a challenge. One possible approach is to use a single value between 0 and 1 that controls the selection process. However, finding a formula to decide between routes for values in between 0 and 1 is challenging.Different approaches have been suggested to solve this problem. Some propose using the harmonic mean between features instead of a weighted linear sum, while others suggest normalizing payment fees to a [0,1] scale and using a score formula. Joost Jager has explored the concept of "payment attempt cost" in Lightning Network Daemon (lnd), which represents the virtual satoshi amount of a failed payment attempt. This can help improve the reliability of the network by minimizing failures and enhancing user experience.Joost also proposed a fuzzy "time preference" parameter for LND that indicates expected payment time and can be presented as a slider or predefined values. While reliability is a probabilistic property of a route, some argue that users are more interested in how long it will take for their payment to be confirmed. However, providing a simple formula to balance fees and reliability remains an ongoing challenge.The Lightning Network Software may allow for software to choose a series of attempts that are 95% reliable and provide users with estimated times and corresponding fees for payments. However, sudden spikes in network traffic could affect the accuracy of the estimates provided. Additionally, processing required to figure out a payment plan becomes significant at the "seconds" level and may cause issues related to CPU speed or server load.In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, there were differing opinions on how to present the estimated payment time to users. While some argued that adding a choice of seconds expectation to the user interface (UI) for Lightning payments would not make for a great user experience, others suggested that some kind of control is needed to bridge the gap between fast and cheap payments.ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about presenting users with an estimate of the number of seconds required to complete a payment via Lightning Network. Instead, ZmnSCPxj suggests requesting a fee budget for a payment rather than committing to a specified timeframe. The goal should be to give users an estimate of fees necessary to succeed within a reasonable time without putting a choice of seconds expectation in the UI. An option to optimize for fees could be given only if they are really cheap and the user does not care if the payment succeeds.</summary>
