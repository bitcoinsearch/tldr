    <summary>In an email discussion between Joost Jager and Rene Pickhardt regarding Lightning pathfinding, Joost addresses the two main variables to optimize for: routing fee and reliability. While routing fee is concrete, being the sat amount paid when a payment succeeds, reliability is a probabilistic property of a route that can be expressed as a probability of success. During pathfinding, route options are compared against each other based on these two factors. Joost proposes a trade-off between routing fee and reliability by offering a single value between 0 and 1 to control the selection process. However, he seeks a simple formula to decide between routes for values in between 0 and 1. Rene acknowledges that feature engineering involves two or more steps: feature selection and combining features. He suggests using the harmonic mean between features instead of a weighted linear sum to optimize pathfinding since it has been shown to work well without the need to learn a weight/parameter. Rene further explains that there is no universal truth for situations like this, and only tests and experience will help make good decisions.</summary>
