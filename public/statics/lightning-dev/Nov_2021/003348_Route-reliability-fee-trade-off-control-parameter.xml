    <summary>A Lightning developer named Joost Jager asked for ideas on how to approach the best formula to decide between routes during pathfinding, preferably with a sound probability-theoretical basis. The two main variables to optimize in Lightning pathfinding are routing fee and reliability, which is expressed as a probability that a route will be successful. Route options are compared against each other, and it depends on user preference which one is the better route. It would be great to offer this trade-off to the user in a simple way, preferably a single [0, 1] value that controls the selection process. However, choosing between routes for a value somewhere in between 0 and 1 requires a simple formula with a sound probability-theoretical basis. Joost explored starting with a statement by the user in a specific form, but he did not find a model that can generalize it to arbitrary inputs A% and B%. He believes that there must be some probabilistic equation, law, rule, or theorem that can support it.</summary>
