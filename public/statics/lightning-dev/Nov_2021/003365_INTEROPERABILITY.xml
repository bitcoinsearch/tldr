    <summary>The context of the conversation is regarding interoperability among different implementations and version management of chosen implementation. Developers are already running nodes connected to other implementations on mainnet, to catch bugs that are not easily visible in isolation, but need real data on the network. The C-Lightning node has channels to LNBIG (lnd) and some unpublished channels made to it are Electrum which means the node is already running against other implementations. It is suggested that different implementation maintainers should do an extra test live on mainnet with liquidity in channels towards the other impl versions before sign off a stable release. The idea is to catch unforeseen glitches that tests of impl in isolation can not catch.</summary>
