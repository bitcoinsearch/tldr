    <summary>In an email conversation, x-raid was asked if they would provide hardware and internet connection for certain boxes. The person writing the email mentioned that they knew of someone who ran a node tracking the C-Lightning master and that they themselves ran a node that they updated every release of C-Lightning. While they didn't know about the actual implementations of what they connect to, LND is very popular on the network and LNBIG is known to be an LND shop, and nearly every long-lived forwarding node has at least one channel with some LNBIG node. They considered this "good enough" in practice to catch interop bugs, but some interop bugs are deeper than just direct node-to-node communications. For example, there had been bugs in their interop with LND `keysend` before.</summary>
