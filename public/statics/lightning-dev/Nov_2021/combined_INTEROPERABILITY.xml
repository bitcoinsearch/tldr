    <summary>In a recent discussion, developers of Lightning Network Node implementations were urged not to devote additional hardware and resources when they have already provided their implementations for free. The need for spec compliance and compatibility of extensions was also highlighted as essential for the continued growth and development of the network. To address the issue of interoperability among Lightning Network node operators, it was suggested that different implementation maintainers test live on the mainnet with liquidity in channels towards other implementation versions. This is necessary to catch unforeseen glitches that tests in isolation cannot detect. Developers are already running nodes connected to other implementations on the mainnet 24/7, and large release windows are used before making a final release to catch bugs that are not easily visible in isolation but need real data on the network.The proposal suggests creating a decentralised integration lab where different Lightning Network implementations can run on separate box setups with channels to other implementations' boxes for thorough testing. However, not all team members may be able to afford significant liquidity on the mainnet or a good internet connection, which raises concerns about how to aggregate the will of a group of people without risking centralization. The proposal suggests that each team should manage their own implementation analysis, but outsourcing is allowed. To ensure privacy and avoid targeted attacks, logs must have sensitive information redacted, and automated redaction is needed for changed log messages. Additionally, Acinq, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs may not have enough funds to run a box, but they already have main nodes that run with real economic activity and stay up-to-date for critical commits and releases. The Lightning Network needs to mature as a financial network system class in preparation for onboarding one billion users by 2026.The discussion also highlights the importance of testing before a public release in open-source projects. It was suggested that a HTML web service user interface with side-by-side windows representing an implementation instance version and a query for download files of range unix.ts per instance could be used. The central point collector could be run outside of the implementation team's perimeter and sponsored, but there are concerns regarding information leakage, which can be used to locate a node and become a target for a targeted attack.Finally, it was proposed that individuals should take up the task of contributing to the development of the network instead of expecting more hardware and resources from Lightning Network Node implementers like Acinq, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs. ZmnSCPxj clarifies that developers are already running nodes connected to other implementations on the mainnet, and he offers to install C-Lightning and CLBOSS on x-raid's hardware using an SSH key and provide addresses of the C-Lightning node so x-raid can provide coins for CLBOSS to manage.</summary>
