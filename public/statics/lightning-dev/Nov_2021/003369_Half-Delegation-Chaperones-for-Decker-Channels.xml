    <summary>In this conversation, the speakers discuss different types of delegation scripts in Bitcoin. They define full delegation as a script that allows one party to sign another script, which can then sign a transaction. Partial delegation is defined as a script that allows one party to sign a tuple consisting of both a script and a transaction, which can then sign the transaction. One example they give for how these delegation scripts could be used is with a scriptless multisig, where S signs T and then onion encrypts to the signers of R and distributes the shares. However, they note that if T is signed by S with AnyPrevOut, then T is now arbitrarily rebindable. To prevent this, they define half-delegation as a script where one party can sign a tuple consisting of both a script and a transaction, and R may sign the transaction, but revealing T/R does not grant authorization to any other party. They also discuss how different signing methods (such as SSS or SIGHASH_ALL) can be used depending on the specifics of the delegation script.The speakers also make some observations about chaperone signatures and how they relate to delegation scripts, noting that chaperone signatures can be useful for dynamically picking/rotating keys. However, they agree that APO's design discussion should not revisit chaperone signatures and instead consider how APO might compose with delegation proposals and CTV.</summary>
