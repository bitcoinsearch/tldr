    <summary>The Lightning Network pathfinding algorithm optimizes for routing fee and reliability. Reliability is expressed as a probability of success for a specific route. The challenge is to offer users a simple way to balance these two variables. To address this, Joost Jager proposed a statement by the user specifying their willingness to pay for a route with a specified success probability. An abstract interface, currently being explored in LDK, allows users to specify the maximum amount they are willing to pay to avoid certain routes, which optimizes for something the user controls. However, the model relies on naive guesses for failure probability, so advanced models can be plugged in instead. There is an ongoing search for a probabilistic equation, law, rule or theorem that supports this optimization. In the meantime, a simple formula that balances reliability and fee would be ideal.</summary>
