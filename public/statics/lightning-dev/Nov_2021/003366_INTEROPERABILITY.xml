    <summary>The email conversation is discussing the need for interoperability among different implementations and version management. The suggestion is to have a HTML web service user interface with side-by-side windows representing an implementation instance version and a query for download files of range unix.ts per instance. The discussion also mentions the need for extra testing live on mainnet with liquidity in channels towards other impl versions to catch unforeseen glitches that tests of implementations in isolation cannot catch. ZmnSCPxj, who is responsible for signing stable version releases, clarifies that developers are already running nodes connected to other implementations on mainnet 24/7 and that they have large release windows before making a final release to catch bugs that are not easily visible in isolation but need real data on the network. In response to xraid's request for assistance, ZmnSCPxj suggests that xraid put up hardware and coins himself if he really wants this to happen and offers to install C-Lightning and CLBOSS on xraid's hardware using an SSH key and provide addresses of the C-Lightning node so xraid can provide coins for CLBOSS to manage.</summary>
