    <summary>In an email chain, a member suggests using an identicon or official logo for a project. They attached an SVG file they created that was inspired by a previous link but made solely by them. The icon is released under CC0. Another member suggests a modification to a different icon link that looks more "networky". However, the first member argues that the simplicity of their Lightning symbol allows for third parties to use it as a basis for their own logos.</summary>
