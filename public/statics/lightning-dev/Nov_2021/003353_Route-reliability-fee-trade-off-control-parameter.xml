    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about presenting users with an estimate of the number of seconds required to complete a payment via Lightning Network. While it may be possible to provide users with estimates based on reliability scoring, network accidents such as nodes dropping off the network can cause unexpected delays. Additionally, calculating a payment plan at the second level can be computationally intensive and may depend on factors such as local CPU speed or delegated pathfinding servers. Instead, ZmnSCPxj suggests requesting a fee budget for a payment rather than committing to a specified timeframe. The goal should be to give users an estimate of fees necessary to succeed within a reasonable time without putting a choice of seconds expectation in the UI. An option to optimize for fees could be given only if they are really cheap and the user does not care if the payment succeeds.</summary>
