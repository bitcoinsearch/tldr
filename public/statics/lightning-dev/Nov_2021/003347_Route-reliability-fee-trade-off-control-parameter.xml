    <summary>In Lightning pathfinding, the primary variables to optimize for are routing fee and reliability. Routing fee is a concrete value, while reliability is a property of a route that can be expressed as a probability. During pathfinding, route options are compared against each other based on their fees and success probabilities. The challenge lies in offering users a simple way to choose between different routes that balances reliability and fees. One possible approach suggested by the user is to use a single [0,1] value that controls the selection process: at 0, the route is only optimized for fees, while at 1, the route is only optimized for reliability. However, finding a formula to decide between routes for values in between 0 and 1 remains a challenge. The user suggests exploring probabilistic equations or laws that can support this, but no model has yet been found to generalize inputs beyond the example given.</summary>
