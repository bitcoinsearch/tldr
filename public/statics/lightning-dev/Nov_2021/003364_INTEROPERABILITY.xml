    <summary>In a discussion about interoperability among Lightning Network node operators, Pierre of Acinq commented that they "eat their own dog food" and experience force closes before their users do. It was suggested that node operators conduct live tests in their continuous integration efforts to ensure stable releases of chosen implementations. The idea of different implementation maintainers testing live on the mainnet with liquidity in channels towards other implementation versions was also proposed to catch unforeseen glitches that individual tests cannot detect. Additionally, it was suggested to have a collection point where loglines from instances taking part in the interoperability assurance test could be fetched. This would help assert that a new release of an implementation is interoperable and can be recommended for installation as the latest stable release version. The discussion emphasized the need for the Lightning Network to mature as a financial network system class in preparation for onboarding one billion users by 2026. Finally, ZmnSCPxj proposed that instead of expecting more hardware and resources from Lightning Network Node implementers like Acinq, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs, individuals should take up the task themselves and contribute to the development of the network.</summary>
