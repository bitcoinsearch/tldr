    <summary>In a recent email to the Lightning Development mailing list, Joost Jager discussed his work on "payment attempt cost" in the Lightning Network Daemon (lnd). This virtual satoshi amount represents the cost of a failed payment attempt. The question that Joost poses is: what is the cost of a failed LN payment? Joost explains that this cost can be difficult to calculate, as it depends on various factors such as the number of hops involved in the payment route and the fee rates of each node along the way. He suggests that these costs could be estimated using simulations or statistical analysis.This concept of payment attempt cost is important because it can help improve the reliability of the Lightning Network. By understanding the cost of failed payments, developers can work to minimize these failures and improve the overall user experience.Overall, Joost's work on payment attempt cost highlights the ongoing efforts to optimize and improve the Lightning Network. While there are still challenges to overcome, the continued innovation and dedication of developers like Joost are helping to make the Lightning Network a more robust and reliable payment network for the future.</summary>
