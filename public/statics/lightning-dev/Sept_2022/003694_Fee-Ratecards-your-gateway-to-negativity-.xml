    <summary>The email conversation talks about pathfinding algorithms and their dependence on data collection probing. The writer suggests that failed payment attempts can be indistinguishable from data collection probing, but data collection probing is preferable as it can happen out of band without causing latency. They raise a question regarding the need for channel capacities to efficiently make payments and if that information should be gossiped. The writer argues that collecting less fees at 25% balance than at 75% balance is generally a false optimization since what needs to be maintained is a balanced flow over time. Instead, they suggest having fee rate cards that depend on time of day/week as a better method of optimization. In response to this, another writer suggests introducing negative fees that make channel balance data a competitive advantage, which will cause node operators to guard their balances and balance data more closely. However, the first writer notes that such a situation would encourage channel owners to broadcast the information rather than keep it private, creating a market for centralized information brokers. The email contains links to previous discussions on related topics.</summary>
