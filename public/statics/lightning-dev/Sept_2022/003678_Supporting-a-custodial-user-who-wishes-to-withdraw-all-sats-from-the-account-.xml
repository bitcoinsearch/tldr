    <summary>In a conversation between Martin and ZmnSCPxj, the topic of wallets supporting ‘send max’ when a zero-amount invoice is used was discussed. Martin suggested that it could be a problem with the custodial service not supporting this feature. However, ZmnSCPxj pointed out that even if a solution is found, there is no guarantee that the custodial service will implement it. They could also pretend that the routing fees paid were higher than they actually were. Therefore, there may be no real solution to ensure the safety of funds in a custodial service.</summary>
