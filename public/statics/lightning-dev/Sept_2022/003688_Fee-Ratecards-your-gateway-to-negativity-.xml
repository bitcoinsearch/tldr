    <summary>In an email exchange, Lisa Neigut proposed the idea of a ratecard, which is a set of four values that price different bands of available liquidity for a channel. ZmnSCPxj responded that the process would be the same as it currently is, with the sender optimistically trying a route with a particular feerate and if that fails, trying another route. A rate card can be modeled as four separate channels between the same two nodes, with different costs each. If the path at the lowest cost fails, you just try at another route that may have more hops but lower effective cost, or else try the same channel at a higher cost. ZmnSCPxj also questioned why the concern about centralization of services collecting information hasn't already manifested in the current network where try-and-try-again is the standard algorithm for payments.</summary>
