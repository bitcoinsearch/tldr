    <summary>The email exchange and Github discussion regarding the implementation of inbound fees in the Lightning Network has raised several concerns. Joost Jager argues that routing nodes should be compensated for accepting incoming htlc and locking up funds in channels, while Bastien Teinturier believes that allowing inbound fees could lead to malicious nodes selectively failing HTLCs and breaking routing incentives. Other participants suggest alternative solutions such as making the opener pay a fee to compensate for risk or setting up a fee-charging gateway with a private channel to the main node accepting payments.Proposals for changing the fee structure of the Lightning Network have raised concerns about breaking the incentive and making the network less reliable. However, some argue that adding inbound fees could lead to better capital placement on the network and lower routing fees. Current path-finding algorithms do not support negative fees, but rounding up to zero is still a quick fix and better than ignoring inbound fees completely. Feedback is currently being sought from both Lightning devs and routing node operators.One issue that has affected the Lightning Network is the use of certain HTLCs, which can damage the reputation of users. To address this, proponents of inbound fees suggest charging nodes receiving payments instead of those sending them. This proposal could incentivize nodes to maintain liquidity and reduce the need for opening new channels or looping payments. Lightning developer Joost Jager believes that greater expressivity in fee-setting generally allows markets to push more flows off-chain. While he thinks negative fees would be more impactful for this purpose, he also sees the potential benefits of combining negative and inbound fees. Overall, Jager believes that inbound fees would be helpful for the Lightning Network, especially in encouraging routing node operators to provide better liquidity and routing services. He is seeking input from other routing node operators to further develop this proposal.</summary>
