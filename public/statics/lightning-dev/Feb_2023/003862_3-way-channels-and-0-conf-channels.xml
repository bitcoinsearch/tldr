    <summary>The Lightning Network primarily uses 2 of 2 multisig channels, but there could be advantages to having channels between three nodes instead of two. For example, channels could advertise which node has the lowest balance, allowing for better balance and overall liquidity. A node with three channels attached to it can be considered completely connected and can route to ten different next hops for only three opening transaction fees. While the time cost is doubled, settling a new payment between three nodes can take around 600ms on average. The channel's lowest balance could be a one-bit boolean value publicly broadcast, making pathfinding easier. In addition, there is an issue regarding 0 conf channels. While a midpoint is an abstract term for 1D lines, it can also apply to 2D and nD shapes. Negotiation protocols could pre-arrange a not yet mined opening tx for a 3-way lightning channel, effectively locking in every party so that they cannot back out of the commitment. This would not be possible with a 2-way.</summary>
