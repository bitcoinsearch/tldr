    <summary>The Lightning Network has proposed a new payment routing method called Payment Route Reservation that splits the payment process into two steps, offering higher reliability, lower latency and fees, increased privacy, and a healthier, more decentralized network. The routing node reserves a specified amount of satoshis with a timeout and if the reservation is not canceled, those satoshis can be used in the next payment step. The Lightning Network has also introduced Trampoline Route Split Reservation, which allows senders to split payments into smaller parts and create multiple reservation routes to create market competition for faster and cheaper routes. Furthermore, publishing channel capacity is not necessary for privacy currencies like Monero, and only hop counts and randomness would be used for routing decisions. The Lightning Network acknowledges that payments may still fail due to reservation timeout, node unavailability, or griefing nodes, but Stuckless Payments can help increase reliability to around 99 percent.In addition, g0b1el has proposed implementing ASCII graphics to improve the user experience for command line tools in a recent proposal on the Lightning mailing list. Despite the potential benefits of this feature, some users have expressed concerns about its practicality, including how well the graphics will render in various environments and whether they will be accessible to all users.Furthermore, g0b1el mentioned two additional improvements to the Lightning Network's payment protocol in a recent email. The first improvement involves nodes on the route receiving the same amount of reservation without the need to put the amount inside the onion. The second improvement eliminates the need for an HTLC onion in the second step as route hops already contain all the necessary information to create HTLCs. Both proposals can be found on the mailing list archive if ASCII graphics are not rendering correctly.</summary>
