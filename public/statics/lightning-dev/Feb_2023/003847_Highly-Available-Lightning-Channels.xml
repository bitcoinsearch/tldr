    <summary>In a discussion about reputation systems in lightning networks, ZmnSCPxj categorizes them into first-hand experience, inferred experience, and hearsay. While the first two are ideal, they are limited by the rarity of repeat interactions and out-of-date knowledge. The solution to this problem is forwardable peerswaps which creates paths for payment routing without pervasive monitoring. They ensure that "beneficial for me" is also "beneficial to everyone", making them beneficial to every participant and should be part of the law of lightning network protocol. This system only requires local reputation and is not based on self-assertions or hearsay.</summary>
