    <summary>In a recent proposal on the Lightning mailing list, g0b1el suggests implementing ASCII graphics to improve the user experience for command line tools. However, some users have reported issues with the rendering of these graphics in certain environments. To address this problem, g0b1el recommends reading the proposal on the mailing list archive where the graphics are rendered correctly.The proposal outlines a new feature that would allow users to view transaction details and other information in a more visually appealing format. This would be accomplished through the use of ASCII graphics, which are simple and easy to read. The proposed implementation would also include options for customization, allowing users to adjust the graphics to suit their preferences.Despite the potential benefits of this feature, some users have expressed concerns about its practicality. Specifically, there are questions about how well the graphics will render in various environments and whether they will be accessible to all users. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential impact on performance and resource usage.Overall, the proposal represents an interesting idea for improving the user experience of Lightning's command line tools. However, further discussion and testing may be necessary to determine whether it is feasible and practical to implement. In the meantime, interested parties can review the proposal on the mailing list archive to see the proposed graphics in action.</summary>
