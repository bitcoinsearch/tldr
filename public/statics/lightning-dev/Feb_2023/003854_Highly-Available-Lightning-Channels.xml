    <summary>When setting a flag without a credit relationship, the node setting it will need to ensure they open new channels, rebalance or swap-in in time to maintain outbound liquidity. This is necessary for running an HA channel. It can be difficult to determine the appropriate threshold for setting this flag and whether the channel is usually saturating in the inbound direction. Additionally, changes in saturation could potentially cause issues. While some operators publish data about their experiences, it may not be representative of the entire network's payment success rates. Ultimately, it is impossible to know exactly what is happening on the lightning network. However, some data can be found publicly at https://river.com/learn/files/river-lightning-report.pdf.</summary>
