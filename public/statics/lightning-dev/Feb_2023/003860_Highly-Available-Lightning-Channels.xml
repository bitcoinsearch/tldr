    <summary>The email thread discusses the different types of nodes in the Lightning Network and how to fetch scoring data for each type. The sender, Joost Jager, proposes that there are three relevant "buckets" of nodes: large nodes sending lots of payments, client nodes that just connect to an LSP or two, and nodes that route some but don't send a lot of payments. For category (a) nodes, Joost believes that the network maturing and improving the scoring algorithms is sufficient. Category (b) nodes can easily download data from a node in category (a), while category (c) nodes can rely on semi-trusted data from a third party. However, another participant in the thread argues that this approach may lead to centralization and favors the ha flag as it allows small nodes to build up their view of the network in an efficient and independent manner. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of neutral protocol development and design.</summary>
