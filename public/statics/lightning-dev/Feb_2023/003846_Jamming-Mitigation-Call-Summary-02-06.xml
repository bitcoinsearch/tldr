    <summary>The email thread discusses the idea of creating a public Google calendar or shared calendar. A link is provided to a Google calendar that can be used for this purpose. The discussion then shifts to an ongoing attempt to define a standard for lightning network metrics, which started over a year ago. The source code for this project is available on GitHub at https://github.com/LNOpenMetrics. The basic idea is to collect data from different nodes and analyze them before defining any protocol support via BOLT or BLIPS. The author suggests that different types of nodes may deserve different kinds of metrics/reputation. Some data related to forwarding payment scoring by channels and node uptime is already accessible via a public API at https://api.lnmetrics.info. The email concludes with thanks for pointing out the potential usefulness of this information.</summary>
