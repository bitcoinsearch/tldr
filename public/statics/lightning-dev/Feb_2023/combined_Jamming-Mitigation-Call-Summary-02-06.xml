    <summary>During Monday's call, attendees discussed proof of forwarding schemes and the challenges surrounding upfront fees and differential rates. They considered a scenario where nodes collaborate to "forward" a payment despite having some proof of forward. The group also discussed upfront fees combined with attributable errors to punish nodes that steal upfront fees rather than forwarding HTLC. The discussion included experimentation with circuit breakers in the context of local reputation or HTLC endorsement, as well as automating decision-making for end users. However, the implementation of these solutions was noted to require wider spread adoption and changes to surface TLVs on the interceptor API. The group acknowledged the complexity of jamming mitigation and whether these imperfect solutions are worth pursuing.Carla Kirk-Cohen announced technical issues with the recording of the call, and attendees were asked to chime in if anything was missed. Details for the next call were shared, including the date, time, link, and agenda. Clara had taken notes as well, but Carla relied on her memory which she stated is a "severely corrupted data store." There was also a suggestion made to create a public Google Calendar or other type of shared calendar.The email thread discusses the idea of creating a public Google calendar or shared calendar. A link is provided to a Google calendar that can be used for this purpose. The discussion then shifts to an ongoing attempt to define a standard for lightning network metrics, which started over a year ago. The source code for this project is available on GitHub at https://github.com/LNOpenMetrics. The basic idea is to collect data from different nodes and analyze them before defining any protocol support via BOLT or BLIPS. The author suggests that different types of nodes may deserve different kinds of metrics/reputation. Some data related to forwarding payment scoring by channels and node uptime is already accessible via a public API at https://api.lnmetrics.info. The email concludes with thanks for pointing out the potential usefulness of this information.The LSP specification group has bi-weekly calls and welcomes additional participants. Vincent brought up an ongoing effort to define a kind of standard for Lightning Network metrics that started over a year ago. The idea of defining what qualifies as good behavior in the Lightning Network could be valuable across the board. The next call is scheduled for February 20th at 18:00 UTC on https://meet.jit.si/UnjammingLN with an agenda available at https://github.com/ClaraShk/LNJamming/issues/3.</summary>
