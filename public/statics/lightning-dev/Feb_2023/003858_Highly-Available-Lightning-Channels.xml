    <summary>During a conversation on highly available lightning channels, Joost Jager asked how to decide on setting the channel without a credit relationship and whether he would be punished for not meeting HA guarantees. Matt Corallo replied that as a node setting the flag, one needs to make sure to open new channels, rebalance or swap-in in time to maintain outbound liquidity, which is part of running an HA channel. When Joost asked how one could be sure about this given that payment success rates are not publicly visible, Matt suggested fetching scoring data from relevant "buckets" of nodes: large nodes sending lots of payments, client nodes, and routing nodes that don't send many payments. He proposed that trusting third-party scoring data for routing nodes seems reasonable and would give everyone a similar experience as the River report.</summary>
