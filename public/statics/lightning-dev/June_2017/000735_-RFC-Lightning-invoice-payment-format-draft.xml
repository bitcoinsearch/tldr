    <summary>In a message from ZmnSCPxj, a doubled "than" was reported at line 20 of Bolt#11. They also noted that they could not find a clear description of how the tagged `d` field is encoded, and that the examples provided have no `d` field. They assume it is in ASCII or UTF8 and packed into 5-bit packets, but believe a proper description of its intended encoding should be included in the BOLT.</summary>
