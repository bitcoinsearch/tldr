    <summary>The letter discusses the potential issues with parsing the optional amount in lightning invoices due to the separator character "1" being used for both human-readable and data parts. If the version is upgraded, there may be confusion about whether a payment starting with lnbc1p indicates a 1 pico-bitcoin payment or an arbitrary payment to a version-1 data part. It is suggested that fixing the first 5 bits to be 0 could provide an unambiguous separator between the two parts. The author also questions the statement that lightning invoices are optimized for human errors, as they are longer than segwit addresses and therefore more prone to errors. They suggest rewording the statement to clarify that human errors are unlikely compared to other types of errors.</summary>
