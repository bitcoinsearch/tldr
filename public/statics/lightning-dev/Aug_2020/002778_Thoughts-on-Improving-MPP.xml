    <summary>ZmnSCPxj suggests splitting payments in terms of a Fibonacci sequence instead of splitting payments by half in case of an adaptive split. He explains that using the Fibonacci sequence would lead to fewer splits and better utilization of available channel capacity. ZmnSCPxj notes that power-of-two splitting is used in `lnd`. The worst-case behavior for power-of-two splitting requires more splits than the worst-case behavior for the Fibonacci sequence. By dividing payments by the Golden Ratio, which approximates the ratio between consecutive entries in the Fibonacci sequence, an approximately Fibonacci sequence can be achieved.</summary>
