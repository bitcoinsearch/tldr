    <summary>In this conversation between Antoine and Zeeman, they discuss the security of zero-confirmation channels. Zeeman suggests a method to increase the security of these channels by sending a high-fee RBF-enabled transaction to Antoine while simultaneously sending a conflicting low-fee RBF-disabled transaction to all available miners. Antoine argues that mapping miner nodes is not a high-cost endeavor and could provide an added layer of security. However, he also points out that any timelock-based higher layer is at risk for anyone powerful enough to reorg. Zeeman counters that this method is only necessary if double-spending of zero-conf channels becomes a real issue, but Antoine argues that 0-conf is simply not safe and there are potential solutions in place. They conclude that once a channel is deeply confirmed, it becomes perfectly safe and that most 0-conf channel mechanisms involve fiat-to-Bitcoin exchanges, which requires tr*st anyway.</summary>
