    <summary>Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Matt are discussing the use of backpressure rate limiting as a solution to mitigate attacks on the Lightning Network. While Olaoluwa agrees that backpressure can work in DoS situations, he raises concerns about its reliability for routine tasks like fetching invoices. Matt argues that this is more of a networking problem than a costing one. They discuss the similarities between the Lightning Network and Tor, but Matt points out that invoice requests require trivial amounts of bandwidth and are not comparable to Tor's current attack. Olaoluwa also questions whether rate limiting could affect users who are streaming payments in real-time, but Matt dismisses this argument as onion messages are cheap compared to HTLCs. Finally, they address using backpressure for rate limiting HTLCs, which Matt confirms is already being done with a tight rate limit of around 400 HTLCs in flight at once.</summary>
