    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a member of the Lightning-dev mailing list, wrote a short write-up on various strategies that public forwarding nodes may utilize. The strategies include passive rebalance, set feerates according to balance, low fee, and wall. If there were only a single wall node, it can stop rebalancing once the price to rebalance costs more than 49% of its earnings, so it paid 49% of its earnings to the passive rebalancers and keeps 51% of its earnings, thus earning more than the passive rebalancers earn. However, once multiple wall nodes exist, they will start bidding for the available liquidity from the passive rebalancers and may find it difficult to compete. Passive rebalancers would outcompete wall strategies if they were the only strategies on the network. However, the network as-is contains a lot of tiny nodes with low feerates. In such an environment, walls can pick up liquidity for really cheap, leaving the low-feerate nodes with no liquidity in the correct direction.Low feerate nodes are notoriously unreliable for payments because their channels are usually saturated in one side or another since walls keep taking their liquidity. Because of this known unreliability, some payer strategies filter them out via some heuristics. Both low-feerates and walls do not leak their channel balances, whereas passive rebalancers do leak their channel balance. The author suggests that actual experimentation on models or on actual network nodes might be better than speculation. In a discussion between Michael and ZmnSCPxj, the latter mentions Alex Bosworth's presentation on categorizing different strategies for a routing/forwarding node. ZmnSCPxj thinks that the general forwarding strategy is separate from the strategies presented by Alex Bosworth.</summary>
