    <summary>In an email exchange between Joost Jager and Bastien about the management of fees on the Lightning Network, Bastien argued that it doesn't make sense for users to dictate how their peers manage their own funds in a channel. He suggested that if users are unhappy with how their peer is managing fees, they should not open channels with them and let the network decide whether they are right or wrong. Bastien also pointed out that if all the funds are on the peer's side, then this is not the user's problem, and they are benefiting from free inbound liquidity. Additionally, he warned that allowing users to set fees on their peers' side of the channel could lead to routing incentives being broken, as malicious users could use high fees to DoS other users' payments. Joost responded with clarification around path-finding algorithms and negative fees, pointing out that rounding up to zero is a quick fix if the sum of inbound and outbound fees turns out negative due to uncoordinated fee setting by nodes. The email exchange was part of a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
