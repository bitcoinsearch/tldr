    <summary>In an email conversation, Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Matt discuss the issue of paying for spam in relation to pre-payments for Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) to mitigate jamming attacks. While HTLCs differ in cost from PoW-for-spam, Matt agrees that naive proposals for pre-payments are not ideal. Instead, Olaoluwa advocates for the forwarding pass approach that would allow major flows of the network to continue despite disruption. However, Matt suggests a "pay per HTLC-locked-time" fee with Rusty's proposal, which allows someone to force-close a channel to "blame" a hop for not failing back after fees stop coming in, though it could put a high premium on uptime. The conversation remains open to further discussion and alternative solutions.</summary>
