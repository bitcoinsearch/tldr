    <summary>In this context, Laolu expresses his concern about relying solely on backpressure rate limiting which could lead to routine tasks like fetching invoices becoming unreliable. He suggests that there might be a need to learn from what works and what doesn't work for Tor, although the systems aren't identical but have some similarities. Laolu also raises a question about whether someone doing streaming payments for a live stream ends up being erroneously rate limited by their peers, leading to their livestream being shut off. In addition, he questions why backpressure rate limiting can't be used for HTLCs as well.</summary>
