    <summary>A developer from dlcspecs reached out for feedback on a PR that aims to send messages larger than 65KB using BOLT 8. However, it wasn't clear from reading BOLT 8 that this was possible without adding any new application layer messages. The sender just needs to chunk their messages and the receiver reads them out into a read buffer exposed over a stream-like interface. This is similar to sending a 65KB message over TCP/IP. The OG spec had this feature but it was removed to simplify things. To reintroduce it, a new wumbo message feature bit can be added.</summary>
