    <summary>In a discussion between Michael and ZmnSCPxj, the latter mentions Alex Bosworth's presentation on categorizing different strategies for a routing/forwarding node. ZmnSCPxj suggests that Michael's attempt at categorizing forwarding node strategies is more granular and unstructured based on individual responses. However, ZmnSCPxj points out that all of the broad categories suggested by Bosworth have a common theme of being public forwarding nodes. In his writeup, ZmnSCPxj highlights various strategies that any public forwarding node may have, including passive rebalance, wall, or low fee forwarding strategies, independently of whether it is just a forwarding node or has additional roles such as merchant/personal node or selling inbound liquidity elsewhere. ZmnSCPxj thinks that the general forwarding strategy is separate from the strategies presented by Alex Bosworth.</summary>
