    <summary>In this email exchange, Laolu questions the viability of proposals to introduce pre-payments for HTLCs to mitigate jamming attacks. He notes that this approach suffers from the same issue as paying in a Proof-of-Work system - it is difficult to assign a reasonable cost that an attacker cares about without impacting system usability. Instead, he advocates for the forwarding pass approach, which would gracefully degrade to stratified topology and allow major flows of the network to continue even in the face of disruption. The email exchange highlights the challenges of designing systems that are both secure and usable.</summary>
