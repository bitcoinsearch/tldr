    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Mats Jerratsch and Rusty Russell spoke about the use of onion routing for sending messages over the Lightning network. The conversation addressed the issue of preferences for what should be sent through onion routing versus what shouldn't. The idea was to extricate messaging from payments by having the vendor negotiate with a node to forward a payment and then have the buyer route to that node. The provision of messaging raised concerns about spam and payment disputes. If lightning is used for messaging, the recipient could claim the route failed and not pay for the message. On the other hand, if nodes are trusted, it raises questions about security and reliability. Rusty suggested that reinventing a peer-to-peer messaging network seems outside scope, but there's nothing stopping them from doing so in a future revision.</summary>
