    <summary>In a conversation between Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Rusty, they discussed the possibility of using cha cha encryption for their protocol. Olaoluwa suggested that packet lengths should be encrypted with a separate key in a similar way to the openssh's chacha20-poly3015 specification to keep the packet length and payload confidential. Rusty agreed and noted that timing and packet boundary measurement can still determine sizes. They also talked about handling limited re-transmission due to nodes going down, as the protocol assumes nodes store things persistently but packet loss and connection issues can occur. As the protocol is command/response-based, retransmission should be responded to by retransmitting the response.</summary>
