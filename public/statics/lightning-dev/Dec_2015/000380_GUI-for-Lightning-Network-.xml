    <summary>Mark suggests that an RPC interface approach is the best for agnostic web clients with OTP as standard and also praises yubikey support. Luke Dashjr does not see a distinction between wallet integration or LN node management, saying that every wallet should be a LN node.

This conversation took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
