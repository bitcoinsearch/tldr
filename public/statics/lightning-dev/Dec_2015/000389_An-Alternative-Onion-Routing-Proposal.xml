    <summary>Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Rusty Russell discussed the byte size of a Lightning Network header overhead. Osuntokun suggested the current header overhead was 3840 bytes, while Rusty argued that it was 1300 bytes. The former included payloads for each node, whereas the latter only had sha256 (32 bytes) + pubkey (33 bytes). They also talked about the message authentication code (MAC) used in the network, with Rusty suggesting ChaCha20+poly1035 as an alternative to AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA-256. However, he wanted to debate this with crypto experts. Rusty also mentioned that his implementation currently used AES-CTR as a stream cipher and a truncated SHA-256-HMAC for the MAC. He planned to port this over to ChaCha-Poly3015 when he had time. They both agreed that Sphinx should be sufficient for now, but Matts might be interested in extending it in the future. Finally, they agreed to discuss their proposed p2p crypto handshake in a new thread.</summary>
