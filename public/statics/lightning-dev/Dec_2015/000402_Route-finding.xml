    <summary>The idea is for neighbors of beacon nodes to discover when one of their neighbors has become a beacon. This information will then be propagated to their other neighbors. The process is designed to minimize traffic, making it easy and efficient. While there is no detailed explanation about the purpose of this discovery, it is possible that it could have applications in areas such as tracking or monitoring of devices in a network. The context does not provide any additional information beyond this idea, leaving much open to interpretation.</summary>
