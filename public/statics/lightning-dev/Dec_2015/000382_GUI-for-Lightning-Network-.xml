    <summary>Mark and Lawrence are discussing the implementation of Lightning Network (LN) nodes. They agree that there will be two types of nodes: endpoints (consumers and providers) and relays (standalone LN nodes). Mark suggests that endpoints should be integrated into wallets while relays should have their own management console. Lawrence agrees and adds that an RPC interface would be useful for agnostic web clients with OTP as standard, and yubikey support would be great. Luke Dashjr joins in the conversation and suggests that every wallet could be a LN node, to which Denis Gorbachev asks if they are talking about wallet integration or LN node management. Luke doesn't see a distinction between the two. Denis provides an example of how reports on various transactions would be a useful feature in general, not necessarily tied to LN. The conversation ends with no further discussion.</summary>
