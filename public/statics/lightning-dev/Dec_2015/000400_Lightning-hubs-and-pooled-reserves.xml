    <summary>The email discusses the possibility of lowering the capital requirement in order to lower the barrier for people wishing to run a Lightning Network node. The writer proposes a trust-based system that resembles a fractional-reserve banking system. However, they suggest that such fractional-reserve hubs will provide lower transaction fees because of lower capital requirements and the idea is worth pursuing. Additionally, they believe it may be possible to design a proof-of-solvency which could replace the existing fractional-reserve system. The writer invites John to connect on Skype to discuss the matter further and acknowledges his accessible writing style.</summary>
