    <summary>In a discussion on December 13, 2015, Denis Gorbachev and Luke were discussing wallet integration and Lightning Network (LN) node management. They were debating whether every wallet should be a LN node or not. Denis brought up the example of running an intermediary LN node and wanting to compare fees for the current month versus the previous month. He mentioned that it could be done through command line or with a GUI. Luke suggested that reports on various transactions would be a useful feature in general, not necessarily tied to LN.</summary>
