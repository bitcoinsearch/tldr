    <summary>The discussion is about how to find routes between nodes and beacon nodes. The idea is for neighbors of beacon nodes to discover when one of their neighbors becomes a beacon and propagate that information to other neighbors. This method would not require too much traffic. The original poster is having difficulty visualizing how nodes would find routes to beacons without resorting to a floodfill search, which would not scale well. They are looking for information on the latest ideas for finding routes.</summary>
