    <summary>In an email conversation on December 8, 2015, Mats Jerratsch raised the question of whether onion-routing should be one-time and one-directional. The preferences regarding what data is to be sent through onion routing are unclear. Bryan had initially assumed that some out-of-band messaging would take place, where an interactive wallet-to-wallet protocol would occur while both parties communicated with the onion routing network for payment route negotiation. Once a path was found, the recipient would communicate over the wallet-to-wallet channel to pass fully-constructed onion routing information back. This would reduce message passing in onion land, making it easier to think about but increasing the complexity of the payment side.</summary>
