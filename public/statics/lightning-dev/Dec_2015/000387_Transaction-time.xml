    <summary>A Twitter user, @DenGorbachev, asked a question regarding the time it should take for a provider to receive payment in a simple case of "Consumer - Relay - Provider" (2 hops). It is unclear what specific payment system or platform is being referred to. The question assumes a scenario where there are two intermediaries between the consumer and the provider. However, no further details are provided about these intermediaries or their roles. Without additional information, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer to this question.</summary>
