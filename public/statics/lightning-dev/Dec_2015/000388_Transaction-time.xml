    <summary>The article discusses the time taken for a provider to receive payment in a simple case of "Consumer - Relay - Provider" (2 hops). The established channels are assumed to be instant, and the payment is only for network latency. The process involves the consumer offering a contract to the relay, who then offers it to the provider. The provider closes the contract with the relay, who then closes the contract with the client. It takes three round-trip times (RTTs) per hop, which means 30 RTTs in ten hops in a large lightning network. With bitcoin node latency averaging at 330ms in Australia, the entire process would take around 10 seconds.</summary>
