    <summary>The conversation revolves around the security and efficiency of using ChaCha20+poly1305 over AES-CTR+HMAC-SHA-256 in routing information for Sphinx mix-header. The debate also includes the safety of 128-bit and 192-bit node IDs, with the latter being suggested as a safer option based on certain musings. The current implementation of node IDs takes two forms: hash160 or raw serialized pub-key. Within the Sphinx mix-header, truncating the hash160 to 16 bytes is suggested, while ditching ChaCha20+poly3015 for AES-CTR+SHA-256-HMAC may be necessary if serialized pub-keys are used for node IDs in the routing info. It is also proposed to upgrade the crypto later by appending a key for a different system. The conversation ends on a positive note with everyone having fun.</summary>
