    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of a GUI for Lightning Network (LN) node management. One user suggests that it would be useful to compare fees for current and previous months, but implementing this through command line would be tedious. Instead, he suggests using a web application that connects to the LN node backend. Another user suggests integrating the LN node management into the Bitcoin Core GUI using an external library. AdminLTE, an open-source web admin template that supports multiple charting libraries is mentioned as a potential tool for implementation. The user also provides a nodejs RPC wrapper for Ethereum as an example.</summary>
