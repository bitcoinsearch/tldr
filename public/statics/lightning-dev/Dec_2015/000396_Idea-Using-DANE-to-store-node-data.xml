    <summary>In a signed message, Douglas Roark has put forward an idea of attaching payment data to DNSSEC via DANE. The idea was to use the DNSSEC system as a database that could get trusted payment info out to users. The setup was designed to allow for all manner of payment methods, with ACH and Bitcoin being the first two to be supported. However, the effort eventually fell by the wayside before a much-improved second RFC draft could get out the door; the first draft barely touches Bitcoin at all. Roark wonders what others think of this idea, and how it could apply to Lightning. The main hangup out the gate would be that the payment info has to be attached to a domain (e.g., topqualitywidgets.com) that supports the scheme. This would mean custom domains would be needed where support for the scheme was explicitly included.Roark thinks that the idea of attaching payment data to DNSSEC via DANE is interesting and may be worth exploring, perhaps in a modified form. He had set up the scheme where, on the Bitcoin side, the keys were really flexible and could support things like per-user payment addresses (i.e., static addresses weren't mandatory). He suggests that if there is any sort of ID at host scheme deployed in Lightning, it should support internationalization. Roark also likes the idea of having some sort of quasi-permanent method for storing data without having to rely on a complicated scheme to find other nodes in the network.The links provided are:1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities2. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wiley-paymentassoc-003. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-smime-09</summary>
