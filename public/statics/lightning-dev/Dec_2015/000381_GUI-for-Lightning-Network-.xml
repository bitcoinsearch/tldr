    <summary>In an email exchange between Luke Dashjr and Denis Gorbachev, they discussed the idea of every wallet being a Lightning Network (LN) node. Dashjr argued that there shouldn't be a distinction between the two, to which Gorbachev pointed out the risk of being hacked when running a node. Dashjr then went on to say that running a node is like running a business, as it requires running a server 24/7 and dealing with security and updates. They also briefly touched upon the idea of comparing fees for current versus previous months using command line or GUI, and agreed that reports on various transactions would be a useful feature in general, not just tied to LN.</summary>
