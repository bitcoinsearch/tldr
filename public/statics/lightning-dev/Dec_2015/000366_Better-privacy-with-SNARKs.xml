    <summary>Andrew Miller, a member of the Lightning development community, posted a message in 2015 on the Linux Foundation's mailing list, stating that a SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) is unnecessary for the application being discussed. It is unclear from the message why Miller believed this to be the case, but he asked if the required messages were too large or if verification took too long. He also suggested that an interactive Zero-Knowledge proof using Yao garbled circuits might be sufficient for their needs. The context of the discussion is not provided.</summary>
