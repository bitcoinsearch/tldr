    <summary>In this discussion, Denis Gorbachev asks how long it would take for a provider to receive payment in a simple "Consumer - Relay - Provider" setup. Rusty Russell responds by breaking down the steps involved and calculates that it would take 3 round-trip times per hop, resulting in a total of 30 round-trip times for 10 hops. Considering his node latency in Australia, he estimates a worst-case transaction time of 10 seconds. However, Mark Friedenbach notes that the estimation is biased towards worst-case latency/best-case decentralization and expects an average user's experience of a 10-hop payment to be on the order of 1-2 seconds, with inner hops between Tier-1 datacenter nodes primarily based on network proximity. He also mentions that a completely geographically distributed network of last-mile endpoints would have a worst-case transaction time of only about 10 seconds, which is doable for PoS.</summary>
