    <summary>There was a recent inquiry from a new member on the Lightning-dev mailing list who had not received any emails and was wondering if there was something wrong. Ricardo Filipe, another member of the list, responded by letting them know that there had been no discussion on the list since September 19th and directed them to the mailing list archive where they could check for existing discussions. The Lightning-dev mailing list is managed by the Linux Foundation and is used for discussions related to the Lightning Network.</summary>
