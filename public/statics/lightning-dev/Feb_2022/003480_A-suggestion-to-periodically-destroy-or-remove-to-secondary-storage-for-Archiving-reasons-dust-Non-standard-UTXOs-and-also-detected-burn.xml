    <summary>The post discusses alarming information about the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in Bitcoin. At least 5.7 million UTXOs are equal to or less than 1000 satoshis (~7%), 8.04 million UTXOs are equal to or less than $1 (10%), and 13.5 million UTXOs are equal to or less than 0.0001 BTC (17%). BitInfoCharts has added a main link for dust analysis, where the top 100 dustiest Bitcoin addresses can be viewed. The first address on the list contains more than 1.7 million dust UTXOs. The author suggests that blockchain tracking analysts might "dust" addresses by giving them 546 sats, hoping that lousy wallets will use the new UTXO from the same address but spending to a different address and combining with other inputs with new addresses, allowing them to grow their datasets about fund ownership. The author believes this practice is common, and JoinMarket has a policy to ignore-by-default UTXOs that pay to an address it already spent from due to this. It is suggested that this effect can be eliminated by removing outputs of exactly 546 sats to reused addresses.</summary>
