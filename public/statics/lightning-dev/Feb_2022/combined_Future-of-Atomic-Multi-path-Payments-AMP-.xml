    <summary>Jozef Hutko, a developer working on a project using LND with Atomic Multi-path Payments (AMP) invoices, has found that no mobile lightning wallet is currently able to send sats to these invoices. He reached out to the Lightning Network Development mailing list to inquire about the future of AMP and whether it could become a standard, as well as if there were any other lightning implementations that support it.Laolu Osuntokun, in response, provided important information about how wallets built on lnd v0.14 should be able to send to reusable AMP invoices, while wallets built on lnd v0.13 could only send to them once unless they manually specified the `set_id` flag to a random value for any subsequent sends. He also viewed AMP as the successor to keysend and explained that the next step was to finalize the current spec draft and propose it as either a BOLT or a bLIP.Osuntokun acknowledged that this had been on his TODO list for some time but hoped to get to it over the next few weeks. Additionally, he mentioned that when PTLCs are eventually rolled out across the network, AMP could be updated to use discrete-logs instead of payment hashes, known as Discrete Log Atomic Multi-Path (DAMP). In addition, AMP could support receiver secret-reveal by combining each share with a receiver-specified public key.Overall, Osuntokun provided helpful insights into AMP and its potential future as a standard.</summary>
