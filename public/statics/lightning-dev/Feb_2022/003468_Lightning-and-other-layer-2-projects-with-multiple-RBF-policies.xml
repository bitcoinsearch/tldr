    <summary>In a recent email conversation, Prayank raised concerns about the security of Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects with regard to different RBF policies used by nodes. Michael Folkson replied that while it may take time for a majority of the network to adopt new policy rules in Bitcoin Core, it can still benefit the security of these projects in the long run. However, not all full nodes will be running the same policy rules at any given time. Furthermore, experiments on signet networks can help identify issues associated with multiple RBF policies.Michael also mentioned that most full nodes on the network currently run Bitcoin Core, but not all of them are running the same version or policy rules. He stated that setting defaults that are widely used is available and should be discussed if certain defaults can bolster the security of Lightning (and possibly other Layer 2 projects) at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols.Prayank asked whether Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects are vulnerable to multiple RBF policies being used and whether recent improvements suggested for RBF policy are only focused on Lightning Network. Michael replied that most of the focus has been on Lightning Network due to its widespread adoption, but contributors to other Layer 2 projects are free to discuss security considerations.Finally, Michael mentioned that Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, allowing contributors to determine what default policy rules they want to implement. The discussion ends with Prayank including his public key for contact purposes.</summary>
