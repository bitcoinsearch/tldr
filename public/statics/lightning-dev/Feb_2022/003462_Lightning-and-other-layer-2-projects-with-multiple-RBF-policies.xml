    <summary>In a discussion about improving fee estimation in Bitcoin Core, it was noted that mempool cannot be considered an orderbook due to nodes using different relay policies. The use of different RBF policies by nodes could potentially affect the security of Lightning Network implementations and other layer 2 projects, as pointed out by 'aj' in a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. An attacker with 10% hash power and using a different RBF policy could exploit vulnerabilities in projects relying on the default RBF policy in the latest Bitcoin Core. A previous CVE highlighted how undocumented RBF policy implementation could impact LN security.The recent discussion to change the default RBF policy used by Core raises questions about multiple versions using different policies and whether users, especially miners, will be incentivized to use different versions and policies. It is also unclear whether the recent improvements suggested for RBF policy are only focused on LN security, which may not be affected by multiple RBF policies. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, allowing users to choose their desired policy.</summary>
