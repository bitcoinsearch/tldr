    <summary>Developer Paul Sztorc responded to claims that recursive covenants are a bad thing in a recent post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He pointed out that although a 51% miner can double-spend in the Lightning Network (LN) by censoring "justice transactions", they can only attack LN channels they participate in, whereas they can simultaneously attack all Drivechain-based sidechains and steal all of their funds. Users of the LN have some protection against 51% miners as they may make a channel with a non-51% miner. Additionally, with Taproot, not all LN-related transactions can be censored by the 51% miner. ZmnSCPxj, a Drivechain developer, presented a quiz to identify those who understand Drivechain technology, which covers topics such as security measures and withdrawal limits. One question asked about the parameters 'b' and 'm' in the Drivechain security model, with 'm' representing how much people want to kill a sidechain, and 'b' representing how much profit a mainchain miner expects from supporting a sidechain. If DC were successful, it could harm altcoin investors and two maximalist groups.Both LN and Drivechain are vulnerable to miner-theft, but they use their design to deter theft. To help people understand Drivechain better, the author presented a quiz with ten questions. They state that changing DC to make miner-theft impossible by making it a layer1 consensus rule that miners never steal would be worse than the disease. The end user should be free to decide what risks they take with their money, and neither LN nor DC is intended for everyone in every circumstance. In a conversation between Paul and ZmnSCPxj, a quiz was presented to test one's understanding of Drivechain. Correct answers include the fact that DC can not make miner-theft impossible by changing it to a layer1 consensus rule, the number of blocks required for 100% hashrate to steal coins from a DC sidechain (13,150), and the two types of people who should use the DC withdrawal system - miners destroying the sidechain and aggregators of sidechain-to-minechain transfers and large whales. Scaling technology for BTC network may become uncompetitive if it does not enable hyperbitcoinization fast enough, which is different from caring about a sidechain's m and b. Finally, if DC were successful, Altcoin-investors would be harmed, and two maximalist-groups would also be slightly harmed, but the groups were not identified.</summary>
