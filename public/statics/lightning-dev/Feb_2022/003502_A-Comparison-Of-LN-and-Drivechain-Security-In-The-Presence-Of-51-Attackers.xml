    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj presented a quiz to test understanding of Drivechain. The questions covered topics such as miner-theft, withdrawal limits and security measures. One question asked about the parameters 'b' and 'm' in the Drivechain security model, with 'm' representing how much people want to kill a sidechain, and 'b' representing how much profit a mainchain miner expects from supporting a sidechain. In terms of deterring sidechain theft, Drivechain is designed for a specific range of 'm'. If DC were successful, it could harm altcoin investors and two maximalist groups.</summary>
