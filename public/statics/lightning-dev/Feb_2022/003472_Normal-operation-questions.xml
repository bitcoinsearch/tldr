    <summary>In this post, Ben Weintraub asks two questions related to the Normal Operation protocol. The first question is about the order of sending `update_add_htlc` and `commitment_signed`. While multiple sources suggest that Alice should send `commitment_signed` after `update_add_htlc`, Ben wonders if it really matters which one comes first. He thinks that as long as Alice doesn't revoke the old state before Bob commits to the new state, the order shouldn't matter, and they could even send their commitments concurrently. The second question is about why both Alice and Bob need to exchange `commitment_signed` and `revoke_and_ack` messages again after Bob sends the `update_fulfill_htlc`. Ben wonders if Alice has enough information to claim her funds with the new state after receiving the preimage.</summary>
