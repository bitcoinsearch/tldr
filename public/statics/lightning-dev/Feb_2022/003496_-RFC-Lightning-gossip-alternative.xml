    <summary>A user named ZmnSCPxj asked Rusty a question regarding the preparation for published channels that are backed by channel factories, if they switch to a new gossip version. Rusty responded by saying that it is already possible with the new proposal and channels do not necessarily have to be real. The required ratio can be raised later, which would require less UTXO proof since older nodes can choose which channels to see based on their ID.</summary>
