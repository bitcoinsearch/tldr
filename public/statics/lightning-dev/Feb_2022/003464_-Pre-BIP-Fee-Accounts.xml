    <summary>In an email thread on the Bitcoin developer mailing list, a member shared their thoughts on "cleaning up" the fee paying semantics in Bitcoin. They highlighted that fees being paid in band makes it difficult to write long-lived smart contracts and other types of transactions that require support for fee bumping and other features. As an alternative, the member proposed establishing an account system as an extension block. However, Peter Todd responded by pointing out that this could introduce its own form of transaction pinning attacks, where third parties could attach arbitrary fees to any transaction without permission. Todd suggested that allowing transactions to designate a pubkey allowed to add further transaction fees if required would be a better solution, which Bitcoin already has in two forms: Replace-by-Fee and Child Pays for Parent. The original email was sent by someone signing off as Lord His Excellency James HRMH, with links to various projects and websites including duigco.org, Willtech.com.au, and Go-overt.com.</summary>
