    <summary>In an email thread, darosior suggested the name "Necromancing" for attacks that work by getting an out-of-date version of a transaction mined. However, this statement was disputed, with ZmnSCPxj arguing that transactions do become out of date in some situations, and Bitcoin standards should avoid making unwanted necromancy a cheap and easy attack. This could limit multiparty feebumping methods to per-participant anchor outputs akin to Lightning anchor commitments, as multiparty RBF is unreliable. While initial multiparty signing may succeed, participants may later regret cooperating or accidentally go offline. Anchor outputs can enable authorized feebumping, but fee accounts could be improved with proof of authorization.</summary>
