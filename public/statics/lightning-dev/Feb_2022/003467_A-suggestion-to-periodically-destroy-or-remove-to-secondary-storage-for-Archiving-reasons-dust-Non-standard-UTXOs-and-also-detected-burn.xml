    <summary>The email discusses the issue of data deletion in computer systems and proposes a solution based on the principles of blockchain technology, particularly Bitcoin. The author argues that nothing should be deleted from the blockchain forever, as it is necessary for clients to validate the blockchain in its entirety. While acknowledging the usefulness of pruned nodes, the author suggests instead setting nodes with the parameter `prune=1` if manual pruning is desired or `prune={&gt;550}` if automated pruning is preferred. The author's chain state database is only 4.9GB and easily manageable by the standard Bitcoin Core client. The email includes contact information for Willtech, go-overt.com, and DUIGCO API, along with a disclaimer that the email does not constitute general advice.</summary>
