    <summary>In this communication, ZmnSCPxj proposes the idea of preparing for published channels that are backed by channel factories in case the system switches to a new gossip version. The proposal involves allowing UTXOs to advertise multiple channels instead of just a single one, which would maximize the expected fee return of all published nodes. However, without the ability to gossip channel factories, they can only be used for unpublished channels. This means that for N clients, there would only be N channels backed by the channel factory and the UTXO. Despite this limitation, it would still be a good idea to have as much of the public network backed by fewer UTXOs, as the published network has far more channels for every N participants. However, this could also make stuffing the public graph cheaper, making it easier to increase the complexity of the public graph and thus increase the cost of pathfinding. Overall, ZmnSCPxj seeks input on this proposal.</summary>
