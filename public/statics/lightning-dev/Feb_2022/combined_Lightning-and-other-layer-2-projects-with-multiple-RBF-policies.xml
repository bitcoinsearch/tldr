    <summary>The security of Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects can be impacted by policy rules unlike the base blockchain/network. However, it is not advisable to abandon these designs without a superior security model. A new RBF policy in Core may not immediately improve the security of projects that rely on multiple RBF policies but can build a strong foundation in the long term. The option to set defaults that are widely used exists due to the dominance of Bitcoin Core. Users, including miners, can run different policy rules without making them effective consensus rules.The recent improvements suggested for RBF policy are focused on Lightning Network security. Still, contributors to other Layer 2 projects can also flag and discuss security considerations that are not specific to Lightning. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI, and its maintainers and contributors can determine what default policy rules they want to implement.Discussions on the Bitcoin Core Dev IRC channel highlighted concerns about the mempool as an order book for bidding on block space due to potential differences in relay policies used by nodes. Using different RBF policies can also impact the security of Lightning Network and other layer 2 projects that rely on the default RBF policy in Bitcoin Core. An attacker with 10% hash power could use a different RBF policy with some nodes and affect the security of different projects. CVEs have been reported wherein undocumented implementation of RBF policy could affect the security of Lightning Network.This raises questions regarding the vulnerability of Lightning Network and other layer 2 projects to the use of multiple RBF policies, changes in default RBF policy used by Core resulting in multiple versions using different policies, and whether recent improvements suggested for RBF policy only focus on Lightning Network and its security. Research into Lightning security is still nascent, and experiments on signet networks with auto-generated transactions and/or reduced block sizes can help identify more issues associated with multiple RBF policies. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, allowing users to choose whatever policy they want.The discussion revolves around the potential impact of multiple RBF policies being used by nodes on the security of Lightning Network and other layer 2 projects. While it is agreed that most users will run default policies, certain defaults can bolster the security of protocols at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols. The security of the Lightning Network and some other Layer 2 projects are partly dependent on policy rules. Users including miners are free to run different policy rules without making them effective consensus rules. In a discussion about improving fee estimation in Bitcoin Core, it was noted that mempool cannot be considered an orderbook due to nodes using different relay policies. The use of different RBF policies by nodes could potentially affect the security of Lightning Network implementations and other layer 2 projects. The recent discussion to change the default RBF policy used by Core raises questions about multiple versions using different policies and whether users, especially miners, will be incentivized to use different versions and policies. It is also unclear whether the recent improvements suggested for RBF policy are only focused on LN security, which may not be affected by multiple RBF policies. Research into Lightning security is still nascent, and we have no idea whether alternative Layer 2 projects will thrive or have conflicting security considerations to Lightning. With such strong dominance of Bitcoin Core, there is the option to set defaults that are widely used. If certain defaults can bolster the security of Lightning and possibly other Layer 2 projects at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols, we should discuss what those defaults should be. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI, and users can readily choose whatever policy they want.</summary>
