    <summary>In a message to bitcoin-dev, ZmnSCPxj stated that it is easy for 51% hashrate to double-spend in the Lightning Network (LN). This statement was deemed true. LN and Drivechain are both vulnerable to miner-theft, but they use their design to deter theft. A 51% miner can only attack LN channels in which they participate; however, they can simultaneously attack all Drivechain-based sidechains and steal all of their funds. In LN, the main obstacle for miners is to join the channel, while in DC, they must construct a transaction obeying Bip300 rules. The Bip300 rules aim to thwart miner-theft because SPV proofs allow it. To help people understand Drivechain better, the author presented a quiz with ten questions. They state that changing DC to make miner-theft impossible by making it a layer1 consensus rule that miners never steal would be worse than the disease. The end user should be free to decide what risks they take with their money, and neither LN nor DC is intended for everyone in every circumstance. DC can simulate a Zcash sidechain, but it cannot allow for instant off-chain payments. Thus, comparing DC vs. LN on any criterion would never be an apples-to-apples comparison. Today's users can sell their BTC for Solana or BSV, so they should be allowed to spend their BTC to a Bip300 script, just as they are allowed to open an LN channel.</summary>
