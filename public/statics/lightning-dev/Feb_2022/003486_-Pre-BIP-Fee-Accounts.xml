    <summary>In an email thread on February 19, 2022, a discussion arose regarding the term "Necromancing" and whether it could be considered an attack in the context of Bitcoin transactions. The term refers to the practice of getting an outdated version of a transaction mined. However, some argue that this cannot be considered an attack since any transaction that has been signed and broadcasted should not be invalidated by a replacement transaction.The conversation then turns to the importance of avoiding unwanted necromancy as a cheap and easy attack. While any signed transaction may still be mined, there are situations where a different transaction would be preferred, making the outdated tx being mined both expensive and annoying. In order to maintain the integrity of the Bitcoin system, standards should be put in place that discourage such attacks while also avoiding making them cheaper than they currently are.The email was sent by darosior and responded to by Peter Todd, who maintains the website https://petertodd.org/. The email contains a signature attachment with a size of 833 bytes, but no further information is given about its contents.</summary>
