    <summary>The discussion revolves around the potential impact of multiple RBF policies being used by nodes on the security of Lightning Network and other layer 2 projects. While it is agreed that most users will run default policies, certain defaults can bolster the security of protocols at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols. The security of the Lightning Network and some other Layer 2 projects are partly dependent on policy rules. Users including miners are free to run different policy rules without making them effective consensus rules. The vast majority of the full nodes on the network currently run Bitcoin Core, but whether this will change in future and whether it is a good thing or not is a whole other discussion. Research into Lightning security is still nascent, so it is too early to predict the final incentives to run the same or differing policies. Contributors to other Layer 2 projects are free to flag and discuss security considerations that aren't Lightning-specific. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI, and users can readily choose whatever policy they want.</summary>
