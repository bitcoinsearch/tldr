    <summary>In a discussion between DA, Peter, and ZmnSCPxj, it was stated that replacement transactions cannot be relied upon to invalidate previous versions of the transaction. It was noted that even if a replacement transaction exists in mempools, there is no guarantee that anyone has heard of it until it is mined and accepted by the block. The point of the discussion was not that this situation never occurs, but rather that it should not happen more frequently.</summary>
