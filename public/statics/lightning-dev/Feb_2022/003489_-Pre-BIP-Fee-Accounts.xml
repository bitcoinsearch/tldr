    <summary>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the topic of a replacement transaction invalidating a previous version of it. However, it is not possible to rely on such an assumption as the previous version still exists in mempools and may be accepted if it is mined before the replacement. There is no consensus about either the previous version or its replacement until one of them is mined and the block accepted. A member suggests naming attacks that work through getting an out-of-date version of a transaction mined as Necromancing, but another member argues that there is no such thing as an out-of-date transaction if it has been signed and broadcasted previously.</summary>
