    <summary>In a conversation, Jeremy discusses the use of CPFP in complicated offchain transactions. He recommends a "usual" design for Vaults that allows an output to hit maturity before it is hot spendable but can be kicked to recovery anytime before using CTV to transition on-chain and remove the hot wallet. However, this means that if one is waiting for one of these outputs to be created on-chain, they cannot spend from the hot key until it confirms on-chain first. In order to CPFP, there must be a separate output just for CPFPing that is not subject to these restrictions or some sort of RBF-able addable input/output. Sponsors may also be a solution.</summary>
