    <summary>The email exchange between Jeremy Rubin and Peter Todd discusses the concept of pinning attack in blockchain protocols. Rubin argues that pinning attack usually refers to pinning something to the bottom of the mempool, but this new type of pinning attack is distinct from others and makes it easier to confirm transactions of interest. Todd points out that sometimes a direct party to the protocol can add fees to transactions, which is harmful to certain use-cases. He suggests having sponsors or fee accounts to ensure progress in the protocol. Todd also mentions that protocols that depend on in-mempool replacements before confirmation must deal with exceptional cases happening occasionally, but an attacker harassing users by making those cases happen frequently is harmful.</summary>
