    <summary>In an email conversation, Ron OHara claimed that with Bitcoin, it is not "Alice transacting with Bob", but rather Address(1) transacting with Address(2), and if both parties do not reuse addresses, then the next interaction will be Address(3) transacting with Address(4). However, this claim is false, as addresses only receive and never send. At a high level, two wallets are transacting in each interaction, regardless of address reuse. The blockchain has no knowledge of these wallets. Luke added that at a low level, the interaction could involve Key(2) with Key(3) if it spends the output created by the initial interaction.</summary>
