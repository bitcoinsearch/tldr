    <summary>The discussion in the LN whitepaper and others focuses on optimizing multiple interactions between Alice and Bob to a single settlement on the blockchain. However, it may not always be possible to optimize transactions for cases like Point of Sale where there are many different entities involved. Additionally, Bitcoin transactions involve addresses rather than individuals, so if both parties follow recommended practices of not reusing addresses, optimization may not be possible. Long-running channels are also vulnerable to traffic analysis, making them less secure than native Bitcoin transactions. The author also raises concerns about merchants being unhappy with pending funds inside LN that may take up to a month to settle.</summary>
