    <summary>The Lightning Network (LN) whitepaper discusses the interaction between Alice and Bob, focusing on optimizing multiple interactions into a single settlement on the blockchain. However, this is unlikely for normal P2P consumer use cases, while B2B cases may have repeated interactions that can be optimized. The LN allows trustless channel chaining, but merchants may not opt for it due to pending revenue inside the LN.Channels in the LN are bitcoins held by a 2 of 2 signature, with recipients mainly receiving payments. Pending settlement means inward cash flow is unavailable for a period of time. Optimization is possible if LN encompasses lots of transactions per client and receiver. Long-running channels are vulnerable to traffic analysis and have lower security than native Bitcoin transactions.The question remains as to which end user use cases will generate enough transaction volume to justify reserving funds for channels in the LN. Long-running channels are essentially identical to address reuse during the period in which they are open, making them less secure than native Bitcoin transactions. However, having three channels instead of one can make the system more robust and prevent routing payment for someone else.While LN with hubs gains major traffic optimization wins when there are many channels and participants, it is unclear how to get there without facing a chicken and egg business problem. Nevertheless, instant payments have great value if there is someone to receive the payments.</summary>
