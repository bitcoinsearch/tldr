    <summary>The discussion is about the use of minisketch for ratelimiting updates in Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Matt Corallo points out that inconsistent ratelimiting policies among nodes can lead to problems when syncing with other peers. Rusty Russell notes that using minisketch in this way requires keeping track of all the differences being ignored per peer, which becomes impractical with a large number of peers. He suggests a preferred ratelimit to prevent spamming beyond a certain point and argues that having some rough consensus is important. Corallo agrees but adds that rate-limits are locally enforced and that there will always be races and updates rejected by some peers but not others. They discuss the idea of an "update-based-sketch" gossip sync and its benefits over other forms of sketch. Ultimately, they agree to schedule a call to further discuss these issues.</summary>
