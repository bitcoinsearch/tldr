    <summary>The context is a conversation about source routing and Boltz Exchange's ability to report onchain addresses. The speaker suggests that even if Boltz keeps records of onchain addresses, it cannot correlate them with the user's published node or IP address. Using an onion link helps to maintain anonymity between onchain addresses and IP addresses. Additionally, multiple swaps through Boltz cannot be correlated with each other, which further improves anonymity. The speaker recommends imitating how `clboss` formats JSON requests to improve anonymity set.</summary>
