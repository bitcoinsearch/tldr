    <summary>Bitcoin Developers can now download an EML file from moderated archives and use a python script to read it. As some emails are moderated, one Python script that is useful is the fast_mail_parser. The body in base64 format and different parts are printed when fast_mail_parser is installed. The email can be read in plain text by decoding the relevant line and pasting the highlighted content in https://www.base64decode.org/. Additionally, b64decode() in python can also be used for decoding. The email was sent with ProtonMail secure email.</summary>
