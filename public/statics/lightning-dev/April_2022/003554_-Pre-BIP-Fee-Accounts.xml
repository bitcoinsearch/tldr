    <summary>In an email thread, Jeremy Rubin responds to a comment about "nonsense marketing" and the confusion surrounding blockchain schemes as "world computers." The commenter suggests that even uninformed people may read technical materials, and those materials can be quoted by journalists or scammers. Rubin also defends the usefulness of progress, even if it is not maximally useful, and argues that progress is progress. The discussion then turns to Open Time Stamps (OTS), with the commenter pointing out that OTS simply proves data in the past without a chain of transactions, which would linearize history. Rubin responds that the normative validation source code is the technical spec of OTS, and that the proof format proves that data existed prior to a merkle root of a particular Bitcoin block, not a Bitcoin transaction. Finally, the discussion turns to fee accounts, with the commenter suggesting that fee accounts should be opt-in if ever implemented.</summary>
