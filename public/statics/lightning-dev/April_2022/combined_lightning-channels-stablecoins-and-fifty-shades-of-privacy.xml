    <summary>The lack of privacy in Bitcoin transactions, especially when it comes to large sums of money, is discussed in this email thread. The absence of confidential transactions in Bitcoin makes it challenging for users to move significant amounts without being observed, and Coinjoin implementations have their own issues. The author suggests using a stablecoin in a lightning channel through Omni BOLT, but this solution reduces liquidity and increases the likelihood of Alice tracking where funds are moved. Instead, the author recommends creating channels to randomly-selected LN nodes from a throwaway LN node using dirty BTC, then sending amounts to a published LN node with already-clean funds. This setup provides privacy by disrupting timing correlation and providing deniability to the published node while protecting the user's on-chain address.The conversation also touches on Boltz Exchange's ability to report onchain addresses and how it cannot correlate them with the user's published node or IP address. Using an onion link helps maintain anonymity between onchain addresses and IP addresses, and multiple swaps through Boltz cannot be correlated with each other, improving anonymity. The speaker recommends imitating how `clboss` formats JSON requests to improve the anonymity set.Lastly, the context discusses the factors that affect privacy in Bitcoin transactions, such as liquidity, anonymity set, amounts, type of addresses/scripts, block, locktime, and version. While Synonym's stablecoin transaction using Omni BOLT in a lightning channel could be a helpful solution for some situations, further exploration is needed regarding its lightning channel capacity and other improvements in this setup.</summary>
