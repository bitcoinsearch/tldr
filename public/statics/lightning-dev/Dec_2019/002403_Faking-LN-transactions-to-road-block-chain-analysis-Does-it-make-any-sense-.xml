    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj raised the issue of the current mutual closes on the Lightning Network being spends of 2-of-2 outputs. As most people use either 1-of-1 or 2-of-3, these 2-of-2 outputs stand out and can be assumed to be related to Lightning. One alternative that was suggested is modifying the current 2-of-2 closing outputs to make them undistinguishable from 2-of-3 outputs by negotiating a random third public key with a nonexistent private key. This could be achieved by XORing random values provided by each channel participant.</summary>
