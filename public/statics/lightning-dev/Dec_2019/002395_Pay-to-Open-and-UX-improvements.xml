    <summary>A proposed modification to Tapscript's `OP_CHECKSIG` is being suggested to read the signature as two 32-byte stack arguments instead of a single 64-byte argument. It is believed that the change would be simple and harmless since Taproot already makes changes to this opcode. However, one individual disagrees with this change, stating that modifying the behavior of OP_CHECKSIG could result in bugs in systems that create and sign transactions. They suggest creating a new OP code called OP_CHECKSPLITSIG or getting OP_CAT approved instead.</summary>
