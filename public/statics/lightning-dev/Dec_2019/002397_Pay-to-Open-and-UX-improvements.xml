    <summary>Good morning ZmnSCPxj,You are suggesting to spend a script-path with `OP_SWAP OP_CHECKSPLITSIG`, instead of the current script. You questioned why `R` is repeated twice in the current script and witness stack, when it is already fixed. Additionally, you inquired about supporting non-`SIGHASH_ALL` sighashes.It seems like swapping `OP_CHECKSIG` for `OP_CHECKSPLITSIG` would be more efficient since only one input is being spent. The current script has unnecessary repetition of `R`. However, it may be worth considering if there are any future use-cases where `R` could change. In terms of supporting non-`SIGHASH_ALL` sighashes, it would depend on the specific use-case and whether it makes sense to support them.Thank you for bringing up these points.Best regards,t-bast</summary>
