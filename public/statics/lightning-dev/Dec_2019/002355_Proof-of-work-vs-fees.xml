    <summary>The conversation between Orfeas and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the effectiveness of Proof-of-Work (PoW) as an anti-spam measure for the Lightning Network (LN). ZmnSCPxj suggests that locking up-front fees and reverting them to the original sender can limit spam, but this can be bypassed if PoW is not fresh. He argues that if PoW is included with (nonce || recent block hash || recipient public key), it would prevent burst-spamming. The fee paid to intermediate nodes by the payer is already a sunk cost, and thus, the payer does not care if the intermediate nodes fail to claim the fee. ZmnSCPxj also notes that PoW is valued by intermediate nodes as a spam-limiting factor, but resellability elsewhere is limited due to being tied to a particular payment attempt.</summary>
