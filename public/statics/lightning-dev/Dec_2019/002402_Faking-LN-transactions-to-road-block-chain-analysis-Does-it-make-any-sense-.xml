    <summary>The Lightning Network's mutual closes are spends of 2-of-2 outputs, which can be a "blockage" for some. However, the upcoming BIP-Schnorr will allow the use of MuSig, which lets all n-of-n (including Lightning 2-of-2) to hide in the same anonymity set as 1-of-1. Work is also being done on verifiable secret splitting, which would allow k-of-n to hide in the same anonymity set as n-of-n, thus bringing the 2-of-3 users into this as well. This uncertainty will force chain analysis and offchain analysis to start considering fuzzy logic. Additionally, CoinSwapper can mix coins by passing them through the Lightning Network.</summary>
