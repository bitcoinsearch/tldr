    <summary>In a recent email conversation, ZmnSCPxj discussed the possibility of implementing single-show signatures in Bitcoin. However, ZmnSCPxj noted that there is currently no way to force single-show signatures and that this approach could add fragility to the system and limit useful features such as RBF fee bumping. Despite these drawbacks, ZmnSCPxj proposed using `OP_CAT` to enforce a particular `R` value for signatures, which would feed only the `s` value onto the witness stack.</summary>
