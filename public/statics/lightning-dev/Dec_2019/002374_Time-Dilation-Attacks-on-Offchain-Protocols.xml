    <summary>In a discussion thread regarding Time-Dilation Attacks on Offchain Protocols, David A. Harding questions the advantage of sophisticated attacks over eclipse attacks. The original poster Antoine Riard had mentioned the possibility of time-dilation attacks, where attackers try to trick victims into believing that no attack is underway. Orfeas, another participant in the discussion, adds his opinion on the matter but admits that he may be wrong. The context provides a glimpse into a technical conversation about potential vulnerabilities in off-chain protocols and the strategies used by attackers to exploit them.</summary>
