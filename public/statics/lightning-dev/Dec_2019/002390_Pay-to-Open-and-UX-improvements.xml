    <summary>In an email conversation between David and t-bast, David suggested a solution stating that he is not aware of any way to currently force single-show signatures in Bitcoin. ZmnSCPxj provided a solution for this issue by enforcing a particular R using `OP_CAT` and allowing the implementation of single-show signatures. However, this construction requires `OP_CAT` which is a dangerous opcode. Further, ZmnSCPxj suggests enforcing RBF for every spend of the output by adding `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP  OP_SWAP OP_CAT  OP_CHECKSIG`. This would provide more assurance and allow double-spent outputs to be revocable in favor of miners. The winning transaction should have an `OP_RETURN` output that pays the entire value as fees and nobody can RBF it further. In conclusion, this is a minor increase in the assurability of the construction but requires caution while using the powerful constructions that come with this solution.</summary>
