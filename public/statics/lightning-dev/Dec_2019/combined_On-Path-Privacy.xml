    <summary>Decentralization is crucial in the blockchain and Lightning layers to prevent illegal transactions, preserve monetary policy, and promote privacy. The Peter Todd hub-and-spoke model erodes privacy, but allowing multiple hubs and encouraging people to increase their number of channels can help mitigate this. Standardized multipart splitting amounts and self-payment are solutions to amount-based correlation, while path length increasing algorithms and JIT routing provide better privacy than multipath. Path decorrelation and extended shadow routing also help with artificially-lengthened paths. However, there are practical limits to how many nodes can be on a path, and increasing the path length does not necessarily improve privacy. The article explores privacy loss models in the context of the Lightning Network, discussing strategies used by surveillors and suggesting techniques to avoid the shortest path heuristic. Nodes keeping forwarding logs can be risky, so spreading out privacy-leaking information among nodes is important. Improvements to the base layer can elide enough information to prevent a log of forwards from being derived. The email discusses the addition of random tweaks to channel traversal costs, which has been implemented in the C-Lightning route randomization feature.</summary>
