    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj suggested modifying the current 2-of-2 closing outputs in Lightning Network to make them indistinguishable from 2-of-3 outputs. This would increase privacy by making it more difficult to identify Lightning transactions. However, Esteban proposed an alternative solution where a random third public key is negotiated with a non-existent private key during channel opening, which would result in a revealed script with only two public keys. While both approaches have drawbacks, negotiating a third key would add an additional cost to the closing transaction but could be phased out when viable. The conversation also touched on potential security risks, including the possibility of an entropy exhaustion attack on negotiation, which could potentially be prevented.</summary>
