    <summary>The discussion between Orfeas and ZmnSCPxj centers around the use of PoW as an anti-spam measure for Lightning Network (LN). The effectiveness of PoW as an anti-spam measure is debated, with one side suggesting that a high PoW target is necessary to prevent burst-spamming. However, including the recipient public key in PoW can prevent burst-spamming and ensure the payer cannot outsource PoW calculation without risking fees. There is disagreement regarding whether PoW has market value, with one side arguing it does, while the other suggests it is not interchangeable with fees. Both sides agree that there is insufficient information to determine if every PoW-based scheme can be transformed into an equivalent fee-based scheme. ZmnSCPxj suggests locking upfront fees and reverting them to the original sender to limit spam. However, this method can be bypassed if PoW is not fresh. ZmnSCPxj notes that intermediate nodes value PoW as a spam-limiting factor, but resellability elsewhere is limited due to being tied to a particular payment attempt. Finally, the discussion concludes by reminding readers that the University of Edinburgh is a registered Scottish charitable body. In summary, the discussion highlights the complexities of using PoW as an anti-spam measure for LN.</summary>
