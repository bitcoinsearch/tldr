    <summary>In an email conversation, Joseph Poon and Bryan Bishop discussed SIGHASH flag types. Poon plans to consider other proposals for the BIP while drafting it for Lightning Network (LN), but he is somewhat averse to proposing too much flexibility before there are clear use-cases. Poon believes that SegWit resolves malleability without worrying about replay attacks in the event of key reuse and that it is only safe to use this new sighash type inside segwit itself. The new sighash flag should be used only if its features are needed.</summary>
