    <summary>The email thread linked in the context discusses a problem that keeps resurfacing in Lightning Network development. The issue appears to be the intertwinement of channel balance and collateral. The email suggests documenting the problem to address its recurrence. The author of the message expresses their understanding of the problem after having thought about it and appreciates an alternative solution provided in the thread. They remain undecided on which solution is better and suggest implementing both types if there is demand for it, using them side by side in Amiko Pay.</summary>
