    <summary>In a recent communication, Joseph Poon suggests that for synchronous across-the-wire commit steps, it is advisable to have three steps as opposed to two. This approach is considered more secure for the commit transaction. Furthermore, he explains that keeping everything asynchronous can simplify orchestration and eliminate the need for locking across-the-wire. The preliminary explanation on this topic can be found in the README.md file on the git repository.</summary>
