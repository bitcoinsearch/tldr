    <summary>In a recent email exchange, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada (CJP) and Rusty Russell, a well-known software developer, discussed the differences between their respective Lightning implementations. CJP was hoping to find some common ground between his Amiko Pay message types and those in C-Lightning protocol description. However, there was hardly any match due to the two platforms implementing nearly opposite subsets of the functionality of Lightning. Despite this, CJP acknowledged that C-Lightning's protocol description would be a good guide for developing a true Lightning style channel in Amiko Pay. Rusty also chimed in, saying that he was currently reworking the update pipelining, which has removed some of the complexity from the protocol. He has pushed his unworking code to the multi-htlc branch on Github, which can be accessed through the provided link. Although he is going on paternity leave for a few weeks, he hopes to build on his experience and expertise to make things faster in Amiko Pay.</summary>
