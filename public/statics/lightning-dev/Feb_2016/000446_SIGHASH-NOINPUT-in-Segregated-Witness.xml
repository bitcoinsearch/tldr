    <summary>In an email from February 25, 2016, Joseph Poon discussed a SIGHASH flag called SIGHASH_NOINPUT that would not include the outpoint being spent or the amount as part of the signature but would include the spent outpoint's script. A link was provided to various proposed SIGHASH types, as well as a "Build your own nHashType" proposal draft. Replies were also linked regarding OP_CODESEPARATOR and replay concerns using SIGHAHS_NOINPUT. Additionally, there was a draft implementation of SIGHASH_NOINPUT available on GitHub.</summary>
