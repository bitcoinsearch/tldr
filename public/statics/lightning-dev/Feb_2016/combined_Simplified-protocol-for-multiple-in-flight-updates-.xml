    <summary>In a discussion between Joseph Poon and Rusty Russell, the former argues that while eliminating acknowledgments would simplify the protocol in adding HTLCs, there are tradeoffs such as uncertainty about whether the other party has received the message. Removing HTLC securely requires removing it, committing to it, and waiting for the other party to revoke prior commitment, but if the success/failure ratio is high enough, it can be worth it. However, this may have disadvantages with intermittently connected nodes as confirmation time windows are smaller for non-responsive payments. Poon also optimizes against payment failure on the add side to avoid re-routing in the opposite direction to do a full cancel with a non-responsive node in multi-hop payments.</summary>
