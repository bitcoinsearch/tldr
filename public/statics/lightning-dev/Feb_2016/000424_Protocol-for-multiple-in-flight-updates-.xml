    <summary>In a conversation between Joseph Poon and Rusty, they discuss the number of steps required for a secure commit transaction. Joseph suggests that three steps are safer than two. However, Rusty questions how the steps are counted, and points out that parties must receive the signature before handing over the revocation preimage. Rusty wonders if a three-way handshake is necessary at every stage to simplify orchestration and avoid locking across-the-wire. Joseph acknowledges that their preliminary explanation in the git repo README.md file may be dense. Rusty asks how one can know what a signature covers if they receive an "add request" "add request" "signed commit", and whether it's necessary to wait for accept/reject message replies before committing. Rusty also questions whether the commit message includes a counter and whether the updates should be offered in parallel for good throughput.</summary>
