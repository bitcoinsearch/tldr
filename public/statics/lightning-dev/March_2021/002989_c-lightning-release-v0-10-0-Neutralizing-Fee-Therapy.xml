    <summary>C-lightning has announced the release of version 0.10.0, a major release that consolidates several features, fixes and experimental extensions. The new release includes significant refinements to pay across various less-common scenarios, as well as improvements to listpeers, which now shows the current feerate and unilateral close fee. Other highlights for users include the ability for listforwards to filter by channel status and in/out channel, and the addition of excess_as_change parameter to fundpsbt and utxopsbt. The Network highlights include the implementation of sync_complete for gossip_range queries as per latest spec, with backwards compatibility for older nodes. There is also a new config option, experimental-dual-fund, which enables the draft dual funding option for compatible nodes, including RBF upgrades for opening transactions. Developers can register all hooks by multiple plugins at once, and remote nodes can close incorrectly opened channels using the new wrong_funding option to close with the experimental-shutdown-wrong-funding option. The changelog contains more details on the changes and updates. Since 0.9.3, there have been 339 commits from 14 different authors over 69 days. The release was named by @jsarenik. First-time contributors included Matthias Debernardini, Luke Childs, and Alexey Zagarin.</summary>
