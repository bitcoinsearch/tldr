    <summary>Lightning is a natural phenomenon that occurs when there is an electrical discharge between the atmosphere and the ground or within the atmosphere itself. It usually happens during thunderstorms, but can also occur in volcanic eruptions or during dust storms. The discharge of lightning causes a sudden increase in temperature and pressure, resulting in a shock wave that produces thunder.Lightning is a dangerous and unpredictable force of nature that can cause significant damage to property and injure or kill people. It is estimated that lightning strikes the earth's surface about 100 times per second, with each strike containing billions of volts of electricity.Despite its destructive potential, lightning has also been harnessed for practical uses such as generating electricity through the use of lightning rods. In addition, lightning is also used in medical treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).There are several types of lightning, including cloud-to-ground (CG), cloud-to-cloud (CC), and intra-cloud (IC) lightning. CG lightning is the most well-known type and can strike up to 10 miles away from the thunderstorm, while CC and IC lightning occur within the cloud itself.Overall, lightning is a fascinating yet powerful natural occurrence that should be respected and precautions should be taken when in its presence.</summary>
