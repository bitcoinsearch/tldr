    <summary>In an email exchange between Stephen Morse and Rusty Russell, the issue of a potential failure mode in the A -&gt; C -&gt; E payment channel was discussed. The concern was that if C became unresponsive, C could collude with another party to steal funds. Joseph Poon suggested a solution off-list, which involved E routing a conditional refund back to A with a larger timeout via a different route. This would pay back the amount to A if they presented the preimage for the initial stalled payment and another preimage only A had. This serves as a guarantee that E will not reveal the preimage required to take the stalled payment. However, this solution raises questions about how nodes get paid and whether A can provide evidence that the route had timed out.</summary>
