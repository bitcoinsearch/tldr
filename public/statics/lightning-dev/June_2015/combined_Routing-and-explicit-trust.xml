    <summary>The context involves a conversation between various individuals discussing Lightning Network, which is a system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables faster and cheaper transactions. The discussion takes place on a mailing list called lightning-dev hosted by the Linux Foundation. One individual writes in asking about the terms "channel counterparty" and "clearinghouse," and what exactly the risk to the counterparty is and why it would be trustless to route through that party. Rusty Russell explains that the hub cannot steal one's money at all, only delay it, so it is mostly trustless. Another individual asks how users of the network would find and select intermediaries. Rusty explains that this is an open question, and he plans on starting a conversation with CJP, the author of Amiko pay, on the new list.</summary>
