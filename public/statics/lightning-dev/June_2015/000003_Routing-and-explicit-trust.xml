    <summary>In an email conversation on June 23, 2015, Rusty Russell expressed his desire to start a conversation about an open question with CJP, the author of Amiko pay. It is unclear whether they were already on the new list or not. The context of the conversation is unknown, but it can be assumed that they were discussing something related to Amiko pay.</summary>
