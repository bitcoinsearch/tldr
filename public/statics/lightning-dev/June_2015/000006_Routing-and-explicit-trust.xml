    <summary>In an email exchange on June 23, 2015, Rusty Russell informed "sickpig at gmail.com" that they were already subscribed to a new list. The recipient was one of the early subscribers and received a warm welcome from Rusty. However, Rusty mentioned that there were only 15 subscribers at the time, and he would wait a bit longer before starting any real discussion on the list.</summary>
