    <summary>In a discussion about the security of the Lightning Network, Rusty Russell responds to Stephen's question regarding what would happen if a payment channel becomes unresponsive mid-payment. Specifically, Stephen asks if someone could reroute their payment to avoid delays but then have the original non-responsive party reveal the pre-image to someone else and effectively steal an extra 0.01 BTC. Rusty confirms that this is a possibility and suggests that delaying the entire payment is not a good option.</summary>
