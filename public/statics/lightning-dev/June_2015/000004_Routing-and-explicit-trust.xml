    <summary>The conversation is about the new list, lightning-dev, hosted by linuxfoundation.org. Rusty Russell mentions that the hub cannot steal money but can only delay it, making it a trustless process. However, there may be some time-preference costs which could impact different people differently depending on their access to other funds. Sickpig at gmail.com asks if they are already on the new list, and Rusty thanks them for the question.</summary>
