    <summary>Ryan Gentry, a member of the Lightning-dev community, has proposed the addition of a Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal (bLIP) process to the existing BOLT process. The bLIP process would handle best practices and features originating from the app layer that struggle to make their way into the spec. Examples of such features include on-the-fly channel opens, dynamic commitments, p2p messaging formats, and new pathfinding heuristics. The bLIP process would provide a place for these features to be succinctly described and organized, bringing them into the fold instead of leaving them buried in old mailing list posts or undocumented. The bLIP process is based on BIP-0002 and would not affect the existing BOLT process. Developers from various implementations and the broader app layer ecosystem are encouraged to volunteer as editors. The proposal has received positive feedback from both app layer and protocol developers, and a branch describing the process has been started.</summary>
