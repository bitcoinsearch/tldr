    <summary>The Lightning Network is exploring two potential solutions, package-relay and SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, for the current LN-penalty. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT with eltoo. Dave Harding recommends publishing more detailed write-ups on these ideas before promoting them further.Antoine suggests a rough deployment timeline, but Dave cautions against creating timelines without consulting numerous contributors first. The proposal recommends implementing "package-relay" in Bitcoin Core to allow for more efficient routing of Lightning Network transactions. The opt-in of any LN/L2 implementation to migrate its fee-bumping backend on top of a future SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT softfork is also recommended.The deployment timeline includes early deployment in Bitcoin Core 0.24 or 0.25 for integration and feedback from the LN/L2 ecosystem, followed by mempool hardening in Bitcoin Core 0.26 or 0.27. The community emphasizes the importance of addressing safety holes previously identified by contributors and encourages open sharing and modification of ideas in line with the hacker ethos.The discussion highlights the need for ongoing collaboration and discussion across various contributors to make progress in decentralized ecosystems like Bitcoin. There are concerns about attackers using pinning to force honest users to pay another anyprevout bounty to miners, which could cause the user to spend more on fees than their balance from the closed channel. It is essential to address these concerns before implementing any solutions.</summary>
