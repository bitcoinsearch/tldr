    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of utilizing Lightning Network's features, including hodl invoices and payment points, to create a network for physical item delivery. The protocol involves using hodl invoices for atomic package delivery, where the merchant creates an invoice with a hash and cost of shipment as quoted by an independent courier. The purchaser pays the invoice, but it cannot be settled until the preimage is revealed. The courier then creates another hodl invoice for delivery costs, delivers the package, and settles the invoice upon receiving the preimage. The email also explores extending the protocol to a multi-courier situation and dealing with the issue of "time preference liquidity," where routing nodes along the way may feel they are not fairly compensated for having their funds locked up for a long time. Moving to payment points instead of HTLCs can potentially help reduce this concern by allowing each node along the route to earn a fee irrespective of whether the hodl invoice is settled or canceled. The author also asks if there is any way for a node operator to determine the likelihood of routing a long hodl invoice without testing on mainnet, which could be expensive.</summary>
