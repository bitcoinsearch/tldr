    <summary>In an email exchange between Rusty Russell and Bastien, the former proposed a new feature to accept zero-conf channels in lightning network implementation. He suggested adding a new feature bit "I accept zeroconf channels" which would allow nodes to send update_add_htlc before funding_locked without upsetting the peer. Nodes are advised not to forward HTLCs from unconfirmed channels unless they have explicit reason to trust that node. Russell also offered to draft something this week. In response, Bastien suggested that rather than sending `announcement_signatures` immediately after `funding_locked`, it might be worth deferring until the funding transaction has been confirmed. The email also raises questions about what minimum depth should be used and whether `accept_channel` should be kept at zero or non-zero value.</summary>
