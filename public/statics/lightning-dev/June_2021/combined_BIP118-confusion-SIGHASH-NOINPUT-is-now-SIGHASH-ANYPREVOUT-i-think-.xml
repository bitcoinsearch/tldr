    <summary>The bip118 draft has undergone significant changes since May 2019 and has been renamed to SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, causing confusion among those who are not up-to-date with the latest updates. The revisions made to the document can be found under the "Revisions" heading of the internal document. While the version of the draft in bitcoin/bips remained unmodified until recently, a minor fix has now caused it to diverge from the updated version. The version in bitcoin/bips still uses SIGHASH_NOINPUT terminology, but with taproot activating, SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT will be the preferred method to ease lightning network client state requirements.Despite these updates, Ryan Grant has noticed that the updated draft of bip118 is not being considered by a wider audience, and he is unsure why. The discussion on this topic can be found on Github at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/943, where relevant links are also provided.</summary>
