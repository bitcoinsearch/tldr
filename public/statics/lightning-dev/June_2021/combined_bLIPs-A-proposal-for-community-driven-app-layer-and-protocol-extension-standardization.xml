    <summary>The Bitcoin Lightning Network community is discussing the addition of a Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal (bLIP) process to the current BOLT protocol. This proposed process would provide a platform for app layer best practices and undocumented features that require cooperation among developers to be organized and described. The bLIP process would bring these features into the fold, as they are currently being developed outside of the BOLT process.Some potential bLIP ideas include lnurl variants, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast payment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, remote node connection standards, and more. These optional features have evolved over time as node implementations and wallets seek to solve UX and operational problems for their users.By having distinct documents for proposals/standards, each new standard/proposal can be more effectively explained, motivated, versioned, etc. The proposed branch is based on BIP-0002, and developers from various implementations and from the broader app layer ecosystem are encouraged to volunteer as editors.There have been concerns about the Lightning Network's current process for handling features and best practices that arise in the wild versus originating within the process itself. Historically, BOLTs have been used to propose new standardization documents, but there is a large gap in describing functionality that has emerged over time due to progressive evolution. Optional features should be extracted out of BOLTs and written as BIPs.While there are new BOLTs being offered, some members of the community believe that all the points addressed in Ryan's mail could very well be formalized into BOLTs but that the current process needs to be rethought to make it more accessible for new ideas to find their way into the BOLTs. Ultimately, different wallets and implementations may be willing to make different usability/security trade-offs. There is no need for widespread global consensus to make certain classes of changes in LN, as it sits a layer above the base protocol.While there are concerns that some bLIPs could be sub-optimal solutions or insecure and put users' funds at risk, bad ideas die out over time or can be spoken out against publicly.</summary>
