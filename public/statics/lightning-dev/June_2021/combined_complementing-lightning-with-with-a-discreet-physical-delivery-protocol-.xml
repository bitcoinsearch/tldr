    <summary>The email thread discusses the potential use of Lightning Network's features such as hodl invoices, payment points, and DLCs to create a network for physical item delivery. The author has shared a repository that explores this possibility and asks for feedback on the protocol. The process of using hodl invoices for atomic package delivery is described, involving the merchant creating an invoice with a hash and cost of shipment as quoted by an independent courier. The purchaser pays the invoice, but it cannot be settled until the preimage is revealed. The courier creates another hodl invoice for delivery costs, delivers the package, and settles the invoice upon receiving the preimage. There are concerns around extending the protocol to a multi-courier situation and dealing with "time preference liquidity" where routing nodes may not feel fairly compensated for having their funds locked up for a long time. Moving to payment points instead of HTLCs can potentially help reduce this concern. The author also asks if there is any way for a node operator to determine the likelihood of routing a long hodl invoice without testing on mainnet.</summary>
