    <summary>The Tor project will be dropping support for v2 hidden services in its latest release, with the aim of entirely dropping it from all supported releases by October. Bitcoin Core has already dropped support for v2 and plans to drop the v2 support for 0.22. This means that v2 onions will gradually stop being gossiped on the Bitcoin network. The author suggests that the Lightning network should do the same, but notes that the configuration is user-facing which could make the transition trickier. C-lightning is deprecating the configuration of Tor v2 services starting next release, and according to their deprecation policy should be able to entirely drop its support 3 releases after this one, which should not be too far from the October deadline. The author seeks opinions and asks what the state of other implementations is with regard to Tor v2 support.</summary>
