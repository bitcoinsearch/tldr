    <summary>There seems to be confusion among those who are not up-to-date with the latest updates to the bip118 draft. The draft has undergone substantial changes since May 2019 and has been renamed to SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. These changes are discussed in detail under the "Revisions" heading of the internal document. The version of the draft in bitcoin/bips remained unmodified until two months ago, where it diverged due to a minor fix. This version still uses SIGHASH_NOINPUT terminology. With taproot activating, it appears that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT will be the preferred method to ease lightning network client state requirements. Despite these updates, the author is unsure why the updated draft of bip118 has yet to be considered by a wider audience.</summary>
