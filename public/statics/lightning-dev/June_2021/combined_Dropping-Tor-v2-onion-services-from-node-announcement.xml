    <summary>A recent post on the Lightning-dev mailing list discussed the deprecation of Tor v2 hidden services. The Tor project plans to drop support for v2 in the latest release, and it will be entirely dropped from all supported releases by October. Bitcoin Core has already defaulted to v3 since 0.21.0 and is planning to drop v2 support for 0.22. Lightning Network may do the same, and some implementations have already started deprecating v2 onion services. Some newer Tor clients are already refusing to connect out to v2 onion services, and lnd may move to disallow users creating a v2 onion service in the next major release. Over half of all advertised addresses on the network today are onion services, and the rise of onion service usage has affected e2e payment latency, general connection stability, and gossip announcement propagation. There isn't much to do at the spec level to deprecate them, but nodes should start ignoring the addresses.</summary>
