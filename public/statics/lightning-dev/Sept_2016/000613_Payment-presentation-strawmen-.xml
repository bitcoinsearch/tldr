    <summary>In the given context, there seems to be an error made by the speaker as they say "Oops, I see my mistake." It is unclear what the mistake was, but the speaker advises to "Hold onto the r-hash longer." It is possible that the speaker is referring to the concept of a hash, which is a function used in cryptography and computer science. A hash function takes input data and returns a fixed-sized string of bytes. The resulting hash value can be used to verify the integrity of the original data.The term "r-hash" is not commonly used and it is unclear what the speaker specifically means by it. However, it is possible that they are referring to a specific type of hash function or algorithm.Without further context or information, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning or significance of the speaker's statement. It is possible that they are suggesting a different approach or technique in relation to hashing.</summary>
