    <summary>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and CJP, CJP suggests that out-of-band distribution of the pre-image is not only harmless but even desirable for committing transactions on channels when one of the intermediate nodes blocks regular distribution. The pre-image can be distributed in- or out-of-band to ensure quick resolution of HTLCs so that funds can flow in the opposite direction quickly. This could serve as an incentive for non-regular distribution of the pre-image. According to CJP, payer-&gt;payee distribution is added next to payee-&gt;payer distribution in Amiko Pay, but it's a voluntary thing, and people might decide to remove it from their version of Amiko Pay, without any real harm being done. In another email, CJP suggests that with source routing and explicit fee payment, you can atomically pay multiple parties by letting all but one of the recipients be intermediate parties in the route and paying them a high transaction fee. Payment amount can be obfuscated by letting yourself (the sender) be the final recipient of the payment so that none of the intermediate nodes sees the actual amount being transferred. However, this adds some interesting game theory where if one of the intermediate nodes blocks the regular distribution, they can potentially keep all HTLCs on their payer-side locked for quite some time until their time-outs, ultimately resulting in rolling back of the funds, with the blocking node again being the only one losing funds.</summary>
