    <summary>The author of the message suggests that with source routing and explicit fee payment, it is possible to atomically pay multiple parties by designating all but one recipient as intermediate parties in the route and paying them a high transaction fee. The payment amount can be kept obfuscated by making the sender the final recipient. The author states that this approach is not complicated and has not been previously realized.</summary>
