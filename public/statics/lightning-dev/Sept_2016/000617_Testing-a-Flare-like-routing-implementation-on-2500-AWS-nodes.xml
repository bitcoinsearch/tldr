    <summary>The conversation begins with someone praising the work being done. The discussion then moves to a proposed use of Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) as a substitute for pure broadcast networks, specifically in terms of storing information such as onion keys, identity keys, and channel proofs. The HORNET protocol is mentioned as a possible way for nodes to communicate with each other, with its bi-directional communication link being attractive. The relationship between the network layer and application layer is questioned, with an inquiry into whether an application-level link is equal to a network-level link. The backwards route being distinct from the forwards route in HORNET is deemed an amazing feature. The Sphinx construction is suggested as a substitute for request/response use-case, revealing the entire path to the responding node. The capacity of channels created and satoshis requested within the payment request are questioned, with the response indicating that they did not matter in the particular test and distribution would be a key parameter for a future dynamic ranking test.</summary>
