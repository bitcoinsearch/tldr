    <summary>Johnson Lau, a user on bitcoin-dev forum, has proposed a restriction for segwit OP_IF argument as policy. He is seeking more people to ACK or NACK the proposal, especially real users of OP_IF. He believes that Lightning network would use it a lot. Rusty, another user, mentions that his current scripts use OP_IF and OP_NOTIF only after OP_EQUAL, except for one place where they use OP_EQUAL...OP_EQUAL...OP_ADD OP_IF. However, he states that there is no effect either way on the c-lightning implementation.</summary>
