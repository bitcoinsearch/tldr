    <summary>In this message exchange, Pierre is seeking clarification from Viacheslav on how a sender can request a receiver's routing table if they are unable to communicate directly. The assumption is that payment requests would be transmitted off-band, possibly through a QR code on a webpage or similar method. The payee's routing table can then be attached as a piece of data to the payment request, creating a direct one-way communication between the sender and receiver.</summary>
