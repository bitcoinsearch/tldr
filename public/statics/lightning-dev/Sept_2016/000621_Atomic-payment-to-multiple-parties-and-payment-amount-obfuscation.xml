    <summary>Rusty Russell, a developer, shared a new thought about atomically paying multiple parties using source routing and explicit fee payment. He proposed that all but one of the recipients could be intermediate parties in the route, and they would receive a high transaction fee. The payment amount can be obfuscated by letting the sender be the final recipient. Rusty Russell also discussed an interesting game theory scenario where a node (B) could potentially gain $4 by ignoring an HTLC from another node (C). However, if C were to get the preimage out-of-band, it could claim the $5 from B and leave it out-of-pocket. Despite this, the game theory applies to normal fees as well.</summary>
