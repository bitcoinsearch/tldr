    <summary>A wants to send funds to E but they don't have a direct payment channel. Therefore, they use a path A-B-C-D-E where A is the sender and E is the final recipient. E sends the hash of a secret r to A which is then passed on to B, C, D, and E in the same order. E discloses the secret to C, who is a partner in crime, while not responding to D. C settles the HTLC with B and gives the secret to B, who then settles the HTLC with A by giving the secret to A.However, A loses the money as E denies receiving it along with the promised service/good. The Lightning Network has no control over this situation.</summary>
