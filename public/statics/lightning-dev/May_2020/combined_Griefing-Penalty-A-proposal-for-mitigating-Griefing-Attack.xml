    <summary>The paper discusses the issues of reverse-griefing and long-term gain strategies in a Lightning Network. To mitigate griefing attacks in Bitcoin-compatible payment channel networks (PCNs), the authors proposed a countermeasure called the Griefing-Penalty, which aims to penalize any party attempting to launch a griefing attack on the network. However, ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Griefing-Penalty as a solution to Reverse-Griefing attacks in an email exchange with Subhra Mazumdar. To address these concerns, Mazumdar explained that honest-rational parties would still follow the protocol unless a strictly more rewarding strategy exists. They also suggested adding extra measures to prevent reverse-griefing. The email exchange touched upon the encumbrance of RSMC, the waiting time involved in earning the penalty, and channel closure.In response to the issues of griefing attacks in off-chain contracts on the Lightning Network, the authors proposed a new payment protocol called HTLC-GP or Hashed Timelock Contract with Griefing-Penalty. The protocol requires both parties to lock funds, with one party locking the amount to be forwarded and the other locking a penalty to be claimed if they grief. The penalty is proportional to the product of the forwarded amount and the contract expiration time. Honest nodes are compensated for any losses due to griefing attacks. The modified contract requires the recipient to lock an additional amount in the contract, which can be used to compensate both the sender and intermediate nodes in case of griefing. If the payment is not resolved within the expiration time, all parties who have forwarded the contract will claim the locked penalty.The HTLC-GP protocol provides a solution to the problem of griefing attacks in off-chain contracts by penalizing the adversary and compensating all affected parties. The authors suggest that the community review the feasibility of the approach and its implementation. The Mitigating Reverse-Griefing contract reintroduces griefing and simplifies the setup to S -&gt; F -&gt; R. However, it also raises concerns about time discounting, counterparty risk, and cheap pseudonyms that make reverse-griefing more attractive than honest behavior.</summary>
