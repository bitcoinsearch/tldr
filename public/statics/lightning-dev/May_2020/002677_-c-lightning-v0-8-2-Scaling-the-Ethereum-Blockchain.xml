    <summary>C-lightning has announced the 0.8.2 release with new and experimental features, bug-fixes, and performance wins. The release includes a new config option for opening channels of any size, a keysend plugin to receive payments, and an announcement of multiple connection endpoints for a single type. A big performance improvement in the pay command has also been achieved. Developers can use the API for the Bitcoin backend plugin infrastructure, facilities for building rendez-vous compatible onions have been added to the onion devtool, and fixes with plugin cleanups and hangs have been made. Python2 has been removed as a dependence. The release notes provide more details about the changes. The release had contributions from 10 different authors, including two first-time contributors.</summary>
