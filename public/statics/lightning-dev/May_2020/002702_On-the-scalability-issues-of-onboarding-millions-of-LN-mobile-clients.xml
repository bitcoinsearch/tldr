    <summary>The discussion involves the potential risks of an off-grid node relying on a local network peer for blockchain information due to the risk of colluding direct LN peers not forwarding payment. The light client is requesting validation information because its direct peers could defraud it, causing its channels to be valueless. A malicious direct payment peer may simulate a successful payment made by an off-grid victim peer to an information source, which would put any LN payments received by the eclipsed off-grid victim node at risk. One solution proposed was to use a system similar to watchtowers when validation-information-provider is prepaid and issues tokens that can be redeemed later. Public watchtowers or some sort of HTTP proxy data cache similar to a watchtower makes the most sense to incentivize full nodes to exchange new data with other nodes in a tit-for-tat way. Network agents that monetize full node information services beyond channel monitoring would be more than just a "Watchtower" for light clients.</summary>
