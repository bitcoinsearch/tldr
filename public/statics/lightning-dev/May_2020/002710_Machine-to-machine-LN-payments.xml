    <summary>Eugene is inquiring about the potential for the Lightning Network to support a specific use-case involving subscription payments. The scenario involves a user subscribing to a service by opening a channel with it and setting their LN node to "trust" invoices from said service. When it comes time for subscription renewal, the service would send an invoice to the client's LN node and the payment would be automatically processed since the client's node trusts the service's node. The user can cancel the subscription at any time by removing the service's LN node public key from the list of trusted nodes or by setting limits on payment amounts and frequencies. Eugene has two questions related to this use-case: 1) Is it possible to send invoices solely through the Lightning Network and should TLVs be used? 2) Can automatic machine-to-machine payments be enabled by accepting invoices from trusted nodes?</summary>
