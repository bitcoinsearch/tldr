    <summary>Eugene has proposed a use-case for the Lightning Network, involving subscription payments. The idea involves a user subscribing to a service by opening a channel with it and setting their node to trust invoices from that service. When it comes time for subscription renewal, the service would send an invoice directly to the client's LN node, which would pay it straight away due to the trusting relationship between the two nodes. The user could cancel the subscription at any time by removing the service's LN node public key from the list of "trusted" or by setting limits on the amount and frequency of payments accepted from trusted nodes.Discussions on the Lightning-dev mailing list suggest that these use cases are already supported by the Lightning Network. TLVs may be used to send invoices, and automatic payments can be facilitated through the use of trusted nodes. Additionally, the conversation explores the possibility of spontaneous keysend payments, where a payee sends a small payment to a payer, who then makes the required payment back. A custom plugin can be used to check incoming keysend messages and pay valid ones back.Overall, the Lightning Network has potential for facilitating subscription-based services and supporting automatic machine-to-machine payments. The use of TLVs and trusted nodes can enable invoicing and payment processing.</summary>
