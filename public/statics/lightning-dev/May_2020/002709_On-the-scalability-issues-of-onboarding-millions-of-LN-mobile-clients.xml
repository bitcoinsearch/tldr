    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, the topic of private full nodes serving headers to weak devices was brought up as a potential solution for issues that may arise with future Lightning Network and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes. Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos agreed with this idea and suggested that connecting a mobile Lightning client to a home full node should be made extremely easy to prevent centralized services from taking over. The user asked fellow members if anyone could describe the current user experience and identify any blockers. In response, Will proposed using a node provider such as FullyNoded or Casa and listed the software needed for his own setup at home, including bitcoind, clightning, zerotier or tailscale, and sparkwallet. He noted that while backups and liquidity issues still need improvement, the user experience can be smooth with the right software.</summary>
