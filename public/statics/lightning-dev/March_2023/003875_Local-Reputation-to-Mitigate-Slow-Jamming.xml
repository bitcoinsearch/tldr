    <summary>In an email conversation, Thomas and the sender discuss the concept of confidence in a node's reputation in a network. The sender questions whether there is any benefit to giving high confidence ratings, as it may lower one's reputation. They also inquire if reporting a confidence rating of 0 (which maps to a reputation of 1) would be the most advantageous selfish strategy. It is noted that if c is already capped at 1, underestimating confidence wouldn't provide any gain.</summary>
