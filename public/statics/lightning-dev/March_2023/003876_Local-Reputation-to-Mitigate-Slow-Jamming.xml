    <summary>In an email conversation between Clara Shikhelman and Thomas, they discussed the impact of giving high confidence to HTLCs. Thomas argued that giving a high confidence would increase the chances that the HTLCs are relayed, which should be the goal. On the other hand, Clara questioned if there was anything to gain from giving high confidence and if it could risk lowering one's reputation. She suggested that reporting confidence 0 all the time might be the best selfish strategy as it maps to reputation 1. However, Thomas countered by explaining that having a high reputation is not a goal in itself but rather a way to make HTLCs more likely to be relayed. He also pointed out that reporting confidence 0 all the time would result in rejected HTLCs in congested situations. Therefore, the key takeaway is that while having a high reputation is desirable, it should not be the ultimate goal, and giving a high confidence can increase the likelihood of successful HTLC relays.</summary>
