    <title>JSON RPC Interface BLIP</title>

    <summary>The author of the email is struggling to find a solution for his Bitcoin Lightning Node management app to connect to various back ends available, especially via web due to encountering CORS errors. Nodes being behind firewalls makes connection to them remotely difficult. While Lightning Labs has its own solution called Lightning Node Connect, it is too tailored for use with LND and gRPC. The author suggests having a BLIP that describes a JSON RPC interface over a WebSocket that node back ends can implement allowing any front end to be used with any back end. This would include all basic features of lightning, like opening and closing channels and sending payments. The author also suggests having a proxy version of the JSON RPC interface, which allows two sides to connect and subscribe to each other. This would enable using nodes behind complicated firewalls such as Tor.</summary>
