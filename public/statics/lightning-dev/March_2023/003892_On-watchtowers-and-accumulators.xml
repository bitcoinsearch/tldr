    <summary>Sergi has discussed with ZmnSCPxj about how to handle data deletion for accountable watchtowers without storing raw proof of deletion for every deleted item. They have come up with a solution using accumulators to reduce data storage requirements while proving additions/deletions. After discussing it with Salvatore Ingala and Calvin Kim, Sergi has written a draft on how accumulators can help with this issue. The draft explains what accountable watchtowers are and how accumulators may solve the problem. The details can be found in the provided link.</summary>
