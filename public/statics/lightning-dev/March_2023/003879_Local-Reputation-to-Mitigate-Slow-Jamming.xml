    <summary>The article discusses the challenges of implementing a binary solution to block low-reputation nodes in blockchain technology. It highlights that an attacker can easily fill the quota for low-confidence HTLCs, resulting in the blocking of genuine low-traffic nodes. The author suggests a continuous solution that differentiates between active attackers and low-traffic neighbors. They propose replacing the concept of "low/high reputation" with "unknown/endorsed" to decide which neighbor should have access to all resources. The idea of different bins is also discussed, but its effectiveness is debatable. Moreover, the article talks about the difficulty of reporting c truthfully without being penalized. If the report is too high or too low, it will negatively impact the HTLCs and the reputation of the node. The author points out that there may be a strong motivation to underestimate rather than overestimate the report, and the chosen formula can significantly affect the punishment.</summary>
