    <summary>In a message to John, Dave discusses the benefits of John's tunable penalties. The first benefit, offchain channel resizes, allows Alice and Bob to share control over an offchain UTXO valued at x satoshis in state 0 and y satoshis in state 1. However, Dave questions how this differs from a classic channel factory, as it seems to be something that was already possible in theory. The second benefit, liquidity multiplexing, is seen as a significant advance. It allows for multiple parties, such as Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dan, to own a portion of a UTXO. Alice and Bob expect to always be available, while Carol and Dan may sometimes be unavailable. This proposal allows Carol and Dan to spend/receive in combination with Alice and Bob, but also ensures Alice and Bob can spend back and forth the entirety of their portions of the UTXO even if Carol, Dan, or both of them are unavailable. Dave notes that this advantage of multiparty channels has not been described before and cannot be functionally reproduced with pair-producing channel factories. Overall, Dave wanted to double-check if he had missed anything about the Offchain Channel Resizes and thanked John for his innovation.</summary>
