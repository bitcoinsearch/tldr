    <summary>The moderator of a group dedicated to Lightning development has announced that all posts will be reviewed and only those directly concerned with Lightning development will be approved. The decision is set to be reviewed next week. The moderator apologizes for any delays in post approval. However, the announcement is followed by an exception made by the moderator himself, allowing the current post to be approved.</summary>
