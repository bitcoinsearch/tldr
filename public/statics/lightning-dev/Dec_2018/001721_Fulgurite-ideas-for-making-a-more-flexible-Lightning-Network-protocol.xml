    <title>Fulgurite: ideas for making a more flexible Lightning Network protocol</title>

    <summary>Trey Del Bonis has proposed a new Lightning Network extension called Fulgurite, which aims to make the network more flexible and fault-tolerant. The proposal merges user balances and HTLCs into different types of "channel partitions" that can be tracked on a graph moving forward in time. This can simplify splicing and subchannels and enable discreet log contracts in channels, improving anonymity. Trey has provided a document describing Fulgurite and a toy implementation of its core parts for experimentation. The proposal is named after fossilized lightning and can be accessed through the link provided.</summary>
