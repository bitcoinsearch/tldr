    <summary>In a message shared on Tuesday, December 11th, Rusty Russell introduced a library called minisketch, which he suggested could be used for efficient summaries of data such as bitcoin transaction gossip. The implementation sweet-spot of the library is at 64-bits, which almost works well for gossip messages. The required size of the minisketch to be sent depends on the number of differences with peer. There does not need to be a consensus between peers on the minisketch size though, since truncated minisketches regrow into whole ones when tossed back into the ocean. Research has been done on estimating the sizes of differences that are linked to in https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/blob/master/doc/protocoltips.md which may be useful.</summary>
