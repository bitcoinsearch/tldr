    <summary>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and ZmnSCPxj on December 2, 2018, the topic of Lightning Network payment paths was discussed. ZmnSCPxj proposed merging failed payment paths into a single payment along the more expensive path. Rusty Russell agreed with this suggestion, stating that using "numpaths" to commit to future actions is unnecessary because the payee is only interested in the total value of the payment. This proposal would involve a temporary underpayment, but could be signaled to the payee with a simple message indicating that "more is coming." The conversation took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
