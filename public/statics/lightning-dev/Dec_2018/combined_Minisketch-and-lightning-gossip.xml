    <summary>Rusty Russell, in a message shared on December 11th, introduced Minisketch, an efficient data summary library that works well for Bitcoin transaction gossip with a 64-bit implementation sweet-spot. The library is designed to minimize overheads and the author proposes using a direct encoding method for node announcements. This allows for immediate use of an INV-style query or the automatic sending of missing information to peers. The required size of the Minisketch depends on the number of differences with a peer, and there does not need to be any consensus on its size as truncated Minisketches regrow into whole ones.The proposed protocol includes a type (#260), chain hash, latest block hash, and Minisketch length. To reduce redundancy, the author suggests combining block height and txindex into "txnumber since block 500,000". The remaining bits are used for output number and timestamp, which can be controlled by the originator to mitigate collisions. Research has been done on estimating sizes of differences, linked in the Github page, which may be useful.</summary>
