    <summary>A Lightning-dev user, Pavol Rusnak, suggested the idea of showing an identicon next to the QR code when performing a payment via QR code. This would allow users to visually verify whether the recipient is correct by checking the identicon of the payee node id (public key) rather than having to check the rather long hex value. The suggestion was met with interest and someone even tested jdenticon with their node id to see if small changes in inputs had uniformly random visual outputs. However, they found that small changes to the first digit didn't change the visual output at all. Whether or not this is useful in this use case, it's something to keep in mind.</summary>
