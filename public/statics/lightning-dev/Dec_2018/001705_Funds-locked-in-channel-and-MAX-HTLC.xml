    <summary>In a conversation thread, Cezary Dziemian inquired about the meaning of max_accepted_htlcs as mentioned in BOLT. Rusty replied confirming that it refers to the maximum number of pending transactions allowed for a single channel. However, there is also a limit on the maximum amount of total offered HTLCs which shouldn't exceed the remote's max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat. If the result would offer more than the remote's max_accepted_htlcs HTLCs or if the sum of total offered HTLCs would exceed the remote's max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat, then an HTLC cannot be added to the remote commitment transaction.</summary>
