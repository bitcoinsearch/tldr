    <summary>A proposal has been made to simplify the process of checking payee node ids (public keys) when making payments through QR codes. Currently, users have to go through lengthy hex values to verify the recipient's identity. To make it easier, an identicon could be added next to the QR code. This visual representation would allow users to quickly check if the recipient is correct. The use of an identicon would need to be added to all Lightning user-facing wallets for this feature to make sense.</summary>
