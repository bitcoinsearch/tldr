    <summary>The author of a forum post appreciated the work done on the Lightning Network (LN) and wondered if there was any discussion about exchanging colored-coins or non-fungible tokens through it. They acknowledged the possibility of issuance and suggested that adding these capabilities to the LN would enable new use-cases. Rene informed Joao about BHB Networks, who are working on colored coins for Bitcoin and Lightning, with Alekos Filini as the main contributor. The progress of this project can be found in their spec repo at https://github.com/rgb-org/spec. The fourth md file in that repo is about the lightning network. Alekos shared information about this project at the third lightning hackday in Berlin and on the LightningHackdayNYC. Both talks were recorded and can be found on YouTube. Joao asked if there was any discussion about exchanging colored-coins or non-fungible tokens through the LN, and Rene suggested talking to Alekos directly.</summary>
