    <summary>In a conversation between Trey and ZmnSCPxj, the idea of setting up subchannels for payments and discreet log contracts (DLCs) was discussed to avoid re-signing for all potential outcomes for DLCs. The routing gossip system is not trust-based and nodes automatically remove spent channel outpoints from their maps. In a Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer factory, the onchain txo would contain all channels in the factory, and nodes would check that the channels purportedly contained in the factory sum up to the value of this txo. The issue of re-signing for DLC subcontracts could be avoided by using SIGHASH_NOINPUT. CSV requirements are time-based requirements that affect the behavior of absolute timelocks used by HTLCs and need to be managed at a higher level. It is better to move time-sensitivity to Fulgurite than to higher layers. Higher layers can simply be concerned about what contracts it wants to enter into.</summary>
