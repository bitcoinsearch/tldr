    <summary>In a Lightning-dev discussion, a comment was made about the creation of American Call Options through Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs). Two possible responses were given to this comment. The first response mentions that cross-asset brokers charge a standard option premium for their brokerage services and asks for clarification on whether the commenter thinks this is a flawed system or just unfortunate. The responder admits to not understanding lightning technology well enough to gauge the effects of any changes to the system.The second response discusses how cross-asset brokers require counterparties to issue them a symmetric but slightly more out-of-the-money call, which they can redeem in the event of a large FX swing. This allows them to limit their FX losses.Overall, the discussion centers around the use of HTLCs and their potential impact on the options market within lightning technology.</summary>
