    <summary>Rusty Russell suggests that the shared secret doesn't need to be very large and explains that the number of attempts per second to guess the shared secret is limited by network latency, bandwidth, and rate limiting. He calculates that a 32-bit shared secret will take around 248 days to crack for a single guess of which node is the final node. Russell also mentions that people are likely to notice ongoing attacks and take countermeasures while the transaction lock time would expire. Responding to Russell's statement, Christian suggests storing the secret from the invoice in the HMAC field, an idea that would not require additional space in the onion. However, he expresses uncertainty about this option since it mixes field purposes.</summary>
