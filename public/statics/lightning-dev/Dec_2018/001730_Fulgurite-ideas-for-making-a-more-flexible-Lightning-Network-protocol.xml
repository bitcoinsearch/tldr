    <summary>The conversation between Trey Del Bonis and ZmnSCPxj revolved around the Fulgurite system, which is designed to allow discreet log contracts (DLCs) and Lightning-visible routing nodes to coexist. The discussion touched upon various aspects of implementing the system. One important aspect was ensuring that routing gossip is not trust-based, and that nodes check if the specified transaction output (txo) is unspent and matches the purported capacity of the channel. Another issue was whether to use subchannels for routing payments through each other and entering into DLCs, so that only the routing (sub)channel would be announced to the routing network. ZmnSCPxj suggested that it might be possible to allocate only part of the funds to Lightning-visible routing nodes by relaxing the requirement that channels purported to be in the factory sum up to the value of the channel factory txo. They also proposed using SIGHASH_NOINPUT to avoid the issue of re-signing the DLC subcontracts and to anchor the DLC subcontracts even if the update transaction changes. Regarding CSV requirements, which are a time-based requirement that affect the behavior of absolute timelocks used by HTLCs, ZmnSCPxj suggested that it would be better to move time-sensitivity to Fulgurite than to higher layers. Higher layers can simply be concerned about what contracts they want to enter into, and the Fulgurite layer can inform the higher layer of the latest block height at which it can still safely collapse the Fulgurite system.</summary>
