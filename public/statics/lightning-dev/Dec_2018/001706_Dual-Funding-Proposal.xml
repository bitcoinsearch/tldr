    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, user ZmnSCPxj suggested adding a 128-bit seed to the `open_channel2` function in order to improve security. They proposed sorting the seed by SHA (seed | input | ) and SHA (seed |) for added entropy. Rusty Russell responded that `open_channel2` already has a good amount of entropy due to its temporary channel ID and various basepoints. He suggested using an existing basepoint as the seed, such as the revocation_basepoint, which would not be exposed on-chain.</summary>
