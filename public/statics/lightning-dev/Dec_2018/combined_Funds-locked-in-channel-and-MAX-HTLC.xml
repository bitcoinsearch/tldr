    <summary>Cezary Dziemian posted a message on a forum seeking clarification on whether the max_accepted_htlcs feature in BOLT allows for a single channel to have multiple transactions pending simultaneously. Rusty replied confirming that it refers to the maximum number of pending transactions allowed for a single channel. However, there is also a limit on the maximum amount of total offered HTLCs which shouldn't exceed the remote's max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat. If the result would offer more than the remote's max_accepted_htlcs HTLCs or if the sum of total offered HTLCs would exceed the remote's max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat, then an HTLC cannot be added to the remote commitment transaction.The conversation thread between Cezary Dziemian and Rusty provides valuable insight into the max_accepted_htlcs feature in BOLT. It clarifies that this feature sets a limit on the maximum number of pending transactions allowed for a single channel. The thread also highlights that there is a limit on the total amount of offered HTLCs that should not exceed the remote's max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat. In conclusion, this discussion on the forum sheds light on the technicalities of the max_accepted_htlcs feature in BOLT and its limitations.</summary>
