    <summary>In a discussion with CJP, ZmnSCPxj addresses the issue of trust in a practical sense. He refers to his proposal of slowdown prevention and acknowledges that it is not completely trustless. However, he believes that if an alternative trustless system is very impractical and the risk is small enough, the benefits might be worth the risks on an individual voluntary basis. CJP responds by expressing hesitancy towards using the word "trust" as it may create friction. He also raises concerns about RM being a trusted third party and charging as much as the market will bear. This implies that OM may be unable to extract any sizable fee, which may deter support for this approach. ZmnSCPxj shares CJP's concerns regarding friction and states that he is hesitant to support the proposal, especially considering the historical behavior of trusted third parties. However, he suggests that if RM can be made punishable for breaches in timing attacks or some similar mechanism, it may become workable.</summary>
