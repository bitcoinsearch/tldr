    <summary>A person named Rene has informed Joao about BHB Networks, who are working on colored coins for Bitcoin and Lightning. Alekos Filini is the main contributor to this project. The progress of this project can be found in their spec repo at https://github.com/rgb-org/spec. The fourth md file in that repo is about the lightning network. Alekos talked about this project at the third lightning hackday in Berlin and on the LightningHackdayNYC. Both talks have been recorded and can be found on youtube. Joao asked if there was any discussion about exchanging colored-coins or non-fungible tokens through the LN. Rene suggested talking to Alekos directly.</summary>
