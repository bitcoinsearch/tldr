    <summary>In this email conversation between Jose and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using standard versus modified wallets for LN payments. ZmnSCPxj argues that standard wallets are more desirable as modifications can be dangerous and increase overall effort. They also discuss logistical concerns around replenishing offline vending machines, with ZmnSCPxj proposing a system that only requires an initial configuration of the machine with a shared secret for an unlimited series of payments. Jose raises concerns about how the system would handle price changes, static QR codes, privacy, and security. ZmnSCPxj suggests using Rusty's proposal for static offers and payment decorrelation to address privacy and security concerns.</summary>
