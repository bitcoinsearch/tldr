    <summary>The email conversation discusses a proposed solution for offline devices, such as vending machines, to share a secret with an online LN Node without requiring changes to BOLT spec or current wallets. The proposed solution involves the online LN node preparing a set of invoices, and the offline vending machine storing the payment hash, salt, and invoice signature. The conversation also touches on concerns about price changes, static QR codes, privacy, and security.ZmnSCPxj and Jose discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using standard versus modified wallets for LN payments, with ZmnSCPxj arguing that standard wallets are more desirable. They also propose a system for replenishing offline vending machines with shared secrets for an unlimited series of payments, but raise concerns about how the system would handle price changes, static QR codes, privacy, and security. Rusty's proposal for static offers and payment decorrelation is suggested as a solution.The conversation also discusses the possibility of not having to replenish invoices for machines that offer services instead of physical products, with ZmnSCPxj suggesting the use of EEPROM to store several hundred thousand invoices. The proposed scheme is intended for offline payments, involving an offline device and an online LN Node sharing a common secret seed, and includes a standard for every compliant wallet to know how to decode and present the information to the user. A piggybacking scheme for vending machines and toll booths is proposed to allow the vending machine to only send the product or service ID to the remote Lightning Network Node, while the price can be adjusted in real time. Technicians are still required to periodically check the vending machines for mechanical damage or attempts to pay via crowbar, and invoices can be replenished with up-to-date prices ensuring limited risk. Static QR codes are deemed unimportant as long as the invoice can be generated at the vending machine and a QR code is shown to pay and claim the product.</summary>
