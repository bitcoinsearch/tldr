    <summary>In a conversation thread, ZmnSCPxj suggests an alternative solution to the problem of multiple payment paths failing. Instead of relying on `numpaths`=3, which overcommits to future actions and may not be necessary anyway, it would be better to merge the failed paths into a single payment along the expensive 4th path. This approach would ensure that the payee receives the total value they are interested in, without getting bogged down in the details of the split. Rusty agrees with this suggestion and thanks ZmnSCPxj for their excellent point.</summary>
