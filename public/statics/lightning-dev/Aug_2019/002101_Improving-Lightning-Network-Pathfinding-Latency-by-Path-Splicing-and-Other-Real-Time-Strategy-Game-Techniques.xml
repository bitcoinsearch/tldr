    <summary>In a conversation between Bastien and ZmnSCPxj, the latter discusses his plans for implementing the multi-path payments (MPP) feature in eclair. He explains that most solutions to the network flow problem require an accurate view of flows at each node, which they do not have. However, for the first hop, they have the exact balance available for sending, and for next hops, they can consider the channels balanced with a random perturbation of X%. ZmnSCPxj's initial implementation of MPP for eclair uses an algorithm similar to flocking, but he is open to trying something similar to `permuteroute` if the results are not satisfactory. ZmnSCPxj also mentions that the original plan was to derive some kind of `getmultiroute` that does a single graph scan and generates multiple paths, but he faced problems in his naive implementations. Therefore, he suggests using `permuteroute` as an idea for implementing multipath.</summary>
