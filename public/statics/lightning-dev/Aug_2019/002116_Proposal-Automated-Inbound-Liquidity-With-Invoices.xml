    <title>Proposal: Automated Inbound Liquidity With Invoices</title>

    <summary>The proposal is for a way to automate instant inbound liquidity via invoices in order to address the problem of waiting for inbound liquidity when first coming online and wanting to receive a Lightning Network payment. The solution suggested involves embedding the node uri of the invoice creator, along with the amount to be routed. This would allow for auto-establishment of channels and pushing of payments for routing nodes, but not all LN nodes. Certain specifics need to be worked out, such as the size of the channel and potential premiums charged by routing nodes who provide this service. The proposal has potential to extend to neutrino LN wallets if they are public.</summary>
