    <summary>The conversation between Rusty Russell and Ecurrencyhodler Blockchains revolves around the proposal of having an automated experience from invoice payment to payment reception without having to manage any channels. Rusty believes that if a node address is published, Bob can get it from the gossip network or DNS seed as a last resort. This proposal is mainly useful where there are no channels at all, or one does not want to publish it generally. However, Ecurrencyhodler argues that all nodes who come online for the first time are not connected to any channels, and even if they hand Bob their URI, they still have to wait for the channels to be established before receiving payment. Ecurrencyhodler suggests that this proposal would help non-technical node managers and that routing nodes are financially incentivized to open a channel with them.</summary>
