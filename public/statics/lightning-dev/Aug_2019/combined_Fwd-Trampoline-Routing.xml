    <summary>Trampoline routing is a method of sending payments through trampoline nodes, allowing users to defer the calculation of the route to their chosen trampoline node. This enables hierarchical/packet switched routing architecture, which will be required when the network becomes too large. Bastien TEINTURIER proposes the creation of a filter system similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 37 (BIP37), where Alice sends gossip filters to her peers and only forwards updates that match these filters. However, this system has a cost for Alice in the form of opening a channel and locking funds to connect to a peer.In a conversation between fiatjaf and ZmnSCPxj, the topic of privacy erosion in routing is discussed. The use of multiple trampoline nodes in routing process is explained as a way to reduce the chance of the trampoline node knowing who the final payee is, thus protecting privacy. The conversation then shifts to the idea of a future public network becoming too large to fit on most devices. ZmnSCPxj believes that a global map with just trampoline-payee association mappings and a myopic detailed channel map should be implemented, with each payer defining their own hierarchy or split. However, ZmnSCPxj also acknowledges the possibility that his ideas may be too indefinite and the network should be allowed to evolve naturally.Bastien seeks feedback from the community on the concept's gossip and fee estimation parts, with the proposal available at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/654. Despite the potential issue of not syncing the whole network, trampoline routing is an engineering trade-off between ease of implementation and deployment, fixing a problem we have today and enabling future scaling for problems we'll have tomorrow.</summary>
