    <summary>On August 5th, 2019, ZmnSCPxj discussed the use of trampoline nodes in Lightning Network on a mailing list. He explained that if Alice only used one trampoline node, it would assume the next hop is always the payee and thus record who the payee is, eroding privacy. However, if Alice uses two, a trampoline node would have a 50/50 chance of knowing who the final payee is, reducing the privacy erosion. He also noted that in the future we will see a public network that is too large to fit on most devices available to most people, so it will eventually be required to hierarchicalize how we store information, with a "myopic" detailed channel map and a "rough" global map with just trampoline-payee association mappings. ZmnSCPxj believes that it is best for each payer to define its own hierarchy or split, preferably with some random component. He also acknowledged that his ramblings may be too indefinite and it would be better to see the network as it evolves.</summary>
