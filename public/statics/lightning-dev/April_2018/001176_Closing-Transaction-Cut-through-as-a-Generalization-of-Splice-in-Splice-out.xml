    <summary>In this message exchange, ZmnSCPxj and Christian discuss the connection between channel factories. ZmnSCPxj suggests that as long as there is a way to invalidate a prior funding transaction to reseat without needing a cut-through, the connection between channel factories is unnecessary. ZmnSCPxj proposes presenting a `reseatchannel` command at c-lightning RPC level to transfer the remaining funds of a channel from one peer to a new channel to another. This can be done using current operations before the Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories are deployed. `Multifundchannel` actually creates a new channel factory with this node and all nodes listed in the multi-fund operation as members of the factory. `Reseatchannel` is an offchain channel reorganization request to the factory.</summary>
