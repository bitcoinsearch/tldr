    <summary>In an email thread, Tyler suggests a better approach to writing a browser extension that interfaces with a daemon already running on the system through REST or similar. Aleksey is looking for a way to run a LN node inside the browser. He asks if anyone has successfully compiled c-lightning project under WebAssembly. There are some things c-lightning does that should stop it from compiling easily, however, there are wrappers for many C-functions by Emscripten lib. Igor notes that Aleksey's biggest obstacle is probably the fact that c-lightning spawns several processes and depends on the bitcoin-cli binary for bitcoind RPC. If WebAssembly supports multiple processes (not just threads) that's a good start. There is a c-lightning specific mailing list available. Tyler suggests Lightning Charge would help here for c-lightning, or lnd has REST and gRPC built in. The key difference here is key material isn't accessed by the browser and secured by the browser's pitiful security, but instead live in the usual directory and the daemon handles it normally. Aleksey could even do something like the Tor Browser Bundle and bundle the daemon with the browser in a neat package.</summary>
