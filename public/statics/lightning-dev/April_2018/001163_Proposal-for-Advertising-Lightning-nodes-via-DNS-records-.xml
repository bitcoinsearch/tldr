    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, user ZmnSCPxj suggested that having private nodes with channels open to public nodes could help domain operators manage their risk. However, another user expressed concern about how risk could be managed if the public and private nodes were owned by the same economic entity. The concern was that the earnings would still be in the public channel, so an attack on the public node could result in the hacker taking the earnings. Another user responded that having a separate node as the source of truth, rather than the gateway node exposed directly to the open network, could have additional advantages. If the gateway node was compromised, it would not be possible for the attacker to escalate to the store without also compromising the hidden nodes. However, if the gateway node provided the ground truth for the store, then the attacker could mark all invoices as complete and steal goods from the shop. The attacker would be limited to draining the B -&gt; C channel until it gets rebalanced.</summary>
