    <summary>In a conversation on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Jim Posen suggested implementing a symmetric CSV delay as a solution to incentivize both parties to mutually close channels instead of waiting for the other side to unilaterally close. The change would require the full CSV delay for the remote output of all commitment transactions, serving as punishment to misbehaving or unresponsive nodes that force the other endpoint to go to chain. Daniel points out that honest nodes that have gone offline will not need immediate access to their balance and therefore this change should not cause too much inconvenience. He also thinks that the change is unlikely to open up a DOS vector as it would be hard to pull off on a large scale. Jim suggests adding the idea to the brainstorming section of the wiki, but notes that he does not have access to add to it himself.</summary>
