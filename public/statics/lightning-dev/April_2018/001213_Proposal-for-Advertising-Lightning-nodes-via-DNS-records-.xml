    <summary>The writer proposes a twofold system for utilizing the blockchain layer for verification and the gossip overlay for censorship resistance. The design uses P2WSH, ensuring that 51% miners cannot censor Numerifide's commands. The gossip overlay network provides censorship resistance and reveals preimage of the P2WSH after it has been confirmed on-chain. Further, the writer mentions that the design requires a separate method of communicating bindings and not being censored. The design also reduces the blockchain footprint, which reduces the amount given to miners and increases what can be put into command bids. Finally, the writer suggests that any proposal needs to have some data crunched and that constraints would necessitate other avenues if only 100 users per day filled up blocks.</summary>
