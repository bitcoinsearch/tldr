    <summary>A discussion took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding the QR code format for node ID at IP:port. Robert Olsson initiated the conversation by stating that eclair only supports hex format at IP:port and suggested using Bech32 nodeid to keep the QR small. He proposed a format, lightning:ln1bech32nodeid/ipnumber/port, where /port is optional if port is 9735. He also mentioned that encoding IP and port number in Bech32 could be another approach. In response, Igor Cota stated that not using hex would save 33 bytes and he intends to support both approaches. If there are 33 bytes before '@', it's raw, and if it's 66, it's hex.</summary>
