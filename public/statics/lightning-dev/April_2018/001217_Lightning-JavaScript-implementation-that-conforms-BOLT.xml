    <title>Lightning JavaScript implementation that conforms BOLT</title>

    <summary>The writer is seeking a way to run a Lightning Network node within a browser, and is looking for suggestions on how to do so. They mention the possibility of implementing BOLT protocol in JS, but are searching for an easier method. The writer asks if anyone has had success compiling the c-lightning project under WebAssembly, which is a C/C++ compiler that can be used to create browser-compatible byte-code. While there are some obstacles to this due to certain functions that c-lighting uses, such as sockets, there are wrappers available for many C-functions through Emscripten lib. The writer is asking for advice on what to look for when trying to run this and is requesting general feedback on the idea.</summary>
