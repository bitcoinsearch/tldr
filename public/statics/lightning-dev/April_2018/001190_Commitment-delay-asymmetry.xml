    <summary>In this context, the writer is discussing the delay involved in their branch and how they can get money immediately without it being revoked. They mention receiving 1.0BTC and 0.99BTC worth of Daniel products. The writer clarifies that the side unilaterally closing the channel would always have to wait for the full delay to allow time for revoke transactions to be broadcast. However, they suggest applying a delay on the remote output based on the balance distribution to avoid a misbehaving node from unilaterally closing channels where it has little or no balance, thereby locking up the funds of the remote node at virtually no cost to itself. The delay on the remote output would scale from zero delay up to the same delay as the side unilaterally closing the channel, which would improve the situation.</summary>
