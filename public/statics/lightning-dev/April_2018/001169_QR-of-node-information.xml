    <summary>In a forum, Robert Olsson has posted a query about not being able to find a bolt regarding the QR code of node at ip:port. He has stated that eclair only supports the format hex at ip:port format and he has not tried any other mobile wallets. Rusty, in response to this, has shared his anticipation of moving away from "manually connect to node" and suggested coming up with a bech32 'ln1' encoding, which would be 62 chars vs 66 if his math is correct.</summary>
