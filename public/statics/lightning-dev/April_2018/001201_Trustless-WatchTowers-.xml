    <summary>The discussion between Conner Fromknecht and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the implementation of a watchtower feature that detects the case in which the second-level transactions have already been spent, and then forgoes sweeping them entirely (on the assumption that it has already been done by a watchtower). They also discuss how spending commitment outputs independently can resolve issues with an attacker possibly choosing sets of outputs that the watchtower cannot act on. The discussion includes technical details about the confirmation of second-level HTLC transactions being separated by arbitrary delays and the need to separate the commitment outpoints from the HTLC outpoints. The conversation concludes with the agreement that this approach is a reasonable compromise for the tradeoffs at hand and could serve as an initial iteration due to its simplicity.</summary>
