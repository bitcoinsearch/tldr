    <summary>In an email conversation between Tyler and ZmnSCPxj, the latter clarifies that a BOLT does not replace bootstrapping seed functionality for Bitcoin lightning network. ZmnSCPxj explains that a client can supplement their view of the network by getting the graph from well-known nodes if they wish but no more as it would centralize the network to an uncomfortable degree. Tyler then expresses concern about how risk is managed when public and private nodes are owned by the same entity. ZmnSCPxj responds by breaking down a scenario where B and C are owned by the same economic entity and compares the risk involved in situations where funds sit on public nodes versus those where they sit on both public and private nodes. From a risk perspective, it appears better to use a public node directly than both public and private nodes. Alternatively, one could contract an external party to run a public node in exchange for higher feerates to the private node.</summary>
