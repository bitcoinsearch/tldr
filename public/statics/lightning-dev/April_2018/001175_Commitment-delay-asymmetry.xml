    <summary>In a written statement, Jim Posen suggests that analyzing game theory is easier if the to_remote output is also time-locked by the to_remote_delay. This action makes the consequences of an on-chain settlement symmetric, shifting the game from chicken to a tragedy of the commons. Posen wonders how others perceive this matter. The move increases incentive to mutual close and appears fair because A informs B what the delay is, thus having A subject to it too is reasonable. On the same note, both sides should use the maximum delay either one asks for. Although not urgent, Posen requests the idea be added to the brainstorming section of the wiki so that it doesn't get lost.</summary>
