    <summary>Tyler H is working on finding a secure way to advertise human-understandable node names that retains the open and decentralized properties of Lightning technology and blockchain. He suggests two favorite approaches, including the Namecoin-style, which involves registering a name first-come-first-serve on a blockchain, but provides no protection against name squatting and attackers registering similar names. The second approach is the Web of Trust, where someone believes the pubkey corresponds to a name; however, this approach provides little to no protection against trusted parties lying to the user. Tyler hopes to find a solution soon.</summary>
