    <summary>In response to Alejandro's question about whether channel balance of each peer on the Lightning Network is revealed on node gossip, ZmnSCPxj replied that it is not. He suggested logically inverting the question and considering if one would want their spending/receiving information on each channel reported to the network and how much they own on Lightning to be reported to everyone. Since the balance on each peer effectively represents the amount of money each peer owns on that channel and any changes in balance represent send/receive on that channel, it is not desirable to report balance or changes in balance to the entire network. Furthermore, one should not expect to receive such updates from anyone else either. Alejandro then asked how payment routes are discovered in real-life implementations like c-lightning and whether it is possible for a sender to discover capacities in each path by probing since the sender can interrupt any payment by not revealing the secret.</summary>
