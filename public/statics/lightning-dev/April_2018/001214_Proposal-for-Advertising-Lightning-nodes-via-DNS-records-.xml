    <summary>This is a discussion between Tyler and ZmnSCPxj regarding the use of blockchain for verification and gossip overlay for censorship resistance. They discuss the benefits of using a standard that uses mappings in a sane way, which would be beneficial for decentralized, human-readable trust. They also talk about the economic incentive for every node to store and gossip the Numerifides mappings and how it could be saved on a best-effort basis, but this would make troubleshooting lookups problematic. ZmnSCPxj explains the design of using the blockchain layer for verification and the gossip overlay for censorship resistance. The design uses P2WSH, so 51% miners cannot censor Numerifides commands. Tyler suggests that reducing the blockchain footprint has real benefits of reducing the amount that gets given to miners and increasing what can be put into command bids anyway. They discuss the separate method of communicating bindings and not being censored, and the need for cooperation of a Bitcoin miner if the design requires publishing everything on-chain. They conclude that anything that gets seriously far along will need to have some data crunched and if only 100 users per day would fill up blocks then constraints would necessitate other avenues.</summary>
