    <summary>The Lightning Network is a payment protocol that aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Bitcoin. In commitment transactions, there is a time-locked to_local output with OP_CSV and a simple P2WPKH to_remote output. However, this creates an incentive for one party to force a unilateral close without penalty, while the other party is penalized. To address this issue and incentivize mutual closes, a proposal was made to implement a symmetric CSV delay for commitment transactions. This would require both parties to wait the same amount of time regardless of who publishes the commitment.Some concerns were raised about this change potentially opening up a DOS vector, but it was concluded that this is not much of a concern. Another discussion suggested scaling the delay on the other side according to the balance of the channel, but the effectiveness of this was questioned. The conversation ended with the idea of letting attackers have immediate access to their funds, which would not affect honest nodes that are truly offline.Participants in the Lightning-dev mailing list debated the merits of symmetric versus asymmetric delays in commitment transactions, but no consensus was reached on the best approach. ZmnSCPxj proposed making the symmetry of coins locked and duration of lock equal on both sides of the commitment transaction. He then sent 0.99BTC to Daniel for 0.99BTC worth of Daniel products and published his original revoked commitment transaction, allowing him to receive the money immediately without Daniel being able to revoke it.Jim Posen suggested analyzing game theory in such situations where the to_remote output should also be time-locked by the to_remote_delay, and both sides should use the maximum delay either one asks for. Rusty agreed with Jim's suggestion and requested to put it into the brainstorming part of the wiki so that it does not get lost.</summary>
