    <summary>The author of the email is seeking advice from other Lightning Network (LN) implementations - lnd, eclair, ucoin and lit - regarding a potential issue while implementing support for 'r' field in invoices. The problem arises when creating invoices with 'r' fields which require knowing what onLightning fees the other side of an unpublished channel wants to charge. Since the sender cannot use their own fees as they would apply only if they were forwarding to the other side, the solution proposed is to send a 'channel_update' as soon as the channel is locked in. This behavior could be standardized regardless of published/unpublished state, and software not expecting this behavior will simply drop the 'channel_update'. The author also seeks advice on the intended way to get onLightning fee rates to put into invoice 'r' fields for private routes.</summary>
