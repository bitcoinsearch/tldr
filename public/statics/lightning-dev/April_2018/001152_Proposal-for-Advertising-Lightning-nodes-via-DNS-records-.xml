    <summary>The email conversation discusses the use of external parties for Bitcoin transactions while maintaining privacy. It is suggested that "private" channels should not be used as they leak economic information. Instead, "published" and "unpublished" channels should be used, with the latter being warned to leak economic information. However, contracting multiple external parties still leaks economic activity, and using multiple public nodes with different software could be a better option. Multiple public nodes can be used for load distribution, with a published channel between them that is larger than normal. However, it is advised not to make one node trust the other completely.</summary>
