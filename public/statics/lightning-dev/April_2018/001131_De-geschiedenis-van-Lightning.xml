    <summary>On 3rd April 2018, Aaron van Wirdum, a writer, sent an email to Corné on the Lightning-dev list requesting for information about Amiko Pay. He was writing a detailed article about the history of the Lightning Network which included predecessors of Lightning and wanted to add a paragraph about Amiko Pay. In his email, he asked Corné if Amiko Pay resembled the concept described in the Lightning Network white paper and also requested information about its similarities and differences with Ripple. He also asked for suggestions of old proposals, concepts, or ideas that have played a role in the history of Lightning and/or Amiko Pay. The deadline for this article was the next day, and although most of the article was finished, there were still some gaps that needed to be filled, such as the Amiko Pay part. Aaron hoped to receive a response from Corné soon and could be contacted on IRC.</summary>
