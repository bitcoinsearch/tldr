    <summary>In an email conversation between Tyler and ZmnSCPxj, Tyler expressed his understanding of the trilemma that needs to be solved in order to implement something suitable for Lightning. He also mentioned that he has pulled his support for his proposal and insists that the proposal should only be a convention at most, but not a standard, and nodes should not trust DNS.ZmnSCPxj replied with optimism about finding a solution for securely advertising human-understandable node names while retaining the open, decentralized properties of the technology and underlying blockchains. However, he acknowledged the issue of Zooko's Triangle which states that decentralized, secure, and human-meaningful cannot all be achieved at the same time. Node pubkeys are decentralized and secure, while node aliases are decentralized and human-meaningful. On the other hand, DNS is secure and human-meaningful but centralized around ICANN.ZmnSCPxj suggested that maybe a DNS-like system could be developed for Lightning that would be decentralized and secure, while still allowing for human-meaningful names.</summary>
