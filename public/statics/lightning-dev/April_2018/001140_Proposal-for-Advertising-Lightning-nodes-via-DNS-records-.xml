    <summary>Tyler and Robert Olsson have proposed an additional BOLT, tentatively scheduled to be BOLT 12, to allow operators of domain names to create SRV records for their nodes. The proposal aims to make it easier for end-users to connect to nodes with enough liquidity to pay every merchant and find the merchant node in a reasonably sane way to open a channel to them for payments. At present, people find nodes in other people's visualizers and pass node aliases around via word of mouth, which is prone to inaccuracy and MITM attacks. Alternatively, one can make a payment, decode the payment request, find the node on the graph and attempt to open a channel to the merchant, but this only works if the destination is advertising addresses.The proposed solution would enable users to say "connect to a Blockstream.com node" and independently look up that domain, find advertised nodes and connect/open channels. This would also improve security from the perspective of nodes masquerading as other nodes, as anyone with a domain can authoritatively list their nodes. Furthermore, domain operators could provide subdomains for their node addresses to distinguish between nodes intended for a specific purpose, from a human perspective.Tyler and Robert Olsson have created a draft of what the RFC could look like and are seeking feedback on the proposal.</summary>
