    <summary>In this context, ZmnSCPxj discusses the problem of securely advertising human-understandable node names in Lightning technology while retaining its decentralized properties. This issue is related to Zooko's Triangle, which states that it is difficult to achieve three properties - Decentralized, Secure, and Human-meaningful - at the same time. Node pubkeys are both Decentralized and Secure, but not Human-meaningful for an average person. Node aliases are Decentralized and Human-meaningful, but not Secure. DNS, on the other hand, is Secure and Human-meaningful, but centralized around ICANN. ZmnSCPxj suggests using a DNS-like system for Lightning technology that is decentralized and secure while allowing for human-readable node names.</summary>
