    <summary>The proposed BOLT is not intended to replace bootstrapping seed functionality. Instead, it would give users the ability to more easily open channels to the node they intend to by giving node operators a way to advertise their nodes. The plan is that you connect (but NOT make a channel with) a known fixed node with known high uptime, then the autopilot downloads the entire network map, then connects and creates channels to nodes from the map. This functionality could be used by mobile wallets to accept a domain parameter to specify an initial node to open a user's first channel. The risk management of public and private nodes owned by the same entity is uncertain. If the public-facing node gets hacked, it cannot draw funds from the private node, only send them out to the attacker on the network or close the channels and send the funds + wallet balance to an on-chain address. The "warm" funds in this scenario sit on the C side of the B -&gt; C channel. While it may be possible for a single entity to use this to manage its own risk, it is likely that "hubs" will arise who take on the risk of being a public node with possibly large amounts of money in their channels and create private channels to their clients.</summary>
