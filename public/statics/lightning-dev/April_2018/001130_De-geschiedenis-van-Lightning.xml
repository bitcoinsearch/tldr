    <summary>Aaron van Wirdum is writing an extensive article on the history of the Lightning Network and is seeking information about Amiko Pay, a predecessor to the network. He found some older documents but hopes that Corné Plooy can provide additional insight into how similar Amiko Pay was to the concept described in the Lightning Network white paper and how it compared to Ripple. He's also looking for any other old proposals, concepts or ideas that played a role in the history of Lightning and/or Amiko Pay. The deadline for the article is tomorrow, and Aaron hopes to hear from Corné soon, although he has already written most of the article except for the section on Amiko Pay.</summary>
