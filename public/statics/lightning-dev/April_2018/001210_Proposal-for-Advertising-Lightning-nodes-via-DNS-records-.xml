    <summary>In this context, Tyler is discussing the appropriate opcode to be used for a relative time lock in Bitcoin script. ZmnSCPxj questions whether Tyler's proposed script works as a check proof-of-work script and clarifies that OP_CheckLockTimeVerify is for absolute time, not relative time. ZmnSCPxj also questions why blockheight 52560 was chosen and suggests that locking funds for a time may be enough without pulling in proof-of-work. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj shares their half-baked ideas for proof-of-mainstake which uses locking funds in the mainchain as voting rights for correctness of the sidechain.</summary>
