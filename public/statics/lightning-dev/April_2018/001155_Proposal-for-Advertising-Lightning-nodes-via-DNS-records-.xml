    <summary>Tyler has decided to pull his support for implementing the proposed BOLT which concerns opening appropriate channels. The primary issue with this proposal is that DNS in its current form cannot be trusted as part of the Lightning spec. Tyler does not discourage thoughtful implementation of functionality like this but does caution any implementation to properly inform the user as to the inherent risk in trusting DNS and only use DNS records as a way to increase confidence, not make guarantees that a node is associated with the domain it says it is. Tyler hopes to find a solution that retains the open, decentralized properties of the technology and the underlying blockchains. ZmnSCPxj expresses concern over the idea of contracting out to external parties and suggests multiple public nodes instead for load distribution. They caution against the use of "private" channels and suggest the terms "published" and "unpublished" channels instead. Multiple public nodes could be useful for load distribution, and implementation diversity could be used to decrease the probability of 0days affecting all nodes simultaneously. A published channel between two public nodes could allow customers to use a channel to one node to pay an invoice made by the other when all other published channels to that node are depleted. However, in terms of hackability, it is not advisable to make one node trust the other. Other discussions regarding public vs private nodes and channel structures are encouraged.</summary>
