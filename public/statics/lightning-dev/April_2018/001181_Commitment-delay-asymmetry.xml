    <summary>The proposal suggests that both parties should use the maximum delay if either one asks for it. However, the issue can be resolved by making sure that both parties have to wait the same amount of time regardless of who publishes the commitment. The suggestion is to add a new section called "Symmetric CSV Delay" to the brainstorming part of the wiki. This would require the full CSV delay on the remote output of all commitment transactions and act as an incentive for both parties to mutually close rather than waiting for the other side to close unilaterally. It would also serve as punishment to misbehaving or unresponsive nodes that force the other endpoint to go to chain.</summary>
