    <summary>In an email exchange, Lloyd Fournier raised two points regarding seed-based peer rediscovery. Firstly, it is not easy to determine whether the process works or not. Secondly, he argued that this method is incompatible with covert recovery schemes. Dave responded by saying that he believes encrypted backups are fully compatible with covert recovery and apologized for not realizing compatibility was one of the design goals. Dave also suggested that nodes using the backup commons would download some number of backups each time they are restarted as a way of testing that backups are being stored faithfully and providing cover for cases where a node does lose data. The email exchange ended with Dave's signature attachment.</summary>
