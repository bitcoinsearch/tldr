    <summary>The email conversation between Lee and LL delves into the privacy challenges associated with lightning. LL provides insights into identifying the node that funded a lightning channel and determining the owner of the channel close output, which depends on whether private channels are used exclusively or not. LL suggests a solution to turn lightning into an effective layer-1 privacy tool in the "Removing cross-layer links" problem on bitcoin-problems.github.io. The conversation moves to the possibility of determining which input came from whom during channel opening.The discussion revolves around the privacy challenges for lightning and whether it is possible to identify who owns which channel output. The answer depends on whether a user exclusively uses private channels or not. If a node has a mix of published and unpublished channels, then it is usually possible to look at a closed unpublished node and determine which output belongs to that node. On the other hand, using CoinSwapper can provide some privacy but requires a user to never use the output from mutual close.The poster wonders if someone could mix their bitcoin by such activity of opening and closing private channels to random nodes after sending some amount to their other channels, or maybe using reverse submarine swap before closing. Depending on the answers to the questions raised, Lightning Network could be used as a fancy payjoin network by mixing the cluster of the poster's coin history with users of their nodes, along with that of the nodes they open and close channels to. The context also includes links to relevant resources to support the discussion.</summary>
