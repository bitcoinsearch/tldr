    <summary>Jasan, a member of the lightning-dev list, has proposed a new feature for YAELBOT that will allow the bot to have its own private keys to keep track of balances with other parties. This implementation would involve an LN node extension and does not require the use of real Bitcoin keys. The keys will be completely offline and owned by humans who set up the channel. Jasan's proposal is described in detail in a comment posted on GitHub and he is requesting feedback from the community. He also encourages individuals to refer to any similar proposals from the past.</summary>
