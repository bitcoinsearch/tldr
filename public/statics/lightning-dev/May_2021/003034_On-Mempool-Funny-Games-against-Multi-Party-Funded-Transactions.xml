    <summary>In an email conversation between Antoine Riard and Jasan, DoS attacks against multi-party Bitcoin protocols during their funding phases were highlighted. The issue of timevalue DoS/fee inflation was noted as common in any multi-party funded transactions, with uncertainty surrounding how well developers are aware of and mitigate against them. Jasan reported experiencing a crash in their C-Lightning node after attempting to open a dual-funded channel two days prior, and provided logs on GitHub that may be related to the mentioned DoS attack. They offered to provide further details if necessary.</summary>
