    <summary>In an email exchange between David A. Harding and LL, the former proposed that a message be signed and gossiped across the network to close a channel with a specific node ID. While LL acknowledged the potential benefits of this approach for users, including closing a channel quickly, there are several downsides to it. Firstly, it creates a new gossip message that can be spammed. Secondly, it is difficult to determine whether the message was successful or not if the person at the other end of the channel is offline. Finally, this approach is incompatible with covert recovery schemes such as what is proposed in [1]. LL also noted that going around looking for backups, which is another recovery method, could potentially result in revealing one's recovery status to everyone.</summary>
