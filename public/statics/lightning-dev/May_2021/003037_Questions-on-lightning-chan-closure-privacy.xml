    <summary>The discussion revolves around the privacy challenges for lightning and whether it is possible to identify who owns which channel output. The answer depends on whether a user exclusively uses private channels or not. If a node has a mix of published and unpublished channels, then it is usually possible to look at a closed unpublished node and determine which output belongs to that node. On the other hand, using CoinSwapper can provide some privacy but requires a user to never use the output from mutual close.</summary>
