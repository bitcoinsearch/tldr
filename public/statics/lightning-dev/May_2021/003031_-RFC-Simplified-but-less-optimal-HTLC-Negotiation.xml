    <summary>On April 27, 2021, Rusty Russell added a draft to Github for the lightning-rfc pull #867. The implementation will require update_fee messages to be on their own, which will eliminate any debate on the channel's state when applied. Matt Corallo expressed his liking of this requirement. Russell suggests that if they do not do turns for splicing, they can make rules around pausing other HTLC updates generic for future use and use them for update_fee in a simpler-to-make-compulsory change. This is similar to the close requirement, except that it requires all HTLCs to be absent.</summary>
