    <summary>In an email conversation regarding the revocation of channel commitment transactions with op_checksigfromstack(msg, sig, key) and signed sequence commitments, ZmnSCPxj suggests obfuscating the initial 'n=0' with a pre-negotiated m and applying some kind of deterministic step to this obscured initial state number. This ensures comparison of sequence numbers while obscuring the number of updates. In response to James Chiang's inquiry about how sequence number n is committed to the nth commitment tx and accessible on-stack during script evaluation, Johnson Lao's and Roasbeef's Talk from Scaling Bitcoin at Stanford is referred to.</summary>
