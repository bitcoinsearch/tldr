    <summary>Rusty Russell has taken a snapshot of their gossip store two weeks ago, which stores all gossip in order. There are around 5100 timestamp-only updates less than a week apart and most of the updates seen two weeks ago were refreshes, not spam. Fabrice Drouin added additional information on channel_update traffic and mentioned that the majority of channels receive at least one update every day. It could be caused by "flapping" channels, probably because the hosts that are hosting them are not reliable. Heuristics can be used to improve traffic, but it is orthogonal to the problem of improving their current sync protocol. Rusty suggested ratelimiting their own enables to one per 120 seconds to avoid corner cases that penalize flapping channels, which might lead to nodes discarding channels as stale because they do not get new updates when they reconnect.</summary>
