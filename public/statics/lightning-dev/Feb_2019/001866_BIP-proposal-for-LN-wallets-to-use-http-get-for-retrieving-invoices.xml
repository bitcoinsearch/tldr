    <summary>A proposal has been made for a "general guideline" BIP for bitcoin Lightning Network wallets to perform an HTTP GET request to retrieve an invoice. The proposal aims to address some development limitations in LN, including the lack of static QRs and the large size of invoices. The wallets would only expect to receive an LN invoice from the GET request. The proposal could lead to cost-effective micro transaction scenarios by printing QRs rather than relying on refreshable displays. Developers could also export complex functionality to their web server and discover use cases that inform protocol development. There may also be possible security benefits to having an airgap between the merchant node and user. The measure is temporary as many enabling features will likely be added natively into LN. Wallet developers have shown interest in the proposal, and a working example using Eclair has been created from the New York LN hackday. The author of the proposal is asking whether it makes sense to pen the guideline as a BIP.</summary>
