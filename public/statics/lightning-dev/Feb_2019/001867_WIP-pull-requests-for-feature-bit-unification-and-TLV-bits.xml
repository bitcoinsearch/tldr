    <summary>Rusty has made some changes to the feature bits of Lightning Network and has written about it on Github. The changes include renaming "local/global" to "peer/channel", sending both in node_announcement, and sending channel in channel_announcement. Rusty has also assigned all the 1.1 bits from the wiki. In addition, he has started working on defining switch_chain, switch_ephkey, and multi_part_payment for TLVs. He has added a `9` field to BOLT11 to flag base amp, OG amp, and more.</summary>
