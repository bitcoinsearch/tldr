    <summary>The Lightning Network (LN) has been discussed in a message thread as a possible addition to any cryptocurrency system. It is suggested that this can be done as long as the system supports a set of minimum functionalities such as multisignatures, hashlocks, and timelocks. The Decker-Russell-Osuntokun payment channel requires an additional functionality called `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`. Fulgurite is working on using a multiparticipant payment channel to instantiate other payment channels.Running LN on top of a plasma chain instead of the main chain was proposed by CD in a group discussion. This would create a plasma layer-2 solution and LN layer-3 solution, which could be beneficial in the long-term future. A "full node" containing at least one plasma chain and LN alongside the main chain could eliminate the need for SPV or neutrino. While theoretically possible, defining the necessary messages, making the system extensible, and ensuring compatibility with the existing LN spec are considered challenging tasks.</summary>
