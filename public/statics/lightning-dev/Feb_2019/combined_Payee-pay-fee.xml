    <summary>In the context, a discussion has been raised regarding Lightning Network (LN) transactions where the payee pays the fee instead of the payer. Cezary Dziemian asks if there are any plans to offer a payment solution where the payee pays the fee instead of the payer, which is not ideal for services such as exchanges. Rusty Russell suggests creating new URI schemes to facilitate the payment process for recurring payments, which includes the development of a new message type to route these requests through the lightning network in order to provide an automated payment mechanism.ZmnSCPxj and Rusty discuss the need for a web way for clients to send invoices or offers over HTTPS and how it would work. They suggest that offers can work over LN alone and explain the process involved. However, ZmnSCPxj raises a concern about how the payee will know to give the BOLT12 offer to the payer. They both agree that it may be better to use a real message format instead of a fake payment.The email thread discusses the issue of withdrawing funds from a service in the Lightning Network (LN), where the payer bears the cost of the transaction fees. ZmnSCPxj suggests that the payee provides one or more complete paths from the payer to the payee node, which will be provided as fully encrypted onions to the payer, providing benefits such as improved privacy and fairness in fee calculation. There is no spec yet, but ZmnSCPxj suggests that someone can pick up this issue and continue its development. The proposal suggests making payments on the Lightning Network to stay within invoice limits, where payees provide a fee limit along with an invoice and payers find a route that does not exceed the limit before paying the invoice. The proposal also suggests adding a new `withdrawn_amount` tag in BOLT11 that signals that the service performing the payment should not spend more than the specified amount and should only deduct the amount released by the service (including fees) from the user account.Overall, the discussions highlight the need for a better payment solution in the Lightning Network (LN) where payees can bear transaction fees, the development of new message types and URI schemes to facilitate automated payments, and the use of fully encrypted onions to improve privacy and fairness in fee calculation.</summary>
