    <summary>Joao Joyce had previously asked about the possibility of identifying users across multiple payments, which was deemed a bad idea. ZmnSCPxj suggested that for proving payments, services could ask for the preimage of an invoice that was already paid. Joao Joyce inquired about standardizing payment invoices to signal wallets to skip the payment process if they can provide the service with a preimage for a previous payment for that particular item. This would have use cases beyond simple downloads such as paying for 30 days of a service and every time you want to access it, scan the LN invoice. C-Lightning already has this feature where if given an invoice for a payment hash it already knows, it silently succeeds and returns the preimage without sending out any money, which should extend to any wallets built on top of C-Lightning. It is unclear what other implementations do.</summary>
