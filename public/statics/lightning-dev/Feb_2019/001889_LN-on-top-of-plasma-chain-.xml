    <summary>The possibility of running the Lightning Network (LN) on any cryptocurrency system, including plasma chain, has been discussed in a message thread. It has been suggested that LN can be built on any cryptocurrency system, as long as it supports a minimum set of functionalities, such as multisignatures, hashlocks, and timelocks. The Decker-Russell-Osuntokun payment channel requires an additional functionality called `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`. The key insight is that a multiparticipant payment channel can be used to instantiate other payment channels, and this effort is being undertaken by Fulgurite. While theoretically possible, the hard part is defining what messages are needed, making the system extensible, and ensuring compatibility with the existing LN spec. In the future, having a "full node" containing main chain, at least one plasma chain, and LN installed on mobile phones could eliminate the need for SPV or neutrino.</summary>
