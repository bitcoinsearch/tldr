    <summary>The discussion thread revolves around the missing piece of information on how the payee would know to give the Bolt12 offer to the payer. Payer is a service and payee is a user in this context. An HTTPS PUT or POST request, with the payer providing the HTTPS server might be used for this purpose. However, a real message format will be nicer and less overhead for everyone. The intermediate nodes do not require upgrades as they remain unaware of this new feature. Using Single-Use-Receivable-BoLs (SURBs) can also be considered as an alternative solution. Rolling out a new feature that must be "sufficiently universal" is still plausible given the early stage.</summary>
