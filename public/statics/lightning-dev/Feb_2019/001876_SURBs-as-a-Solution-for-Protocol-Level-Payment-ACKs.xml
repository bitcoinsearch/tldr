    <summary>Rusty Russell, a well-known Bitcoin Lightning Network developer, has suggested using single-use-reply-blocks (SURBs) to implement a "payment ACK" for each sent HTLC. Currently, HTLC routing is mainly a game of "send and hope it arrives", as there is no clear indication of the arrival of an HTLC at the destination. The payment ACK feature would allow the sender to know when a payment has reached the receiver and help AMP implementations by allowing them to receive feedback on successfully routed splits. It would also help in enforcing and relying on acknowledgments, which may thwart silly games receivers might play, claiming that the HTLC "didn't actually arrive". In the long run, Rusty suggests that something needs to be done about this issue, and HORNET could be used as a solution to address soft errors.</summary>
