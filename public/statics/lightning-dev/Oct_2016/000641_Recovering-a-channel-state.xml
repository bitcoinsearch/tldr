    <summary>Anton Kumaigorodskiy, a member of the Rusty Russell team, suggests that it is important to account for the possibility of mobile devices getting lost, stolen, or data erased. He believes that there should be a way to recover the channel or at least break it unilaterally on a new device. While this topic was deferred for 1.0, it is important to discuss. Assuming you still have your ID, if you lose that key, you're out of luck.Tadge has done a lot of work on outsourcing vigilance, which involves uploading encrypted information to watchers. This can almost reconstruct the current state sufficient to mutually close the channel. There's an interesting subset of this which can be done with peers. Each peer would keep some amount of encrypted data for you and always send it to you whenever you first connect. As long as one peer is honest, you get enough state to cleanly shut down the other peers without getting robbed. However, there is still a lot more work to be done in enumerating exactly how this works. The idea of having peers exchange encrypted data to help each other recover channels could be useful in situations where mobile devices are lost or stolen.</summary>
