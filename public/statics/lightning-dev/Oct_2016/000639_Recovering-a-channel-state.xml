    <summary>The author is considering the issue of mobile devices being lost or stolen and how to recover data or break channels unilaterally on a new device. The first solution proposed is the ability to do a unilateral close, with essential parameters recorded on a server for later retrieval. However, fully recovering a latest channel state seems tricky as it requires trusting a server to never provide an outdated snapshot. The author proposes directly asking the counterparty to provide the latest channel state, but there is no way to check if the snapshot is unrevoked without involving trust. The author seeks feedback on whether it is possible to obtain a latest channel snapshot from the counterparty in a trustless manner or if unilateral close is a better option.</summary>
