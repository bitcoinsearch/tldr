    <summary>When it comes to mobile Lightning Network wallets, there are several reasons why supporting only a single payment channel could be beneficial. Firstly, the majority of LN nodes on mobile devices will likely be offline 99% of the time, making them ineffective in relaying payments. Additionally, if a portion of funds becomes locked in HTLC, it may not be in the user's best interest, especially if the lock lasts for hours. Secondly, one channel with 1 BTC is better than two 0.5 BTC channels because the end user can receive and send larger amounts. Lastly, having a single payment channel improves user experience and simplifies the user interface, making it easier for adoption. Currently, Anton's plan for his Android LN wallet is to support only a single payment channel, but he is open to feedback if there are any important factors he may have missed.</summary>
