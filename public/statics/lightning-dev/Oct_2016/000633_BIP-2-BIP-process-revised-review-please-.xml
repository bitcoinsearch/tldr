    <summary>BIP 2 is being considered as the final draft to replace BIP 1 in specifying how the entire BIP process works. The Process BIP will need rough consensus from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to become active. The absence of a clear process defined in BIP 1 has led to the intention of using BIP 2 for its own activation procedure. Any objections to the new BIP process as specified in BIP 2 should be raised immediately. The link to BIP 2 can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki. Luke expresses his gratitude for the review.</summary>
