    <summary>In an email thread, gb noticed that lightningd is using port 8334 and namecoind has used port 8334 since it was launched in May 2011. Christian Decker replied stating that it is mostly a coincidence as the implementation will bind to a random port by default, but Rusty fixed the port to 8334 to make the server easier to find. The email thread also included a blog post describing the recent use of a v0.5 C lightning prototype, showcasing a completed transaction that included invoicing, multi-hop payment, and item delivery. The post contained additional content and supporting code, as well as a short video. The Lightning micropayment system was tested by creating invoices for test Bitcoin payments over the Lightning network and offering an ASCII cat picture in return. Dr. Christian Decker purchased the picture using 0.01 test Bitcoin to open a Lightning channel with the server. After a single confirmation, he paid the invoice with a 100 satoshi transfer. Accessing the link, he discovered it was an ASCII picture, with a nice bonus. Two cats! Christian promptly opened another node, connected to the first node and bought a second copy of the cat picture by routing through the previous node. The Digital Ocean server runs Apache, bitcoind, and lightningd. A CGI script calls 'lightning-cli invoice 100000' to create an invoice, which is presented to the user. If 'lightning-cli listinvoice' indicates that the invoice was paid, the script presents the picture. This is the first end-to-end test of a Lightning micropayment network, including invoicing, multi-hop payment, and item delivery.</summary>
