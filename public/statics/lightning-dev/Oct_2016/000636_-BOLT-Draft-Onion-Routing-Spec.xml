    <summary>Christian Decker provided an update on the status of the project to swap out EC-DSA for EC-Schnorr. During a meetup in Milan, it was decided to drop the end-to-end payload as there is currently no good use case for it. The shared secret backlog remains in the spec, but committing routing information to the payment hash is awkward. This is because if the payment hash is included in each per-hop payload, it would increase the size of the payload. Alternatively, if it is added to the last per-hop payload, only the last hop would be able to identify a replay attack. Both the C-lightning and lnd implementations have been adapted and can be used. There was also discussion about rotating onion keys for security purposes.</summary>
