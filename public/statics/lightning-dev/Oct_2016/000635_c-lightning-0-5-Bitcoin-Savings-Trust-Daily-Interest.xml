    <summary>A new release, version v0.5-2016-10-19, is now available on GitHub for the Lightning Network. This release contains various updates and features including IRC-based node and channel announcements, Sphinx-based onion for HTLC privacy, primitive helper scripts in contrib/, invoice support for receiving payments, and several minor fixes and cleanups. Additionally, this release allows users to buy a cat picture from a website that is running a lightning server on port 8334. Christian Decker contributed heavily to this release, but it predates the Milan spec, which will be the focus of version 0.6. The operation testnet has also been made more robust with this new release.</summary>
