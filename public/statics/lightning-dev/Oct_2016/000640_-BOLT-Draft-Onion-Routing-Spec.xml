    <summary>Olaoluwa Osuntokun, one of the contributors to the Lightning Network, has decided to put aside the shared secret backlog for now as he found it awkward to commit the routing information to the payment hash. This decision was made after Rusty Russell, another contributor to the Lightning Network, assumed that the packet format would not be modified to include the payment hash in either the header or e2e payload when they agreed to include the payment hash in the MAC check within the header. Both Olaoluwa and Rusty seem to have the same understanding regarding this matter.</summary>
