    <summary>The author of this post is an academic who has been studying the Lightning network. They did not participate in forming the network's vision, so they may say some nonsense. The post questions the benefits of sending cycle transactions to oneself to rebalance the network. There have been many discussions on this topic on the Lightning Network mailing list and other places online. Some have suggested a smart mechanism for rebalancing, such as Revive or Liquidity Network. However, it is unclear what benefits are gained from rebalancing. According to one source, the distribution of funds in channels does not affect network liquidity. Cheaper fees or shorter paths may be possible if the network remains balanced, but a smart fee strategy could also achieve these benefits. The post includes links to the Lightning Network mailing list, Reddit, and a Medium article summarizing the benefits of rebalancing.</summary>
