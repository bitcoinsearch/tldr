    <summary>In a discussion about Lightning implementations, Rene CC'd explained that virtual channels are used as a spam-prevention mechanism. However, this is only applicable for gossip messages that advertise public channels. Rene went on to list two things: firstly, BOLT-11 r fields can be used to advertise virtual and private channels, and secondly, the advertisement of existence of a channel does not require its use. Dmytro Piatkivskyi then raised an issue with source routing, citing an example where he trusts someone unconditionally, but does not have a channel with Bob, who Alice wants to send a satoshi to. He suggested advertising their trust as being a single node or introducing virtual channels to constantly figure out their respective balances.</summary>
