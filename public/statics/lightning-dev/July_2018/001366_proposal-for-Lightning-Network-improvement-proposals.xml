    <summary>Ren√© Pickhardt, a contributor to the Lightning Network, has proposed the creation of Lightning Network Improvement Proposals (LIPs) in a similar vein to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). He suggests that these proposals be placed in a new repository called lips within the github.com/lightning account, or within the lightning rfc repo. The purpose of this proposal is to have a centralized location for future enhancements for BOLT 1.1, the current Lightning Network protocol. Potential LIPs could include watchtowers, autopilot, AMP, splicing, routing protocols, broadcasting past routing statistics, eltoo, and more. Pickhardt plans to work on a LIP for splicing.</summary>
