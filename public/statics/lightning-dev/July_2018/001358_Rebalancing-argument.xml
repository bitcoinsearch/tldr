    <summary>The conversation started with a discussion on the need for active rebalancing in Lightning Network. A scenario was presented where channel balances were not maintained and resulted in routing failures, causing nodes to fight each other while charging fees to recoup losses. One participant argued that rebalancing is not necessary if nodes plan their send and receive activities based on available balances in channels. Another definition of equilibrium involves distributing available balance equally amongst channels owned by a node, which minimizes depleted channels. This definition is beneficial as it reduces the number of routing failures from failed HTLC forwarding. In a world post-AMP, passive rebalancing may not be necessary, but if a few sources/sinks dominate, channels may require more maintenance. The directionality of payment flows in the network also affects the necessity of active rebalancing. If payment flows are balanced, then passive rebalancing may not be required. However, if a few sources/sinks dominate, channels may regularly become biased requiring more maintenance.</summary>
