    <summary>In a discussion between Dmytro and Olaoluwa, Dmytro argued that worrying about equilibrium in the Lightning Network is unnecessary as there is no real proof that it improves the network. However, he notes that money being locked in channels is a major issue and the distribution of funds in channels should be dictated not by equilibrium but by nodes' plans to send and receive. Olaoluwa commented that active rebalancing may be necessary for nodes to be able to send/receive payments themselves, while passive rebalancing can be carried out independent of needing to send/receive payments to ensure an equilibrium state amongst the available balances of their channels. The directionality of payment flows in the network also plays a role in whether passive rebalancing is necessary. If payment flows are more or less balanced, then it's possible passive rebalancing isn't really necessary. Finally, Dmytro questions the purpose of rebalancing and suggests that a smart fee strategy might do the job instead.</summary>
