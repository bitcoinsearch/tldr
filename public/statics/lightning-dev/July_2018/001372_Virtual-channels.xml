    <summary>In a discussion about virtual channels in Lightning implementations, Rusty suggests that we can use the BOLT-11 'r' fields to advertise private or virtual channels. He also notes that an advertisement of a channel's existence does not require its use and that it is possible to transact without opening a channel by having a trust relationship. Dmytro Piatkivskyi brings up the idea of allowing heterogeneity in LN transactions, which would allow companies to transact with entities they have a trust relationship with. He gives an example where Alice wants to send a satoshi to Bob, but Dmytro doesn't have a channel with Bob. In this case, Dmytro trusts Rusty, who has a channel with Bob. Rusty suggests that source routing could be a problem but one solution could be advertising their trust as being a single node or introducing virtual channels to constantly figure out respective balances.</summary>
