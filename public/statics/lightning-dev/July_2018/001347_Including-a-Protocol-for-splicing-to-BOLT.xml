    <summary>The Lightning Network developer community is currently discussing the importance of splicing and AMP in the network. Rusty Russell, a prominent member, stated that while both are important, "multi-channel was a hack because splicing doesn't exist." He added that he wants to have his cake and eat it too, believing it's possible once Scnorr-Eltoonicorn arrives. Another developer, Christian Decker, agreed that multipath routing is a priority, but splicing is just as important for better UX, allowing users to ignore differences between on-chain and off-chain funds and showing only one balance for all use-cases. However, they also acknowledged that switching to dlog-based HTLCs will be a significant update and should not be underestimated.</summary>
