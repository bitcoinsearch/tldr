    <summary>In an email thread between Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd, the naming of a flag in Bitcoin's protocol was discussed. The original name, SIGHASH_REUSE_VULNERABLE, was deemed inadequate as it did not describe what the flag actually did. Maxwell suggested that making the signature replayable is equivalent to omitting the identification of the specific coin being spent from it. However, Todd pointed out that reuse could be a vulnerability in other ways, such as with hash-based signatures. They agreed to add a suffix or prefix to the term SIGHASH_NOINPUT, potentially calling it SIGHASH_NOINPUT_UNSAFE. Links to Todd's website and signature were provided in the email.</summary>
