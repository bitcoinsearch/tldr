    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, users debated the relative priorities of different features for the Lightning Network. One user noted that while they believed splicing was less important than Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP), they thought it was still essential to improving user experience. Splicing allows users to blend on-chain and off-chain funds seamlessly, displaying one balance for all use cases. Another user agreed that both splicing and AMP were necessary, but argued that multi-channel payments were only implemented as a hack due to the lack of splicing. They added that while AMP was important, it was a "nasty compromise" with current limitations. Finally, the user expressed hope that the upcoming Scnorr-Eltoonicorn update could provide a solution that allowed them to have their cake and eat it too.</summary>
