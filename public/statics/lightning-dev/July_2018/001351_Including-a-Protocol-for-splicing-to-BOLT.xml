    <summary>The discussion centers around the importance of ZKCP (Zero Knowledge Contingent Payment) in building a trustless off-to-on/on-to-offchain bridge. This is because ZKCPs allow LN endpoints to interact with the chain and create trustless swaps outside of Lightning. The interaction between the bridge and Lightning is through BOLT11 invoices, which provide the necessary ZKCP for a trustless bridge. Off/onchain bridges are important as they provide incoming channels, reloading spent channels, and unloading full channels. AMP enhances such a network, reducing the importance of maximum channel capacity when a ZKCP-providing AMP is available. Dual funded channels allow for immediate bi-directional transfers between endpoints, while splicing allows channels to contract or grow, as well as perform various actions such as paying out to on-chain addresses and creating fee inputs for eltoo. However, it is noted that some compromises may have to be made, but it is possible to roll out these technologies with less coordination than others, and they are not necessarily opposing constraints. Finally, the conversation touches on the topic of Schnorr-Eltoonicorn, a proposed upgrade that may capture the imagination of the community for years to come.</summary>
