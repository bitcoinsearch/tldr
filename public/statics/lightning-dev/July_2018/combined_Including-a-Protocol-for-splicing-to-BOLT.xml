    <summary>The Lightning Network development community is considering implementing splicing in the protocol to improve user experience and reduce differences between on-chain and off-chain funds. Splicing allows for the movement of funds between on-chain and off-chain channels without closing the channel. However, implementing this change will require low-level knowledge of Bitcoin, the protocol, and specific implementation details.Lightning Labs has started working on an async version of splicing, which could be included in BOLT 1.1, expected to be drafted later this year. The protocol change will need to include a generic message for both splice in and out, fully async splice in/out, and pre-announcement gossip messages.If included in BOLT 1.1, the splicing protocol could allow for channels to contract or grow, pay out to on-chain addresses, fund new channels on the fly, close into old channels, consolidate change addresses, create fee inputs for eltoo, orchestrate closing/opening coin-joins, and more. The splicing session would be initiated by the remote party and enable batching of operations.Some members of the Lightning Network community are working on splicing, while others are focused on improving the intelligence of the autopilot feature of the network. Many consider splicing a higher priority that should be formalized into the Lightning RFC.However, there are concerns about leaving out ZKCP, a building block in cryptocurrency that enables trustless off-to-on/on-to-offchain bridges. Without it, a trustless swap outside of Lightning becomes impossible. AMP enhances such a Lightning+bridge network, reducing the importance of maximum channel capacity. Still, one member has suggested they would rather leave out AMP and double-funding and splicing than remove ZKCP.</summary>
