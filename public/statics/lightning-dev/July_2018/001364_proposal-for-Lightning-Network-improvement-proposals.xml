    <summary>The proposal to start having LIPs (Lightning Network Improvement proposals) has been made in the tradition of BIPs. The LIPs should be placed on the github.com/lightning account in a repo called lips, or within the lightning rfc repo. A draft for LIP-0001, which describes the process and is 95% influenced by BIP-0002, has been created in a personal github repo with some open todos and questions. The background for this idea was that during a talk examining BOLT at the bitcoin munich meetup, it was realized that there are many ideas distributed within the community, but no central place to collect future enhancements for BOLT1.1. Having a list of LIPs in place before discussion in Australia could make the conversation more focused. Potential LIPs include watchtowers, autopilot, AMP, splicing, routing protocols, broadcasting past routing statistics, eltoo and more. The author, Rene Pickhardt, has volunteered to work on a LIP for Splicing (and has already started).</summary>
