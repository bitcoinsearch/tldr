    <summary>In a message dated July 2, 2018, Gregory Maxwell expressed his concern about the potential insecurity of the noinput feature in Bitcoin which could lead to replay attacks. He suggested that the formal name of the flag be changed to "SIGHASH_REPLAY_VULNERABLE" or "SIGHASH_WEAK_REPLAYABLE" to emphasize its vulnerability. However, Luke disagreed, stating that address reuse is undefined behavior and should not be assumed as safe or reliable. Furthermore, he stated his intention to use SIGHASH_NOINPUT for ordinary Bitcoin transactions in a wallet he is developing, which explicitly does not support address reuse.</summary>
