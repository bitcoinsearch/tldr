    <summary>The absence of channel capacity in the channel_announcement message is being questioned due to difficulties faced by mobile and light wallets in determining it. Currently, the only way to determine channel capacity is by checking the blockchain which is not feasible for these types of wallets. Furthermore, the data available on the blockchain is in the form of short_channel_id, which is incompatible with most block explorer APIs. As a result, not knowing the capacity of channels leads to low routing success rates, particularly for larger payments. This makes route-finding tools complex and dependent on various factors for fetching and parsing transactions. The author seeks to understand if there is a valid reason for this limitation or if it could be improved.</summary>
