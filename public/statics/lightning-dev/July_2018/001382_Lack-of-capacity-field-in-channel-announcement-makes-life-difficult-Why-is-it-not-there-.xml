    <summary>Christian Decker suggests that discussions about different proposals should be judged independently and not grouped together for convenience. He believes that the proposal about htlc_maximum_msat would not be controversial, but it should still have its own separate proposal and discussion. In addition to this, Rusty proposes adding an optional funding transaction and merkle proof to channel_announce or introducing a new channel_announce_with_proof message. He suggests that nodes could use a feature bit to indicate whether they want this or there could be a request/response for specific proofs. Rusty also suggests tunneling bitcoin block headers through the network, which would benefit lite nodes.</summary>
