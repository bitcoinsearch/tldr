    <summary>The email thread discusses the use of sighash_noinput in reducing the number of stored signatures. However, there is concern about the potential trade-off of privacy when using this method for watchtowers. The txid_half + encrypted blob model ensures that no information is learned about each state and how they relate unless a revocation must happen, but this method does not scale well. With the reuse of signatures for multiple states with sighash_noinput, there is a question of how to minimize information being disclosed to third parties. Rusty Russell responds by stating that a wallet should never create a SIGHASH_NOINPUT to spend its own UTXOs, as it is only useful for smart contracts with unique conditions such as lightning.</summary>
