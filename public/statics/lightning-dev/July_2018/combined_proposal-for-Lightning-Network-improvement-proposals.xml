    <summary>René Pickhardt, a member of the Bitcoin Munich Meetup group, proposed creating Lightning Network Improvement Proposals (LIPs) for future enhancements to BOLT 1.1. These LIPs could include features such as watchtowers, autopilot, AMP, splicing, routing protocols, broadcasting past routing statistics, eltoo, and more. The goal of having LIPs is to have a central place where ideas for future enhancements for BOLT 1.1 are collected, making discussions more focused. René volunteered to work on a LIP for Splicing.However, Olaoluwa Osuntokun pointed out that BOLTs already serve as the equivalent of improvement proposals, and new standardization documents are proposed initially as issues or PRs when ultimately accepted. The current process surrounding creating/modifying/drafting BOLT documents may need to be better documented and structured to ensure transparency for newcomers.During the discussion, Mr Hodlen expressed concerns about the assignment of values for types and feature bits and how new features can be tested without conflicting with other developers. He suggested an "Experimental Features Protocol" where experimental features can be tested using a unique identifier instead of centralized number assignment by the Lightning community.The Lightning Network's experiment message is a new feature that wraps up features within a unique feature name to avoid conflicting implementations. This message serves as a generic transport mechanism between any two lightning nodes who have agreed to support the `experiment_name_hash`. If the hash in the experiment message is 0, the payload will be treated as one of the following messages: `init_experiments` or `experiment_error`. The `init_experiments` message informs a peer of features supported by the client, while the `experiment_error` message provides additional debugging information related to the experimental feature being used.In conclusion, there were discussions about the best way to propose and test new features for Lightning Network and BOLT 1.1. While René Pickhardt proposed creating LIPs, Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested that BOLTs already serve as improvement proposals. Mr Hodlen suggested an "Experimental Features Protocol" to test new features using a unique identifier. The Lightning Network's experiment message serves as a generic transport mechanism for experimental features between nodes.</summary>
