    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list in a mailing list for developers. Orlovsky's post regarding a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol was not published despite receiving support from known community members. He accused the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, of abusing his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies, which must be applied on a non-selective basis.Orlovsky proposed several solutions including having a clear moderation policy, replacing Bishop with a new moderator who should be selected using the criteria “least votes against”, ensuring the role of the moderator(s) must be purely executive of the policies, without any personal preferences, creating a dedicated mail list (“bitcoin-dev-unmoderated”) which will publish all submissions without moderation, and making the incentive to work as a moderator reputation-based. Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. Bishop responded by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky should include the other tweets he sent for context. He also suspected that Orlovsky may be attributing malice to him because he asked him to stop tagging him on quantum woo. Bishop clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and is interested in hearing about it.</summary>
