    <summary>The Lightning Network, known for its ability to carry out global business and scale through fast and secure lightning payments, has been hailed as a great achievement. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has expressed his satisfaction with the network in an email dated June 3, 2023. He created a new lightning address, satoshi@vistomail.com, which he believes provides a comfortable way for humans to process transactions. Nakamoto praised the Lightning Network's ability to process more transactions per second than any other financial instrument, putting it light years ahead of traditional banking systems. He also reiterated that Bitcoin is a massive success and will continue to scale. However, concerns have arisen due to recent changes in ownership at Vistomail, where Nakamoto's lightning address is located. Some fear that scammers may use the domain to impersonate Nakamoto.Peter Todd has suggested blocking the entire Vistomail domain from the list in order to prevent potential fraud. Despite this concern, the Lightning Network remains a significant breakthrough in the world of global finance, and its ability to process transactions quickly and securely suggests that it will continue to play a major role in the future of digital currency.</summary>
