    <summary>Antoine Riard is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, financial system fragmentation that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic population, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from Africa. Antoine mentions that usually, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling. However, due to the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and "tropical weather," it is better to announce the event well in advance. He suggests having a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine welcomes any objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024 and emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability. He encourages action rather than mere talk in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine suggests surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could be suitable for hosting the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He invites Lightning Network developers to reach out and be part of the organization, considering it a great opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Bernard expresses interest in Antoine's proposal and intends to contact him regarding the organization of the summit.Overall, Antoine aims to organize the LN Summit in Africa, highlighting its potential and opportunities while emphasizing the need for collaboration and practical actions within the open-source community.</summary>
