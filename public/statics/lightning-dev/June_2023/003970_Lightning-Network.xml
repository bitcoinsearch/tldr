    <summary>In an email dated June 3, 2023, Satoshi Nakamoto expressed his satisfaction with the Lightning Network as a means of conducting global business with fast and secure lightning payments. He created a new lightning address, satoshi@vistomail.com, and praised the network's ability to process more transactions per second than any financial instrument, adding that Bitcoin is a huge success and will continue to scale. However, it appears that Vistomail has recently changed ownership, leading to concerns that the domain may be used by scammers pretending to be Satoshi. Peter Todd suggested blocking the entire domain from the list.</summary>
