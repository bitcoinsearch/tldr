    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, and a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Additionally, there are opportunities to build local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of CoreDev or LN Summit is usually not made on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling. However, given the potential complexities of organizing the summit in Africa, such as visa travels and tropical weather, it is better to announce it well in advance. The organization would benefit from a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine invites objections or feedback regarding his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability, stating that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine suggests surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could be suitable for hosting the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to privately share the feedback with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.A dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, has been set up for anyone interested in being part of the organization. Antoine encourages Lightning Network developers to participate, seeing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine concludes his message by mentioning that he has experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for this upcoming summit.</summary>
