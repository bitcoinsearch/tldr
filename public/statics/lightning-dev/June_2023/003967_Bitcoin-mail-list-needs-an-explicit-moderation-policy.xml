    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, sent a post to bitcoin-dev mail list referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. Despite receiving support from known community members, the post was not published the next day, while other emails were released to bitcoin-dev. Orlovsky and his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association started asking questions about whether this post ever got to Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies, which must be applied on a non-selective basis. Also, Bishop had abused his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. In response, Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, the bitcoin-dev mail list must have a clear moderation (or pre-publication peer-review policy). Secondly, Bishop must be replaced with a new moderator who should be selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria “least votes against”. Thirdly, the role of the moderator(s) must be purely executive of the policies, without any personal preferences. Fourthly, a dedicated mail list should be created (“bitcoin-dev-unmoderated”) which will publish all submissions without moderation. Lastly, the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.</summary>
