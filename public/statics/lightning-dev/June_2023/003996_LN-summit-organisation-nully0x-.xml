    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that holding the summit in Africa would be beneficial due to the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Antoine acknowledges that announcing the organization of the summit on open communication channels is not the usual practice to maintain engineering conversation serenity and avoid trolls or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the operational challenges involved in hosting the summit in Africa, he believes it is better to announce it ahead of time. He mentions that operations and financial resources should be sufficient but encourages a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine requests objections to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024 and assures that he will uphold strong transparency and accountability standards. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc., and share feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.He provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for LN developers interested in being part of the organization and sees it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring together the lightning dev community and leverage the potential of Africa for the LN Summit 2024.</summary>
