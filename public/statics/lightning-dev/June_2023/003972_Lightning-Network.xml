    <summary>I am responding from my secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to validate my account. I want to clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since I registered it. The purchase update on who.is is simply an addition of years to the ownership, as the domain was set to expire. Despite your smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, I see everything. You have great technology but waste time arguing instead of working harder. It seems the new developers no longer want me around, and I am fine with that.To further clarify, I added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and falsely claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin. I have other ways to prove my identity, but I never cared because I am the real Satoshi. I saw all the messages, including yours Peter. I also added my lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com, to compliment the Lightning team for their excellent work in creating a global business platform with fast and secure lightning payments.Peter Todd, in response to my previous email, mentioned that vistomail.com seems to have changed ownership based on the updated whois records and website content. He suggested blocking the entire domain as he assumes it to be another scammer pretending to be Satoshi.In conclusion, I wanted to express my appreciation for the Lightning Network's achievements and the ability it provides for conducting global business with fast and secure lightning payments. Bitcoin's success and scalability are evident, surpassing traditional banking systems.</summary>
