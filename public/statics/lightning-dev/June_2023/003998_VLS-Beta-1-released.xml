    <summary>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is thrilled to announce the Beta release of their MVP2, which focuses on enhancing security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. Developers of Lightning Network (LN) applications are encouraged to join the VLS Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta provides security against common methods used by malicious nodes to steal user funds, it does not cover all potential scenarios where users might face fund loss. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and its protection aligns with your specific use case requirements.Developers can expect various highlights from the VLS beta, such as compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery options for both signer and node failures, a comprehensive set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules like velocity and approval, complete layer-1 validation rules for on-chain channel state tracking, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle that ensures safe on-chain state. For detailed information, refer to the full changelog.In the upcoming release, the VLS team plans to enable the signer to run in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, operate on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and optimize performance for embedded processors. Future releases will include routing capabilities, BOLT-12 support, VSS Integration, and Multisig.For developers seeking an engaging and impactful FOSS project to contribute to, the VLS project welcomes your help. Get in touch with the team through Matrix to explore opportunities for involvement.To learn more about the VLS Beta release, visit [vls.tech](https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/).</summary>
