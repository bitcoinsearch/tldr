    <summary>I am responding from my secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to provide further validation to my account. Peter, before you make false statements about the domain vistomail.com, I want to clarify that the domain hasn't changed hands since I registered it. The purchase update on who.is simply reflects the addition of years to ownership because the domain was set to expire. Despite your smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, I added years to the ownership because I thought it was necessary. You seem to argue over everything and dismiss others' opinions without considering them. You even stopped my ability to submit posts in certain forums like bitcoin-dev, bitcoin-core-dev, and now lightning-dev. It is clear that the new developers no longer want me around, and I am fine with that.To further prove my identity as the real Satoshi, I added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses. This was done to counter Craig Wright's attempts to sue everyone and falsely claim he is the creator of Bitcoin. I have many other ways to prove my authenticity, but I never felt the need to do so because I know I am the real Satoshi. I have seen all the messages, including yours, Peter. In addition, I added my lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com as a compliment to the Lightning team for their great work. They have made me feel welcomed and I appreciate their efforts.For reference, I have included a public key attachment (contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com - 0x6674D3A1.asc) and a signature attachment (signature.asc) to validate the authenticity of this message. Thank you once again for your work and for making me feel welcomed.Satoshi Nakamoto</summary>
