    <summary>The Lightning Network has been hailed as a great achievement, with the ability to conduct global business and scale through fast and secure lightning payments. Satoshi Nakamoto has created a lightning address, satoshi at vistomail.com, which he considers a comfortable way for humans to process transactions with more speed and security than any financial instrument in existence. Bitcoin is seen as a massive success and will continue to scale. The Lightning Network's ability to process more transactions per second than traditional banking systems puts it light years ahead of them.</summary>
