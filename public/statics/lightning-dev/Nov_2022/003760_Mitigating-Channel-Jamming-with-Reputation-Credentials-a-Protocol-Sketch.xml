    <summary>Antoine and Clara have been discussing the need for a recommended policy in relation to the Lightning Network. Antoine proposed that the simplest recommended policy would be for credentials shown to the routing hop to cover for full routing fees, ensuring a zero-jamming risk situation. He also suggested that credentials requested could increase in function of local channel congestion rate or network data, with higher returns being offered in exchange for higher risk exposure. Additionally, a reputation layer could be added where reputation scores are fully fungible against monetary credentials in the acceptance of a HTLC forward request. Clara agreed that a recommended policy is needed and expressed concern that it may never happen if not made a priority. Antoine shared the email on #lightning-dev Libera chat to get more feedback on schedule. When asked if he had a timeline in mind for presenting such a policy, Antoine explained that for now, he is thinking more about refining the proposed credentials architectural framework. He believes dynamic routing policy in function of channel congestion rate, combined with reputation to do active risk-management are far more advanced questions.</summary>
