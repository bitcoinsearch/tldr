    <summary>A new Watchtower-Free (WF) protocol has been introduced for the Lightning Network, which enables casual users to send and receive Lightning payments with minimal availability requirements or the need for watchtower services. The protocol achieves this without any changes to the underlying Bitcoin protocol and requires three changes relative to the current Lightning protocol.The WF protocol divides users into Casual-Lightning-Users (CLUs) that only send and receive payments, and Dedicated-Lightning-Users (DLUs) that can also route payments. It uses Commitment transactions, HTLC-success transactions, and Funding transactions to facilitate payments and has two parameters, I_S and I_L, which determine the frequency with which the user needs to be online.John proposed a modified protocol for the Lightning Network, which Dave reduced into its essential ideas and asked for confirmation. John confirmed that Dave's understanding was accurate. Dave pointed out a potential issue regarding a malicious partner broadcasting an older revoked commitment transaction, which John acknowledged but suggested setting a long interval safety parameter for penalty transactions.John and Bastien discussed the trade-offs between DLUs and CLUs in terms of capital efficiency. John suggested refunding the remainder of the cost-of-capital pre-payment to the CLU, which would mitigate the disadvantage of the larger delay (1-3 months vs. 2 weeks) in the WF protocol. However, Bastien expressed concern about liquidity not being free, specifically how DLUs won't be able to quickly move liquidity around with this proposal, causing them to charge CLUs for the loss of expected revenue.In another email exchange, the comparison between the WF protocol and non-cooperative close transaction on-chain with a 2-week delay was discussed. The WF protocol has a larger delay of about 1-3 months but allows the DLU to move liquidity to another Lightning channel by either getting the CLU to sign a cooperative close transaction or putting a non-cooperative close transaction on-chain. Despite its benefits, John's proposal assumes that the CLU checks the blockchain themselves, rather than using a watchtower service, and requires the DLU to decide at the time of the check-in whether or not to perform the splice. Finally, the WF protocol requires that Alice and Bob stay off-chain long enough to guarantee that Alice will be available for at least G, which is sufficient for both parties to update the channel state off-chain.</summary>
