    <summary>Antoine shared a mail on #lightning-dev Libera chat to get feedback on schedule. Clara had asked Antoine if he had any timeline in mind for presenting a policy. Antoine replied that for now, he is thinking more to refine the proposed credentials architectural framework. He added that dynamic routing policy in function of channel congestion rate, and combining it with reputation to do active risk-management are far more advanced questions. In response, Clara thanked Antoine for his quick and detailed response and asked him if he had a timeline in mind for presenting such a policy. She also mentioned that if the call time (Monday the 28th at 7 pm UTC) doesn't work out for anyone, they can reach out to her. Clara looked forward to discussing this further over the phone call and said she would make some inquiries to ensure the time works for most people.</summary>
