    <summary>Clara is concerned about the lack of a recommended policy for Antoine's proposed solution. She worries that it may never happen if it isn't made a priority. Antoine shared Clara's email on #lightning-dev Libera chat to get more feedback on schedule. In response to Clara's question about presenting a policy, Antoine referred to comments on the BOLT #1043 PR and stated that he is currently focusing on refining the proposed credentials architectural framework. He believes that dynamic routing policy in function of channel congestion rate and combining that with reputation to do active risk-management are far more advanced questions. Clara confirmed a call time on Monday the 28th at 7 pm UTC and asked Antoine about his timeline for presenting a policy. She clarified that she meant a set of algorithms that should guide the token quantity, rate issuance, token acquisition cost, and adaptations in function of the local channel congestion or even the gossips of other routing nodes. She expressed her excitement about discussing this further during the call and will make inquiries to ensure the time works for most people.</summary>
