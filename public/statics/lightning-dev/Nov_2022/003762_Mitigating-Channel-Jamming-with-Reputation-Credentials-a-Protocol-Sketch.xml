    <summary>Antoine Riard proposes a "staking"/reputational credentials system to save on unconditional fees paid by HTLC senders. This system allows for past HTLC routing success to be converted into more allocated credentials, which can minimize the overhead cost of future HTLC sends or allow them to lock liquidity for longer periods. From a routing node viewpoint, a 0-risk HTLC forwarding acceptance can be maintained by requesting strict binding between credentials acquisition cost and channel liquidity routed. If higher returns are sought, the ratio of credentials to liquidity can be adjusted, but this comes with higher risks. A "pure reputation" system can also be layered on top of this monetary paradigm, where HTLC senders are allocated more significant liquidity slots based on their identities' quality. The real bottleneck in this case is the cryptosystem, i.e., proving UTXO ownership without revealing any other information. Overall, Antoine believes that a simple recommended policy is needed, but refinement can occur over time with solid foundations. Clara Shikhelman asks if there is a clear benefit to using a token compared to unconditional fees and local reputation. She also requests a timeline for presenting such a policy. Antoine responds that a recommended policy is needed, but he is currently focused on refining the proposed credentials architectural framework. Dynamic routing policy in function of channel congestion rate, combined with reputation to do active risk-management, are more advanced questions. He also shares the mail on #lightning-dev Libera chat to get more feedback on schedule.</summary>
