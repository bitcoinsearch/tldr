    <summary>Clara, a member of the Lightning Network (LN) developers' group, has suggested having another call to discuss jamming. She proposed a repeating call every two weeks, starting from Monday the 28th at 7 pm UTC. Clara has several questions regarding the token transferability between users, recommended policy for token creation and use, the translation of reputation credentials to liquidity units, and how these tokens work with blinded paths and other privacy-preserving suggestions.Antoine Riard responded to Clara's concerns. He proposed a formalization of a reputation-based scheme to solve channel jamming by using "credentials" issued by routing hops attached to each HTLC forward request. The "credentials" can be used by a reputation algorithm to efficiently allocate channel liquidity resources by rewarding or punishing payment senders. The initial distribution of the "credentials" could be bootstrapped leveraging one-time upfront fees paid toward the routing hops, and subsequent distribution could rely on previous HTLC traffic. Antoine provided a protocol description in his response.Antoine also evaluated the mitigation proposal against a few criteria emerged from recent research. He stated that the mitigation is effective, incentive-compatible, transparent from the user, and conserves high-level privacy. He further discussed the ease of implementation, centralization inertia, ecosystem impacts, proposal modularity and flexibility, and feedback.Antoine provided links to previous research works and proposals related to reputation schemes, unconditional fee research, inbound channel routing fees, rate card, flow-control valve, and short-lived ZKP. He highlighted the potential of the credentials framework beyond solving jamming, as a generalized risk-management framework for Bitcoin decentralized financial network.</summary>
