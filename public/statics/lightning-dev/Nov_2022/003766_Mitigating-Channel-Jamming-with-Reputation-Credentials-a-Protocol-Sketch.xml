    <summary>Michael Folkson, an amateur in the field of reputation systems, expressed his skepticism about embedding a reputation layer or reputation credentials into the Lightning protocol. He believes that decentralized reputation systems baked into a protocol is too risky and will not be managed by protocol developers but by multiple companies and projects. Michael provided some links to additional reading on reputation systems, which Antoine Riard proposed as a solution to solve channel jamming.Antoine's proposal involves a formalization of a reputation-based scheme that relies on "credentials" issued by routing hops and requested to be attached to each HTLC forward request. The "credentials" can be used by a reputation algorithm to reward/punish payment senders and allocate channel liquidity resources efficiently. The proposal builds on previous reputation-scheme research and integrates more recent proposals of upfront fees as a straightforward mechanism to bootstrap the reputation system.The current reputation-credential architectural framework assumes credentials distribution at the endpoint of the network, but it should be flexible enough for the credentials to be harvested by the LSPs and then distributed in a secondary fashion to their spokes. Feedback is welcome, and Michael's links provide more information on reputation systems.A recent email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list discussed a new paper published by researchers from the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University. The paper proposes a new mechanism for preventing transaction malleability on the Lightning Network, which has been a persistent issue since the early days of the network.The proposed mechanism involves the use of "commitment schemes" that bind each Lightning payment to a specific transaction ID. This prevents attackers from modifying the transaction ID and potentially stealing funds from the network. The paper has received positive feedback from several members of the Lightning development community, including Rusty Russell and Christian Decker. However, some developers have raised concerns about the potential complexity and performance impact of the proposed solution.A pull request has also been opened on the Lightning Network's official GitHub repository to discuss the paper's findings and potential implementation strategies. The pull request includes a detailed summary of the paper's key points and links to additional resources for interested developers.Overall, the discussion highlights the ongoing efforts by the Lightning Network community to address longstanding issues and improve the network's security and scalability.</summary>
