    <summary>In this email, Clara is reaching out to a group of people to schedule a call for discussing a policy. She acknowledges that the scheduled time might not work for everyone and encourages them to let her know. Antoine responded quickly with a detailed response to Clara's question about whether recommending policies includes guiding token quantity, rate issuance, token acquisition cost, and adaptations based on local channel congestion or other routing nodes' gossips. He says it does not include those factors. Clara asks if there is a timeline for presenting such a policy. She looks forward to discussing further during the phone call and will make inquiries to ensure the best time for most people.</summary>
