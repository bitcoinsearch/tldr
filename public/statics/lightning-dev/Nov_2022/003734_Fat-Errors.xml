    <summary>In an email exchange between Joost Jager and Rusty Russell regarding gaps in error attribution in Lightning Network, Joost proposed a scheme where the sender signals the maximum number of hops to trade off size against privacy. Rusty agreed with the proposal and suggested using 16 hops as it is the closest power of 2 to the legacy hop limit. He also mentioned a pre-pay scheme involving sending N sats and a secp point which could earn the forwarder 1 sat for every chained secret returned. However, he acknowledged that this scheme may be more invasive than simply touching encode/relay/decode of the failure message. Both parties discussed their plans to further implement these schemes.</summary>
