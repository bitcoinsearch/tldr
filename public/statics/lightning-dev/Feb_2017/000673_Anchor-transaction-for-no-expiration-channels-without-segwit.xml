    <summary>In an email thread dated February 8, 2017, Nicolas Dorier proposed a solution to eliminate the need for nTimeLock in transactions. He stated that nLocktime for TX2 is essentially free and only serves to prevent fast initial channel close. Once an unchanged version of TX1 is in the blockchain, all further updates to the channel can exclude the nLocktime. Additionally, the email thread discussed a bounty of 1 BTC that could be unlocked by Alice once the channel is set up, as a courtesy.</summary>
