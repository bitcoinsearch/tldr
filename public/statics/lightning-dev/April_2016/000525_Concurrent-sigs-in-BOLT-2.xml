    <summary>In a discussion about the possibility of nodes getting stuck in an infinite loop while sending each other new HTLCs instead of immediately sending a new SIG, Rusty Russell explains that as long as an HTLC is committed to by both sides, it's locked in. He also notes that until then, the receiver cannot offer it onwards. Furthermore, a node must estimate the deadline for successful redemption for each HTLC it offers and should not offer a HTLC past the deadline. With regards to whether it should be specified that the only valid answer to a signature is either a signature (if there are outstanding changes) or a revocation, Rusty believes that you should be able to pack in as many updates between signatures as you want.</summary>
