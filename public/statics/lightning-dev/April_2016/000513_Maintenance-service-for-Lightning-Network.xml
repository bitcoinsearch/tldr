    <summary>The email thread discusses how routing data works in the Lightning Network and the process of making an initial payment request. One suggestion is for both devices to establish a socket connection to current landmark nodes, although this could be overwhelming for both devices and landmark nodes. Another possibility is a deterministic method that determines what exact node a user's ID should connect to, which could distribute the load across the network. There are concerns about DDoS attacks, which could spam a Lightning device with millions of payment requests. Rusty proposes a solution where nodes have an ID and publish their public routes by proving they own the anchor transactions for their channels, with information on routes to and from landmarks stored by every node. To accept a payment, a unique hash of R-value, an amount, and route information from a landmark to the receiver would be given. The thread also discusses the need for stable identities on devices, encryption for transferring core data, and the possibility of a service parallel to LN that can transfer core data in encrypted form. However, offline receive is deemed much harder and not planned for 1.0 spec.</summary>
