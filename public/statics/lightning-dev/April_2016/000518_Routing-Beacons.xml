    <summary>The inquiry made by Laurentmt is regarding the idea of routing based on beacons in LN. The idea is to route through a known set of landmarks which can be achieved via several ways. The node is interested in finding the cheapest route to and from each beacon which can be easily propagated by broadcasting the best route known. However, if rates are expressed as "base + per-satoshi-amount", then "cheapest" depends on the amount, so some heuristics will be required.</summary>
