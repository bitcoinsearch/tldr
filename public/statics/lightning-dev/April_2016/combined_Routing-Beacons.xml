    <summary>Laurent, a LN noob, is curious about routing based on beacons. He wonders if it is similar to the Pulse Protocol, which uses periodic computation of spanning trees rooted at beacon nodes. According to Rusty, there are several ways to do routing via a known set of landmarks. Since each node is interested in the cheapest route to and from each beacon, it is easy to propagate by always broadcasting the best route that is known. However, if rates are expressed as "base + per-satoshi-amount," then some heuristics will be required since the cheapest route depends on the amount.</summary>
