    <summary>A discussion among members of the Lightning Network community has revealed that HTLC IDs are not enough to establish a secure system. The problem with using only the IDs is that in some cases, an acknowledge field must be taken into account. For example, if A sends ADD HTLC X, ADD HTLC Y, ADD HTLC Z and B sends FAIL Y before A has received this message, then SIG Z will be invalid. In such a scenario, B has no way of knowing whether A received the "FAIL Y" message or not without checking the 'acknowledge' field. Therefore, it would make sense to include the ID in the update_commit msg as well, instead of relying on the acknowledge field. However, acknowledge fields should still be relied on at the transport level (including the reconnect scenario) to know which messages should be replayed. Odd/even HTLC IDs have been discussed as a means of quickly distinguishing between incoming and outgoing htlcs and to catch bugs.</summary>
