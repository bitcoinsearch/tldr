    <summary>In an email dated April 1, 2016, Pierre asked the Lightning Network developers about the purpose of odd/even HTLC IDs. Joseph Poon replied that he had been working on a cleaner solution and that the original idea was to have unique IDs for each HTLC created so they could be identified later on. The direction would be understood by the positive/negative amount, and the ID would not need to be in the final wire protocol. It would mainly be used for debugging purposes.</summary>
