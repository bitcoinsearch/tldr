    <summary>The Lightning Network is a proposal to improve Bitcoin scalability by making transactions faster and cheaper. However, there are concerns about establishing an initial payment request connection between nodes without overwhelming socket connections or risking DDoS attacks from spammers. Blind signatures have been suggested as a possible solution, but enforcing this on a distributed network remains unclear.To initiate a payment request, at least three core pieces of data are required: the hash of R-value, a list of "full node" URLs where the receiver currently has open channels, and a list of receiver IDs for each "full node." There are also concerns about avoiding confusion with QR codes, verifying the identity of the receiver, and validating metadata.Rusty proposed generating stable identities on users' devices using EC25519 keys. A service parallel to the LN transfer could then act as a third-party watcher for broadcasted commitment transactions and act as a "name authority" for users who supplied metadata along with their public keys. However, offline receive is difficult to implement, and it may require the receiver to trust someone to collect the payment or pay extra for all the funds tied up in the network waiting for the receiver to come online.</summary>
