    <summary>Subhra Mazumdar was experimenting with LND and established a channel between two parties, A and B. When sending a payment to B via HTLC, B adds an invoice and Subhra used a different payment hash for A for sendpayment with a delta of 144 blocks. However, the error message "incorrect or unknown payment details" occurred on initiating send payment. It is unclear if B is ignoring any formation of HTLC between them and if no money gets locked in this case. Subhra also wants to know how to mimic a griefing attack scenario in LND, where B refuses to release the correct preimage.</summary>
