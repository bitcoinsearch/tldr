    <summary>In this email exchange, ZmnSCPxj suggests a modification to the current path blinding proposal for multi-hop locks. The recipient would need to give the sender all the blinding points for each hop in the blinded path, rather than just one blinding point as is currently done. However, this may open up some attack vectors on the sender as the security assumptions are based on the sender being able to choose every secret from a random distribution. It may be possible for the sender to tweak each recipient secret with a secret of its own, but further analysis and verification is needed. The sender would only need to deliver the payment point to the first recipient-selected-hop, while the rest of the recipient-selected-hops would add their blinding scalars (which come from the recipient), and the final recipient can linearly deduct those.</summary>
