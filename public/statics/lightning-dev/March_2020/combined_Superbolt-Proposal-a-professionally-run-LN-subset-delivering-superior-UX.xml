    <summary>The Lightning Network (LN) is facing issues due to inbound/outbound channel liquidity and node dropouts, leading to failed payment attempts. To solve these problems, a new proposal called Superbolt Network (SBN) has been made, which enforces strict rules for nodes to follow regarding liquidity, uptime, and channel rebalancing automation. The SBN would be optional for LN nodes to use or not depending on their preference. Two node classes are proposed, Routing Node (RN), and Access Node (AN), with commensurate total node and per-channel liquidity requirements. Channel balancing would be automated via "circular payments" and Loop to ensure channels do not become stuck from inbound/outbound liquidity snags. Payments sent on the network would be subject to a flat fee regardless of hops involved in routing the payment.However, the proposal to split the network into a central network of specially-chosen nodes surrounded by second-class and third-class nodes is criticized as disturbing. There are also concerns about how SBN would be bootstrapped, who are the first members, and how "random selection" works. To attest to uptime, a censorship-free way is proposed using OpenTimeStamps. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj notes that data from cdecker establishes a lower bound on expected user experience with Lightning Network payments, as it assumes every node has an equal chance of being the payee.In response to a question about node uptime, the node shows its signatures attested on OpenTimeStamps. However, the asker would only believe the node if the set of signatures attested on OpenTimeStamps is large enough. The email exchange discusses ways to ensure usability and decentralization of the network, particularly regarding the SBN (Submarine Swap Network). One suggestion is to limit the maximum node size with enforced minimum liquidity requirements per channel. Another proposal is to use OpenTimeStamps for self-attestation, which has a low risk of being coordinated against by an attacker. However, the risk of a minority OTS-server censoring specific nodes remains a possibility.The article also discusses the vulnerabilities of the proposed Statechain Bitcoin Network (SBN) and how it can be attacked. The author mentions that anyone who can update the software can easily create a fake node that appears to have completely legitimate channels to one or more real nodes, thereby making SBN worthless. They suggest that to make proof-of-uptime expensive, SBN should charge higher than current feerates for premium reliable service. The author also proposes groups of independent citizens put funds in a k-of-n address and continuously spend that k-of-n address to itself on every block.The email exchange concludes with the concept of offchain systems being pushed onchain. The author explains that not everything is online at each block, only at the blocks where the offchain system is pushed onchain. Overall, the main focus of the conversation is to ensure usability and decentralization of the network while addressing the vulnerabilities and concerns associated with the proposed SBN.</summary>
