    <summary>The email exchange between the two individuals is about the possible implementation of a Bitcoin Lightning Network. One individual suggests using OpenTimeStamps (OTS) to ensure uptime of nodes. However, the other individual points out that this approach only measures node uptime and not node behavior. They use an example of how the London government's attempt to reduce the rat problem by offering payment for every rat tail provided by citizens resulted in private individuals growing rats for their tails. The proposal is also vulnerable to attacks such as running fake nodes.The economics of mining should provide protection but multiple nodes can be run by the same entity to get around per-node limits. Therefore, the proposal is modified to include minimum node capacity requirements with no maximum number of channels or capacity limits. Blinded commitments and k-of-n addresses are also suggested as an alternative approach to OTS servers.The author concludes by discussing the concept of offchain systems being pushed onchain. They explain that not everything is online at each block, only at the blocks where the offchain system is pushed onchain. The author signs off with their name, ZmnSCPxj, and regards to the recipient, Robert.</summary>
