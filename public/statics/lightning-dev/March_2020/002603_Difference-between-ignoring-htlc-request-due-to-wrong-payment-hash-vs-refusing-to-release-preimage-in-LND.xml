    <summary>The conversation revolves around the issue of unresolved HTLCs while probing in LND. The process of probing sets up a chain of irredeemable HTLCs, which eventually escrows funds and forces nodes to wait until the HTLCs time out before being able to forward other payments. This can cause a DOS attack on the probe route, giving only one shot at probing before having to wait multiple hours for the HTLCs to expire. The discussion also touches upon the scenario where funds remain locked due to locktime, and the possibility of mimicking griefing attack scenarios in LND. The conversation recommends modifying LND code directly or using plugins in C-Lightning to achieve this.</summary>
