    <summary>From the given context, it is being discussed if it's possible to establish an HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contract) using a right-to-left approach, starting from B to C first and then A to B. However, this approach doesn't seem logical. The point raised is that B cannot be punished if it doesn't possess the secret at the time of establishing the HTLC. This creates a challenge for atomicity between A to B and B to A. What if A to B HTLC is established but there is no contract for B to A?</summary>
