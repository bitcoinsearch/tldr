    <summary>Bastien, a contributor to the Lightning Network, has proposed a method for route blinding that would improve wallet users' privacy. He has shared his proposal in a GitHub repository and simplified the scheme compared to previous iterations. The crypto part is ready for review, but Bastien still plans to add more to the proposal. He welcomes comments directly on the branch commits and may turn it into a draft PR to facilitate discussions. In response to a comment about the use of payment_secret, Bastien explains that he removed its (ab)use but thinks that replacing it with blinding would not work because the blinding is known by the next-to-last node. The goal of payment_secret is to prevent the next-to-last node from discovering it to avoid probing. Regarding ZmnSCPxj's suggestion, Bastien notes that the secrets established with anonymous multi-hops locks are between the sender and each hop. In the case of route blinding, the secrets added are between the recipient and the hops, and they do not want the sender to influence those. They are looking for a reverse Sphinx solution, and while they are not sure yet if the recipient can safely contribute to those secrets, they hope to find a trick in the future.</summary>
