    <summary>In an email exchange on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Subhra Mazumdar asked about the terms of a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC). Specifically, they asked why the terms couldn't be set such that 0.4 BTC goes to party A, 0.2 BTC goes to party B, and 0.4 BTC is locked in the HTLC. This would allow for either party to claim the locked funds, with party A able to claim them after a certain time period if party B does not produce the required knowledge of R : H=h(R) within that time period. In response, LL noted that the only problem with this approach is that it doesn't work across multiple hops, only for the final hop. LL then provided a link to a paper on atomic swaps as a basis for doing HTLCs fairly. No further information was given on the content of the paper or how it related to the discussion at hand.</summary>
