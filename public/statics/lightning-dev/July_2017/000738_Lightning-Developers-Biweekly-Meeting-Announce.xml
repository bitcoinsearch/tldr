    <summary>A formalized Google Hangout for implementers of the Lightning specification has been opened to a wider audience. The call will take place every two weeks on Monday at 20:00 UTC, with the next call scheduled for July 24th. Communication during the call will be via freenode's IRC servers using #lightning-dev. Those working on the Lightning protocol who wish to attend should contact the organizer for an invite.An agenda will be produced each week which will include a list of outstanding PRs on Github. Minutes from each meeting will also be posted to the ML (mailing list). A link to the last set of minutes can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbMxe_QZhpHo67eeiYHbJ-BvNKU1WhFd5WhJFeD9-DI/edit?usp=sharing. Moving forward, all non-spelling/typo changes to the spec will require a vote with no objections from call participants. Any developers unable to make the meetings are able to veto or defer by emailing the organizer prior to the meeting.</summary>
