    <summary>Keags sent an email to Jorge Tim√≥n, advising him to be mindful of his words when communicating on the mailing list. Keags warned that some readers may not understand the drama that Jorge is referencing and his overt antagonism may cause suspicion among readers. He suggested that Jorge communicate in a way that recruits allies and demonstrates good faith if he wishes to affect change. Keags also advised Jorge to take greater care in seeing how his words are understood by others, as this could elicit greater sympathy and cooperation.Jorge's original email raised concerns about defending himself and his right to a presumption of innocence. Antoine Riard responded, expressing his concern about frivolous legal claims being used between bitcoin developers/organizations, provoking a distortion of neutrality and a chilling effect of technical discussions. He believed that participants' rights and capabilities to contribute and speak their minds should be protected, and emphasized the importance of respecting freedom of expression, presumption of innocence, and due process in the Bitcoin common space. Antoine concluded by thanking the Bitcoin friends who have called for level-headedness and cool-mindedness in public discussion.The Lightning-dev mailing list has been experiencing low activity due to off-topic emails and limited moderation. One member expressed concern over the potential death of the mailing list and asked if there was a better place for discussions. Another member highlighted the importance of public communication for technical discussions in order to document the range of options considered and provide opportunities for new participants to contribute. They emphasized IRC, the mailing list, and GitHub issues/PRs as the primary channels for such communication. It is important to note that this discussion took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list and was made available through associated links.</summary>
