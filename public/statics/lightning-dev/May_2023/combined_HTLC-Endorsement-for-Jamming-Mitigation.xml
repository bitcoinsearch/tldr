    <title>Combined summary - HTLC Endorsement for Jamming Mitigation</title>

    <summary>The conversation revolves around the HTLC endorsement scheme in the Lightning Network and its implications for reputation and routing fees. The main concern is ensuring reputational transitivity to prevent abuse during high-fee periods. The discussion also touches on topics such as local-only reputation systems, repeat interactions from individual senders, and the impact of attacks on large routing nodes versus edges.One major concern raised is the lack of transitivity of reputation acquisition cost between hops in a payment path, which creates a vulnerability in the endorsement scheme. The distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue is emphasized, with reputation being determined as a function of the latter. The email suggests that nodes should consider setting a higher bar than reputation revenue if they deem a high reputation with another node crucial.The conversation also discusses the challenges of gossiping about reputations in a decentralized network and the importance of distinguishing between fees charged by a node and reputation revenue. There is a mention of some nodes with Tor having an unrealistic perception of the network due to issues with the overloaded Tor network.Overall, the conversation highlights the need for rigorous analysis and evaluation of reputation systems, the vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies for channel jamming attacks, and the importance of data gathering for simulations and experimentation. The Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a valuable platform for these discussions and collaborations among developers and enthusiasts in the Lightning Network community.In another part of the conversation, the distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model is discussed. The speaker presents an example involving nodes Caroll, Bob, and Alice to illustrate the decision-making process based on reliability judgment and the potential for jamming attacks. The compensation mechanism in this scenario is unclear, and further information on the LDK scoring engine is provided through a link.The vulnerability of the Lightning Network's endorsement scheme is discussed, focusing on the lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost between payment path hops. The reputation gained during low fee times cannot be used when fees are high, and sudden fee spikes can change reputation. The impact of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability is also considered. The email suggests that reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic channels should be established to prevent abuse.The conversation also touches on the implementation and position of reputation systems in the software stack. It is suggested that reputation systems should be separate from the protocol or P2P gossiping and implemented as an API or plugin. Privacy concerns may lead some users to choose not to participate in such services.The Lightning Network community actively addresses the issue of channel jamming, and proposals are made for a two-part scheme involving HTLC endorsement and reputation. Data gathering efforts, including the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation, are planned during the upcoming call. Different algorithms for tracking local reputation will be experimented with. Each node will track the reputation of its direct neighbors and reserve slots and liquidity for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers. Reputation and endorsement form the initial steps in the two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming. Antoine also mentions Staking Credentials as an end-to-end approach to address channel jamming and provides a link for more information.The usefulness of reputation systems in the Lightning Network is debated. The argument against them revolves around their susceptibility to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks. However, reputation data can still be useful for choosing potential channel counterparties.Overall, the Lightning Network community is actively discussing and proposing solutions for mitigating channel jamming attacks. The discussion involves exploring reputation systems, endorsement schemes, and the evaluation of their effectiveness through data gathering and rigorous analysis. The Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for collaboration and exchange of ideas among developers and enthusiasts in the Lightning Network community.The email thread discusses various aspects of the HTLC endorsement model in the Lightning Network. It begins by highlighting the shift from verifiable information to potentially false reputations as a basis for decision-making. The communication between nodes is limited to whether an HTLC is endorsed or neutral, and it is advised not to gossip this information to avoid discrepancies.One major concern raised in the email is the lack of transitivity of reputation acquisition cost between hops in a payment path. This creates a vulnerability in the endorsement scheme, as a node could sacrifice its earned reputation to inflict a loss of routing fees on another node's incoming link. The distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue is emphasized, with reputation being determined as a function of the latter.The email then provides updates on the upcoming call for channel jamming, scheduled for May 1st. The agenda for the meeting can be found on GitHub, and the goal is to gather data during these weekly calls to mitigate jamming. This includes observing the effect of logging-only implementation in steady state and collecting real-world data for future simulation work. Different algorithms for tracking local reputation will also be experimented with. Minimal changes required to add HTLC endorsement are outlined, starting with a binary endorsement field and potentially using an experimental TLV value. The proposed two-part scheme for</summary>
