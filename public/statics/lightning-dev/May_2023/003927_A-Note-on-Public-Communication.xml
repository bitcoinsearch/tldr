    <summary>There is concern over the state of public communication in a certain mailing list, which has become barren since one off-topic email was sent. There appears to be a backlog of emails with only one moderator checking them once a week, leading to discussions on whether there is a better place for such conversations. The importance of holding conversations as much as possible in public was emphasized by a member of the lightning community, citing its usefulness in documenting technical decisions and providing an interface point for new participants to contribute to the discussion. It is therefore crucial for technical or specification discussions to be held publicly to ensure transparency and inclusivity.</summary>
