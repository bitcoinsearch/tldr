    <summary>In an email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Tony Giorgio raised concerns about public communication and suggested finding a better place for discussions. In response, Antoine Riard defended his post from March 21st regarding "frivolous legal claims" being used between bitcoin developers/organizations that could lead to a distortion of neutrality in development and a chilling effect on technical discussions. He believes it is his legal right and moral duty to inform the community of what is happening. Antoine argues that open-source responsibilities should be subject to external accountability, and he defends the practice of exposing private elements if they are proportional to the wrongdoing being exposed. He also emphasizes that communication channels in Bitcoin and Lightning development are public forums where participants have the right to speak their minds and contribute. Antoine stresses the importance of maintaining a balance of rights and proportionality in restraining measures when there are conflicting principles. He acknowledges that conflicts are not binary and that people can disagree on the set of legal and moral principles to apply. Antoine concludes by thanking Bitcoin friends who have called for level-headedness and cool-mindness in the public discussion of this complex topic. He says he won't communicate further on this subject on the Bitcoin and Lightning technical channels but believes that the discussion on principles, abstracted from its private elements, should still be pursued on other channels.</summary>
