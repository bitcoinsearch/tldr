    <summary>The LSPSpec group has been working on the specifications for Lightning Service Providers (LSP) to create interoperability between Lightning wallets and LSPs by standardizing their communication. The group has announced two mature specifications, LSPS1 - Channel Request and LSPS2 - JIT Channels, which are available for review on Github repository. The LSPS1 API allows purchasing channels from an LSP while the LSPS2 API facilitates Just-In-Time Channels for 0conf channel opening on payment arrival. The group holds biweekly calls every Wednesday at 11:00 am UTC to discuss the current state of the spec. The next call is scheduled for May 17th. To receive a calendar invite for the upcoming call, individuals can join the Telegram group and message Pav their email address.</summary>
