    <summary>Michael Folkson has suggested that lightning-dev mailing list requires more moderators due to the increased number of emails on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He believes that although Bitcoin and Lightning discussions are becoming more intertwined, it is best to keep both lists separate. Recently, one off-topic email sent to the lightning-dev mailing list led to a decrease in communication and only one moderator checking them once a week, which may cause the list to die. However, Vincenzo Palazzo thinks the list is the most accessible way for communication as it allows people to search for some history and implement ideas proposed in the future. Vincent agrees to change the communication tools if they do not lose two properties.</summary>
