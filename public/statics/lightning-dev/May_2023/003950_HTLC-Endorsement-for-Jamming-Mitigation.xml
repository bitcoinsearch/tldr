    <summary>The post discusses the potential issues that arise when gossiping about reputations in a decentralized network. The decisions made are no longer based on verifiable information but rather on potentially false reputations earned elsewhere. However, the communication between nodes is limited to whether an HTLC is endorsed or neutral, and it is important not to gossip this information to avoid discrepancies. The post also mentions that some nodes with Tor have an unrealistic perception of the network, believing that other nodes are offline when the issue lies with the overloaded Tor network.</summary>
