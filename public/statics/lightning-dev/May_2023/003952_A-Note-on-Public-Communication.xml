    <summary>In this email exchange, Jorge Tim贸n challenges Jeremy Rubin to a public debate to defend himself against accusations that he is "clearly delusional." Tim贸n accuses Rubin of lying about him behind his back and marginalizing him, leading to his exclusion from several forums. He alleges censorship and a lack of support for freedom of expression in the community, and expresses a desire to clear his name or at least be given a chance to try. Despite his biases, Tim贸n suggests that Rubin should also have an opportunity to defend himself in the debate.In a separate email, Antoine Riard defends his right to share personal information about a conflict with Chaincode on a public forum, citing the importance of maintaining transparency and accountability in open-source development. He emphasizes the need for proportionality in any restrictions on participants' rights to contribute and speak their minds in communication channels. Riard also calls for level-headedness and cool-mindedness in discussing the issue, while acknowledging the complexity and grey areas involved.In a recent post on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a contributor shared the importance of public communication in technical discussions and decision-making processes. The post highlights the usefulness of channels like IRC, the mailing list, and GitHub for documenting options considered and providing opportunities for new participants to join the conversation. The author emphasizes that public communication is especially important for specification or technical discussions. With recent posts on the list, the author felt it was necessary to reiterate the preference for public communication whenever possible.</summary>
