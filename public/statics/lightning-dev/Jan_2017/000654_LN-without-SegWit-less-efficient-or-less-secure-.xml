    <summary>Stefano Pepe, CEO of UniquID Inc., has expressed interest in helping with the evolution of Lightning Network (LN) and Segwit. In a recent email exchange, Andres G. Aragoneses raised concerns about the lack of activity on the lightning-dev mailing list and questioned the feasibility of LN without SegWit. Rusty Russell, a developer for Blockstream, responded that if SegWit does not activate, there is something seriously wrong with Bitcoin. Russell also explained that outsourcing the job of watching the blockchain to a server is not feasible due to the inability to hand over a penalty transaction signature without knowing what the bad transaction will look like. The discussion continued on the mailing list, which can be accessed through the provided link.</summary>
