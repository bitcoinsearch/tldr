    <summary>In a message sent on January 15, 2017 at 9:30:48 PM EST, Rusty Russell expressed his opinion that if SegWit (Segregated Witness) doesn't activate, there is something wrong with Bitcoin. He noted that it isn't solely an issue concerning the Lightning Network and stated that there has been no significant technical objection to SegWit. He added that SegWit boosts Bitcoin's performance in terms of functionality. However, he acknowledged that the perspective on this matter could vary from one person to another.Russell explained that those who consider Bitcoin as digital gold and do not particularly prioritize payments may perceive the failure of SegWit activation as a positive development. For them, it would signify how difficult it is to make modifications to Bitcoin and even suggest that major changes to Bitcoin are unlikely to occur again. This perception aligns with what digital gold enthusiasts typically want from Bitcoin.</summary>
