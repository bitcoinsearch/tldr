    <summary>Christian Decker and Rusty Russell are discussing the use of the first forked block as the genesis block for a forkchain, while keeping the non-forked blockchain on the original genesis hash to avoid disruption. They also mention the difficulty that arises if one chain does not declare itself as the forked chain. The discussion then shifts to channels that are open during the fork and how to settle them. If no replay protection was implemented on the fork, then the last commitment can be used to close the channel, but if replay protection was implemented, then people will lose money. Rusty also mentions the possibility of a standalone "salvage" utility to retrieve lost funds.</summary>
