    <summary>In a discussion about the Lightning Network protocol, Rusty Russell provides feedback on a document discussing some of the technical details. One point addressed is the creation of a dust output in the process of setting HTLC floors in second-level transactions, which would render small amounts unusable on the chain. However, Laolu suggests that the trim output specification should also indicate that no dust output should be created on second-level transactions. Another topic discussed is the use of SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY instead of using sighash-all on second-level HTLC transactions. While this approach might allow for coalescing many HTLC transactions into a single one, it is considered to be an obscure case and is mostly intended for fee bumping. Additionally, the closing transaction and commitment tx with no HTLC outputs are two other cases where this approach would be viable. The use of this signing mode is not difficult to implement.</summary>
