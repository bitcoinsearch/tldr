    <summary>The current chain_id allows for the differentiation of blockchains based on the hash of their genesis block. With the existence of hardforks branching off of the Bitcoin blockchain, questions arise about how Lightning can function on or across permanent forks of a parent blockchain that share the same genesis block. Suggestions have been made to change the definition of chain_id to the hash of the first block of the new branch and require replay and wipe-out protection, but there are concerns about whether these requirements can be relaxed. Additionally, concerns about slow block times and the possibility of using Lightning on almost frozen block chains suffering from a sudden loss of hashpower have been raised. There has been no prior discussion or study of Lightning in the setting of hardforks, and it is unclear if this is the appropriate place for such discussions. Martin, the author of the message, seeks input and guidance on these issues.</summary>
