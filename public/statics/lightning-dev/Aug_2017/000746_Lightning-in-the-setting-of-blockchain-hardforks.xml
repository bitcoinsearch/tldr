    <title>Lightning in the setting of blockchain hardforks</title>

    <summary>The email exchange between Christian and Martin discusses the challenges of using Lightning to work on or across permanent forks of a parent blockchain that share the same genesis block. They suggest changing the definition of chain_id to the hash of the first block of the new branch and requiring replay and wipe-out protection to handle these challenges. However, they also consider the possible issues with slow block times and sudden loss of hashpower in almost frozen blockchains. Additionally, they discuss the complications of open channels during a fork and the potential loss of funds if replay protection is not implemented. The email concludes with Christian welcoming Martin to the mailing list and expressing his excitement for the upcoming challenges.</summary>
