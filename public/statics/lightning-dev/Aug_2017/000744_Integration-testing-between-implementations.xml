    <summary>The protocol for version v1.0 is now in feature freeze, with changes limited to bug fixes and clarifications. To ensure interoperability, a testing process has been implemented by Christian, who has been testing the three most active implementations against each other. The resulting lightning integration test suite is still under construction but has already found inconsistencies among the implementations. Christian has published some of the test runs, which include metadata to reproduce them and will soon add a log view for easier identification of failures. This useful tool can be used to check compatibility between implementations, and feedback and suggestions are welcome. Links to the lightning integration test suite and published test runs are provided.</summary>
