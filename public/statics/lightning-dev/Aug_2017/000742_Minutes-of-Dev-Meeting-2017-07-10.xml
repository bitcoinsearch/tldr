    <summary>During a discussion, Olaoluwa Osuntokun pointed out that the signing mode SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY is already in use. The code modifications required to switch to this mode are trivial, as per Rusty's suggestion. However, due to the organization being in a "NO CHANGES EXCEPT BUGFIXES" mode, this change has been deferred until version 1.1, which implies a new feature bit. Rusty has recorded this information on the project's Wiki page for future reference.</summary>
