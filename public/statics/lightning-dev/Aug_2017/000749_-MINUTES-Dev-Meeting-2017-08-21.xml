    <summary>This week in the Bitcoin community, there were some highlights worth noting. Firstly, BOLT 10, a DNS seed, was merged. To try it out, users can go to Christian Decker's node and use the command 'dig lseed.bitcoinstats.com' which will give them some random testnet nodes. In addition, there were recommendations made for 'bitcoin:' URI key and 'lightning:' URI inclusions in BOLT 11. Finally, there were no core protocol changes made this week.</summary>
