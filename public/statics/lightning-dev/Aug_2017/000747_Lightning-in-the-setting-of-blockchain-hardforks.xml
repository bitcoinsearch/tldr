    <summary>The discussion is about the chain_id and how it can distinguish blockchains using the hash of their genesis block. However, with hardforks branching off of the Bitcoin blockchain, the question arises as to how Lightning can work on or across distinct, permanent forks of a parent blockchain that share the same genesis block. The writer suggests changing the definition of chain_id to the hash of the first block of the new branch and requiring replay and wipe-out protection. The writer also asks if these requirements can be relaxed, considering slow block times and whether Lightning can transact on almost frozen block chains suffering from a sudden loss of hashpower. Additionally, the writer inquires about any previous discussion or study of Lightning in the setting of hardforks and wonders if this is the right place to discuss it.</summary>
