    <summary>In this communication, Martin acknowledges Stefan and Lightning Devs for their research work on approximation preservation. He expresses his interest in the research and mentions that he had similar questions regarding it. However, he was unable to read the paper due to its paywalled status and unavailability on sci-hub. In response, Stefan provides a Google Books preview link to the same article for Martin to access. Martin appreciates Stefan's idea for proof of approximation preservation and concludes with a cheerful note.</summary>
