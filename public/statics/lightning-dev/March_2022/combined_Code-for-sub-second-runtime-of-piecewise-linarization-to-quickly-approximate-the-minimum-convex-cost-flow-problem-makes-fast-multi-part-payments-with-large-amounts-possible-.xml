    <summary>The Lightning Network has found a way to approximate the slow minimum convex cost flow computation via piecewise linearization of the min cost flow problem on the uncertainty network. The proposed solution generates several candidate paths for a solid approximation of the optimal MPP split. The code can compute a reasonable-looking approximation to the optimal solution in a sub-second runtime on the complete public channel graph of the Lightning Network. They discuss Mission Control information provided by lnd and express gratitude for a contribution that has allowed them to resume coding and intends to release a usable version soon. The author suggests pruning channels with high unit costs on the first segment, especially if they are further away from the source and destination node, to reduce the size of the graph and improve runtime. They have also worked on a heuristic that could throw away about 90% of all channels and found the same flow in the pruned network as on the full network. The email contains a long list of transactions with various details such as source node, target node, probability, and fee rate. The total probability of the entire flow is 0.0032, the total fee is 248793.763 sats, and the effective fee rate is 0.498%. The email thread discusses the possibility of combining parallel channels, which appears to be reasonable and may become necessary when considering fees and routing requests. However, split payments between parallel channels may not work well in practice due to routing node decisions and channel jamming. Leftovers after piecewise linearization could be pruned to reduce the size of the graph and improve runtime. The only requirement for the solver to work is that mu*fee_rate_ppm needs to be an integer.The discussion on zerobasefee suggests that HTLCs are always free to an attacker. However, the argument doesn't hold up as Zmn's approach for overweighing base fee can be used to let the market decide on the relative importance of optimized routing vs base fees. Martin's approximation research on the minimum convex cost flow formulation for multi-part payments on the lightning network is paywalled and not available at sci-hub.</summary>
