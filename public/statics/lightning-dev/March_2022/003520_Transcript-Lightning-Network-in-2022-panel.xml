    <summary>Recently, a panel discussion was held in London before the Advancing Bitcoin event featuring Christian Decker (c-lightning), Bastien Teinturier (eclair), and Oliver Gugger (LND). A transcript of this discussion has been posted on Github and will eventually be available on btctranscripts.com. The panel discussed various topics including different approaches to running a Lightning node and recent tensions in the BOLT spec process. Christian also provided a demo of Greenlight which is used for onboarding new Lightning nodes that run on external infrastructure while retaining control of keys. The individual implementation priorities for the coming year were also discussed. Michael Folkson shared this transcript with an email address and his contact information.</summary>
