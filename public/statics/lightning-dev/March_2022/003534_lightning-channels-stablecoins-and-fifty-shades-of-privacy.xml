    <summary>The context discusses the factors that affect privacy in Bitcoin transactions when large sums of money are involved, such as liquidity, anonymity set, amounts, type of addresses/scripts, block, locktime, and version. The absence of confidential transactions in Bitcoin makes it difficult for users to move large sums without being observed. While Coinjoin implementations have their own issues, Synonym's stablecoin transaction using Omni BOLT in a lightning channel could be a helpful solution. Bob can use 1000 BTC linked with an incident by opening channels with Alice and getting stablecoin that can be used in any project supporting Omni BOLT assets. However, the lightning channel capacity when using Omni BOLT and other improvements in this setup need further exploration.</summary>
