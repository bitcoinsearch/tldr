    <summary>Sergi Delgado has announced the release of alpha version for rust-teos, which is a lightning watchtower and a port of the original Python codebase. The new version has improved design, less boilerplate code, and better performance. Rust and LDK have played a major role in improving the functionality. The HTTP API is used for interaction with the user and tower while the internal interface is built using gRPC. The admin can interact with the backend through CLI. Currently, there is no client for the new tower as the old c-lightning's watchtower plugin needs to be updated. The codebase will benefit from some additional reviews and contributors. The code can be found on Github along with an architecture diagram.</summary>
