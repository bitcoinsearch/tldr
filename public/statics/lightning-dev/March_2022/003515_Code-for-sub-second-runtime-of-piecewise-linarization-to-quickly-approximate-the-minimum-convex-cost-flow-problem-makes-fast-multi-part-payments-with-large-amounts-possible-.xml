    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of combining parallel channels, which appears to be reasonable and may become necessary when considering fees and routing requests. However, split payments between parallel channels may not work well in practice due to routing node decisions and channel jamming. Mission Control (MC) information about channel balances may not be accurate for parallel channels as nodes can pick any of them. The size of piecewise linearization is discussed with the conclusion that splitting all channels into an equal number of pieces is well motivated. Leftovers after piecewise linearization could be pruned to reduce the size of the graph and improve runtime. The only requirement for the solver to work is that mu*fee_rate_ppm needs to be an integer.</summary>
