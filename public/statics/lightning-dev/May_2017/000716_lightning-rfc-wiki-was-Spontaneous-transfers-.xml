    <summary>In a recent conversation, a suggestion was made to document brainstorming ideas related to Lightning Network on the lightning-rfc wiki on Github. This would help in referencing these ideas and formulating them as BOLTs later. The idea was agreed upon by others as well. Additionally, there is much wrong judgment of Lightning elsewhere due to exposure to outdated papers and presentations. The lightning-rfc contains the latest spec, but it may be too technical for some.</summary>
