    <summary>A developer has submitted minor editorial patches to the lightning-rfc via email. Rusty Russell, on behalf of the Lightning Network team, thanked the developer for the patches but suggested that it would be better to submit them as GitHub pull requests to avoid spamming the mailing list. Russell also noted that the list is generally used for discussing large change proposals, though even these are better if they start with a GitHub patch. The developer's email contained three patches: one for 02-peer-protocol.md, one for 07-routing-gossip.md (moving a text about ipv6 and port from channel_update to node_announcement), and another for 07-routing-gossip.md (updating text about end indication). All patches were applied and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/161.</summary>
