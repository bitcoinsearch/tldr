    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Christian Decker expressed his concern about using `short_channel_id` as an alias for the endpoint, arguing that it felt wrong to perform a lookup for space-saving purposes. Additionally, he suggested removing the amount shorthands (k/m/g/...) from the proposal since invoices are not user-readable and would require people to convert BTC to SAT on their own. He proposed either getting rid of the shorthands or adding BTC shorthands as well. Despite his concerns, Decker praised the proposal overall, calling it clean and extensible with support for testnet. He also approved of using bech32 as a serialization format, which he believed could be shortened further than hex. Furthermore, he suggested supporting a different, human-readable encoding without changing the signature serialization. Lastly, he mentioned directly deriving a URI scheme from the bech32 encoded string by replacing the '1' with a ':'. Rusty Russell responded to Olaoluwa Osuntokun's opinion that the encoding utilized in the LN payreq use-case didn't carry over compelling traits from the Bitcoin address use-case. Russell agreed, but noted that the encoding was useful for QR codes and denser than hex. He implemented and pushed fallback addresses in the example encoder/decoder and tweaked the format slightly, making it complete. Despite some awkwardness in trying to get on 5 bit boundaries, Russell welcomed ideas from others.</summary>
