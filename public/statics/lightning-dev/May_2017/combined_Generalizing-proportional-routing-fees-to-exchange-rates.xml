    <summary>The author proposed a modification to the lightning protocol regarding the use of proportional routing fees. The author suggests that instead of advertising proportional routing fees, nodes should advertise a BTC-to-BTC exchange rate to generalize this exchange rate to cross-chain cases. A node needs to advertise multiple exchange rates for various coins. Currently, Lightning designates supported coins by hashes of their genesis blocks (32-byte `chain_hash`). An exchange rate denominated in ratio of 1/1,000,000 can be encoded in 4 bytes. Thus to advertise exchange rates a node provides 64 bytes to identify the coins being referred to, and 4 bytes for the actual exchange rate. For cross-chain exchange rates, a node needs to advertise both directions (e.g. LTC-to-BTC and BTC-to-LTC). One way to advertise would be to advertise a BTC-to-LTC exchange rate plus a rate offset. Moreover, there are two general problems with random currencies on lightning. Firstly, it's not clear why you'd want them once bitcoin has lightning. Secondly, we've made several assumptions that it's not free to create channels, which punts many DoS problems to the underlying blockchain. The author suggested that these added complexities into an already complex system need to translate all parameters into Bitcoin equivalent terms (CLTV, amount, off-chain fees, on-chain fees, etc.). Therefore, the author would like to punt this to a future version of the protocol.</summary>
