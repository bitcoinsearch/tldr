    <summary>The context discusses the possibility of using onion routes with on-chain and off-chain hops for exchanges. The discussion centers around the idea that anyone can be a cross-currency exchange without having problems about chicken-and-egg problems like "how do I receive LTC via Lightning if I don't have LTC to initiate a channel on the LTC side". The discussion also covers the reason why channel opens require the initiator to be the one, and the only one, to put up funding for the channel. Additionally, this approach is simpler and requires very little coordination. At the latest when the channel is being funded you'd see that information anyway. The ability to treat on-chain payments like any other lightning channel transfer is very nice and allows us to treat the on-chain payments identically to off-chain payments.</summary>
