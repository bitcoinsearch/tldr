    <summary>Christian Decker proposed a mechanism called splice-in/-out to solve the problem of topping up the funds in a channel. The mechanism involves creating a new 2-of-2 output and letting it confirm before asking the counterparty to collaborate in closing the channel by spending the funding transaction (TX) output and the prepared top-up output into a new 2-of-2 output. The settlement transaction is automatically the funding transaction of the new channel. This method allows for on-chain transactions directly from funds locked in a channel without the need for confirmation. It also eliminates the need to drain HTLCs before performing a splice operation. Christian is seeking feedback and comparisons with another proposal he presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop.</summary>
