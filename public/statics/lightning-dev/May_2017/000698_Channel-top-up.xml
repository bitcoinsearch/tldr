    <summary>In a conversation about the top-up problem in Lightning Network, ZmnSCPxj proposed a solution that reuses the same mechanism as onion routing with an on-chain transaction that allows Alice to top up her side of the channel without affecting the channel state and without keeping track of side funds. However, Christian pointed out that the proposal is complicated and raises the issue that HTLCs in the channel cannot use the topped-up funds unless they are aggregated first. ZmnSCPxj then suggested another mechanism called splice-in/out that would solve the top-up problem by closing a channel and reopening a new one right from the settlement, but Christian pointed out some risks involved such as a potential hostage situation. The two proposals were compared and feedback was requested. ZmnSCPxj also noted that the top-up procedure could be used as the first hop of an onion route for someone off-LN to pay into an LN node without committing funds to open a channel.</summary>
