    <summary>Christian Decker has suggested getting rid of shorthands or adding the BTC shorthands. The invoices are human-readable for some people, but converting BTC to SAT would have to be done by users if BTC units were not supported. Rusty Russell suggests using BTC with m (milli), u (micro), n (nano) and p (pico). He also likes the proposal and supports testnet. Rusty also mentions that they might consider supporting a different, human readable encoding without changing the signature serialization. Finally, he suggests turning this into BOLT 10 if people like this change.</summary>
