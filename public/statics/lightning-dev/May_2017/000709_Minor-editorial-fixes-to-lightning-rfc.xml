    <summary>In this context, ZmnSCPxj is thanking someone for making a contribution to the Lightning Network RFC repository on GitHub. They mention that it would be better to submit minor fixes as pull requests on GitHub to avoid spamming the mailing list, but they are happy to accept personal submissions if necessary. ZmnSCPxj also notes that the mailing list is generally used for discussing large change proposals, which should ideally start with a GitHub patch. The conversation ends with ZmnSCPxj expressing understanding and signing off.</summary>
