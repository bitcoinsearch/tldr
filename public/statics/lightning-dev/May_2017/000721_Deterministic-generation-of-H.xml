    <summary>The author of the email is asking if there is a way to deterministically generate H without revealing S to the generator while still being safe to use S to close the channel. They explain how with bitcoin addresses, BIP32 allows for the generation of a Master Private Key, which can be transformed into a Master Public Key and used to generate a series of addresses without the use of private keys. Similarly, with LN, a random value S is generated and hashed into H, which is then distributed along with S to close the channel. The author is seeking clarification on whether H can be generated deterministically like addresses using a Master Public Key.</summary>
