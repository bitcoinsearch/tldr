    <summary>The Lightning Network developers have discussed the issues of cross-chain payments and random currencies. They agreed that cross-chain transactions are complex and bring in a lot of complexity to an already complex system. The edge of the network refers to either the node performing the exchange or the endpoint creating the route. These are the only ones who need to concern themselves with the problems that come from this being a cross-chain transfer. There may be some added noise for other nodes when it comes to being able to prove things along routes. It is far more efficient to have them communicate out of band by creating an order book on top of the base network and do order matching in there, rather than attempting to fit this added complexity into LN itself. They also discussed the issue of random currencies on Lightning, saying that it is not clear why you would want them once Bitcoin has Lightning. If free channels were created, many DoS deterrents require Bitcoin-like on-chain fees to work at all, thus punting the risk onto the nodes straddling the chains. However, how attractive would their service be if they need to charge high fees to absorb that risk? The developers emphasized that they are currently focusing on slowing down the evolution of the 1.0 spec, so that they can finalize their implementations and start integration testing.</summary>
