    <summary>A proposal has been made to modify the lightning protocol with regards to proportional routing fees. The current exchange rate is not enough information for networks, as they also need to know block numbers for CLTV timeouts and network topology. These issues can be pushed to the edges of the network. There are also concerns about the use of random currencies on lightning, as it's unclear why they would be needed once bitcoin has lightning. Additionally, assumptions have been made that creating channels is not free, which protects against DoS attacks; if channels were free this protection would vanish. Lastly, there is a reluctance to add features to version 1.0 of the protocol in order to close down spec changes.</summary>
