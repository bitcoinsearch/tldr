    <summary>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj suggested two ways of making anonymous donations to controversial charities. The first option is for Alice to send `X+fees` to Bob and then `fees` back to herself, creating a circular route that masquerades the payment as an oversized fee deposited at Bob. This way, Alice can trigger the payment herself, but the sender's identity cannot be communicated to Bob. The second option is to create a gambling service where the payout of the winning amount is the second half of the route if Alice wins at all. Although the first option is probably the easiest and cleanest, the second one would allow the creation of a gambling service that does not know the identity of its players. ZmnSCPxj thinks this method is clever and even the receiver cannot leak information on the donors.</summary>
