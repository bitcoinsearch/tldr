    <summary>In an email conversation, Rusty Russell proposed using BTC with m (milli), u (micro), n (nano) and p (pico) to make invoices more readable. He also highlighted the confusion that can arise when converting prices due to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Russell's proposal was well received by Christian Decker who stated that it was clean, extensible, and supported testnet. Decker also suggested using bech32 as a serialization format and supporting a different, human-readable encoding. The discussion ended with the possibility of turning this into BOLT 10.</summary>
