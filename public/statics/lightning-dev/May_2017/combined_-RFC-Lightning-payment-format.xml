    <summary>The Lightning Network developer community has proposed a new payment request format, called BOLT 11, that enables users to send lightning payments between different wallets. The proposal includes a signature that covers the entire payreq, which would allow users to immediately verify the authenticity of the payreq and integrity of the contents without the use of an external mapping. The format ranges from approximately 181 characters upwards, and though it could be squeezed further, it uses a compressed serialized public key to refer to the destination, which is shorter than a full 33-byte pubkey. Rusty Russell put together a draft format for requesting lightning payments and an (incomplete) implementation. The human-readable amount within the prefix is nice for UX as one can quickly see how much one is about to pay/receive, however, these payment requests can get rather long, so there is no need for bech32 character optimization for manual entry. In addition, the proposal allows payment requests to include a timestamp and an expiry date, useful for cases where users have only a particular time window to make the payment.</summary>
