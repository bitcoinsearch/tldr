    <summary>A member of the Lightning-dev forum, ZmnSCPxj, had shared a patch that was difficult to apply due to issues with line-wrapping and whitespace. Another member of the forum took it upon themselves to fix these errors and worked through spelling mistakes as well. They also added a Travis check to prevent further introduction of errors. The fixed patch can be found on Github. ZmnSCPxj apologized for the trouble caused by the original patch and thanked the other member for fixing and improving it.</summary>
