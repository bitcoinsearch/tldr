    <summary>The Lightning Network, a protocol for off-chain bitcoin payments that is being developed, has anticipated a major problem that could arise in its implementation. Specifically, the network may be more vulnerable to probing attacks than other payment channels such as hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs). In response, the developers have devised a solution that utilises XORing to make it harder to probe the network and to effectively turn the lightning node into a gambling casino. Lightning nodes will need to hold funds to act as participants in the channel, but there will be no risk of loss if they are used only as a relay.</summary>
