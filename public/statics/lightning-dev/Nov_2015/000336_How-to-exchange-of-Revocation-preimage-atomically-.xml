    <summary>Nicolas Dorier, a Bitcoin developer, expressed concern over a potential attack on the Lightning Network protocol. He was reviewing bip 112 and noticed that HLTC has a vulnerability. When both parties want to revoke a commitment, they need to exchange the revocation preimage. However, if not done atomically, Alice can intentionally withhold her revocation, preventing Bob from withdrawing his funds. The process involves exchanging new commit tx signatures followed by the revocation of old commit tx. If Alice fails to perform the second step, Bob still has the new commit tx he can drop on the blockchain. Rusty, another Bitcoin developer, acknowledged the issue and provided a solution.</summary>
