    <summary>Nicolas Dorier raised concerns regarding the difficulty in solving a problem related to dust amount, which is not constant and depends on minTxRelayFee that is dynamic, and is affected by the mempool state of each node. However, another person disagrees with this and suggests that IsDust depends on the global minTxRelayFee from main, which is not dynamic like the one used in the mempool. The decoupling of mintxrelayfee from dust is necessary, but there have been problems during implementation due to circular dependency. A proposal was made to tie dust definition to transaction's fee. This discussion took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
