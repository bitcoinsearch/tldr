    <summary>In an email thread from November 2015, Anthony Towns suggests adding further constraints on timeouts based on fees so as to avoid being left holding the bag. He also suggests batching timeouts for better efficiency. Anthony recommends expiring 1000 concurrent HTLCs on a channel in five batches of 20 instead of individually, allowing them all to be spent to a single output. This saves 19*34 bytes in that transaction and about 19*130 bytes when spending the outputs. The overall saving of 2c or more per batched HTLC is achieved with 40 satoshi/byte fees @ $350/BTC. According to the 100kB standardness limit on transactions, there can be at most about 3000 concurrent committed HTLCs on a channel assuming the anchor is a single multisig transaction and the outputs are all P2SH.</summary>
