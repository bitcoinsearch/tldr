    <summary>The speaker is learning about Lightning Network and reviewing BIP 112 when they notice a potential attack with HLTC. When both parties want to revoke a commitment, they need to send one to another the revocation preimage. However, if not done atomically, Alice intentionally not sending her revocation after receiving Bob's can prevent Bob from withdrawing his funds. The speaker wonders if they are missing something and suggests that requiring a third party may be a solution but this defeats the whole purpose.</summary>
