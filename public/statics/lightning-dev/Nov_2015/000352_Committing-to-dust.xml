    <summary>The issue at hand, as documented on https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/14, is that the problem involving dust amount is not easily solved due to its inconsistency. This inconsistency arises from the fact that the dust amount depends on minTxRelayFee, which in turn is dependent on the mempool state of each node. In order to solve this issue, a way to decouple minTxRelayFee from dust is needed. One proposal involved tying the definition of dust to the transaction's fee. However, during implementation, a circular dependency gave rise to problems.</summary>
