    <summary>In this communication, Pierre asked if there were any resources available on "segregated witness" but did not find any. Another person in the conversation, Doug, informed him that Pieter has posted code for a hard fork version of segregated witness on GitHub. The code can be found at https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/commit/663e9bd32965008a43a008d1d26ea09cbb14e83aa. However, Doug did not know of any public soft fork code.</summary>
