    <summary>Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns have come up with two different approaches for a complicated method called revealP. The alternative approach by andytoshi and Anthony Towns is more complex than the other. The revealP function has three signatures, sigA, sigB, and sigC, and three different pubkeys, P, Q, and R. The scriptPubkey has pubkey P and stack operations to implement the function, while the scriptSig only has Q, R, and the three signatures. Anthony Towns raises concerns that this approach may not work as it requires all three signatures to share the same r and SIGHASH settings, which is mathematically possible but should be safely intractable.</summary>
