    <summary>On November 24th, 2015, Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns discussed the introduction of new opcodes with the segregated witness proposal. While Russell believed that it would be easy to introduce new opcodes, Towns did not understand how this was possible. Russell clarified that the first byte of SW script is a version byte, and if one does not understand that version, the script will succeed. This allows for adding ops that change the contents of the stack as a soft fork instead of a hard fork. However, Russell did not believe that this was necessary in their current situation.</summary>
