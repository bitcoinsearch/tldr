    <summary>Nicolas Dorier, who was learning about the Lightning Network, noticed a potential attack when reviewing bip 112. He pointed out that when both parties want to revoke a commitment, they need to send one another the revocation preimage, but if not done atomically, Alice intentionally not sending her revocation after receiving Bob's would prevent Bob from withdrawing his funds. He wondered if he was missing something or if requiring a third party is the only way of fixing this, expecting he does not collude, which defeats the purpose. Tadge replied that all payments are "push" payments, and in practice, every update of a channel state has an initiator. He explained how the process works and said itâ€™s not atomic so payer goes first. Therefore, if Alice doesn't do the second step, Bob still has the new commit tx he can drop on the blockchain.</summary>
