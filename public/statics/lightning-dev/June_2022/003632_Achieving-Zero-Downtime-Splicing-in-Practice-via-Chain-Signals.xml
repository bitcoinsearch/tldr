    <summary>The conversation between Rusty and Olaoluwa Osuntokun discusses the issue of reliable gossip in routing. Rusty argues that relying on a wait time is simpler than waiting for reliable gossip, but Olaoluwa counters that there is no guarantee of message propagation time. He also suggests that ratelimiting may prevent some nodes from receiving all updates. Olaoluwa proposes using an on-chain signal to indicate when a splice is in progress, to ensure that routers do not lose out on potential fee revenue and sends/receivers continue to use channels. Rusty suggests treating every close as signaling "stay tuned for the gossip message" instead.</summary>
