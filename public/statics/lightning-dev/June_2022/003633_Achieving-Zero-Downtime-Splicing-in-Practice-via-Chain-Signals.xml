    <summary>The move to taproot/gossip v2 aims to make lightning's on-chain footprint indistinguishable from any other on-chain usage, which runs counter to the proposal of adding an on-chain detectable signal. The severity of a comms failure is minimal, and the suggested solution of waiting for a certain number of blocks before channel closure may not be foolproof. It takes approximately an hour for gossip to propagate, and 12 blocks is a reasonable estimate for waiting time. More robust signaling can be added later if lost routing fees become a significant problem. Alex Myer's minisketch project may also improve gossip reconciliation efficiency, making gossip reliability less of an issue.</summary>
