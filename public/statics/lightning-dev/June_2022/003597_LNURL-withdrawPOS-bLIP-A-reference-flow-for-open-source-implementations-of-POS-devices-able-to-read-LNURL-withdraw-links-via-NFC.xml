    <summary>David Coen has submitted a pull request for a new bLIP for a common NFC payment flow that uses LNURL protocol, specifically LNURL-withdraw sub-protocol, called LNURL-withdrawPOS. This is NOT a new LNURL sub-protocol but an attempt to reach an open and common standard for the receiving part of the flow (merchant Point of Sale with NFC sensor). LNURL-withdraw gives users the ability to receive funds via Lightning Network without the need of manually creating an invoice. Users scan a QRcode or paste the LNURL-withdraw link into their wallet, this queries a server and gets a JSON with some info, such as the max amount the user can receive, the min amount the user can request, etc.In this repo, David schematizes a LNURL-withdraw flow for POS, which sees the interaction between the user and a POS equipped with an NFC sensor. This bLIP serves to document what could be a reference flow for open source implementations of POS devices able to read LNURL-withdraw links via NFC, for a better UX in Lightning payments powered by LNURL protocol.There are already solutions that use this common flow or are going to implement it. David is having calls to push the adoption of this open standard, and he invites the representatives of the implementations to signal their support to this flow by adding themselves to the table available at https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LNURL-withdrawPOS and to support this bLIP. Before adding your implementation to this list, be sure it is open source, fully interoperable, and respects the LNURL-withdraw specs (LUD03).BTCpay's LNURL NFC Support plugin by Andrew Camilleri, Coincorner's checkout system, IBEX Mercado's Point of Sale, and Fast Bitcoins's Point of Sale are some of the reference implementations. David is open to discussing this even via call: simply select a date from his calendar at https://calendly.com/thedavidcoen.</summary>
