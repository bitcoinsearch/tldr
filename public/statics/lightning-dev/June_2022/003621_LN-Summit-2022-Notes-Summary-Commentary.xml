    <summary>In a discussion about the Lightning Network (LN) protocol's latency sensitivity, Christian Decker notes that slow signers should not cause too many issues, except for slower forwards in the case of routing nodes. However, if forwarding nodes take a full second to forward a payment, it may be necessary to avoid such nodes. Matt Corallo suggests that while he would prefer all forwarding nodes to take 30 seconds to improve privacy, users expect payments to complete within 100ms with multiple retries in between. Peter Todd raises the possibility of allowing users to opt-in to slower payments for privacy, particularly for automated payments like rebalancing.</summary>
