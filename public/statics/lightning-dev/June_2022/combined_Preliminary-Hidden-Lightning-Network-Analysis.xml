    <summary>Over the past few months, Tony Giorgio has been working on an LDK probing project that searches for unannounced channels on the Lightning Network. He found nearly 445 unannounced channels, totalling 1,076,077,750 satoshis locked across three nodes he probed. These results have been made public on Github. The use of verbose error messages and channel IDs based on UTXOs have made it possible to exploit channel privacy. To address this issue, Tony suggests migrating to alias SCIDs and avoiding error messages that reveal private information. In a conversation with René Pickhardt, they discuss the possibility of probabilistically learning which nodes tend to have unannounced channels by looking at wallets' poor utxo management and on-chain signals. They agree that these strategies can reduce the number of tested nodes and make it feasible to probe the network as new blocks come in.Tony emphasizes the need for alias SCIDs to improve privacy, causing nodes to request a channel by a random value rather than the value derived from the on-chain transaction. He encourages every active unannounced channel holder to close, coinjoin, and reopen with an alias. Until this migration happens, it would be beneficial to stop being so specific about errors. Tony plans to continue his probing project while fixing efficiency bugs and narrowing down the other channel partner. It is important to note that Rene mentions the exploit with short_channel_ids has been known since 2019 and highlights the use of error codes of onions.
