    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Bitcoin developer Peter Todd proposed the idea of allowing users to opt-in for slower payment processing for increased privacy. Todd suggested that allowing payments to occur more slowly could be beneficial for rebalancing and other automated processes. While it may not be practical to hold onto an HTLC (hashed time-locked contract) for too long, waiting a second instead of 100ms to batch transactions could still provide benefits without creating capacity issues. The idea is seen as an interesting one by some in the Bitcoin community.</summary>
