    <summary>Christian Decker, a developer of Lightning Network(LN) protocol, mentions that the LN protocol is generally not very latency sensitive and can handle slow signers without causing issues. However, if forwarding nodes start taking a full second to forward a payment, it may become necessary to avoid such nodes. Users expect payments to complete in 100ms with multiple payment retries in between. While it may not be possible to achieve this in lightning, a good goal would be to get 95th percentile payments down to one second to avoid retrying payments. Implementing a timeout on the peer level is not recommended, but it may need to be handled in route selection if it becomes more of an issue going forward.</summary>
