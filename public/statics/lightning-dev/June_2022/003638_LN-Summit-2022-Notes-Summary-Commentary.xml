    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the Lightning Network protocol, Christian Decker mentioned that the LN protocol is generally not very latency sensitive and can handle slow signers without causing too many issues. He said that routing node signers should be well below the 1 second mark, even with more complex signer logic, including MuSig2 or nested FROST. However, Matt Corallo expressed concern about forwarding nodes taking a full second to forward payments. He believes that getting 95th percentile payments down to one second is a good goal, something that requires never having to retry payments and having forwarding nodes not take more than 150ms. While he doesn't think introducing a timeout on the peer level is necessary, he suggests handling it in route selection if it becomes more of an issue going forward. Christian agreed that while edge nodes may benefit from relaxed timings, routers should strive to be as fast as possible.</summary>
