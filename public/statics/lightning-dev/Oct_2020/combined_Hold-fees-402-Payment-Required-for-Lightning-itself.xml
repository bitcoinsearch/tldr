    <summary>The Lightning Network has been a topic of discussion due to concerns about undesired usage such as spamming and incapacitating channels. While rate limits and other limits can mitigate these issues, they may also limit the capabilities of honest users. Trustless payment schemes have been explored, but none seem satisfactory, leading to the suggestion that a small bit of trust may not be so bad.To address this issue, Joost Jager suggests introducing hold fees as a way of incentivizing good behavior. The proposed hold fee system allows peers to charge each other for forwarded HTLCs based on lock time and HTLC value. The asymmetry of hold fees is meant to prevent channel jamming attacks, but it requires trust between peers. Two options for implementing hold fees are proposed: option A involves prepaying a channel peer who deducts the hold fees until zero, while option B integrates the prepaid fees with the HTLC add/fail/settle messages. Both options require trust between peers, and concerns have been raised about nodes stealing payments or artificially delaying forwarding to inflate hold fees.Rusty Russell expresses concern about spam attacks on the Lightning Network and highlights the possibility of attackers using low-reputation nodes to jam up high-reputation channels. To address this issue, Joost Jager proposes a hold fee system, where peers charge each other for forwarded HTLCs based on lock time and HTLC value. The proposed hold fee system is looser than previously proposed schemes, and it allows for interesting dynamics on the network. Routing nodes with a strong relationship may decide not to charge hold fees to each other at all.Overall, the discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation emphasizes the importance of addressing potential adversaries and prioritizing the spam/jam issue in Lightning development. While there are concerns about adding trust to the network, the proposed hold fee system allows for interesting dynamics and may reach an equilibrium that is healthy in terms of decentralization and privacy.The Lightning Network could be attacked by a party intentionally causing delays in transactions. To address this issue, the proposal suggests implementing an upfront payment made by the sender. However, there are concerns that attackers could still collect forward payments, leading to short-lived controlled spam attacks. The proposed solution involves adding a hold grace period field to channel updates and introducing two new fields in the TLV extension of update_add_htlc.Joost and Bastien have also discussed proposals for bidirectional upfront payments and hold grace periods. Ultimately, it is important for the Lightning Network to prioritize finding a good anti-DoS system to prevent potential bias towards centralization as outside systems establish themselves.There are also discussions related to trustless offchain-to-onchain swaps, where the swap service will generally be forced to pay up the hold fees as claiming the offchain side is dependent on claiming the onchain side of the trustless swap mechanism which is slow. There are concerns about communication latency delaying responses and introducing fixed upfront payments instead of scaling approaches. Finally, ZmnSCPxj explains the process of revoking and acknowledging a channel in case of a griefing attack, while discussions also focus on potential weaknesses such as griefing attacks and potential deanonymization of sender/recipient nodes.Joost Jager discusses two attacks on the Lightning Network that involve exploiting the hold fee charging mechanism. The first attack involves an intermediary node losing funds while another party gains funds, allowing an attacker to extract funds from the intermediary node and ultimately siphon all of the low-reputation (LOW-REP) node's funds. The second attack involves an attacker node receiving an HTLC from a victim and charging hold fees without forwarding the payment. It was noted that penalizing the attacker in the first attack could be done if the forward fee decrements at each hop, but it needs to be in the onion and the delta needs to be high enough to actually penalize the attacker. There was also a discussion about potential griefing attacks in the implementation of the grace period.The proposal is that this spam/jam issue needs to be prioritized and solved before real adversaries show up. Jager assumes that high-reputation (HIGH-REP) nodes will not collaborate with attackers and this proposal can work in practice. However, this attack requires an untrusted attacker node to charge hold fees but does not jeopardize the reputation of the HIGH-REP node that collaborates with the attacker.</summary>
