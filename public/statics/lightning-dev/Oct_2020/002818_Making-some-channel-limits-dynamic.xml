    <summary>In a conversation about dynamic channel parameters, a user expresses the desire to raise `htlc_minimum_msat` on some large channels to limit payments to big amounts. However, this could cause issues with MPP as the assumption is that smaller amounts are more likely to be successful. As a solution, the use of big payments could be seen as an aggregation, allowing for rebalancing through high-`htlc_minimum_msat` channels.</summary>
