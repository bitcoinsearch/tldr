    <summary>In this conversation between Bastien and Darosior, they discuss the idea of fundees paying a portion of the commit-tx on-chain fees in certain cases. Bastien suggests that if they don't do this, it could result in a web-of-trust network limiting channels to only those who trust each other. Darosior agrees with this idea but proposes a middle-ground solution where funders only pay for the "backbone" fees of the channel and fees necessary to secure transaction confirmations are paid by each interested party in the future anchor outputs. They credit ZmnSCPxj for pointing this out to them on IRC.</summary>
