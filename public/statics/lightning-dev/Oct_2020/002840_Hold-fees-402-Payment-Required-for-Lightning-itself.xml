    <summary>In this context, ZmnSCPxj discusses a potential attack on the lightning network by exploiting pre-existing trust relationships between intermediaries. By forwarding the payment through multiple nodes, the attacker could lock up the capacity of less-capitalized competitors in the payment forwarding business. The primary attackers would be the payer and payee who are coordinating with each other to lock up the funds of other lesser-capacity nodes. To protect against such attacks, tr\*stworthiness needs to be judged without revealing identities.</summary>
