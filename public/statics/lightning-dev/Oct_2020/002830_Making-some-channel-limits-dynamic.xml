    <summary>The proposal suggests adding tlv records in `commitment_signed` to tell the channel peer that the values of certain fields are changing. This fits well with the "parameter re-negotiation" portion of the loose Dynamic commitments proposal. With this, both sides would be able to propose/accept/deny updates to the flow control parameters that can be used to increase the security of a channel or implement a sort of "slow start" protocol for new peers. The dynamic HTLC bandwidth allocation mechanism would serve to mitigate several classes of attacks and give forwarding nodes more control of how their allocated bandwidth is utilized by all connected peers. One other value that should be dynamic to protect against future unexpected events is the dust limit.</summary>
