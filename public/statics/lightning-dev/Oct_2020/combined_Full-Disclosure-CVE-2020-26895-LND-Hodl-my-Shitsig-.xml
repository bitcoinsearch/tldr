    <summary>A vulnerability has been identified in the Lightning Network protocol that could lead to attackers stealing in-flight HTLCs. The vulnerability is related to high-S signatures, which are not tx-relay standard and won't be relayed/mined on the regular p2p network, but are still consensus-valid. The LND team has adopted a solution to normalize any high-S signature provided by the counterparty to a tx-relay standard one. Lightning node security relies on being able to unilaterally broadcast channel transactions to enforce an off-chain negotiated balance. Channel transactions are asymmetric, and each party owns a different version including all parties' balances/HTLCs.This vulnerability highlights the importance of transaction standardness, which is a set of supplementary anti-DoS rules on top of Bitcoin consensus rules, and affects other time-sensitive multi-party protocols such as vaults/CoinSwaps. Tx-relay standardness issues pose a systematic risk for layer 2 protocols relying on time-sensitive transactions. Another vulnerability has also been identified in the Lightning Network protocol related to the expiration of a preimage with outdated utility. This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the Flood &amp; Loot paper and could lead to the exploitation of channel timelocks. The LND team fixed the vulnerability and released lnd v0.10.0-beta, followed by v0.11.0-beta. It is recommended that Lightning Network users upgrade their software to the latest version to avoid potential attacks. The CVE-2020-26895 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A wider discussion on the topic can be found on the bitcoin-dev mailing list archive.</summary>
