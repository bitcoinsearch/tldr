    <summary>The idea of using an upfront payment system instead of relying on reputation to decide acceptance of HTLC issuers has been proposed. However, this may not be without complications for newcomers who fear that the node they connect with might not forward their payment and instead fail it and claim the upfront fees. The first hop may also prefer to just fail the HTLC and steal all the upfront fees. There is a proposal to require the first hop to prove where along the route errored so that it can claim more as upfront fees since it will forward the upfront fees to the later hop as well, but this may introduce an attack vector. A web-of-trust might not be so bad as anyone can look at the blockchain and network gossip to get an idea of who is generally considered trustworthy. However, this risks centralization around existing, long-lived nodes.</summary>
