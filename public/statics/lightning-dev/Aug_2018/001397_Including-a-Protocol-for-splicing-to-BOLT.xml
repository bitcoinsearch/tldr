    <summary>One of the most frequently requested features by users and developers is spontaneous payments. Recently, it was discovered that this feature can be easily achieved if the payer generates a preimage and hash and includes the preimage in the sphinx message to the payee node. This method is mostly used for donations and does not require any proof of payment. If the payee node is able to recognize the sphinx message format and has access to the preimage, they can claim the payment. The implementation of this feature could potentially improve user experience and simplify the payment process.</summary>
