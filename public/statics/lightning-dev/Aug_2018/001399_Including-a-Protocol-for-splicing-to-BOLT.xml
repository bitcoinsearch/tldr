    <summary>In an email exchange between Christian Decker and Corné Plooy via Lightning-dev, they discuss the most requested feature of spontaneous payments. Plooy notes that spontaneous payments can be easily realized if the payer generates the preimage and hash, and includes the preimage in the sphinx message to the payee node. Decker responds, reminding Plooy of the information already present on the Brainstorming wiki. He also comments that the wiki should be more prominent. The conversation ends with a link to the specific section of the wiki that discusses the passing of a transfer secret in the onion.</summary>
