    <summary>Christian Decker is a member of the W3C Web Payments Working Group and is following the discussion to determine what changes and special considerations are needed for Bitcoin and Lightning to work correctly when the spec is finalized and deployed. The current spec should be compatible with both Bitcoin and Lightning, but a special Payment Method ID needs to be assigned to them since they cannot rely on a centralized URL to act as a payment method. A local handler can be specified as Payment Handler, which allows for a Bitcoin or Lightning daemon to run locally that is invoked for payment requests. The Payment Request API even mentions XBT as a supported currency, in addition to ISO4217 codes. Special handling is required for Bitcoin and Lightning with regard to the Payment Method, therefore, the Payment Method Manifest doesn't apply to them. This suggests that Bitcoin and Lightning should work with the spec without any major roadblocks. The W3C Web Payments Working Group is looking for feedback on their GitHub repository.</summary>
