    <summary>In this conversation between Robert and ZmnSCPxj, ZmnSCPxj proposes the idea of using normal onion-routing modified in some way to read and modify max for rebalancing. ZmnSCPxj believes that rebalancing is good for many reasons as it solves problems where a node has only one channel to send out via and has even fewer if a certain channel goes down. For example, if there exists any D-C channel, A asks whomever it may concern if sending 100 sat A-&gt;D-&gt;C-&gt;A would benefit them as well and if it does, you send over 100 sat and will end up with a balanced network. However, Robert questions the state before and after of channel D-C and postulates that in any case where rebalancing is possible, then a payment route exists that is sufficient for payment to the network, and in the end, the purpose of LN is payment, not some ideal of channel balance. He suggests that dynamic fee changing is sufficient and requires no update to the base LN protocol.</summary>
