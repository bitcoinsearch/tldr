    <summary>Kulpreet Singh has shared his early results on measuring the centrality of nodes and the dependence on some nodes to route payments and prevent network partitions in the Lightning Network. He measured the centrality of nodes and the central point dominance based on betweenness. He also measured the number of articulation points in the network. Singh suggests that this is just a start and that they should look at treating LN as a directed graph and perform analysis based on treating LN as a flow network. In response, Ren√© Pickhardt shares his first draft for the c-lightning autopilot and the 4 heuristics he implemented to select nodes to which one could connect. One heuristic samples from the nodes that contribute to the high diameter. Pickhardt believes this heuristic should reduce the articulation points and biconnected components. Singh plans to publish the json output he got from LND when he gets around to plotting his results on a chart so they can verify he is not making an error somewhere.</summary>
