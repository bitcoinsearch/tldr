    <summary>Swayam expressed interest in measuring the network topology of the lightning network and asked if they could obtain a graph or all measurements from explorer sites such as 1ml.com. Davison suggested that Swayam could look up the information on explorer sites like 1ml.org, but Artem asked for clarification on what Swayam meant by "measure". If Swayam wanted to know how many nodes and channels there were, they would need to connect to any LN node and set the initial_routing_sync flag in the init message. This would prompt the peer to send the whole gossip dump containing node and channel info of every public node/channel (sans channel capacities). Alternatively, if Swayam did not want to make anything but just to query their c-lightning node, they could use listnodes and listchannels commands with lightning-cli. Finally, if Swayam wanted to get the information without doing anything or running a node, they could look it up on explorer sites like 1ml.org.</summary>
