    <summary>A member of the Lightning-dev community has asked if any companies are members of W3C and if anyone could be a member of the W3C Web Payments Working Group. Christian Decker is mentioned as being a member in a previous email, which the community member finds awesome. The W3C has released their candidate recommendation for a payment API, which will be published no earlier than October 31st 2018. They are currently looking for feedback on their GitHub repository. Bitcoin is mentioned in the API, but it would be even cooler if lightning payments were compatible with their recommendation. The community member asks Christian for an update on the work and how relevant it is for them.</summary>
