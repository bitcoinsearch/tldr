    <summary>The Lightning development team is currently considering several proposals to improve routing success rates for payments, particularly larger ones. One of the proposed solutions involves adding an optional funding transaction and merkle proof to the channel_announce message or creating a new channel_announce_with_proof message. Another idea is to tunnel Bitcoin block headers to help lite nodes.Robert Olsson has suggested appending an HTLC maximum value to the channel_update message. This proposal would not affect older implementations and could be discarded by nodes that check the blockchain. Privacy concerns are addressed by making revealing local balances optional.The Lightning-dev mailing list is discussing a proposal to include the total channel capacity in the channel_announcement message, which currently requires checking the blockchain. Robert Olsson suggests appending the max capacity to channel_update, while Christian Decker argues that the announcement is the right place for this information. Artem questions the rationale for not including channel capacity in the channel_announcement message, which can make route-finding tools complex and decrease routing success rates.During a channel discussion, Christian explained the importance of including information about channel IDs in the announcement. Splice-in and splice-out actions result in new short channel IDs. The context suggests that channel IDs are crucial for the functioning and existence of the channel, but no further details were provided.</summary>
