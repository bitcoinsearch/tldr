    <summary>Kulpreet has been considering ways to measure the centrality of nodes in the Lightning Network (LN) graph and their dependence for routing payments and preventing network partitions. He believes that measuring and tracking changes in key metrics could assist the community in deciding which nodes to open new channels with. To achieve this, he measured the centrality of nodes and central point dominance using methods from two well-known papers. The first paper is by Lindon C. Freeman, "A Set of Measures of Centrality Based on Betweenness", Sociometry 40, pp. 35-41, 1977. The second paper is by Robert E. Tarjan, "Depth first search and linear graph algorithms" SIAM Journal on Computing, 1(2):146-160, 1972. Kulpreet acknowledges that his approach is just a start and that further analysis should be done treating LN as a directed graph and analyzing it as a flow network. However, he is eager to share his early results and welcomes any feedback or suggestions. Kulpreet wrote a Medium post where he elaborates on the choice of the two metrics and what they mean for LN.
