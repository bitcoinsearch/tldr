    <summary>Robert Olsson, a Lightning Network developer, has provided a way to access raw graph data from one of his nodes for those who do not have a node themselves. The data can be accessed through https://rompert.com/networkgraph and it is the same information used on the Recksplorer site. In a previous conversation on the Lightning-dev mailing list, users discussed ways to measure the network topology of the Lightning Network. One user suggested using explorer sites like 1ml.org to get the information without running a node. Another user recommended connecting to any LN node and setting the initial_routing_sync flag in the init message which will prompt the peer to send the whole gossip dump, containing node and channel info of every public node/channel (sans channel capacities).</summary>
