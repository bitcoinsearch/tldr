    <title>Possibility to Include refund invoice in lightning payments</title>

    <summary>A Lightning Dev has proposed the idea of attaching a refund invoice to any Lightning Network (LN) payment, giving the recipient the option to fully or partially refund the payment or even tip a higher amount back to the sender. The user wallet would pay a normal LN invoice with an additional 0 sat invoice attached for the refund. The refund protocol would need to be agreed upon by the wallet to ensure a seamless user experience. On the recipient's side, they would receive a normal LN invoice and store it to perform a spontaneous refund later if desired, as the invoice amount is not predefined. This could have use cases in promotions, refunds, safety deposits, and spontaneous payouts in games. Alternatives like Hodl invoice exist but are limited as they only offer an "all or nothing" refund option. The proposal requires the payer to generate an invoice and include it encoded in the payment request as payload, while the receiver must be able to settle the actual payment and optionally support the feature of storing the refund invoice. The proposal is seeking resources or hints for further development and implementation.</summary>
