    <summary>In an email exchange between Bastien TEINTURIER and ZmnSCPxj, they discussed the use of the collaborative path in taproot-tweaked public key. The bip-taproot proposal specifically disallows all `SIGHASH` that is not the current set of valid `SIGHASH` flags when using this path, and thus does not include `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`/`SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT`. New `SIGHASH` types *are* allowed in bip-tapscript (i.e. when signing for a `OP_CHECKSIG` variant inside a taproot script), and this is where the proposal of aj builds upon. ZmnSCPxj believes there is no point in using the collaborative path unless they are cooperatively closing. He further added that once they are cooperatively closing, they can agree to spend the funding txo without requiring that `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` be used since they already have fallbacks in case of cooperation failure, i.e. the existing update/settlement txes.</summary>
