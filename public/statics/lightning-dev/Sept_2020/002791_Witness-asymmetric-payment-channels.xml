    <summary>In an email exchange, Lloyd Fournier and ZmnSCPxj discuss the complexity of a new proposal for Lightning Network channel updates. Fournier believes there is an improvement in conceptual complexity over the current BOLT spec, but also notes a worse storage complexity due to the need to keep around encrypted signatures. This could be a fatal flaw unless addressed. ZmnSCPxj points out that the proposed setup would not reduce storage complexity as much as expected, and raises concerns about synchronizing between both sides when using "the same" transaction. They suggest solutions such as passing a token or having different transactions on both sides, but note that these could come with tradeoffs.</summary>
