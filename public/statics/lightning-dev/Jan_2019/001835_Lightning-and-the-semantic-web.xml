    <summary>In an email conversation between Rene and Melvin, Rene suggests that Melvin should look into the W3C Payment Group, who are working on a recommendation for browser vendors to enable low-level payment APIs. He also mentions LightningJoule, which builds on top of webln, and while not an ontology, it goes in a similar direction. Melvin, who works on the Solid project, expresses his interest in integrating Lightning with Solid, and asks if anyone knows of any existing work in creating an ontology for this purpose or would be interested in collaborating.</summary>
