    <summary>The author of the message proposes a concrete plan for feature bits. The first step is to rename 'local features' to 'peer features', and 'global features' to 'routing features.' Secondly, the two types of features should share a number space so that they do not overlap. Thirdly, both the peer and routing features should be put in `features` in node announcements. However, even bits should never be used for peer features. This plan will allow the use of node_announcement as a way to connect to a peer that supports feature X and also as a means to determine whether a node can be used for routing. In addition, DNS seed filtering might support filtering only by pairs of bits in the future.</summary>
