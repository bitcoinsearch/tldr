    <summary>Melvin Carvalho, a developer working with the Solid project, expressed interest in integrating Lightning Network concepts into the semantic web. In order to achieve this, he proposed creating an ontology and asked if anyone had existing work in this area or was interested in collaborating on an ontology.René Pickhardt responded to the post and suggested taking the vocabulary for Lightning Network from the BOLT 07 which defines the gossip messages, as there are inconsistencies in naming across implementations. René created an overview of the terms specified in other bolts and made a Pull Request to the repository which has not been merged yet.The example outputs from c-lightning demonstrate the differences in the naming of identifiers for nodes between LND, c-lightning and BOLT07. Melvin Carvalho will go with RFC naming for nodes and edges. Regarding the four address types, in particular the semantic web likes URIs with a scheme or protocol so instead of example.com, http://example.com is preferred. In this context, lightning: could be used for all four address types.Melvin's observation is that two fundamental concepts in Lightning Network are channels and nodes. Two data structures in lnd describe graph for channels and nodes respectively. René Pickhardt suggested creating a vocabulary for Lightning Network terms and documenting their meaning, which would aid in making it self-documenting. He also asked if the terms were consistent across different implementations.</summary>
