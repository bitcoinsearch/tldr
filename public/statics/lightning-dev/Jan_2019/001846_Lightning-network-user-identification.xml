    <summary>In a forum post, Jo√£o Joyce inquired if there is a way to identify a user across multiple LN requests or even authenticate the user in a single step using a Lightning Network wallet. He presented several use cases where this feature would be beneficial, such as a pay-per-view event where users could buy the right to view the event by scanning the QR code on the billboard. A music-streaming company could print QR codes on posters and users could instantly get the album on the music-streaming app on their phone by scanning the code. Additionally, vending machines or similar services could provide anonymous frequent-user discounts or reward points for users. Arcade games could also benefit from identifying users across multiple plays and different machines, providing high scores and user performance statistics, as well as multiplayer gaming while keeping user identity, scores, and in-game items intact. The post concludes with a question about the current possibility of this feature.</summary>
