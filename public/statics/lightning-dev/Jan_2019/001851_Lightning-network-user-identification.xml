    <summary>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, a user has raised concerns about user identification in the context of payments for goods and services. They suggest that using something like SQRL or BitID could provide some level of anonymity, but it would require users to keep separate apps for login and payments, which could be confusing and inconvenient. Instead, they propose a scenario where a user can go to an ebook store, select a book, scan a Lightning Network invoice, and confirm payment and identity in one action without creating an account or logging in. Another user suggests using the payment preimage as a unique userID, which would ensure that userIDs are only usable if paid for. The original user questions the need for multiple apps and the privacy risks associated with services that require personal information such as email accounts, while expressing a willingness to allow services to keep records of their purchases and high scores if done anonymously and securely.</summary>
