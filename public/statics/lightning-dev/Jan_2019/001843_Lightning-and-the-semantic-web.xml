    <summary>The email is about the inconsistency in vocabulary used across different implementations of Lightning Network. The author suggests taking the vocabulary from the BOLT 07, which defines the gossip messages and other terms specified in other bolts, to create a consistent vocabulary. They also provide an overview by hand of the terms specified in other bolts. Two examples of outputs from c-lightning are given to demonstrate how the naming of the vocabulary differs. Melvin Carvalho responds by suggesting creating a vocabulary for lightning concepts to the semantic web, which could be achieved by creating an ontology. He asks if there is any existing work in this area or if someone is interested in collaborating on an ontology.</summary>
