    <summary>In an email conversation between Bretton Vine and Melvin Carvalho, they discuss the first steps towards integration of lightning concepts to the semantic web. Melvin suggests creating an ontology as a way to achieve this, which involves defining terms and linking them to other terms. They then proceed to list some terms and their attributes that could be included in the ontology, such as 'node', 'channel', 'fundingtx', 'transaction', and 'channelbreach'. Bretton emphasizes the importance of starting with small common use cases and building up the set of terms from there. They also mention a couple of use cases that others are interested in, including sending satoshis to an inbox and a paywall use case like yalls.</summary>
