    <summary>Melvin Carvalho, a developer working on the Solid project, expressed interest in integrating Lightning Network with Solid. He reached out to Ren√© Pickhardt to inquire about any existing work in creating an ontology for this integration. Pickhardt suggested looking into the W3C Payment Group's recommendation for a low-level payment API and LightningJoule, which builds on top of webln. While not directly related to ontologies, these resources are aligned with the direction of the integration. Carvalho is also a member of the W3C community group and trying to evangelize lightning in the shopping cart experience. Despite the differences between webln and the W3C Payment Group, conversations around integrating Lightning Network into semantic web are ongoing.</summary>
