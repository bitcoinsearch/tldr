    <summary>Francis Pouliot, a Bitcoin app developer, has shared his perspective on user experience (UX) issues when using his app to buy Bitcoin with fiat and receiving payments via the Lightning Network (LN). The process involves the user making an invoice with a specific format provided by the app, but there are concerns that users may not pay enough attention to details such as the description field or may even make typos. The app then needs to decode the bolt11 in the invoice and compare it to what was instructed, which can be a hassle for developers. If they do not match, the user must create a new invoice. There is currently no API available for this type of push payment, but there have been discussions about creating one. Rusty, a member of the Bitcoin community, suggests using an lninv URL to simplify the process.</summary>
