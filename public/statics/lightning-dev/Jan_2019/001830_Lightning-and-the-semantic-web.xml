    <summary>Melvin, who is working on the Solid project, has expressed interest in integrating the Lightning Network with Solid. To achieve this, he plans to create an ontology that would port some of the Lightning concepts to the semantic web. Melvin is looking for any existing work in this area and also open to collaborating with anyone interested in creating an ontology. Solid is a decentralized web platform that aims to give users control over their data and online identity. The Lightning Network, on the other hand, is a layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that enables faster and cheaper transactions.</summary>
