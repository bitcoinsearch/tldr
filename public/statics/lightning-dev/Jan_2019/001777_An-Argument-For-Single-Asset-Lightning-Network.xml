    <summary>The author of the message discloses that they work for Bitonic, which operates a centralized and trusted exchange, leading to potential bias in their ideas. However, they argue that the persuasiveness of words should be independent of who speaks them. The author references previous discussions regarding trustlessness, providing a proposal for a system that is not completely trustless but still practical. They acknowledge that trust creates risks but suggest that if the alternative system is impractical and the risk is small enough, the benefits might outweigh those risks on an individual, voluntary basis.</summary>
