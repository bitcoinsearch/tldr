    <summary>Melvin Carvalho, a developer working on the Solid project, expressed interest in integrating the Lightning Network with Solid and creating an ontology for it. Ren√© Pickhardt suggested looking into the W3C Payment Group and LightningJoule as they are working on a recommendation for browser vendors to enable a low-level payment API. Melvin asked about consistency in terminology across different implementations of the Lightning Network and suggested creating a vocabulary and documenting the terms to make them self-documenting.</summary>
