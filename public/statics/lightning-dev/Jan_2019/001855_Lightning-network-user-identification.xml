    <summary>The conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Jo達o Joyce revolves around the issue of privacy in Bitcoin's Lightning Network (LN) payments. While Jo達o acknowledges the added value of this feature, he agrees that if the base layer is nonprivate, it would be difficult to regain privacy. Both parties express concern that people and corporations may abuse this feature or turn it into the only way to make LN payments. The discussion moves towards the idea of moving this feature to the hardware of the user, but they both agree that lack of standardization is a significant challenge. Jo達o questions whether any wallet currently has this capability or if wallets are the right place for it. Additionally, he wonders if other apps should be given access to pre-images of LN payments. Jo達o expresses his hope that a replacement for email/password as an authentication method could come from something as pervasive as email addresses. However, both parties agree that authentication might be out of scope in this context.</summary>
