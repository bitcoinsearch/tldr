    <summary>The author of this message has collected data on routing tables and channel updates. They created backups for 12 days and collected information on 17,000 channel IDs. The data showed that there were 130,000 different channel updates with an average of 8 updates per channel. However, only 18,000 pairs of channel updates carried actual fee and/or HTLC value changes. This means that 85% of the time, the information queried was already known.To improve this, the author suggests adding a basic checksum to channel range queries, covering fees and HTLC min/max values. This improvement would be added to the open BOLT 1.1 proposal to extend queries with timestamps. The author also believes that this checksum could be used in inventory-based gossip messages and set reconciliation schemes.Overall, the author's findings suggest that implementing a checksum would lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of collecting and querying information on routing tables and channel updates.</summary>
