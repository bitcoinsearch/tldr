    <summary>A member of the Lightning-dev mailing list proposed using Chernoff Faces, which are visual representations of data points as faces, to identify node public keys. This would allow for easy recognition and memorization of small changes in a node's public key. To achieve this, a cryptographic hash function could be used on the public key, and the result could be plugged into a Chernoff Face generator. This idea was suggested as an alternative to the current method of displaying a long hex value for node IDs during payments via QR codes. The proposal would require implementation across all user-facing wallets to be effective.</summary>
