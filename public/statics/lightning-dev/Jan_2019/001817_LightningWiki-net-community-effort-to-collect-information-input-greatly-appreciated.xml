    <summary>The writer is excited about Lightning and has started a new website, https://LightningWiki.net, which will be a centralized place for information on Lightning. The Wiki is a community effort that is not specific to any implementation of blockchain. The writer is looking for help in expanding the wiki, as there is currently not much content. Registration is open, and people can email the writer directly if they want to contribute beyond writing articles.</summary>
