    <summary>A Lightning-dev mailing list discussion on improving user verification in QR code payments took place on December 29th, 2018. Pavol Rusnak proposed the idea of displaying an identicon, such as those generated by jdenticon.com, of the payee node ID next to the QR code for visual verification. William Casarin suggested the use of a visual hashing algorithm that produces uniformly random outputs for small changes in inputs, which could be useful in this case. However, he noted that jdenticon did not exhibit this property. A participant named Max proposed using a confirmation phrase of a few words instead, which could be easier to implement and reliable if a pool of enough words was available.</summary>
