    <summary>A project to create a modern replacement for bitcoinj that can be used for L2 applications like Lightning is being revived. The current plan is to implement traditional SPV and then implement neutrino when development is picking back up on that in Bitcoin Core. If that takes too long, they will consider implementing neutrino against btcd. The author wants to know what the mailing list thinks should be considered from a usability perspective for lightning devs. Different features must be implemented such as a Bitcoin wallet, monitoring channels, and validating channels. To download all blocks but not necessarily store them all, Bloom Filters and client-side filters are required. As the number of channels grows, it may become impractical to watch every channel. It is important that the lite wallet supports mobile platforms, particularly android. Java 7 is used, so plain Java or Kotlin should be considered instead of Scala where possible. One suggestion is to adhere to the Bitcoin Core API when possible so that bitcoin-s can be used as a drop-in lite client replacement for Bitcoin Core.</summary>
