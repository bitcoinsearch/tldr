    <summary>In a recent email exchange, ZmnSCPxj, a Bitcoin and Lightning Network contributor, clarified that the fact that ultimate payer has received the payment preimage is sufficient proof of payment. This means that in case of reuse, whatever the receiver claims is to be ignored and the payment preimage in possession of the ultimate payee is considered the whole of the proof of payment.However, if the receiver knows it does not control the entire Lightning Network, it should not reuse payment hashes, since intermediate nodes it does not control could claim the payment and give the proof-of-payment to the ultimate payer. ZmnSCPxj also mentioned that although a malicious receiver can provide an invoice with assisted routes, where among those he/she controls a node and that node won't forward to the htlc but steal the funds instead, the attack described is not possible as the possession of the payment preimage is itself the entirety of the proof of the payment, regardless of what the receiver claims.</summary>
