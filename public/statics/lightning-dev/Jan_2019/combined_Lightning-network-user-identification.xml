    <summary>The conversation between João Joyce and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the issue of privacy in Bitcoin's Lightning Network (LN) payments. The idea of identifying users across multiple LN requests or authenticating them in a single step using an LN wallet is discussed, with João presenting several use cases where this feature would be beneficial. Suggestions are made regarding the use of payment preimages as unique user IDs to ensure that userIDs are only usable if paid for. The discussion also touches on the possibility of moving this feature to the hardware of the user and standardizing it. João suggests having a unique userID that is only valid for a particular store, eliminating the need for the user to create an account or log in to the service, and no private data would be kept by the store. Both parties express concern over the privacy risks associated with services that require personal information such as email accounts, and the principle of privacy first is emphasized. The email conversation proposes a scenario where a user can confirm payment and identity in one action without creating an account or logging in, making for a more seamless user experience.The forum post discusses various use cases where identifying users across multiple plays and different machines would be beneficial, providing high scores and user performance statistics, as well as multiplayer gaming while keeping user identity, scores, and in-game items intact. The post concludes with a question about the current possibility of this feature. In the lightning-dev mailing list, a user raises concerns about user identification in the context of payments for goods and services. The suggestion is made that using something like SQRL or BitID could provide some level of anonymity, but it would require users to keep separate apps for login and payments, which could be confusing and inconvenient. Instead, a scenario is proposed where a user can scan a Lightning Network invoice and confirm payment and identity in one action without creating an account or logging in. Suggestions are made regarding the use of payment preimages as unique user IDs to ensure that userIDs are only usable if paid for. The original user questions the need for multiple apps and the privacy risks associated with services that require personal information such as email accounts, while expressing a willingness to allow services to keep records of their purchases and high scores if done anonymously and securely.</summary>
