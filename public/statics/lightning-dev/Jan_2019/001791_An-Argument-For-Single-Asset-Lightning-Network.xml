    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list discusses a potential solution for unfavorable exchange rate changes in cross-asset payments. The proposed solution involves adding an extra hashlock to the HTLC that is controlled by the exchanger, allowing the person making the exchange to cancel the payment if they believe the exchange rate has unfavorably changed. The payment would be contingent on the approval of the exchanger, transferring the ability to create an underhanded call option to the exchanger. The exchanger can only keep this option open by refusing to immediately claim the routing fees. This idea complicates the current protocol but may offer simplifications.</summary>
