    <summary>A user named ZmnSCPxj on Lightning-dev forum has shared an interesting argument in which HTLCs (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) are compared to American Call Options. The post suggests that multi-asset Lightning Network may not work due to certain reasons. Another user, Rusty, agrees with the post and believes that multi-asset LN could fail due to long-lived spam payments that require proof of something going wrong, which won't be valid if it's from a different network. This could result in the exchange point being penalized making them vulnerable to a DoS attack.</summary>
