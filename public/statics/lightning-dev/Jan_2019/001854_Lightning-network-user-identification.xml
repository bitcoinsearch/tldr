    <summary>In this email conversation, Joao is discussing the issue of connecting multiple payments to a user account in Bitcoin and Lightning. The suggestion is made that the user software should handle management of all preimages for items purchased, creating a virtual "user identity" and "Bitcoin wallet". This reduces privacy leakage as vendors cannot link different purchases to the same user, at least on LN. However, ZmnSCPxj points out that users should have control over what information they reveal and it should not be required for any purchase. The principle of privacy first is emphasized, with higher layers possibly supporting persistent user IDs but the base layer remaining nonprivate.</summary>
