    <summary>In a discussion about set reconciliation schemes, a participant suggests reconciling [channel id | timestamp | checksum] but another participant raises concern that if timestamp is changed while checksum is not, it would still be seen as a set difference and require further communication rounds to determine that the channel parameters have not actually changed. The second participant suggests that it may be better to reconcile [channel_id | checksum] instead and sort out which timestamp is later at a later point after sharing the set difference.</summary>
