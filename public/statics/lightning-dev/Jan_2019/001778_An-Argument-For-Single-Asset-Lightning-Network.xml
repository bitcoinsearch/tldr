    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a Lightning Network developer, expresses concern over a proposal to create an exchange function as a higher layer on top of the Lightning Network. He argues that this approach is unnecessarily complex and could result in every node being involved in trying to solve the problem. Instead, he suggests that each layer should solve its own problems in a clean and elegant way. ZmnSCPxj also notes that if S is a payee in the proposed system, it will have to shut down its channels immediately in case of a slow response from the next node. However, this gives OM the power to censor payments. Additionally, if S is secretly a sockpuppet of F, who is setting up an American Call Option, S can simply not forward to RM until much later.</summary>
