    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Pavol Rusnak proposed adding an identicon of the payee node id (public key) next to the QR code for payments in Lightning user-facing wallets. This would allow users to quickly visually check if they have the correct recipient. ZmnSCPxj suggested using Chernoff Faces to identify the node's public key since humans are best at recognizing small changes in faces and remembering them. The use of cryptographic hash function would help produce much different faces and make it easy to notice public key changes. ZmnSCPxj also mentioned that this could lead to humans obsessively rerolling their pubkey until they acquire a face they like, which will be a source of amusement.</summary>
