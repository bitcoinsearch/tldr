    <summary>In an email thread about Lightning Network (LN) payouts, the issue of routing fees in custodial cases was raised. The discussion questioned whether the sender should deduct routing fees from the user's account when paying a user-provided invoice. One potential attack on a custodial service would be for an attacker to create many invoices of 1 satoshi each and have the custodial service pay them, resulting in fees equal to or greater than the invoice amount. Possible solutions to this include imposing a withdrawal limit or minimum withdrawal amount. However, the custodial service may also deduct routing fees from the user's account, which is undesirable because routes and fees are controlled by the sender, not the receiver.It is widely agreed that custodial services cannot be trusted to hold substantial sums of money safely for long. Therefore, any UX problems with them are largely immaterial. From a UX perspective, having a well-connected node with well-funded/balanced channels is more important than using a custodial service. Refusing to pay a lesser invoice is possible, but waiting for a new channel might be a deal breaker. Deducting routing fees is also important to consider in this context.</summary>
