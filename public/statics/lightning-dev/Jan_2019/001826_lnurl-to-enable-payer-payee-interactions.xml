    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network (LN) development, has responded to Anton's proposal of using user's LN node key as a stable user identifier for payer/payee interactions on the network. ZmnSCPxj highlights four use cases that should be implemented within BOLT rather than as separate HTTP requests. The first use case is the incoming payment channel request which will allow liquidity providers to sell a service of providing incoming liquidity to nodes in exchange for a fee. The second use case is about withdrawing funds from a service and how this raises issues of fees on Lightning, especially for custodial services. Here, ZmnSCPxj suggests adapting Rendezvous routing to custodial service withdrawals as a better solution. This will prevent revealing the public node of the user to the service, thus avoiding the issue of personally-identifiable information. The third use case is linkable payments. Payments sent by the payer and interpreted by the payee will have type-length-value (tlv) soon. It would be trivial to add a user-linking-key to such a key-value map. Finally, the fourth use case is login with Bitcoin wallet which can also add a user-challenge using the tlv. ZmnSCPxj concludes by stating that these use cases should be implemented within BOLT "soon" rather than as separate HTTP requests. He suggests that Anton should contact cdecker and CJP to adapt Rendezvous routing to custodial service withdrawals.</summary>
