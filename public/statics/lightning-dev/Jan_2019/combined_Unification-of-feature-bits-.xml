    <summary>Bitcoin Lightning Network developer Rusty Russell has proposed a plan to unify the feature bits in node announcements. The plan includes renaming 'local features' to 'peer features' and 'global features' to 'routing features', having both share a number space, and putting them in `features` in node announcements. However, even bits should never be used for peer features. This will enable the use of node_announcement as a way to connect to a peer that supports feature X and also as a means to determine whether a node can be used for routing. However, Fabrice Drouin expressed concerns about the concept of `routing features` and suggested using `node features` instead, which are advertised in node announcements, and `peer/connection features`, which are a subset of `node features` applied to a specific connection. Rusty explained that any kind of mid-path splitting or combining feature would have the same properties as `routing features`. In addition, the rationale behind not allowing even bits in peer features is that the even feature can be put into peer_features on connect, but only the odd feature should be put into node_announce.Rusty's proposed plan involves three steps: renaming features, sharing a number space, and putting them in `features` in node announcements. However, DNS seed filtering might support filtering only by pairs of bits in the future. The proposal aims to simplify the process of connecting to peers and determining whether a node can be used for routing.</summary>
