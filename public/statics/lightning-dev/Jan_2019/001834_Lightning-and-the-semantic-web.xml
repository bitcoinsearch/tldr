    <summary>In an email dated January 21, 2019, Melvin Carvalho discussed the first step towards integration being the porting of lightning concepts to the semantic web. This can be achieved by creating an ontology that lists relevant concepts and their possible attributes and links. Some of the concepts mentioned include node, pubkey, ipaddress, numberchannels, channel, stateactive/stateclosed, fundingtx, localbalance, remotebalance, closingfee, stateopen/stateclosed, transaction, invoice, amount, destination, validtime, channelbreach, datetime, error, and result. The email was signed off by Bretton with his openpgp link provided.</summary>
