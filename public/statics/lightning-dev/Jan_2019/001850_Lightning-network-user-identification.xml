    <summary>In this email, the writer discusses the possibility of using SQRL or BitID for a service that requires both login and payment. However, this would require the user to keep two separate apps for login and payments, leading to confusion and a poor user experience. Alternatively, the writer proposes a scenario where the user can simply scan a Lightning Network (LN) invoice at an ebook store, confirm payment and identity in one action, without having to create an account or log in. The writer suggests using the payment preimage as a unique user ID, which ensures that user IDs are only usable if paid for. This eliminates the need for private data storage by the store and provides a more seamless user experience.</summary>
