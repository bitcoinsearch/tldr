    <summary>Rusty Russell, the developer of c-lightning, has recently shared his thoughts on a proposal for a new backup scheme for Lightning Network nodes. The scheme would enable users to recover their funds in the case of data loss by creating an encrypted backup that is served by peers. Russell has expressed concerns about the proposal, including the removal of the ability to update a channel without access to the node's secret key and the need for a generation counter which makes it less scannable. However, he has suggested that more reliable backups could solve this problem and has also mentioned other potential solutions such as OP_RETURN tagging opens and deterministic key generation. Despite these concerns, Russell has not ruled out the possibility of implementing the backup scheme and says it may be worth revisiting if necessary.</summary>
