    <summary>The email conversation discusses the possibility of determining which output from a 2 of 2 multisig belongs to whom if the balances of each side of a channel are different when closing vs. opening. The sender questions whether it could be determined if the output belonging to a certain node later uses that as input for a non-private channel opening and wonders if it would look the same if it was the same user opening a new channel to that node. The conversation then moves to the possibility of determining which input came from whom during channel opening.</summary>
