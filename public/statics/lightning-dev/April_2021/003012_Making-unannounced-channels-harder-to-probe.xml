    <summary>In this context, Joost made a comment about needing to know the node_id of the next node which is not entirely true. The specification states that if the node_id is incorrect, one should send an `update_fail_malformed_htlc` with failure code invalid_onion_hmac, which node N turns into its own failure message. There is a suggestion that it could be converted to `unknown_next_peer` instead. However, this error is not common on the modern network as onion implementations have been reliable. Joost's comment can be found on his Twitter account.</summary>
