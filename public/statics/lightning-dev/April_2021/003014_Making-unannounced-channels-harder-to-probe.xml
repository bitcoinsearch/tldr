    <summary>Joost Jager corrected Rusty's statement that one needs to know the node_id of the next node for lightning network payment. Jager pointed out that if the node_id is wrong, then one can send an `update_fail_malformed_htlc` with failure code `invalid_onion_hmac`, which node N turns into its own failure message. However, Rusty suggested that perhaps it should convert it to `unknown_next_peer` instead. Rusty also mentioned that this isn't a common error on modern networks and onion implementations have been solid. Rusty later apologized for misreading Joost's tweet and thanked him for pointing out his mistake.</summary>
