    <summary>On April 27th, Rusty Russell announced on the Lightning Network GitHub page that a draft is up for a potential update to the network. The draft can be found at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/867. The update would require that update_fee messages be on their own, which would eliminate any debate on the state of the channel when the update is being applied. While this implementation is currently voluntary, making it compulsory is a goal for the future.Matt suggests that if they do not do turns for splicing, they could take the rules around splicing pausing other HTLC updates and make them generic for future use. This could also be used for update_fee in a simpler-to-make-compulsory change.</summary>
