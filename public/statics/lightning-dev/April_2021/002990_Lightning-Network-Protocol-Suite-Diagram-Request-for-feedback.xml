    <summary>The authors of the book "Mastering the Lightning Network," including Andreas, Roasbeef, and Rene, have made significant progress over the last 18 months. They have created a diagram of the Lightning Network Protocol Suite that they would like to share with the community for feedback and criticism. The diagram, which can be found on Wikimedia Commons, shows the layers of the protocol suite, as well as the boxes and labels used to describe them. The authors are particularly interested in feedback about the novel naming of some layers and the geometry and semantics of the boxes themselves.The authors note that while the BOLTs are intermixed and somewhat linked, this can sometimes be confusing when introducing the protocol to new people. To address this, they decided to create an architecture diagram for the Lightning Network. After several iterations, they believe it is time to present their current diagram to the community for feedback before using it as a guide for some of the chapters in the book.Interested parties can see a part of the authors' discussions and previous versions of the diagram on GitHub. However, it should be noted that BOLT 03 and BOLT 5, which cover Bitcoin stuff, are not currently included in the diagram. Ultimately, the authors hope to use the feedback they receive to further refine the diagram and create a useful resource for those looking to understand the Lightning Network.</summary>
