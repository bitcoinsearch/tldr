    <summary>Rusty has proposed a simple addition to the BOLT 12 offers spec on Github. The addition allows invoice requests to ask for old invoices to be obsolete, enabling a workaround in cases where payments are stuck. This means that vendors can commit to a new invoice which obsoletes the old one using the already-existing invoice_request message. This addition will allow wallets to have another option for handling these cases. If the vendor cheats and accepts both old and new payments, they can be proven to have lied. Alternatively, an error message could indicate that the payment has already been received and it's simply the return that is stuck.</summary>
