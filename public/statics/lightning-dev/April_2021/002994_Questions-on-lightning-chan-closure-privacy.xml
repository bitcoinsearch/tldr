    <summary>When opening and closing channels on Lightning Network, it involves 2 of 2 multisig bitcoin addresses. The first question is whether someone analyzing the transaction details of the 2 of 2 multisig address when the channel is being opened or closed can determine what lightning node it belongs to. The second question is whether someone can determine which output from the 2 of 2 multisig belongs to who if the balances of each side of a channel are different when closing versus opening.The poster frequently connects random people to their lightning node with private channels. They sometimes open private channels to the lightning network and make payments to themselves to one of their other channels before closing. Depending on the answers to the above questions, Lightning Network could be used as a fancy payjoin network by mixing the cluster of the poster's coin history with users of their nodes, along with that of the nodes they open and close channels to.The poster wonders if someone could mix their bitcoin by such activity of opening and closing private channels to random nodes after sending some amount to their other channels, or maybe using reverse submarine swap before closing.</summary>
