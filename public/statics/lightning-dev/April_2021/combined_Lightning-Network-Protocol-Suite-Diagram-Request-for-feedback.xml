    <summary>A team of lightning developers, including Andreas, Roasbeef, and René Pickhardt, have been working on a book called "Mastering the Lightning Network." They have created a diagram of the Lightning Network Protocol Suite and are requesting feedback and criticism from the community. The diagram can be found on Wikimedia Commons and shows the layers of the protocol suite with boxes and labels used to describe them.The group hopes to receive feedback before finalizing the diagram, which they plan to use as a guide for some chapters in the book. The lightning network protocol consists of intermixed BOLTs that can sometimes be confusing for new users. To address this issue, the group created an architecture diagram for the Lightning Network.Some categories on the diagram do not fit neatly within a BOLT, so discussions about categorization are ongoing. BOLT 03 and BOLT 5, which relate to Bitcoin, are not currently part of the diagram. The authors hope to use the feedback they receive to further refine the diagram and create a useful resource for those looking to understand the Lightning Network.Elliot provided positive feedback on the project and suggested functional categorizations as an alternative to layer mapping. Interested parties can see a portion of the authors' discussions and previous versions of the diagram on GitHub. Ultimately, the goal is to create a comprehensive resource for understanding the Lightning Network.</summary>
