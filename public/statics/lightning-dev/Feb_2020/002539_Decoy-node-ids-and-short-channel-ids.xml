    <summary>In this conversation, a proposal has been made to use the letter 'z' as a bolt11 letter. A reference has been made to the French word "rendez-vous" which shows that even the French do not pronounce the letter 'z'. However, the Z-man has to approve this proposal as he might have already claimed it for himself or his puppet army. Meanwhile, ZmnSCPxj has claimed the number '8' as his bolt11 letter to actively mislead surveillors who may be monitoring his public alias.</summary>
