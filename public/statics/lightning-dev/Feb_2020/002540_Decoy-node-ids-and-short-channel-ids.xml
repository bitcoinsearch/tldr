    <summary>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj proposed to use letter 'z' in bolt11 for its usage as rendezvous and even French don't pronounce it. However, t-bast agreed to this proposal only if Z-man doesn't want to claim the same bolt11 letter for himself or his puppet army. In response, ZmnSCPxj claimed '8' for his own usage and for his non-existent army of city-marching robots. Moreover, he added that it does not appear in his public alias at all, thus actively misleading surveillors.</summary>
