    <summary>In a post, the author questions why there is fragmentation between peer-to-peer projects with similarities and suggests using open source technologies and standards like libp2p for communication and multiformats for addresses, hashes, and encodings. The Lightning community responds that simplicity and security are priorities over versatility, with connection logic being less complicated than other aspects of lightning. Crypto for lightning uses the noise framework, but it is easy to write one's own code instead of fighting with dependencies. The community prefers auditable dependencies and a simple transport to make testing and implementation more straightforward. Bastien Teinturier and Matt note that libp2p can be insecure due to offering too many options and suggest simplification to improve auditing. Despite the benefits of common toolkits and standards, coordination and consensus may not allow for their creation in time. The Lightning community may consider implementing projects like libp2p and multiformats.</summary>
