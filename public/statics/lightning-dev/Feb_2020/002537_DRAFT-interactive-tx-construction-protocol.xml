    <summary>The discussion revolves around the protocol for serial ids in multiparty constructions. It is agreed that the serial ids should be chosen randomly and collisions of serial ids between peers is a protocol error. The definition of collision is clarified to mean literally equal, not equal in all bits except the lowest bit. The purpose of having the low bit is discussed, which is to multifund in a way that the initiator creates multiple channels simultaneously with multiple nodes. However, it is pointed out that with PoDLE, this would not be possible as the PoDLE commitment cannot be opened with the other node as the target. This is due to the modified PoDLE committing to which node an opening is for, preventing the pouncing venus flytrap attack.</summary>
