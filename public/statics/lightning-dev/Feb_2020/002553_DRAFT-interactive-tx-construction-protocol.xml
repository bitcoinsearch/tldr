    <summary>The discussion is about the possibility of doing multi-channel open with PoDLE signature committing to a node_id. The modified PoDLE signature commitment requires every initiator to include at least one of their own inputs in the tx. It prevents the pouncing venus flytrap attack, where an initiator tries to initiate an additional open using someone else's utxo's. Alice sends her own UTXO1 with proof to Bob and gets his UTXO back, then sends her own UTXO2 with proof to Carol and gets Carol's UTXO back. Alice sets the lower bit on the serial_id from Bob and sends it to Carol and does the same for Bob with Carol. Now all parties have the same tx, unless they chose the same serial_ids, which identifies them.</summary>
