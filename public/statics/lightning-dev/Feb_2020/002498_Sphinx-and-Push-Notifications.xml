    <summary>In a discussion on Lightning-dev, it was asked if c-lightning would support Sphinx or other forms of spontaneous payments. In response, darosior said that cdecker is working on integrating keysend to his noise plugin. The keysend functionality is implemented in the noise plugin and can be pulled out since it is trivial to implement. It was also noted that Sphinx-send is a misnomer, and keysend is the proper name to use. The discussion then moved to whether a lightning node like lnd or c-lightning could send a push notification when it receives or routes a payment. Darosior explained that c-lightning sends notifications for typical events such as "I received an HTLC". A plugin can subscribe to HTLC related events, such as forward_event or invoice_payment, to get notified about forwardings or invoices being paid. The plugin can then transform the event arbitrarily and issue calls to signmessage to create a signature for the message, allowing authenticity of the message to be proven. However, JSON is not the best format for canonical serialization, so canonicalization may be necessary before signing.</summary>
