    <summary>The Lightning Network protocol is being developed by a mailing list dedicated to driving the protocol's development. Questions about understanding the protocol should be directed to bitcoin.stackexchange.com. The first question asked if it is possible for the last hub to prepare the last HTLC with a small amount to the payee when funds are sent without an invoice. The payee will only release the preimage for an invoice if they are satisfied with the amount, which is usually specified in the invoice. If keysend is used, the payee does not expect an amount and may consider it free money. Onions are always of constant size (20 * 65 Byte = 1300 Byte), and padding is described in the Sphinx paper and BOLT 04. Channels are not entirely locked during confirmation; rather, the HTLCs are additional outputs in the commitment transaction that lock the amount of the payment until settlement, which cannot be used by either party of the channel for other payments/activities. The protocol allows for up to 483 htlcs concurrently in flight as specified in BOLT 04, but the standard of implementations and recommendation is 30.</summary>
