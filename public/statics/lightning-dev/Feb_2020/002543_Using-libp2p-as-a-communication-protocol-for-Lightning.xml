    <summary>The author of the post is curious about why there is fragmentation between different peer-to-peer projects that seem to have many similarities. They suggest that common toolkits and standards for decentralized systems could be useful for the whole community. The author specifically asks why Lightning, a peer-to-peer project, does not use existing open source technologies and standards such as libp2p for communication or multiformats for addresses, hashes, and encoding. They wonder if the Lightning community has considered implementing these tools or if there was a decision not to use them for some reason. The author provides links to libp2p, multiformats, and IPLD for reference.</summary>
