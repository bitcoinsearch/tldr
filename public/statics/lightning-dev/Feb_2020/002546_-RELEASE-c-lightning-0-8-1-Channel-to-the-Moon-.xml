    <summary>The Elements Project has announced the release of version 0.8.1 of their Lightning Network implementation. Among the highlights for users is the support for gifting msat to the peer when opening a channel via push_msat, which provides a new way to lose money. Additionally, invoice routehints can be overridden using exposeprivatechannels by setting it to [] to eliminate all of them and fit the invoice in Twitter messages. Preliminary support for plugin hooks that can replace the default bitcoin-cli with other blockchain querying methods has been added as well. For the network, plugins can now set additional feature bits for more experimentation. Wallet withdraw transactions now set nLocktime, making them blend in more with other wallets. There is also a fix to prevent grossly unbalanced channels from becoming unusable. More information about this release can be found in their CHANGELOG.md file on GitHub. Since version 0.8.0, the Elements Project has had 257 commits from 17 different authors, with five first-time contributors: Nikas Claesson, @minidisk1147, Ken Sedgwick, Zoe Faltib√†, and Glen Cooper. The team at Elements Project expressed gratitude for contributions and bug reports and encouraged people to continue submitting them.</summary>
