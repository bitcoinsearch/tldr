    <summary>The conversation between two individuals, t-bast and ZmnSCPxj, discusses hiding the node ID of the last node. Bob can provide an encryption key to peers with unpublished channels that they can XOR with their own true node ID and use the lowest bits in the SCID. Alice wants to prevent Carol from linking multiple HTLCs together, so she can use a different node ID in every invoice. However, the lowest bits of the node ID are embedded in the SCID, which should not be revealed to Carol. The best way for Alice to hide from Bob is to use a different node ID for each channel she opens and use Tor. Lastly, it is suggested that Alice should use multiple Bobs to achieve better results.</summary>
