    <summary>In a discussion related to Lightning Network, ZmnSCPxj expresses concern about custodial lightning services limiting their payments due to KYC pressure in the near future. To avoid adding any requirements on the payer, he suggests a system that doesn't add any constraints on them. However, this approach may put more pressure on Bob, who is required to include the scid he used in the update_add_htlc message so Alice can verify it. ZmnSCPxj further notes that if the payer and Bob are in separate jurisdictions, there might be a possibility of risk-sharing, but if the payer is also using a custodial service, then the custodial service could be pressured to verify the routing hints of any invoice it is asked to pay. Finally, he points out that this is the main point of t-bast email.</summary>
