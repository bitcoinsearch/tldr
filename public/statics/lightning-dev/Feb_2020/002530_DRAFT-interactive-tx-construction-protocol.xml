    <summary>The author of this message believes that PoDLEs are compatible with JoinMarket only to the extent of the H2 construction, but not the proof. They caution against attempting to maintain compatibility with JoinMarket and instead advocate for upgrading the protocol to schnorr/taproot or at least native segwit in the future due to coinjoin being a fee-heavy protocol. The author also shares a link to an interesting use-case of DLEQ to create blinded tokens using blind signing which prevents double spending, and suggests that there may be something to learn from this line of thinking.</summary>
