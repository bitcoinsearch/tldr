    <summary>The Lightning Network has been exploring various routing methods to improve privacy and reduce the number of channels published off-chain. One proposed solution is Trampoline routing, which adds onion routing above individual channel hops. Another method is Payment Point Rotation, which uses payment point+scalar to achieve "path decorrelation," changing the outgoing PTLC at each hop in the onion route.Combining Ant Routing with the `getroutequick` algorithm can significantly reduce resources proportional to the total number of payments globally. The Lightning-dev mailing list has been discussing these various routing methods, along with their advantages and disadvantages.To limit spam on the Lightning pheromone network, the Lightning Network has proposed using 'pheromones' to broadcast transaction information. Pheromones would contain signatures of the sender and receiver and recognize channels instead of nodes, thus limiting spam. Users would include the short-channel-ID(s) in the invoice instead of the actual node when issuing an invoice. This allows for proper handling of UTXOs after closing and enables selling different products from the same Lightning node without anyone realizing it.In addition, when pheromones are channel-based instead of node-based, onion-routing a trampoline route requires a static public key of a node. Asymmetric encryption can then be used, providing a mild improvement in privacy as everyone else who is not involved in the channel has a 50/50 chance of guessing who the real destination of the payment is. Each channel has its own pubkey that is distinct from any other channel's pubkey.</summary>
