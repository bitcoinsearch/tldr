    <summary>Cezary Dziemian, a member of the Polish LN community, has some questions about Lightning Network transactions. Firstly, he asks if it is possible for the last hub to prepare the last HTLC with a smaller amount to the payee if no invoice is sent. He also enquires whether additional data are added to the end of the onion-encrypted list of HTLCs to prevent the last hub from guessing that it is the last one in the route. Finally, he asks whether channels are locked entirely during payment confirmation or only for the in-flight payment amount and if a single channel can process more than one transaction at once. Cezary requests simple answers as his English is not yet perfect.</summary>
