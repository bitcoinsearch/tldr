    <summary>A short agenda has been prepared for the next meeting of protocol devs taking place on Monday, February 17th. The group has decided to limit discussion to two topics and track other topics in a backlog section to prevent meetings from running too long. If there is extra time, they will start discussing entries from the backlog. The agenda includes pull request reviews and long term updates, with additional topics in the backlog section. The meeting is open to the public and will be held on IRC channel #lightning-dev. Christian closes by encouraging anyone with feedback or suggestions to reach out before the meeting.</summary>
