    <summary>In this email conversation, Bastien and ZmnSCPxj discuss the issue of privacy in Bitcoin Lightning Network transactions. The discussion centers around preventing Carol from correlating different invoices as arising from the same payee. Bastien suggests using a different node_id for each invoice to prevent correlation and explains how this can be done easily on the payee-side. ZmnSCPxj points out that the lowest bits of the node ID are embedded in the SCID and should not be openly revealed to Carol. They also discuss the possibility of Alice using multiple Bobs to better protect her privacy. In order to hide from Bob, Bastien suggests using Tor and a different node_id each time. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of privacy in Bitcoin transactions and the various strategies that can be used to maintain it.</summary>
