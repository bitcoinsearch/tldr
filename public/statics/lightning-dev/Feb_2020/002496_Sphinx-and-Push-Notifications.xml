    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Pavol Rusnak from SatoshiLabs raised two unrelated questions. The first question was regarding whether c-lightning will support Sphinx or other forms of spontaneous payments. The second question was about whether it is possible for a lightning node to send a push notification when it receives or routes a payment and whether this notification is cryptographically signed. In response to the second question, Johan informed that lnd is getting an API in the next release (v0.10) which allows subscribing to HTLC events. The notification won't be signed but the stream uses TLS. However, he mentioned that signing can easily be added using the `signmessage` API. Johan also provided links to the relevant PR and documentation for further reference.</summary>
