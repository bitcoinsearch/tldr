    <summary>Pavol Rusnak from SatoshiLabs raised two questions related to lightning network in a Lightning-dev thread. Firstly, he asked if c-lightning will support Sphinx or other forms of spontaneous payments. Darosior responded by saying that cdecker is working on integrating keysend to his noise plugin. Secondly, Pavol enquired whether a lightning node such as lnd or c-lightning can send push notifications when it receives or routes a payment and if these notifications are cryptographically signed with the node's private key. Johan informed that lnd is getting an API in the next release (v0.10) which allows subscribing to HTLC events. The notification won't be signed but the stream uses TLS. However, signing can easily be added using the `signmessage` API. In the discussion, it was also mentioned that c-lightning sends notifications for typical events such as "I received an HTLC!" and a plugin can be developed to register to these lightningd notifications and send encrypted push notifs. The documentation link for this feature was provided in the response. Darosior further explained that a plugin can subscribe to HTLC related events, such as forward_event or invoice_payment, to get notified about forwardings or invoices being paid. The plugin can then transform the event arbitrarily and issue calls to signmessage to create a signature for the message, allowing authenticity of the message to be proven. However, JSON is not the best format for canonical serialization, so canonicalization may be necessary before signing.</summary>
