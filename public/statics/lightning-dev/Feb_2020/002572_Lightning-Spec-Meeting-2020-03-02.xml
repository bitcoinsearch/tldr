The agenda includes pull request reviews for five issues, including reply channel range simplification, BOLT11 additional and negative tests, stuck channels, Wumbo advisory for scaling confirmations, and Gitbook quick follow-up. Long-term updates include discussions on the current status of the trampoline routing proposal, protocol testing framework, rendez-vous, and improving gossip (`gossip_queries_ex`).
