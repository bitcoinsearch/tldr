    <summary>In this email conversation, Bastien Teinturier suggests a new scheme to prevent channel probing attacks in the Lightning Network. The proposed scheme involves using payment secrets and decoy keys to create decoy short channel IDs. However, there is still a need to address the issue of assigning short channel IDs. Rusty Russell proposes using blocknum=0 to identify special SCIDs and reserving the rest of the SCID for the lowest 40 bits of the X-coord of the node ID that is the destination. This could work well up to a few thousand peers with unpublished channels. Additionally, it is noted that short channel IDs are used as a way to refer to the next node rather than the next channel in the onion routing. Finally, it is mentioned that Bitcoin's high block number allows stealing 18 more bits from blocknum to increase identification capacity.</summary>
