    <summary>In this context, René Pickhardt expresses his delight on Rusty's proposal but raises a concern about spam prevention. Rusty confirms that it doesn't handle spam, but it is cheaper than the HTLC system. He also suggests adding an up-front 1msat payment when they can figure out how to do that. Rusty explains the non-persistent storage costs for remembering how to forward the reply are the 200 bytes in his implementation. René asks if he can use this protocol to create a fee-free rebalancing protocol or communicate with nodes further away than just his peers. Rusty confirms that both of these are possible with this protocol and adds that he hasn't prevented spam because it cannot be prevented. Rusty's proposal gives a more efficient method than encoding via HTLCs.</summary>
