    <summary>Bastien Teinturier, a Lightning Network developer, proposed a new scheme to improve payee privacy and replace current route hints. He suggested the use of the letter "z" as the bolt11 letter for the scheme, which would allow additional routing information to be added using TLVs inside the field. Rusty Russell, another Lightning Network developer, supported the proposal and suggested adding feature bits to the fields. They also discussed using the scheme for private channels and new rendezvous, and solving the issue of private channels needing a temporary scid. Bastien stated that he would start working on an implementation and spec PR, and offered drinks to anyone who could crack it.</summary>
