    <summary>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Christian Decker in August 2016, they discuss the addition of a realm byte to Lightning Network to avoid ambiguity when transferring funds across multiple channels on different chains that use the same identifiers. Christian explains how this could lead to guesswork and fee-shaving if the intended amount is not clear. Rusty points out that reusing rhash can also be a concern as it may lead to people publishing their Lightning address in the same way they publish a Bitcoin address.</summary>
