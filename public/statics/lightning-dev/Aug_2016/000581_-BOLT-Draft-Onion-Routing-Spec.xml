    <summary>In this discussion, Rusty Russell suggests simplifying the routing protocol for onion packets by agreeing with a rendezvous node to forward the packet to the intended recipient. He also proposes supporting regular onion packets for now and broadcasting extensions for future use. Christian Decker raises concerns about providing a precompiled header with HMACs for the final recipient without knowing them upfront. They discuss the possibility of implementing seamless rendezvous routing and conclude that dropping per-hop HMACs may be necessary. They also agree that key rotation alone is simpler than a timestamped log of secrets and should suffice. The group also discusses using Schnorr keys within the Bitcoin network for space savings.</summary>
