    <summary>Rusty Russell suggests a new format for ephemeral key and mac headers, which includes a realm byte and per-realm-information. The "next-hop" field should be an opaque blob at the specification level with no explicit meaning, as nodes residing on various chains will parse the address accordingly. An explicit network byte makes sense since there could eventually be multiple networks, but it should be within the main p2p message header rather than the onion blob header for crossing chains. Rusty also proposes using HTLC-hash and HTLC-preimage for commitment transaction revocation. Laolu approves of this proposal. It is important to maintain the security properties of the onion blob by keeping each blob uniform in length.</summary>
