    <summary>The email thread discusses methods to avoid a large amount of outsourcing work in the Lightning Network. The first method discussed involves pre-computing an HMAC by the outsourcer and giving it, along with the encrypted blob, to the watcher. The watcher adds the HMAC and the blob to a key-value store and compares the HMAC of all transactions in a new block against the key-value store. The second method involves HMAC-ing the transaction itself or part of the transaction as the secret key. This method is constrained by block size. However, including the witness in the HMAC risks reintroducing malleability while excluding it risks predictability. To fix this issue, randomness can be inserted into the transaction, or the input signature from the witness can be extracted as a filter. Another suggested solution is to use one's own input signature as the key for the encrypted blob. This approach helps encourage more nodes to download witness data.</summary>
