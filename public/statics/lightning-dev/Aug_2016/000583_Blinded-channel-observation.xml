    <summary>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon, they discussed the use of hash trees in Bitcoin transactions. They talked about using a tree of chained preimages and hashes as a part of the tree itself to save on wire usage. This chain would look like preimage-&gt;hash-&gt;preimage-&gt;hash instead of preimage-&gt;preimage. This way, the wire message could only be sending next_revocation_hash, with the prior revocation preimage being revealed automatically. Pubkey revocations would require using privkeys+pubkeys instead of preimages+hashes, which ups the cost/complexity. However, they agreed that it was better to stick with hash trees unless a significant win is achieved.</summary>
