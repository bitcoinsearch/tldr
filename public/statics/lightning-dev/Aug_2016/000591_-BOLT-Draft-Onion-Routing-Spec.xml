    <summary>In an email conversation, Olaoluwa Osuntokun proposed to store the target realm byte in the per-hop payload. However, Laolu suggested that it should be protected under a MAC as forwarding to the correct realm is critical for payment success. The integrity of per-hop payloads must be protected to prevent exploits, such as instructing intermediate hops to forward more coins. While fee-shaving attacks can be limited, a way to fix the issue would be great.Stitching routes may be difficult if payloads cannot be dropped from the MAC, making the interactive protocol outlined before rather ugly. The invoice pattern deviates from the final recipient giving necessary information for transfer in a single bundle.</summary>
