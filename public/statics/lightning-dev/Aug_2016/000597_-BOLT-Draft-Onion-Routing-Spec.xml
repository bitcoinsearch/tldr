    <summary>Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon discussed the potential dangers of cross-chain payments in a mailing list exchange. They raised concerns about the likelihood of mistakes being made when sending funds across different chains, which could result in unintended amounts being transferred. Russell suggested that default requirements for pre-negotiated amounts between senders and recipients should be put in place to prevent such mistakes. He also proposed the use of pay-to-contract as a means of ensuring safety when dealing with cross-chain payments. Poon added that having an identifier between each hop would be sufficient to avoid confusion. However, he expressed concern about the possible re-use of rhashes and suggested implementing code to prevent it from becoming a habit.</summary>
