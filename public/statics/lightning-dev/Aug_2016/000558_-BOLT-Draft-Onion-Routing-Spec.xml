    <summary>Rusty Russell, a developer for the Lightning Network protocol, has proposed changes to the existing construction of the protocol. The proposal calls for combining the "header" and "per-hop payload" into a single 40-byte field and adding at least one byte for "realm." The addition of a realm byte will allow for future extensions to the protocol with backwards compatibility. The current protocol requires nodes to allocate an unbounded amount of storage to the shared secret "seen" log which is unnecessary. Rusty proposes allowing nodes to periodically truncate this log by adding an additional session time stamp to the mix-header. He also suggests switching from hash/preimage to the privkeys with point addition scheme to address replay protection issues.</summary>
