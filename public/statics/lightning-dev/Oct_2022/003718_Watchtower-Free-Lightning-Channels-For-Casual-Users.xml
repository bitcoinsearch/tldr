    <summary>In this email conversation, John and Bastien discuss the Watchtower-Free (WF) protocol for Lightning nodes. While John sees benefits in removing the intermediate HTLC-timeout transaction for outgoing payments, Bastien is concerned that DLUs (dedicated liquidity providers) won't be able to quickly move liquidity around, which could lead to prohibitively expensive charges for CLUs (casual liquidity users). John suggests refunding the remainder of the cost-of-capital pre-payment to the CLU, which would mitigate the disadvantage of the larger delay (1-3 months vs. 2 weeks) in the WF protocol. They also discuss inherited IDs proposal and provide links to related materials. The conversation ends with thanks and a note about using secure email from Proton Mail.</summary>
