    <summary>The Lightning Network is a payment protocol that allows for faster and cheaper transactions than traditional blockchain-based payment systems. The article highlights the challenges faced by net receivers, who have channels that accumulate more funds over time instead of sending them out. To ensure that net receivers also benefit from the Lightning Network, the forwardable peerswaps proposal can be used. This feature recycles sats and replenishes liquidity back to whoever gave them in the first place. Implementing forwardable peerswaps on a wide scale across the network will initiate more swaps and lead to net receivers getting more inbound capacity.The post also discusses offchain-to-onchain swaps and the possibility of forwarding them through a Payjoin transaction. However, currently deployed swap servers like lightning loop and boltz have a prepayment feature that may pose issues for pseudonymous protocols such as peerswap. To address this issue, paying the DoS prevention fee with an onchain transaction can make the prepayment and the responder's duty atomic.Additionally, the article discusses the feasibility of moving the peerswap feature to two hops, which would offer improved balance for free to intermediaries. Smart programs could automatically select an outgoing channel with high uptime and in need of balance adjustment, ensuring success while still offering a degradation in expected reliability. Overall, forwardable onchain-to-offchain peerswaps offer a promising solution to managing the liquidity of the Lightning Network. The post argues against the claim that the Lightning Network only benefits net senders, as there must be net senders for net receivers to exist.</summary>
