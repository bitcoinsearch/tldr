    <summary>The Lightning Network has updated its transaction format to use CPFP carve-out and anchor outputs, which allows nodes to set fees at broadcast time. However, this change brings new challenges as it requires nodes to maintain a reserve of available UTXOs for fee-bumping. This process involves complex decisions and dynamic risk assessment as nodes may need to fee-bump thousands of HTLC transactions in a short period of time. To solve this problem, each node can sign multiple versions of the HTLC transactions at various feerates, allowing pre-signed transactions that match the required feerate. This reduces the requirements on the on-chain wallet and simplifies transaction management logic. Bastien Teinturier raised concerns about the limitations of this proposal to handle dusty HTLC attacks and the complexity it introduces. He proposed a pragmatic approach to increase fund safety for existing node operators and wallets, with his proposal currently seeking concept ACKs. Bastien sent an email to the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding the implementation that needs to be provided and shared three links related to the same on Github. The first link is for a pull request numbered 688, the second link is for an issue numbered 845, and the third link is for another pull request numbered 1036.</summary>
