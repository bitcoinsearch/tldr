    <summary>The author proposes a technique for creating a maximally private channel that uses only absolute locktimes for the Lightning network. The commitment transactions must be signed at every block and dropped onchain as soon as a block arrives. The commitment transactions can be revoked using relative-timelocks, which can be implemented in Scriptless Script by pre-signing an nSequence transaction. However, this approach has drawbacks, such as bursts of activity on the Lightning network at every block and the risk of dropping offline. Despite the drawbacks, this approach provides extreme privacy without the need for relative locktimes or unpublished channels.</summary>
