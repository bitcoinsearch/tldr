    <summary>The article discusses the effects of Byzantine nodes on payment channels and transactions. The channel mechanism involves only two nodes, thus making a Byzantine fault impossible when considering it. However, Byzantine faults can only occur if at least three nodes exist. In the case of multi-hop forwarding mechanisms, for a hop node on a payment attempt, there are three participants: itself, the incoming node, and the outgoing node. The article examines each case and how it affects the payment. Regarding the impact of two Byzantine nodes opening a payment channel, those two nodes would be indistinguishable from a single node that has channels of both nodes. In such a case, the aggregate of the two nodes would own all the money in that payment channel, and it is no different from the aggregate HODLing its funds in a hot wallet. Therefore, it is immaterial to the rest of the network what games the aggregate of both nodes plays with the money that it holds solely as its own.</summary>
