    <summary>The email is a response to ZmnSCPxj, discussing the addition of random tweaks to channel traversal costs. The C-Lightning route randomization feature currently does this, but it is set to up to a +/- 5% tweak. A paper linked in the email suggests adding random tweaks to the costs of entire routes instead, although pathfinding algorithms may not be able to implement this easily. Since the analysis, total fuzzing has been replaced by a tweak of both the base and proportional fees, added along the CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) during the shadow route random walk. A link to the relevant GitHub code is included.</summary>
