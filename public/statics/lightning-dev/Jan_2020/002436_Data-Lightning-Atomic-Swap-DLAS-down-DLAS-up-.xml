    <summary>In an email conversation on 11/9/19, Takaya Imai mentioned that he did not describe a way to detect if data is correct or not, specifically referring to the zero knowledge proof process. Matt responded by asking if Takaya was familiar with Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP), which was originally designed for on-chain applications but can be used in lightning as it only requires a method to lock funds to a hash preimage.</summary>
