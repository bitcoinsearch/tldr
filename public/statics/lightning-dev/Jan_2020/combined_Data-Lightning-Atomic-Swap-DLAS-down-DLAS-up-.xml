    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list recently had discussions regarding the use of Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) to ensure correct data transfer. ZmnSCPxj suggested using ZKCP to lock funds to a hash preimage, whereas Matt Corallo advised against transferring data in lightning payments due to potential DoS issues. Instead, he recommended sending an encrypted copy of the file with the payment preimage as the decryption key, making it one atomic action.However, Subhra Mazumdar raised concerns about ensuring correctness for the entire asset when partitioned into several units. In response, ZmnSCPxj directed Subhra Mazumdar to a protocol that requires a zk proof of property of the entire file. The mailing list also discussed the use of ZK proofs and the lack of academic-style papers on ZKCP.The mailing list emphasized not using unnecessary data in lightning payments as it is DoS-y and rude to peers. While Zk proofs may be too slow for a consensus system where every party needs to download and validate them, they can be used for relatively simple programs with a two-party system. Matt Corallo suggested using ZKCP, originally designed for on-chain applications, which can be used in Lightning. However, there is no proper paper on ZKCP and various discussions can be found through Google.</summary>
