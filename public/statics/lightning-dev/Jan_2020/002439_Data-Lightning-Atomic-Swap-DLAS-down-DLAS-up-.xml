    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of Zero Knowledge proofs (ZK proof) in the Lightning Network and whether it would slow down the system, thereby defeating its purpose of scalability and faster transactions. Matt Corallo, a prominent Bitcoin developer, suggests that Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) may be a solution to this problem. While there is no academic-style paper on ZKCP, there have been various discussions about it. ZKCP was originally designed for on-chain applications, but it can also be used in the Lightning Network by locking funds to a hash preimage. The email exchange between Matt Corallo and Subhra Mazumdar is a part of the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
