    <summary>The email conversation between Max and Antoine discusses the transaction format used in Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Antoine clarifies that he is not referring to a binary transaction format, but rather a format similar to what is used in BOLT3. He expresses his concern about discrepancies in transaction fields among LN implementations, Coinjoin wallets, and core wallet transactions, which can leak information about the protocol or tooling being used to an external observer. To address this issue, Antoine suggests obfuscating or using standard values as much as possible within the protocol semantics to break chain analysis heuristics. In a separate email, Lisa Neigut responds to Max's question about whether PSBT (BIP 174) would be a good solution for wallet interoperability, stating that while it is a great protocol, it may be too heavy for transaction collaboration between two peers.</summary>
