    <summary>In an email thread, Matt Corallo suggested that Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) could be a useful way to detect the correctness of data without revealing it. ZKCP was originally designed for on-chain applications but can be implemented in Lightning as long as there is a method to lock funds to a hash preimage. The original poster expressed their gratitude for the information and mentioned they will look into the construction. The email thread was part of the Lightning-dev mailing list, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation.</summary>
