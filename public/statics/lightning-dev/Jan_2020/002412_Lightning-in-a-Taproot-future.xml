    <summary>In a discussion regarding improving the distinguishability of transactions with relative lock times, Lloyd Fournier suggests that setting relative time locks on normal payments would weaken the heuristic. Dave proposes to suggest to the Bitcoin Core project to set nSequence to the block age of the UTXO being spent in order to limit a sniper's ability to rearrange ancestor transactions. This could enhance existing anti-fee-sniping by reducing the amount of PoW covering any of its descendant transactions if they opt-in to this scheme. While Bitcoin Core has the necessary information to add an appropriate nSequence to its transactions, every wallet should be keeping track of its transaction's confirmation scores to know the nSequence delta to use for allowing transactions to be confirmed in the next block but no earlier block. Dave questions whether this change would be useful in providing privacy for the scheme ZmnSCPxj described.</summary>
