    <summary>A proposed algorithm for conducting payments that optimally reduces the imbalance of nodes when conducting a (multipath) payment was shared in an email. The algorithm assumes a node u wants to pay someone for an amount a and computes the new node balance coefficient ν′u after this imaginary payment has been conducted as τu−a/κu, where τu is the total amount of funds that node u currently has and κu is the sum of the capacities of all its payment channels. For all online channel partners, the algorithm computes ζ(u,v1),…,ζ(u,vd), assuming channels are ordered such that ζ(u,v1)&gt;…&gt;ζ(u,vd′) and omitting channels with ζ(u,vi)−ν′u&lt;u.In response to the email, it was suggested that the rule used in the algorithm might be useful to guide how to split a payment for multipath payments. For example, if a payer Alice has channels to Bob and Charlie, and Alice-Bob has A=0.5, B=0.5, and Alice-Charlie has A=0.5, C=0.5, then in order to retain balance, if Alice has to pay 0.1, it should strive to split the payment into a 0.05 via Alice-Bob and 0.05 via Alice-Charlie. It was asked whether it would be possible to derive such a calculation from the published rule, where if one of the payer channels is imbalanced in favor of the payer, then the payment probably should not be split, but if the payment is big enough that it would be imbalanced against the payer afterwards, then some small amount must be split out to another channel.</summary>
