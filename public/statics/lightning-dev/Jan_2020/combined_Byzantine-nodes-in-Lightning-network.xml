    <summary>The article explores the effects of Byzantine nodes on payment channels and transactions, particularly in multi-hop forwarding mechanisms. While the channel mechanism involves only two nodes, making a Byzantine fault impossible, it can occur when at least three nodes exist. If two Byzantine nodes open a payment channel, they become indistinguishable from a single node that owns all the money in the channel. This situation is no different from the aggregate HODLing its funds in a hot wallet, making it immaterial to the rest of the network what games the aggregate of both nodes plays with the money it holds solely as its own.However, there is a concern about the impact of Byzantine nodes on protocols, specifically in the context of payment channels. The author is searching for literature that addresses this issue since intermediate transactions may not be recorded if two Byzantine nodes open a payment channel. This scenario could affect other transactions routed through the same channel.</summary>
