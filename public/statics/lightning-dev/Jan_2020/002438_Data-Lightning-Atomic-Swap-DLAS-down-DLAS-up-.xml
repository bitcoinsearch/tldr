    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo mentions the concept of Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) as a way to verify the correctness of data using zero knowledge proofs. While there doesn't appear to be an academic-style paper specifically on ZKCP, there are various discussions about it that can be found through a Google search. Matt notes that this lack of formal documentation is not uncommon in the cryptocurrency space and can lead to relevant context being missed in academic papers. ZKCP was originally designed for on-chain applications but can also be used with lightning as long as there is a method to lock funds to a hash preimage.</summary>
