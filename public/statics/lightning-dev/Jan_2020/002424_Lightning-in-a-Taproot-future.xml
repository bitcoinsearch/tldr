    <summary>In a recent email exchange, ZmnSCPxj proposed implementing relative locktime in Poon-Dryja commitment transactions. This involves two outputs: one directly spendable by the remote side and one spendable by the local side after a relative locktime. However, a block chain analyst can rule out any transactions pairs using (nLockTime, nLockTime) or (nSequence, nSequence) as unilateral closes, eliminating 50% of transactions from the anonymity set protecting LN unilateral closes. Dave suggests improving this by having the remote side randomly select between nLockTime and nSequence for its transaction, but believes that dual timelocking provides better access to the full anonymity set.</summary>
