    <summary>According to calculations, it will cost approximately 94 satoshis to spend at minfee. The dust limit for Segwit outputs is 294, which assumes 3 times the minfee. Anchor outputs are set at 294 satoshis and are spendable, with a cost of $3 each if BTC is $1M. The anchor outputs are P2WSH, and the default dust limit for them is 330 satoshis. Lower costs are better as long as funder-pays, provided that they eventually get spent.</summary>
