    <summary>The author of this message is inviting fellow protocol developers to a meeting on Monday, January 20th, 2020. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss open issues and pull requests related to the Lightning specification. To ensure the meeting is productive, the author has created a tentative agenda [1] which includes a short list of items for discussion, as well as longer-term topics. The author also encourages other attendees to add any missing topics in the comments section of the document or by contacting him directly.To facilitate the discussion, the author has kept the list of issues and pull requests to a minimum. Additionally, two attendees will provide brief updates on dual-funding and trampoline proposals respectively. However, the author hopes to balance both short-term and long-term goals by adding discussions of research results to future meetings. Finally, the author emphasizes that issues or pull requests that are brought up during the meeting should be actionable and not require more than five minutes of discussion.</summary>
