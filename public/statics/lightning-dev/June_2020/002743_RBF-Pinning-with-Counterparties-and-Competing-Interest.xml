    <summary>In a recent email thread, Bitcoin Core developer, Dave Harding, raised concerns over the idea of Lightning Network (LN) nodes investing in mining pools to gain information about mempools and reduce attacks on the network. He suggested that incentivizing LN nodes to connect to the highest hashrate pools could create a centralization force by increasing existing economies of scale. Moreover, this approach could promote reputation-based centralising forces that push individual miners towards well-established pools. Instead, he recommended using independent pay-to-preimage transactions as incentive equivalents to paying normal on-chain transaction fees. Incentive equivalence means that it does not provide reputational advantage or direct economies of scale. However, ZmnSCPxj noted that pay-to-preimage doesn't work with PTLCs. On the issue of whether we need off-chain nodes to be somewhat heavily invested in on-chain operations, Harding doesn't see how eltoo helps.</summary>
