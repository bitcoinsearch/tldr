    <summary>In a recent message shared on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member suggests that fee futures may be a solution to current scalability issues. Although they cannot locate their earlier writing on the topic, a fellow member by the name of `harding` provides a link to a previous discussion on the matter. With fee futures, users can lock in a specific fee rate for a transaction at a later date, potentially reducing congestion and improving overall efficiency. It remains to be seen if fee futures will become widely adopted within the Bitcoin community, but it is an idea worth exploring.</summary>
