    <summary>The Lightning Network developer community is discussing possible ways to protect against a malicious participant that broadcasts a low-fee HTLC-success or Remote-HTLC-success transaction. One proposal suggests doing a Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) carve-out on the malicious transaction, but this may involve broadcasting thousands of transactions and could be messy. Another suggestion involves requesting parent transactions using P2P getdata(type='tx', id=$txid), and if received, extracting the preimage at no cost. This approach may involve less bandwidth and zero fees, but it requires careful timing and may not be effective against targeted relay attacks by motivated attackers who research which IP addresses belong to miners.</summary>
