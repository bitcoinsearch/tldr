    <summary>In an email exchange between Anthony Towns and Pierre, they discuss the initiation phase of a channel in relation to funding it. Pierre points out that assuming the initiator of a channel will fund it may not always be accurate, especially if the requester is a merchant who will only receive payments from it. He suggests making the initial funding low and having the lightning node fund the channel instead. Anthony shares his thoughts on the state orientation of the dot output, stating that he would prefer to see the protocol steps laid out rather than the states and transitions. He also discusses the potential for updating multiple HTLCs at once and proposes an alternative protocol with a more complicated structure but simpler state diagram. Additionally, he critiques the PRIO stuff as being klunky and suggests a better way to prioritize updates. Further, he highlights potential deadlocks and suggests adding a timeout waiting for messages before retrying or closing the channel. Finally, if the INIT_NOANCHOR is meant to implement the single-sided-anchor idea proposed in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1134319.msg11963141, he proposes adding a PKT_REBALANCE_VIA_BLOCKCHAIN option. He lays out the possible protocol steps for this rebalancing process.</summary>
