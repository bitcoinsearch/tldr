    <summary>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Btc Drak, the deployment of OP_CSV was discussed as a means of avoiding hacks. Btc Drak requested that interested parties review the OP_CSV BIP, pull request and related BIP68 PR. Additionally, Btc Drak mentioned the idea of a feature-pack softfork which includes CLTV+CSV+BIP68+median_past_timelock as a single softfork. The "median-past-locktime" pull requests were also made available for review and have direct relevance to Lightning as part of the locktime featureset referenced above. Links to the BIP discussion and core pull request were provided.</summary>
