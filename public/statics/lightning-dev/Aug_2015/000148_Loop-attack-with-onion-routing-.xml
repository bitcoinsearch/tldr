    <summary>In this email thread, Rusty Russell suggests peeling the onion in a specific case. The scenario discussed involves Alice sending a payment to Emma via Bob, Carol and Dave. Two cases are explored: Dave taking too long to talk to Emma and Carol pretending that Dave misbehaved when he didn't. In both cases, Bob is able to detect the problem and resolve the situation. However, this method reveals the entire chain of payees back to the root, potentially causing issues if the payment appears suspicious. The email concludes with the question of why use onion routing if the chain of payees is revealed.</summary>
