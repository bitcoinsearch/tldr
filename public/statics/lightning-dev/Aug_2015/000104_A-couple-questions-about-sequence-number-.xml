    <summary>Jeremy Rubin has asked a couple of questions regarding the use of sequence numbers in Lightning. Firstly, he enquires about the race conditions and how negative it is concerning the censorship vulnerability. He believes that certain things time out with respect to the Bitcoin blockchain height. He is not satisfied with section 9.5 of the paper and wants someone to outline better what the race conditions are and how it is addressed. Secondly, Jeremy raises concerns about using sequence numbers to select the right transaction to include. It would seem to leak information about how many LN transactions took place, making it meterable by external parties. For example, a miner could make the fee for settling proportional to it. To alleviate the ability to reliably meter, Jeremy suggests incrementing by a random amount. However, he also wonders if it is good that this can be metered.</summary>
