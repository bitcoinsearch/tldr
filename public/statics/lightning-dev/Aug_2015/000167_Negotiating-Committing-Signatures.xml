    <summary>Jeremy Rubin has proposed the addition of new signature schemes to Bitcoin and running lightning over multi-signature variants to make use of multiple signature schemes without drawbacks. This hybrid solution would be possible, but implementing novel crypto into Bitcoin is a large task. Rusty Russell responds that even with an "order of magnitude" increase in pubkey and signature sizes, it wouldn't make much logistical difference to the Lightning Network. However, giant pubkeys could pose logistical issues, but using the Bitcoin trick of referring to them via their RIPEMD160 should work there too.</summary>
