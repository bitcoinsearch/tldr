    <summary>In a recent discussion, Mats Jerratsch and Joseph were talking about implementing changes to the Thunder proposal. Joseph asked Mats about the impact of OP_CLTV on the proposal. After some analysis, Mats found that replacing CSV with CLTV is possible, but has its downsides. If something goes wrong during channel negotiation, one needs to wait for longer periods of time. Additionally, channels need to be reopened regularly, which creates problems of its own since it becomes impossible to accept an HTLC that passes CLTV timeout. Mats hopes that OP_CSV will be deployed soon to avoid such complications, but acknowledges that there is still plenty of work to be done in the meantime.</summary>
