    <summary>Rusty Russell sent an email on August 14, 2015 at 2:23 AM expressing his hope that OP_CSV gets deployed soon to avoid future hacks. He also requested those interested in the topic to review the OP_CSV BIP, pull request and related BIP68 PR. Rusty mentioned that a BIP proposal for median-past-timelock would be presented shortly and would need review. Additionally, there is growing support for a feature-pack softfork which includes CLTV+CSV+BIP68+median_past_timelock as a single softfork. Drak encouraged thoughts about this deployment option to establish consensus on how to move forward. Links to all relevant documents were provided in the email.</summary>
