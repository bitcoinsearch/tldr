    <summary>Rusty Russell, a developer, has acknowledged the need for a bitcoinj implementation of Lightning and appreciates any implementation as it is a positive step for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Russell has been non-responsive due to his focus on ensuring he is happy with the basic inter-node protocol, which they can start sharing. Russell likes doing protocol design with other implementers because it tends to yield great results, though he acknowledges that protocols are hard.</summary>
