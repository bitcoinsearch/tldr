    <summary>The Lightning repository is shared by Jasper Hugunin and the routing protocol used in the repository is a variant of distance-vector routing. The nodes inform their peers about the cost to reach node X and build routing tables with the help of this information. When payment needs to be sent, the node looks up its peers to forward the payment. The current routing protocol is a hack to demonstrate potential rather than a final solution. Bryan Bishop inquires about what happens if the peer does not know the destination or if there are more than one peer. He shares the link to the Github repository for reference.</summary>
