    <summary>On August 1, 2015, a discussion took place via email between Christopher Jamthagen, Eric Lombrozo, Rusty Russell and the Lightning Development mailing list. The conversation revolved around the possibility of stealing money from a hub, and the difficulties associated with outsourcing and pre-signing the stealing transaction. One issue discussed was that the txid of the revoked commitment transaction would not be known until the cheater signs and broadcasts it, making it impossible to pre-sign the stealing transaction for the third party. Despite these obstacles, the group pondered the idea of finding a clever way around them.</summary>
