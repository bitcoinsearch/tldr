    <summary>In a conversation between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns on August 24th, 2015, Rusty explains the process of resolving a hashed time-locked contract (HTLC) in a scenario where Dave times out. If Dave fails to resolve the HTLC within the required timeframe and does not send a blame packet back to Emma, Carol has to dump the commit tx (transaction) to the blockchain. In this case, the screwed-up HTLC and any other ongoing casualty HTLCs will be affected. However, she can include the commit tx and htlc txs in the blame packet back to Bob without naming Dave.Anthony Towns points out that the HTLC txn provides Dave's public key id, which is the only name that matters. Rusty disagrees, saying that there's no reason for the two to be connected, as one can offer any transaction as an anchor and use any keys they want.Finally, Rusty mentions that Joseph suggested a hack where all the channels open would be shown on the blockchain but he doesn't think it's necessary.</summary>
