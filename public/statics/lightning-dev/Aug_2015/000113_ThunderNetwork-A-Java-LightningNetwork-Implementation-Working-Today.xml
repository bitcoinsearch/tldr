    <summary>In this email exchange between Joseph and Mats, Joseph offers feedback on Mats' implementation of a Lightning Network Payment-Hub + Client written in Java. Joseph suggests that while the code can be used for further development, it should not be called a Lightning Network implementation due to its differences in design and trust models. He points out some potential issues with the implementation, such as the risk of exit scams and malleability risks with malicious servers. Joseph also notes that payment channel-based systems can provide value by allowing for important transactions of higher value without crowding out low-value transactions. Mats responds by explaining that while the network is no longer no-trust but low-trust, he will focus on building a potent backend in the future. He addresses some of Joseph's concerns and acknowledges the problem with RBF in the implementation.</summary>
