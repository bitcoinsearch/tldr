    <summary>In this email conversation, Pierre congratulates Rusty for his great work on lightning and mentions that he has made two dummy PRs on Rusty's GitHub project. He also raises a concern about the assumption made in OPEN_WAITING state where the event BITCOIN_ANCHOR_DEPTHOK will always happen before receiving the other party's PKT_OPEN_COMPLETE. Rusty explains that the packet is deferred until after the transition.Pierre then asks Rusty to confirm if Bob's state is correct in an Alice-&gt;Bob-&gt;Carol-&gt;Dave scenario. Rusty clarifies that Bob has two states here; the states are per connection and there's Bob-&gt;Alice and Bob-&gt;Carol. He confirms the correctness of the first three transitions but does not understand the last two transitions as they do not seem necessary. Rusty signs off the conversation by thanking Pierre and addressing him by name.</summary>
