    <summary>Jeremy Rubin has proposed the addition of new types of signature schemes to Bitcoin, with the aim of running lightning over multisignature variants. This would allow users to leverage the advantages of multiple signature schemes without their drawbacks. The proposal suggests using a "better to negotiate with" scheme for the main negotiations and switching to a "better to commit to" scheme when it is time to settle. The negotiation phase could be made easier by lowering the requirements to verify a payment.At present, ECDSA is the only signature scheme available in Bitcoin, which could make it difficult to implement this proposal. SecureRF has developed a novel signature algorithm based on the Braid Group, which promises to be significantly more efficient to verify. Although the size of their keys/signature is approximately an order of magnitude larger, their verification time is approximately 200x faster. Using this signature scheme as "B" could enable users to switch from B to A when settling payments, reducing the requirements to verify a payment and making embedded systems less expensive that can verify a lightning network payment.Rusty Russell responded to Jeremy Rubin's proposal stating that while a hybrid of signature schemes is possible, it would be a large task to get novel crypto into Bitcoin. The AEDSA signatures are around 6000 bits and have a length distribution, while the public keys are 344 bits long and constant length. Rusty suggests using the bitcoin trick of referring to giant pubkeys via their RIPEMD160 to avoid logistical issues.Derek Atkins considers creating a prototype of using AEDSA to gauge its performance, and asks whether he needs to only change within lightning or also update bitcoind/alphad. Rusty responds that implementing AEDSA would be a reasonable experiment, but changing novel crypto in Bitcoin would be a large task.</summary>
