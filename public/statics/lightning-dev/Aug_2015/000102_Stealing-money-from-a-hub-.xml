    <summary>A discussion on the timestop feature in Bitcoin's Lightning Network was had between two individuals, Christopher Jamthagen and Rusty. Christopher expressed concern that if the timestop feature were to activate only when the CLTV transaction is included in a block, it would leave the network open to a potential DoS attack vector where hubs can be forced to close channels with other hubs. Rusty countered this by suggesting that "time doesn't pass if a block is full" and that the CLTV block time and real block time would diverge by 1 block / ~10 minutes every time a block is full, making it necessary to explicitly supply the block-height at which the transaction that includes the CLTV was signed. Although there is no formal BIP for this yet, Rusty believes this solution is the only sane way to go about it.</summary>
