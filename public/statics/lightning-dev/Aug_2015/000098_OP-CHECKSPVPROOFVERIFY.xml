    <summary>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Eric Lombrozo, Eric expressed confusion over how to use OP_CAT. Rusty suggested that a merkle tree calculation can be open-coded using OP_CAT and OP_HASH256, eliminating the need for a new OP. However, Rusty also acknowledged that this discussion may not be relevant to the current list they were on and suggested finding a more appropriate forum.</summary>
