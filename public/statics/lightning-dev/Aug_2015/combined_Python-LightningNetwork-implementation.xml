    <summary>Jasper Hugunin, a developer at HashPlex has implemented a full prototype Lightning node in Python that supports micropayment channels supporting unilateral close, basic routing support allowing payments to be routed multiple hops, integration tests, and the MIT License. The routing protocol is a variant of distance-vector routing with nodes informing their peers beforehand about how to get to a node and the cost involved. Nodes use this information to build a routing table that determines which peer to forward payment to. However, the current routing protocol is something of a hack to demonstrate potential rather than a final solution. Routing is going to be hard, but this seems perfectly workable for bootstrapping. Jasper intends to follow Rusty's micro-payment channel design, but revocation and HTLCs have not yet been implemented. Routing also uses an insecure payment forwarding algorithm (since HTLCs are missing), and does not handle channels closing. Jasper has attempted to split the server, the UI, the channel protocol, and the routing protocol into separate modules so that they can be developed independently.</summary>
