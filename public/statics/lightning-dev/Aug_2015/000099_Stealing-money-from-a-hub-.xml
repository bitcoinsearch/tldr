    <summary>Eric Lombrozo and Christopher Jamthagen discussed about a third party notification system for detecting stealing transactions in a network. Lombrozo mentioned that once he is notified, he could sign the stealing transaction and take all the money himself. Lombrozo suggested that if the system works perfectly, the "they tried to cheat!" case never happens and anyone relying on income from that event will go broke. However, it is not possible for the watcher to prove that they notified the user of the stealing transaction. Therefore, Rusty suggested paying a tiny amount in advance every month instead of relying on the watcher's notification. Rusty also mentioned that he knows some clever people designing a micropayment network that could be used for this purpose.</summary>
