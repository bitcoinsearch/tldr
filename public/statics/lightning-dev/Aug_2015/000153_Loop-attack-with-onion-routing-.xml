    <summary>In a conversation between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns, they discuss the possibility of using different keys for each channel on the Lightning Network. This would make it so that the key is not linked to the Lightning Network ID used for routing, which could prevent fraudulent behavior. However, there is still a risk that someone could construct a fake channel closure transaction to try and deceive others. It would cost a bitcoin transaction and lock up their bitcoins for the timeout period, but this may not be enough to deter all fraudulent behavior. Overall, the conversation emphasizes the importance of security measures in preventing fraud on the Lightning Network.</summary>
