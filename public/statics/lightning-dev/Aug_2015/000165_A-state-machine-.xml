    <summary>In this email exchange, Rusty Russell suggests some changes to the state diagram of the lightning network protocol. He proposes laying out the diagram differently, with multiple graphs starting at INIT/NORMAL with a single cmd/pkt and ending at NORMAL'/CLOSED/ERROR. He also suggests combining error paths that apply to many states in the output. There is a discussion about the optimization of updating many HTLCs at once rather than using ADD_HTLC, COMPLETE_HTLC, TIMEOUT_HTLC, etc. Rusty thinks it's too early to do this. The PRIO stuff is discussed, and Rusty finds it klunky. He suggests having a constant tiebreak in case of simultaneous/overlapping channel updates, but this could lead to livelock. They also discuss the potential deadlock situation if both systems think they're high priority. Finally, Rusty proposes a PKT_REBALANCE_VIA_BLOCKCHAIN option for rebalancing the channel.</summary>
