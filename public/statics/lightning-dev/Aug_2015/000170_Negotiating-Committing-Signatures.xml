    <summary>In this email exchange, Rusty Russell is responding to a proposal by Jeremy Rubin suggesting the addition of new types of signature schemes to Bitcoin and running lightning over multi-signature variants to utilize the advantages of multiple signature schemes without drawbacks. Rusty acknowledges that the hybrid proposal is possible but notes that getting novel crypto into Bitcoin is a large task. He also mentions that giant pubkeys might be a logistical issue but that using the bitcoin trick of referring to them via their RIPEMD160 should work there too. Rusty explains that AEDSA signatures are around 6000 bits and not constant length and that even with these sizes, there is a tremendous verification performance increase over ECDSA. Finally, Derek Atkins provides his contact information and a confidentiality disclaimer at the end of the email.</summary>
