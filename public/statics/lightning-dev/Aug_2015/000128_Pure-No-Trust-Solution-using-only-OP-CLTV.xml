    <summary>In this context, Joseph Poon agrees with Mats Jerratsch that it is possible to use a model of OP_CLTV without OP_CSV by using a balance reserve. This was discussed in a mailing list along with caveats on the risks and effects of doing so. Mats asks how much is possible with only CLTV implemented in relation to changes of OP_CLTV in Thunder proposal. Joseph believes very minor changes to the code would result in full lightning channels as per Rusty's doc. There will be huge benefits to Bitcoin if bitcoinj has an implementation ready when OP_CLTV/OP_CSV is implemented.</summary>
