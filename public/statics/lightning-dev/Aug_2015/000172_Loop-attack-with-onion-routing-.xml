    <summary>On August 31, 2015, Rusty Russell proposed a new scheme on the mailing list. The proposal suggests that users return a valid unilateral close transaction, or else their channel would be closed by Rusty himself. He argues that this proposal is effective because unilateral closes can be painful due to locked funds, fees, and opportunity costs. Anthony Towns supports this proposal and says it's more than enough for now. It seems that the proposal was made in the context of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, which allows for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions by creating off-chain payment channels between users.</summary>
