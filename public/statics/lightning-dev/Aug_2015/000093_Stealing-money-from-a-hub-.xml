    <summary>In an email thread from August 1, 2015, Eric Lombrozo and Rusty Russell discuss the issue of stealing money from a hub in relation to Lightning Network. Russell mentions that outsourcing needs a new sighash op mode or normalized txids in order to design a deployable system around it, but he did not elaborate on this. Lombrozo asks for clarification on what Russell meant by this, to which Russell responds stating that the txid of the revoked commitment transaction will not be known until the cheater signs and broadcasts it. This means that pre-signing the stealing transaction for a third party is not possible.</summary>
