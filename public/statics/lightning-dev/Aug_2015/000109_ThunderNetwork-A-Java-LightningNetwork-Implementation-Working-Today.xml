    <summary>The Lightning Network Payment-Hub + Client implementation in Java has been introduced by a developer which can be accessed on http://thunder.network and https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork. The channel design has been modified to work on the current Blockchain without requiring softforks, making it low-trust. However, with upcoming new OP_CODES, this will change. The prototype wallet provided will be followed by a potent backend in the future. Developers are encouraged to add these functionalities to their existing wallets as there are many already available. The use of such payment networks will help alleviate pressure in the blocksize-debate and leave more space for important transactions of higher value. The developer is available for further explanations and discussion on IRC channels under the name mjerr.</summary>
