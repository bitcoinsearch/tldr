    <summary>In this conversation, Mats and Joseph discuss the possibility of using OP_CLTV without OP_CSV as a mandatory minimum for a full Lightning Network. Joseph mentions that he had previously discussed this model on the mailing list with some caveats on the risks and effects of doing so. He provides a link to the message ID for reference. Mats responds by working out how much is possible with only CLTV implemented and thinks that very minor changes to the code would result in full lightning channels. Joseph agrees and believes there will be huge benefits to Bitcoin if bitcoinj has an implementation ready when OP_CLTV/OP_CSV is implemented.</summary>
