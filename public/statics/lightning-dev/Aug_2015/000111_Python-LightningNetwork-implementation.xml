    <summary>Jasper Hugunin, a developer at HashPlex, has announced the release of a full prototype Lightning node in Python. The Lightning node includes features such as micropayment channels that support unilateral close and basic routing support allowing payment to be routed multiple hops. Integration tests have also been included. The Lightning node is set to be released tomorrow and is licensed under the MIT License.
