    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, Christian Decker discussed the proposal for `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`. While he acknowledges that it is a powerful tool, he also notes that all sighash flags can be dangerous if not well understood. He believes that from a technical and risk standpoint, there is not much difference between a new opcode or a new sighash flag. Decker proposes using the existing segwit version with the NOINPUT feature, rather than creating a new one. The proposal being minimal should help streamline discussions and prevent people from trying to add their favorite feature. He also suggests that the code does not have to be much more complicated with a separate opcode; passing an extra flag to TransactionSignatureChecker::CheckSig() is probably close to enough.</summary>
