    <summary>The discussion involves the use of SIGHASH_NOINPUT and SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY on transactions with multiple inputs to include additional fees for updating transactions. The Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels are compared to the Poon-Dryja/LN-penalty channels in terms of the number of transactions required, with the Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels requiring more transactions due to CSV-encumberance on settlement transactions. This may complicate routing decisions for a mixed network where some channels are Poon-Dryja and some are Decker-Russell-Osuntokun. The proposed solution is to introduce this as a local feature by extending the `channel_update` message with a `csv_delta` parameter. Nodes unaware of this new channel type will only build routemaps of Poon-Dryja channels. If a peer does not support Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels, then it is impossible to fund such channels with them.</summary>
