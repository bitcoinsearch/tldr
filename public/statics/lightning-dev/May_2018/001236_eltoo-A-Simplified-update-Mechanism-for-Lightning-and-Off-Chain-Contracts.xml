    <summary>In this message, the author raises some concerns and confusions with regards to a paper's description of a setup transaction. The author notes that the paper is not clear on what the setup transaction should look like and that there is a mix-up between the setup transaction and funding transaction. Additionally, there seems to be a misunderstanding of changing the output from the setup transaction into a 2-of-2 multisig output when it already is one. The author seeks clarification on how the setup transaction is supposed to look without the changes described in section 4.2. They also mention that they are unsure about the pros and cons of getting rid of the trigger transaction proposed by ZmnSCPxj. However, they do note that a major advantage of getting rid of the trigger transaction would be that only two transactions (latest update and settlement) would need to be committed to the blockchain in the unilateral case, compared to three in the approach presented in the paper. Overall, the author seeks further explanation and clarification on the setup transaction and expresses interest in the proposed solution by ZmnSCPxj.</summary>
