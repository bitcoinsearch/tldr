    <summary>In a discussion among individuals involved in the Lightning Network development, Benjamin Mord expresses concern that the scriptless scripts concept may fall to Schor's algorithm. He recommends caution when depending on functional concepts whose underlying cryptographic primitives cannot be swapped in an emergency. While ecdsa is currently used, it is vulnerable to Schor's algorithm, but there are a variety of backup primitives available. Mord suggests that if scriptless scripts are found possible under lattice-based cryptography, it could be a solution. Greg Sanders responds by mentioning that the linear properties of signature tricks are maintained under a number of post-quantum schemes, specifically lattice-based cryptography. However, they both agree that redundancy of any sort is good, even when not focused specifically on quantum risks. In the context of asymmetric cryptography, there are not many post-quantum schemes, only one: lattice-based cryptography which can use hash functions to create something like asymmetric signatures as well.</summary>
