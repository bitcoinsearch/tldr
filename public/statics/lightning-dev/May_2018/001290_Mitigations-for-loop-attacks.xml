    <summary>In this context, ZmnSCPxj discusses the relationship between reputation and `reputation_loss_rate` in HTLC. Reputation score is a private per-node thing while `reputation_loss_rate` is explicit in the HTLC. The reputation bins are assigned to half-chans rather than to nodes. Graphing reputation loss along the line as N increases, they form a triangle, and the area of the triangle is the total reputation destroyed, where only one edge of the triangle is lost by the Node18-&gt;Mallory3 reputation score.</summary>
