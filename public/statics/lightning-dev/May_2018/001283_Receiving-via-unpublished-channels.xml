    <summary>In an email exchange between nayuta-ueno and ZmnSCPxj, the former requested clarification on whether c-lightning checks the 'r' field from payee's invoice. ZmnSCPxj replied that the invoice has a signature for the entire invoice, but only the payee's signature is included in the channel fee. The payee has an incentive to provide accurate channel information since incorrect information could lead to payment failure. Therefore, only the payee's signature should suffice and if they provide bad information, they risk not getting paid.</summary>
