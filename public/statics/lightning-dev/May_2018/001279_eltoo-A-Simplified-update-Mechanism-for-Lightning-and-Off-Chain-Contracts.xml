    <summary>In this email exchange, Christian and ZmnSCPxj discuss the impact of CSV-encumberance on settlement transactions that carry contracts in the channel. They compare it to Poon-Dryja where commitment transactions are unencumbered by CSV and only the revocation to spends of the contracts being transported is inserted. Christian argues that the CSV delay is shared across all nodes in the route and not additive unlike CLTV delay, but it does not mesh well with current routing algorithms. ZmnSCPxj suggests c-lightning to use a "find all paths" algorithm instead of the shortest-path algorithm as it would support extensions like max S or negative fees better. This new algorithm would filter out any routes that exceed maximum total delay and forwarding fee.</summary>
