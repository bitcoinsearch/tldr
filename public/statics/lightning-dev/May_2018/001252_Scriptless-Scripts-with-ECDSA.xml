    <summary>The email exchange discusses the potential vulnerabilities of cryptographic algorithms in the face of quantum computing. The author acknowledges a mistake in labeling something "post-quantum" without mathematical proof and instead refers to lattice-based cryptography as a Shor's algorithm-resistant scheme. The finite lifespan of cryptographic primitives is mentioned and the importance of planning for their eventual failure is emphasized. The possibility of both classical and quantum cryptanalysis leading to broken primitives is discussed, requiring preparations on the part of systems relying solely on cryptography. In particular, scriptless scripts are addressed as a functional concept that falls to Schor's algorithm and lacks alternative implementations, highlighting the need for cryptographic conservatism and planning for emergencies. The need for redundancy and the salience of certain primitives' finite lifespan is emphasized. The email also briefly touches on the possibility of asymmetric signatures through hash functions in contexts where time can be used for asymmetry.</summary>
