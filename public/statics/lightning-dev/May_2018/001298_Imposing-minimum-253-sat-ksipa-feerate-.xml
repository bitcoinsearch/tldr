    <title>Imposing minimum 253 sat/ksipa feerate?</title>

    <summary>C-lightning, a Lightning Network implementation, has imposed a minimum 253 sat/ksipa feerate due to differences in fee computation between BOLT specifications and bitcoind. The BOLT spec specifies a fee computation that is not identical to how bitcoind computes fees. Thus, the minimum 250 sat/ksipa feerate, if computed using the BOLT spec, will result in a fee which bitcoind will compute as less than the minimum 250 sat/ksipa it imposes. C-lightning will not accept an onchain feerate (from `update_fee`) of less than 253 sat/ksipa due to the above issue with the divergence in how BOLT and bitcoind compute fees. This has resulted in some issues in C-lightning where unilateral closure occurs when the counterparty proposes a 250sat/ksipa feerate. Although C-lightning has increased the ranges recently, the 253sat/ksipa limit remains a hard limit and will still cause C-lightning to unilaterally close if the counterparty gives an `update_fee` of less than 253 sat/ksipa.</summary>
