    <summary>The context discusses the potential vulnerabilities in Lightning's signature algorithms and message transport encryption. The author proposes a new message protocol for re-anchoring transactions, which includes a new "signing algo" concept and a new "reopen_channel" to move a channel from one signing algorithm to another. The vulnerability of Scriptless Script used for payment forwarding is also discussed, with the author noting that it can only be used for payment forwarding and that we can fall back to hashlocking if necessary. The author suggests having functionally equivalent backups on paper for every function, even if only on paper, until at least one or two mathematically dissimilar assumptions have been found as alternative backup foundation. The article ends with a discussion of different ways to do Scriptless, but notes that all of these still depend on the Discrete Log Problem being Hard.</summary>
