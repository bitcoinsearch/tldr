    <title>Receiving via unpublished channels</title>

    <summary>In a post on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj raised issues regarding creating invoices with 'r' fields while implementing support for them. To receive via an unpublished channel, it is important to know what onLightning fees the other side of that channel wants to charge. The problem arises when in case of an unpublished channel, we do not send channel_announcement and channel_update. Without sending the channel_update, the other side of the channel never informs us of the onLightning fees they want to charge if we would receive funds by this channel. An idea discussed was to simply send 'channel_update' as soon as the channel is locked. ZmnSCPxj asked the other LN implementations (lnd, eclair, ucoin, lit) if they should consider standardizing this behavior (i.e. send 'channel_update' after lock-in regardless of published/unpublished state), and if so, how to get the onLightning fee rates to put into invoice 'r' fields for private routes. It seems back-compatible, and software which does not expect this behavior will simply drop the 'channel_update' (as they do not follow a 'channel_announcement').</summary>
