    <summary>The concept of scriptless scripts is vulnerable to Schor's algorithm and currently has no alternative implementation. Benjamin Mord urges caution when depending on functional concepts whose cryptographic primitives cannot be swapped in an emergency. While ecdsa is also vulnerable to Schor's algorithm, there are backup primitives available. The functional concept of scriptless scripts is promising, but cryptographic conservatism must be added before building upon it. There is hope that scriptless scripts may be possible under lattice-based cryptography.</summary>
