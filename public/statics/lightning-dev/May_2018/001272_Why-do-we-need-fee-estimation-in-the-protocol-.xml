    <summary>The author questions the need for consensus in fee estimation for BOLT#3, stating that the current algorithm may be sub-optimal and subjective. They propose that each peer should have the ability to determine the fee for their own commitment transaction, with the peer who has an interest in committing to a certain transaction paying the fee. The author also suggests that changing the fee may not require a new revocation secret and that peers should be free to choose their own fees during normal operation, except in cases where there are significant HTLCs. However, updating the fee would require changes to follow-up transactions due to the change in txID.</summary>
