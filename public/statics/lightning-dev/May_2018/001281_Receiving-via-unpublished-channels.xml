    <title>Receiving via unpublished channels</title>

    <summary>In response to a query about whether c-lightning checks something in the 'r' field from payee's invoice, ZmnSCPxj clarifies that the 'r' field doesn't contain a signature like the 'channel_update'. He further explains that the invoice has a signature for the whole invoice and only the payee signature is needed since the fee for this channel is from the peer of the payee. The payee has an incentive to provide accurate information about the channel as payment may fail if the channel fees or CLTV-delta is not as expected. Therefore, only the payee signature is required and if the payee provides incorrect information about the channel, they lose out on getting paid.</summary>
