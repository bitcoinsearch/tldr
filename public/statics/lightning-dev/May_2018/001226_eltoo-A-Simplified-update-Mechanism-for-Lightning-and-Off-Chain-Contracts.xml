    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a cryptocurrency expert, has received an interesting paper and is questioning the use of terminology in it. Specifically, there is confusion around the terms "input script" and "output script." ZmnSCPxj quotes a portion of the paper that defines "input script" as referring to `witnessProgram` and `scriptPubKey`, and "output script" as referring to `witness` or `scriptSig`. However, Figure 2 in the paper uses the term "output script" to refer to what appears to be a `witnessProgram`, `scriptPubKey`, or `redeemScript`. The figure displays an output script used by on-chain update transactions and contains conditional statements with multiple `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` operations.</summary>
