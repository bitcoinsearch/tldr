    <summary>The author suggests that the main problem with decentralized crypto/crypto exchange on the Lightning network is that participants can delay transactions to speculate on exchange rate changes. Two approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue. The first approach involves a latency monitor service which can be used as a source of information for building reputation, but dealing with reputation in a community of easily-created pseudonyms has its own set of issues. The second approach delegates the job of executing the Lightning transaction to a trusted third party that prevents cooperation with the other trading party to perform the delay attack. This design is not perfectly trust-free decentralized, but it gains a lot compared to traditional exchanges. It may not be needed to let a single Lightning node have channels for different cryptocurrencies; one node for each currency can be used, and higher-level exchange software can do the forwarding. Decentralized Lightning-based exchange might not be competitive for very high-frequency or high-volume needs, but for casual use by those already on Lightning, it might have some use. This approach eliminates the need for exchanges with large amounts of stored crypto assets, which are an attractive target for hackers.</summary>
