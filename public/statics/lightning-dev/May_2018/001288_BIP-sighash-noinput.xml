    <summary>A proposal called 'SIGHASH_NOINPUT' has been discussed in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal suggests a more general and technically simpler implementation by having a boolean specifying whether the inputs listed must be all of them or a subset of everything, similar to outputs. A single boolean could also apply to both. The proposal has received general enthusiasm with no major criticism. Christian Decker has requested the BBEs to assign a BIP number to the proposal. He has implemented hashing in Bitcoin Core but it is unlikely to sail through review. The lack of groundwork on witness V1 scripts means it cannot be tested now. However, it is noted that some fork coins have used sighash 0x40 as FORKID which does not conflict with this proposal since it only applies to segwit transactions. Discussions are being held on how to move forward with implementing this proposal and combining multiple proposals into the next soft-fork.</summary>
