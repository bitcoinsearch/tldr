    <summary>The Lightning Network community has been discussing the use of scriptless scripts to replace regular 2-of-2 multisig with a single p2wkh. The benefits of this change include lower fees for opening and closing channels, smaller public key scripts and htlc timeout+success transactions, and openings and cooperative close transactions blending in with anonymity set of regular p2wkh transactions. One proposed implementation is the Paillier technique, which involves a setup phase requiring three proofs: a proof that the Paillier public key is well-formed, a dlog proof for the signing keys themselves, and a proof that value encrypted is actually the dlog of the public key to be used for signing. These proofs can be piggybacked onto the existing channel funding steps, taking one round trip time (RTT) or slightly longer with the third proof. The additional cryptographic overhead and increased size of opening messages are the main costs associated with this approach.Another proposal is the ECDSA-version of scriptless scripts by Pedro Moreno Sanchez. This method uses only two-party ECDSA signatures and allows for the use of scriptless scripts without waiting for Schnorr signatures to be deployed in Bitcoin. However, adding an HTLC would require N RTTs, and the onion payload would need to be re-interpreted to encode G*alpha. Both proposals have advantages and disadvantages, and each requires modifications to the process of adding and settling an HTLC and the onion payload. Additionally, introducing new end-to-end contract types could partition the network and limit path diversity.</summary>
