    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposal of a reputation system for Lightning Network. The discussion covers different aspects of the proposed system, including the penalty for delayed channel closure, the potential incentives for nodes to fail payments, and the risks associated with the proposed system. The email thread also delves into the issue of reputation loss and how it can be prevented through the proposed system. Some concerns are raised about the leakage of information due to the aggregation of losses along the route, but it is argued that this actually serves to prevent large nodes from ruining links elsewhere. Overall, the email thread provides a detailed analysis of the proposed reputation system and its potential benefits and drawbacks.</summary>
