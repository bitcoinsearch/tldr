    <summary>In an email exchange between Christian Decker and Carsten Strotmann, they discuss the creation of a setup transaction in Bitcoin's Script language. Decker suggests changing the wording to "funding transaction" or "multiparty output" to avoid confusion. They also discuss the complexity of the setup transaction output and suggest referencing Figure 2 to address any confusion. Strotmann asks if a second output (change) would work, but it is unclear whether this suggestion was adopted. The email signature includes information about Andrena Objects AG, including upcoming events.</summary>
