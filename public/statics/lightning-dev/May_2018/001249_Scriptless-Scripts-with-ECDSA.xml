    <title>Scriptless Scripts with ECDSA</title>

    <summary>The concept of scriptless scripts, as currently formulated, falls to Schor's algorithm and lacks alternative implementation. The underlying cryptographic primitives cannot be swapped in an emergency, thereby posing a potential threat. While ecdsa is used for such purposes, it too is vulnerable to Schor's algorithm. However, unlike scriptless scripts, there are several backup primitives available for ecdsa that fulfill the same functional objective. If scriptless scripts were possible under lattice-based cryptography, it would be a significant development. Although the functional concept of scriptless scripts is impressive, there needs to be some cryptographic conservatism before building on it to avoid creating a house of cards.</summary>
