    <summary>The passage discusses various patches applied to the Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLT) used in the Lightning Network. These patches standardize pluralization for 'HTLC', explain channel reserve and the use of 'push-msat', describe how retransmission of any channel messages works, outline the unique set of keys used in each commitment transaction, and discuss the structure of an onion packet used in onion routing.The passage goes on to explain the process of forwarding a hashed time-locked contract (HTLC) packet through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network. It provides examples of error packets that can occur when forwarding an HTLC packet and discusses the process of blinding messages in the network.Additionally, the passage covers the ways a channel can end: cooperation, force-close, and breach, and the handling of on-chain HTLC output. The official Noise protocol name for Lightning Network's variant is "Noise_XK_secp256k1_ChaChaPoly_SHA256".Lastly, the passage includes a script called spellcheck.sh that can be used to spellcheck files using Aspell, with the homedir being in the tools/ directory of the repository.</summary>
