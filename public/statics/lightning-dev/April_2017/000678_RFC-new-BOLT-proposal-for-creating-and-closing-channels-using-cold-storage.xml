    <summary>A user named Jonathan Underwood has written a very primitive BOLT for consideration and is seeking feedback on it. He has provided a link to the BOLT in a GitHub gist. He is requesting ways to mitigate the scenario where a single attacker compromises both sides of the channel, or at least give the channel owners a fighting chance. Underwood is the Chief Bitcoin Officer at Bitbank. He has included his PGP public key block for encrypted messages.</summary>
