    <summary>A Lightning developer commented that technically, balancing channels by paying oneself is possible with c-lightning by manually creating a circular route and using the `sendpay` JSON-RPC command. However, there is currently no built-in support for this feature and it may not be necessary to consider from a protocol point of view. Another developer pointed out that channel balance may not necessarily be desirable and depends on use cases. In the example given, balancing the channels would mean Bob could no longer pay a 1.5BTC invoice in the balanced case. Once AMP is possible, this consideration will no longer be an issue. The original message proposed a function in the CLI allowing Bob to pay himself and specify which two channels he would like to balance automatically but expressed concerns about the risk of oscillation if everyone in the network started doing this.</summary>
