    <summary>In a discussion about how to receive Lightning Network payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel, ZmnSCPxj provided several options. One option is to try the Blockstream Store route, where people will make channels to you if you do it early enough. Another option is to publish the node and contact details (IP or TOR onion service) and hope people are excited enough about your product to open a channel to you. The third option that could be interesting for some businesses is to wait for a service to offer deals like "up to 300mBTC receive for only 1mBTC! At least 3 months channel alive!" for new upcoming businesses. However, Cezary thinks this option may not work well for businesses like an ATM that need to be able to receive and send funds through a balanced channel. Without the possibility of both-side funding channels, it's hard to establish such a channel, requiring trust to hub. Though LN is in its early stages, Cezary wonders why both sides cannot fund channels. ZmnSCPxj explained that it's because of trust issues and technical limitations, but Cezary wonders whether this will be added to BOLT and implemented in the future.</summary>
