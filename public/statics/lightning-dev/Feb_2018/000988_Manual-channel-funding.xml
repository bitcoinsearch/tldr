    <summary>Currently, users are unable to manually choose outputs to fund their channels on the platform. Additionally, there is no option to fund a channel with "all available funds". One user reported setting up a channel and attempting to use all of their available funds, resulting in a transaction on the blockchain with an output for 980 SAT. The user suggested the implementation of an option to "take fee from funding amount", as well as the ability to choose exact outputs to spend.</summary>
