    <summary>The Lightning Development team discussed the implementation of three new feature bitpairs. The first one, 'query_short_channel_id', was deemed trivial to implement. The second one, 'query_channel_range/reply_channel_range', requires channel index by block number and zlib for compression. To expedite deployment, a byte or two could be added to denote compression scheme and allow for progressive rollouts of more context-specific optimized schemes. The third feature is a gossip_timestamp field in `init`. From the perspective of Laolu Osuntokun, additional fields cannot be appended to the `init` message as it already contains two variable sized fields (and no fixed size fields). Instead, it should be a distinct `chan_update_horizon` message. Fabrice Drouin suggested adding a `data` field which contains zipped ids like in reply_channel_range so they can query several items with a single message. The team agreed that adding an additional encoding_type field before data could work. Rusty Russell tried various compression schemes, such as gzip -9 and delta, to decrease the number of bytes required. They found that the deltagz scheme worked the best.</summary>
