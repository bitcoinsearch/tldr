    <summary>The Lightning Network is a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables faster and cheaper transactions by using payment channels between parties. A question frequently asked is whether it is possible to send $6 payment atomically, combining five $2 channels. The answer is yes, but proof of payment would be lost in the process. Rusty Russell suggests that this problem could be resolved when scriptless scripts or other decorrelation mechanisms are introduced. He also adds that multipath payments may result in increased reliability and privacy, which are overwhelmingly compelling reasons for their adoption. Johan proposes a solution to maintain proof of payment, which involves requiring two hashes to claim the HTLC - the presage from the invoice payment hash and the new hash introduced here. However, this solution would require changes to scripts. Schnorr/EC operations could make this process even more elegant.</summary>
