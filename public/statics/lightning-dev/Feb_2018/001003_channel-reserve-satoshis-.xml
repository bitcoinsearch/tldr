    <summary>The conversation between Cezary and ZmnSCPxj discusses various aspects of the Lightning Network (LN) and its functionality. They talk about the risks involved in opening channels to few nodes, compared to opening channels to more nodes. The current code in c-lightning tends to couple "channel" to "peer" too much, making it difficult to open multiple channels with a single participant. LND can form multiple channels with peer LND, but currently, c-lightning daemon will reject the multiple channel attempt from LND.They discuss the possibility of having both-side funding channels for new businesses like an ATM that needs to send and receive funds. ZmnSCPxj suggests not trusting a single hub and instead encouraging more hubs by having incoming 300mBTC from one hub and making an outgoing 300mBTC to another hub. Another option is to make "circular superhubs" where small groups cooperate and each member opens channels with the other two members. This allows for seamless sending and receiving to anyone on the network.In terms of receiving LN payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel, options include doing the Blockstream Store route, publishing node and contact details, waiting for services to offer deals like "up to 300mBTC receive for only 1mBTC! At least 3 months channel alive!", or asking a friend to channel to you. While there are trust issues with dual-funding channels, there is an issue regarding this, but priority is given to the implementation of payments. Overall, they talk about various ways to improve network connectivity and encourage more participation in the LN.</summary>
