    <summary>The ownership agreement between a payer and payee is usually verified through payment proof, which specifies the obligation but not necessarily the identity of the payee. However, privacy concerns exist with the knowledge of both the payer and payee identities. The Lightning network has focused on the privacy issues of the payer, rather than the recipient of funds. To address this, various solutions have been suggested for anonymous payments. One such solution is a "pre-cooked" onion option that uses shared secrets to ensure anonymity. However, this approach may compromise privacy. Another solution is to remove destination awareness or create multiple nodes to keep transactions private.Donating money anonymously to a node without leaving proof of the payer's identity can be achieved by routing the payment from the payer to the payee and back to the payer, with a hefty fee left to the payee. This approach uses bi-directional routing, where the payee first finds a route to themselves from a rendezvous node, onion-encrypts that route, passes it to the payer (with the rendezvous node ID), and the payer adds to that route the onion route from payer to rendezvous point. This way, the payer knows the rendezvous node ID but not the payee node ID, while the payee knows the rendezvous node ID but not the payer node ID.However, the proof-of-payment mechanism's privacy implications are a concern since it provides cryptographic evidence to the buyer or seller that a specific party performed a transaction. One possible solution is to reduce the strength of proof-of-payment so that it is only used in front of previously-agreed-on dispute resolution parties.</summary>
