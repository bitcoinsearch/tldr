    <summary>The discussion revolves around the privacy concerns that arise from having a signed invoice that provides cryptographic evidence to the buyer and/or seller that a particular transaction has taken place. However, it is clarified that this is an opt-in feature and either party can choose to skip the proof-of-payment scheme if they wish to. From the perspective of the network, it is indistinguishable and only the end points need to decide if they want to opt in for it. The concept of proof-of-payment is defined as a piece of data known to the payee that allows them to prove that payment was made to them and in exchange, they agreed to transfer ownership or provide services. The requirements for proof-of-payment include that it must be available to the payer who has the burden of proof, must prove agreement between both parties, and must mention specific obligations and identity. While the current invoice protocol meets most of these requirements, there are still privacy concerns that arise, such as the requirement for the payer to learn the payee's identity and the payee to learn the payer's identity. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of maintaining privacy while also providing a secure and accurate proof-of-payment system.</summary>
