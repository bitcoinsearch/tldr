    <summary>The lightning-dev mailing list has discussed the need for a stop-gap solution to fix the naive table dump on initial connect. With the size of the testnet graph, tens of thousands of messages have to be sent even if nodes are already fully synced upon initial connect. Christian Decker proposed adding a new feature bit indicating that the `init` message is extended with a u32 `gossip_timestamp`, interpreted as a UNIX timestamp. However, Laolu believes that a new message is required instead of extending the `init` message. Fabrice Drouin's proposal cares only about newly created channels and uses an update horizon in which vertexes+edges with a lower time stamp just shouldn't be set at all. The use case for this is mobile nodes or nodes which are often offline and need to resync very often. The lightning-dev mailing list is open for further discussion and proposals.</summary>
