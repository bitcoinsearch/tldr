    <summary>The privacy focus of payment has been on the payer more than on the recipient. To address this, there could be an ability to provide a pre-cooked onion that would allow payment to an anonymous destination directly or via a middleman who has that pre-cooked onion. However, it is not possible now as shared secrets required for decoding error replies allow decryption of the entire onion. It is suggested that errors from the final destination are needed to reflect them. A simple tweak to use the SHA256() of the secrets for shared secret used to encrypt the error replies would allow providing those error secrets along with the onion.The proof-of-payment may not be important as the removal of the destination awareness can greatly reduce privacy issues. Ideas like making proof of payment optional or reducing its strength or abandoning it altogether or using bi-directional routing are also discussed.</summary>
