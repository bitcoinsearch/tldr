    <summary>There are various methods to receive Lightning Network payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel. One way is to use the Blockstream Store route where people make channels to you because they want to try out Lightning Network quickly. Another option is to publish your node and contact details and hope that your product will excite people enough to open a channel to you. It is likely that in the future, some service may offer deals for new businesses such as "up to 300mBTC receive for only 1mBTC! At least 3 months channel alive!". Lastly, you could ask a friend to channel to you.</summary>
