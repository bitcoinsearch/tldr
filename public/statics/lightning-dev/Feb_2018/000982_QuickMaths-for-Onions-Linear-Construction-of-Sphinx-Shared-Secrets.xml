    <summary>A developer named Conner Fromknecht has shared his findings after working on some upgrades to the lightning-onion repository. He found that all implementations of the project used a quadratic algorithm, which he worked to replace with a more efficient linear algorithm. His tests showed an 8x speedup and ~70% less memory usage. Fromknecht has submitted a pull request to update the recommendation and reference code in BOLT 4, which suggests the use of a quadratic time algorithm. The correctness of the output has been verified against the (updated) BOLT 4 test vector. Links to the relevant repositories and PRs are included in the message.</summary>
