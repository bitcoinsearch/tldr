    <summary>On February 20, 2018 Rusty Russell shared updates on the lightning dev interop call. A new feature bitpair has been proposed in three parts. A prototype has been built with a new feature bit `channel_range_queries`. The logic is such that if a node sets `initial_routing_sync` and `channel_range_queries`, it sends a `query_channel_range`. If the node sets `initial_routing_sync` but not `channel_range_queries`, then it sends its routing table as before. Also, if the node supports `channel_range_queries`, it sends a `query_channel_range` message. This ensures that new and old nodes can understand each other.Two types were discussed: `query_short_channel_id` and `reply_channel_range`. It was suggested to add a `data` field containing zipped ids to `query_short_channel_id` similar to `reply_channel_range`. Additionally, an `encoding_type` field could be added before `data` or it could be the first byte of `data`.Rusty Russell also shared encoding sizes for various compression schemes. Four schemes were tried in increasing complexity order, Raw, gzip -9, splitgz, delta, and deltagz. Two corpuses were used to test these compression schemes, LN mainnet dump with 1830 channels and all P2SH outputs between blocks 508000-508999 with 790844 channels. Results showed that deltagz had the smallest size for both corpuses.</summary>
