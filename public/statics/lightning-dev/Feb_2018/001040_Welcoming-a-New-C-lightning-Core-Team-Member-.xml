    <summary>Rusty Russell and Christian Decker, the developers of c-lightning, have given ZmnSCPxj commit access to their project. Despite knowing nothing about him except for his preferred pronoun and moniker (Zeeman), they have given him access due to over 100 commits he has made, many of which were non-trivial. Zeeman has earned their professional respect with his contributions to the project. He jokingly mentioned that he is on the side of humanity in the upcoming robot uprising, despite being a randomly-generated human.Rusty and Christian are excited to see Zeeman's excellent code and thorough review of their mistakes now that he can share the blame. They believe major developments are worth posting to the list and created an ML for c-lightning.</summary>
