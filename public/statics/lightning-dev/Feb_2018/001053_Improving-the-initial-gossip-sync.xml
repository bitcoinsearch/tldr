    <summary>In this conversation, Rusty and Olaoluwa discuss the implementation of three proposed changes to the Lightning Network protocol. The first change, "query_short_channel_id," is deemed trivial and Rusty implements it with data packing. The second change, "query_channel_range/reply_channel_range," requires channel indexing by block number and zlib compression. Rusty plans to implement it to assess its impact. The third change involves adding a gossip_timestamp field to the "init" message to override initial_routing_sync. Olaoluwa is hesitant to add additional fields to the "init" message, but Rusty argues that it is possible and suggests indexing by timestamp for the new field. Rusty proposes implementing these changes and creating a proper spec.</summary>
