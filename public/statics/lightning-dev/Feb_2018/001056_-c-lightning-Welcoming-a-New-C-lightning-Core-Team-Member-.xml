    <summary>In a Lightning-dev discussion, a user named ZmnSCPxj raised a question about whether the usage of GPG is considered desirable. The user mentioned that they were having some difficulty setting up GPG satisfactorily but would make an effort if necessary. A request was made to know the specific difficulties faced by the user. The discussion thread also includes a signature attachment of type 'application/pgp-signature' from Peter Todd's email.</summary>
