    <summary>In a discussion about Lightning, Olaoluwa Osuntokun discusses the possibility of atomically sending $6 to fulfill a payment with five $2 channels. Rusty Russell responds to Osuntokun's idea by stating that while it is possible to make multipath donations, proof of payment is lost, which he considers critical. However, he believes this issue can be fixed when scriptless scripts or other decorrelation mechanisms are implemented. He also notes that there may be potential fee savings for larger payments if modifications are made to the fee schedule. Nonetheless, Russell thinks that the reliability and privacy arguments for multipath payments are more compelling than the cost argument.</summary>
