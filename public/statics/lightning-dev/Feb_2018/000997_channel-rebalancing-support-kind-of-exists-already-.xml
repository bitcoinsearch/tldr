    <summary>In the email thread, Robert Olsson suggests a hypothetical scenario where Bob opens a channel to Alice for 2BTC, and Carol opens a channel to Bob for 2BTC. He then proposes that Bob could balance the channels by paying himself an invoice of 1BTC, ensuring that the route goes out through Alice and comes back via Carol. This would result in two nice balanced channels and better connectivity in both directions. Olsson wonders if the protocol already supports this type of solution and suggests adding a function in the CLI to allow users to pay themselves and specify which two channels they want to balance. He also suggests making it automatic. Aleksej responds to Olsson's email, stating that rebalancing may not be necessary, as typical users would have one channel for receiving funds (employer) and others for spending (stores). To refund them, users would simply spend funds through channels that are more unbalanced in direction where the user owns coins. Employers would be able to pay employees through channels he has with stores where he owns the money. Aleksej believes that rebalancing could be done automatically when users send or receive their usual transactions. He is unsure about the difficulties regarding routing in LN but hopes that it can be done safely, reliably, and quickly.</summary>
