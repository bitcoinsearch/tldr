    <summary>The sender of this email, Alex P, is concerned about the lack of options to choose outputs to fund a channel manually, and the inability to fund the channel with all available funds. They attempted to use "all I have" to fund a channel but only got 980 SAT in transaction output. Alex suggests that there should be an option to take the fee from the funding amount, and also an option to choose exact outputs to spend. Christian responds to Alex's query stating that it seems to be an issue with the interface implementations rather than protocol related. He advises Alex to file an issue with the respective implementation if that is the case.</summary>
