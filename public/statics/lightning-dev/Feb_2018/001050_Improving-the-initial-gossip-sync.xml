    <summary>The Lightning Network developers have agreed on a new feature bitpair to move forward with. The first part is query_short_channel_id which contains the chain_hash and short_channel_id, and the second part is query_channel_range/reply_channel_range that requires channel index by block number, zlib. The third part involves adding a gossip_timestamp field in `init` that overrides `initial_routing_sync`. Rusty Russell suggests making this a distinct `chan_update_horizon` message (or w/e name), rather than appending additional fields to the init message as it already contains two variable sized fields. This would allow either party to at any time update this horizon/filter to ensure they only receive the freshest updates. Similarly, leaf/edge nodes can opt to receive the latest updates if they wish to minimize payment latency due to routing failures that are the result of dated information. The only case where a node would want the most up to date link policy state is for optimization/analysis, or to minimize payment latency at the cost of additional load.</summary>
