    <summary>The sender's ability to choose the most efficient path to a recipient on the Lightning Network has been called into question due to its lack of routing tables. Without these tables, the next receiver's connection to the ultimate receiver or their proximate connections is unknown, leading to potentially inefficient paths. A solution to this mesh network routing problem has yet to be found. The discussion raises the question of who controls the internet's routing table and whether it operates as a mesh network.</summary>
