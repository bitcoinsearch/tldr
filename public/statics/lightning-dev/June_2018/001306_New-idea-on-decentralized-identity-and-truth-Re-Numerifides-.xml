    <summary>Tyler has opened a GitHub pull request to discuss the features and behavior of Atlas. The goal of Numerifides was to create trusted name mappings that are human meaningful. Tyler suggests that every node could be a watchtower, by announcing to the network at large when a channel is breached, thus nodes will likely want to close their channels with the less trustworthy nodes. Tyler proposes adding a feature to Lightning whereby any given node can be queried for a mapping, such as "Give me the IP address for Google.com" and the node can provide any answer one chooses along with fulfilling a Lightning payment request the client provides. Tyler suggests that paying 1 satoshi per query for decentralized, trusted hosting of your data mappings seems fair. Lastly, Tyler suggests that the database could be shared among nodes for a price, where a Lightning node can offer to store data per hour and the person who wishes for redundancy can pay a Lightning invoice and provide the data.</summary>
