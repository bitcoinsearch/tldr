    <summary>In this email exchange, Laolu and ZmnSCPxj discuss the technical implementation of a splicing proposal. The proposal should include a generic message for both splice in/out, which allows both sides to schedule/queue up possible changes. Fully async splice in/out is ideal as it doesn't need to block channel operation for confirmations, improving the user experience. A pre-announcement gossip message would signal other nodes that the channel is about to change outpoints but can still be used for routing. However, there will be a time of a few blocks where other nodes consider the channel closed but the replacement channel is not yet deep enough on-chain to be re-announced. To limit the number of parallel updates, Splice-in should be limited if it has not been buried deeply in the chain yet.</summary>
