    <summary>The Lightning Network developers are currently discussing issues related to minimum fees and fee computation. One major issue is that dynamic minimum relay fees may cause many nodes to not relay transactions if the fees are on the lower end of the permitted range. Therefore, it is recommended to keep at least a minimum of 1000 sat/kbyte in mind.C-lightning imposed a minimum of 253 sat/ksipa feerate due to the difference between how BOLT and bitcoind compute fees. As a result, C-lightning will not accept an on-chain feerate less than 253 sat/ksipa. The same solution has been implemented by Eclair and ucoin. However, lnd and lit do not appear to have this minimum imposed.In the Lightning development mailing list, ZmnSCPxj is discussing the minimum relay fee of 250 sat/ksipa (1000 sat/kbyte) which is imposed regardless of dynamic blockchain conditions. Sjors Provoost also comments on the issue, stating that at least the above minimum needs to be kept in mind when trying to get a transaction mined.There is a concern that a 250 sat/kweight feerate is too low for timely processing because it will never be put in a block, potentially leading to an attack as described in a GitHub issue. Nodes will regulate their minimum fee rate dynamically based on the size of their mempools, making a static fee floor a temporary measure.Laoluwa Osuntokun suggests utilizing a permanent op_true output as a candidate for managing these fee issues. Recently, there have been issues with C-lightning's implementation of bitcoind resulting in unilateral closures when the counterparty proposes a 250sat/ksipa feerate. This issue has been reported on GitHub by the ElementsProject/lightning team in two separate tickets, numbered 1351 and 1529. While C-lightning has increased its ranges recently, a hard limit of 253sat/ksipa still exists, causing unilateral closures if the counterparty gives an update_fee of more than this limit.</summary>
