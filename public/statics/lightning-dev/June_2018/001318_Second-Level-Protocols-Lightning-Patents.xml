    <summary>According to an email sent by Praveen Baratam on June 22, there is a question about the possibility of patenting Second Level Protocols such as Lightening Network. The question arises whether it is possible for the author or inventor to patent these protocols. However, it is unlikely that these protocols can be patented in the EU, as both mathematical methods and computer programs are excluded from being patented. It is important to note that this information was shared on the Lightning-dev mailing list, which is a platform for discussing development related to the Lightning Network.</summary>
