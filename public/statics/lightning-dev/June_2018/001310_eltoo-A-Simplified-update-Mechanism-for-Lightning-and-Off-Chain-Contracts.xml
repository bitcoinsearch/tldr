    <summary>Dave, a reader of Eltoo's paper by the Blockstream company, wrote to them asking for clarification on one point. Specifically, he wasn't sure why it was certain that a transaction with the last agreed upon state would not be replaced and why it could use low fees. The reason being that in the mempool, another state could replace it if it paid more fees for RBF replacement. In response, Dave suggested that the statement should be clarified to indicate that even cooperative close cases require monitoring of old states until they have sufficient confirmations to make them immutable.</summary>
