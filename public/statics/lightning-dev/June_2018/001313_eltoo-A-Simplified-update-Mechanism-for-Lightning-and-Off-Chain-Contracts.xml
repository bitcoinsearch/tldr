    <summary>A potential vulnerability in the Lightning Network's Eltoo protocol has been discovered by Bitcoin developer, David A. Harding. In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on 19 June, he outlined two theoretical attack scenarios. The first involves an attacker stalling a payment channel so long that the transactional fees required to complete it are higher than the value of the channel. The second concerns someone stealing from a payment channel with multiple hops by introducing significant delays in the settlement process. Both attacks rely on the use of the SIGHASH_NOINPUT signature hash type, which is proposed for use in the upcoming Eltoo BIP.</summary>
