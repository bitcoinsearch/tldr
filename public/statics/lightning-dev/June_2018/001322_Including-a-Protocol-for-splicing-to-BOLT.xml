    <title>Including a Protocol for splicing to BOLT</title>

    <summary>The author found an email from six months ago on a list stating there was a plan to include a splicing protocol as BOLT 1.1, but upon checking the git repo and issues, they did not see anyone currently working on it nor that it had been included yet. They are considering taking initiative on the topic over the next few weeks if no one is working on it, or offering support if someone is. The background for their question is from attending the 2nd lightninghackday in Berlin where they had discussions about the autopilot feature and splicing. Lightning lab members told them they are currently working on splicing, but the protocols should also be formalized. The author previously planned on improving the intelligence of the autopilot feature but after the discussions, believes splicing should be a much higher priority and that the process should be specified in the lightning rfc. They ask for help improving the quality of the spec they will create since it is their first time adding work to such a formal rfc.</summary>
