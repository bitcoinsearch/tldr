    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list discusses various topics related to Lightning Network technology. Praveen Baratam posted a question about the possibility of Second Level Protocols such as the Lightning Network being patented by their authors/inventors. Tim Blokdijk replied that in the EU, both mathematical methods and programs for computers are excluded from being patented. Oleg Sadov suggested using SDN technologies, such as OpenFlow, to manage network configurations. Meanwhile, Joseph Hoane raised concerns about the inherent weakness of the Lightning Network due to the lack of routing tables, making it difficult to choose an efficient path for the next recipient. ZmnSCPxj responded that the current spec has each participant share their views of the entire graph with each other, so the payer uses its own local view of the network to create a route from payer to payee, and no guesswork is necessary. The solution currently in use requires each node to keep a view of the entire network, which may become too large for low-end devices to keep. ZmnSCPxj also mentioned that the mesh network routing problem in general can be solved by self-addressing packets or offering a forwarding fee. However, this reveals the destination of the payment, which is why Lightning went with onion routing. Overall, the Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a forum for discussing issues related to Lightning Network technology.</summary>
