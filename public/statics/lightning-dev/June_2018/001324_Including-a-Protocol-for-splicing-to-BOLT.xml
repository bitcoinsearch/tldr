    <summary>The Lightning Network developers are working on splicing, a protocol modification that requires low-level knowledge of Bitcoin, the protocol, and specific implementation details. In contrast, modifying autopilot strategies is purely policy. Splicing will likely be included in BOLT 1.1, which will be officially drafted late in fall of this year. However, implementations can draft up working versions, reserving a temporary feature bit. A splicing proposal should include a generic message for both splice in/out, fully async splice in/out, and pre-announcement gossip messages. The inclusion of a sort of "scheduler" for splicing can allow implementations to greatly batch all their operations.  The background for the question was the 2nd lightninghackday in Berlin where attendees had intensive discussions about the autopilot feature and splicing. Developers from Lightning Labs told the attendees that they were currently working on splicing. It seems technically straightforward but the protocols should also be formalized. Previously planned work on improving the intelligence of the autopilot feature of the lightning network is being set aside in favour of splicing. The process should be specified in the lightning RFC.</summary>
