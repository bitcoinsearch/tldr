    <summary>Tyler H has proposed a new feature for the Lightning Network called Atlas that allows any node to be queried for a mapping and provide an answer along with fulfilling a Lightning payment request. The idea is that only important mappings will get paid, and less popular ones will not be paid or disregarded. The database could be shared among nodes for a price using Bitcoin to check if they are honest by querying them.ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about the lack of Sybil protection for readers of the mapping service and proposed using Node pubkeys so that rapid subsequent requests above a threshold from a given pubkey fail after the first success. In addition, advertisers would only be charged if the read is a payout. Tyler suggests using eltoo penalty transactions as a way to measure which nodes have the most accurate mappings. He also thinks that every node could act as a watchtower by announcing to the network when a channel is breached, allowing nodes to close their channels with less trustworthy nodes.Tyler proposes adding a feature to Lightning that allows querying for mappings, which would cost the claimant more depending on the length of path or number of queries. The payment should be small, and the database could be shared among nodes for a price where a Lightning node can offer to store data per hour, and redundancy can be paid for using Bitcoin as the currency. Tyler believes this system is more decentralized, honest, and fair than ZmnSCPxj's advertiser node proposal.Tyler is open to feedback on his proposal and has opened a GitHub pull request to start hashing out the features and behavior of Atlas. He believes that Lightning Network could be used for more than just payments, including data storage and retrieval, querying information from other nodes, and rebalancing channels.In addition, in the future, people could submit queries like "What's the best place to get a burger in San Francisco," and only those with Bitcoin to burn would be willing to pay for their opinion to be heard. Tyler thinks this map of mappings is much more decentralized, honest and fair compared to an alternate idea suggested by ZmnSCPxj involving advertiser nodes with write, read and proof interfaces, which is strongly centralizing.</summary>
