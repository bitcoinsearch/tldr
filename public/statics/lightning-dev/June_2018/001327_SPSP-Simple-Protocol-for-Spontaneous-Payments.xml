    <summary>A proposal to allow spontaneous payments within the Lightning network has been outlined in a GitHub issue and a "brain storm" wiki on the Request for Comments repository. Currently, an invoice from the receiver is required to make a payment. The proposed solution involves routing the payment to the intended recipient's node using a special form of encrypted routing message that includes a preimage and potentially other data such as a signed description. If the receiving node recognises the format, it can use the preimage to complete the transaction or cancel it if unsolicited funds are received. The proposal offers advantages over the existing "payment to self" method, including simpler routing and the ability to include a small message with the payment.</summary>
