    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list is a forum where different topics related to the Lightning Network are being discussed. One of the topics that came up was whether second level protocols like Lightning Network can be patented. A user raised concerns about this, and another user explained that while it may be possible in some jurisdictions, certain categories such as "mathematical methods" and "programs for computers" are excluded from being patented in the European Union.Another topic that was discussed on the mailing list was the mesh network routing problem. Specifically, one user questioned how the sender could choose the next recipient to effect an efficient path to the ultimate receiver when routing tables are not part of the architecture. The current solution used in Lightning Network involves each participant sharing their views of the entire graph with each other. This enables the payer to use its own local view to create a route from payer to payee without requiring intermediate nodes to make any decisions or keep routing tables.One criticism of the Lightning Network is its routing problem, but the existence of channels is backed by a 2-of-2 multisig UTXO, making it impossible to fake a channel without committing money into some UTXO. However, this solution requires each node to keep a view of the entire network, which can become too large for low-end devices to keep. Self-addressing packets like IP uses could solve the mesh network routing problem, but this approach would reveal the destination of the payment, which is why Lightning Network uses onion routing.Finally, it has been suggested to use SDN technologies, such as OpenFlow, to create a network configuration managed by the L7 OSI application layer with NW packet routing and transparent transformation for the sender/receiver pair. This technology is currently used for building SDN-enabled blockchain modelling NW environments for R&amp;D projects. Overall, the discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list covers different aspects of Lightning Network, including potential patent issues and solutions for mesh network problems.</summary>
