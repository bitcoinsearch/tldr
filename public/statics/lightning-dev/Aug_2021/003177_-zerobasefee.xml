    <summary>In a discussion among Lisa, AJ and others, ZmnSCPxj suggests that micropayments have a different payment regime than non-micropayments. Node operators do not feel any loss while handling low value payments. The micropayment implementation is simple and obvious in retrospect, but it may complicate the algorithm described by Pickhardt and Richter. To resolve this issue, they propose having a minimum split size for the algorithm, and payments below this size will be sent as single payments using the old algorithm. The minimum possible feerate could be 1 ppm. For instance, the minimum size could be 1,000,000 msat or 1000 sat. Payments larger than this threshold will use the Pickhardt-Richter algorithm with zerobasefee. Payments lower than the threshold will not split and use the try-and-try-until-you-die algorithm.</summary>
