    <summary>In an email exchange on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a member jokingly suggested that the c-lightning team might introduce proof of stake to Bitcoin or change its monetary policy. The previous release names were mentioned as "Federal Qualitative Strengthening", "(Still) Scaling the Ethereum Blockchain", "Blockchain Good, Orange Coin Bad", and "Bitcoin's Proof of Stake". The c-lightning team is not planning to do any of those things but is open to new name suggestions for the next release. Some suggestions were provided such as August: Hal Finney, September: El Salvador, October: Silk Road, November: First Halving, December: 2228.</summary>
