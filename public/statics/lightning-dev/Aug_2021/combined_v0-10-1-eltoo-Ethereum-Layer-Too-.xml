    <summary>Lisa Neigut has announced the release of c-lightning 0.10.1, which was named "Ethereum Layer 2" and had caused confusion regarding its relation to Ethereum. However, Michael Folkson clarified that the c-lightning team has no plans to introduce proof of stake to Bitcoin or change its monetary policy. The release includes compulsory payment secrets in invoices and incompatible experimental features, so users of the rebalance or drain plugins must update. New features for users include `experimental-dual-fund`, Taproot support for `withdraw` and `close`, and the ability to query `listchannels` by destination as well as source. Developers can enjoy improvements to the manual pages and plugins, along with HSM daemon separation into libhsmd and Python bindings. The changelog provides more details on updates and bug fixes. There were 526 commits from 15 different authors over 114 days, including 6 first-time contributors. Finally, the c-lightning team is open to new name suggestions for future releases.</summary>
