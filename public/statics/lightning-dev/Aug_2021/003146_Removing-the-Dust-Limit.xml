    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a member of the Lightning development team, suggested removing the dust limit from Bitcoin. His reasons include that it is not their business what outputs people want to create, and dust outputs can be used in various authentication/delegation smart contracts. In addition, dust-sized htlcs in lightning force channels to operate in a semi-trusted mode, which has regulatory implications for channel classification in different jurisdictions. Removing the dust limit would simplify fund transfers, similarly to receiving a 0.01 cent dividend check in the mail. Thinly divisible colored coin protocols could also make use of sats as value markers for transactions. Rubin noted that if confidential transactions were ever implemented, preventing dust creation without compromising privacy/allowed transfers would be impossible. The main reasons not to allow dust creation are spam and dust fingerprinting attacks. However, Rubin argued that these concerns are not valid given the five reasons he presented above. Even if the dust limit was removed, Lightning would still trim any HTLCs below the amount they cost to redeem in fees.</summary>
