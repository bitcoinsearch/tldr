    <summary>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj suggests to avoid using "funder" and "fundee" in BOLT's rationale section for dual-funding, and use "initiator" and "acceptor" instead. Lisa has a patch for this in her spec PR. However, the sender and receiver of an HTLC still matter more than who is the acceptor or initiator. Risks for HTLC sender include channel not confirming, but they can close it on-chain. Risks for HTLC receiver include channel never confirming, so the HTLC must not be routed out or resolved locally unless the receiver trusts the peer. ZmnSCPxj points out that in single-sided funding, if a user sends out an HTLC and gets the preimage before the channel confirms, their peer cannot block the confirmation, and they can safely accept funds from the peer.</summary>
