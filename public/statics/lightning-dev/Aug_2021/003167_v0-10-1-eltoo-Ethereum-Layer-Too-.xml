    <summary>The release of c-lightning 0.10.1 was recently announced on GitHub by Lisa Neigut. The name for this release, "Ethereum Layer 2", had raised some confusion regarding the project's relation to Ethereum. This was addressed by Michael Folkson, who assured that the c-lightning team has no intentions of introducing proof of stake to Bitcoin or changing its monetary policy, as they have done with previous release names such as "Bitcoin's Proof of Stake". Other past release names include "Federal Qualitative Strengthening", "(Still) Scaling the Ethereum Blockchain", and "Blockchain Good, Orange Coin Bad". The c-lightning team is open to new name suggestions for future releases.</summary>
