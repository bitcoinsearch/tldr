    <summary>The Lightning Network's optimal fee structure for HTLCs is a topic of discussion among participants. One argument suggests that setting the base fee to zero would make optimization easier and prevent paying more fees as a result of splitting a payment. However, this approach does not capture all costs incurred by node operators. To address this, a solution proposed is to have a minimum payment size of 5000 sats and allow the node side to accept smaller payments despite the htlc minimum setting. There is also debate over whether HTLC slot usage should be kept as a limitation after switching to eltoo. While eltoo provides the ability to have channel factories that solve the broadcastability issue, it is not clear how the maths changes when self-hosting or using dedicated or shared hosting. Additionally, caution is emphasized when changing the protocol or deploying new algorithms in production.The conversation suggests that fixed fees applied only to successful transactions are not a solution for the long-term health of the network. The Lightning Network's current approach to routing has similarities to the flow-based approach in its use of probabilities to quantify the level of uncertainty of internal network channel balances. However, if a client has no prior observations, it can end up exploring poor routes for transactions.In a mailing list discussion, Anthony Towns suggested that the proportional fees in Lightning Network do not match the real-world costs of forwarding an HTLC. Matt Corallo agreed and added that there are additional costs incurred on failed HTLCs and that dropping the base fee may make the situation worse. The cost to nodes is mainly the opportunity cost of not being able to accept other transactions that pay higher fees, which can be captured by setting a proportional fee and a minimum payment value. However, Towns argues that this approach does not fully capture the opportunity cost of the capital and the HTLC slots for routing nodes.The discussion revolves around the necessity of routing fees in the Lightning Network and their impact on the long-term health of the network. One participant suggests that software vendors should explore other ideas before ignoring nodes with certain fees, while another argues that base fees disproportionately penalize payment splitting and do not reflect real-world costs. They also discuss the potential impact of changing fee structures on DoS attacks and the need for simple fee structures that match reality.There have been discussions advocating for setting the BOLT#7 fee_base_msat value to zero, which would mean there is no fixed minimum fee and that all fees on all channels are proportional only. It makes routing easier, but there may be fixed costs that need to be compensated, such as computational work or bandwidth to forward transactions. The conversation between Matt Corallo and Anthony Towns revolves around the topic of whether it is too early to decide on fee structures for Lightning Network routing algorithms. The #zerobasefee movement seeks to switch to zero base fees, enabling a migration to experimental algorithms, but Matt argues that more research is needed before such a move and that it is premature to make any strong assumptions. The conversation highlights the need for fee structures that are simple, match reality, and allow sufficient flexibility for node operators to capture their costs. They suggest that there is still much exploration needed in the design space for lightning routing algorithms and more research needs to be done before making any significant changes to the fee structures for Lightning Network routing algorithms.</summary>
