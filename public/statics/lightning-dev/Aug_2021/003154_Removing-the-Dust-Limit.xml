    <summary>There is information available regarding computationally hiding and binding CT, which can be found in a paper available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf. Specifically, section 4.6 of the paper provides details. Additionally, for those interested in utreexo, there is a discussion thread available at https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/discussions/249?sort=new that discusses tradeoffs between different accumulator designs. One design mentioned is the swap tree, which allows for old data to naturally "fall leftward", although alternative designs may be preferred for various reasons.</summary>
