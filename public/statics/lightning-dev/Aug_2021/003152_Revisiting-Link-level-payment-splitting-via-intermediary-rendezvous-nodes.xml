    <summary>The email exchange discusses the creation of a route from C to E that bypasses a saturated channel D-C. The proposed solution is for C to create a sub-route from D to E, which is treated as a partial route-to-payee under rendezvous routing. C passes an ephemeral key into the payload of the rendezvous node D in the alternate route, signaling to D it needs to swap out the key. D, upon unwrapping its onion sees that it needs to swap ephemeral keys, does so, and goes on with the route to E. However, a practical problem here is that the incoming HTLC B-&gt;C has some time limit. For JIT rebalancing, the risk is that the payment ends up failing at some later point, and C paid for a rebalance without actually benefiting from it. For the link-level splitting, the risk is that C has to give a larger time limit for the reroute via A, risking its own time limit if something has to drop on-chain.</summary>
