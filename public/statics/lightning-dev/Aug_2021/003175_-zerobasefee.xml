    <summary>The discussion on Twitter and other platforms is centered around the idea of setting the BOLT#7 fee_base_msat value to zero. This approach has several benefits, such as easier one-dimensional optimization problems, making routing easier and simpler. However, it does come with a cost. With no fixed minimum fee, there may be fixed costs involved in routing payments that need to be compensated for. One solution is to set a minimum payment size of 5000 sats with the 0.02% proportional fee. Additionally, nodes could accept smaller payments if they pay the same fee as a larger payment. This approach could also work for overloaded channels, allowing small payments when not busy but reserving larger slots for when the channel reaches capacity. Although there are obstacles to overcome, it seems fair to have zero base fees until a solution is found for the mechanism against payment lockup.</summary>
