    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, in a message to Matt and AJ, proposes modifying the algorithm used for payment routing in the Lightning Network. The proposed modification involves ignoring the fee scheme used by forwarding nodes, and instead using only the negative-log-probability. After getting a payment plan, the algorithm would check if the fees involved are beyond some user-defined limit, and if so, it would look at the highest-fee channels in the payment plan and disallow them if the total fees exceed the fee budget. This approach allows for resilience against any future fee schemes, while still achieving optimality in a way similar to what is suggested in the paper.</summary>
