    <summary>In an email to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Daki Carnhof discusses a philosophical approach to channel fee settings on the Lightning Network. He introduces the idea of Zero Fee Lightning Network Routing, which encourages individuals to do their own automated fee management, rather than relying on interventions done in fiat and altcoin standards. The reasoning behind this approach is that our computers are already running for Bitcoin nodes and doing simple computations for free, so it would make more sense to not ask for fees on the Lightning Network. Daki suggests that the higher interest of the community will just melt into the overall price like Proof-of-Work does. He also mentions an algorithm called Hill Climbing, but believes it would make our computers compute even more with uncertain results. In conclusion, he thanks ZmnSCPxj for his Algorithm For Channel Fee Settings and offers his 5msat. Daki provides a link to a YouTube video discussing this topic with Jordan P. Peterson and guests, but it is unclear at what specific time in the video the topic is discussed.</summary>
