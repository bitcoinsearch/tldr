    <summary>The writer is considering how the dust limit, which helps keep unspent transaction output (UTXO) sets down, can be achieved on the Lightning Network (LN) side by using channel factories. These factories would allow multiple channels to be backed by a single UTXO. However, this approach would result in a greater number of participants with differing opinions on appropriate feerate. As a result, the dust limit may become less significant than actual on-chain feerates for higher layers. The writer signs off as ZmnSCPxj.</summary>
