    <summary>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj asked whether the algorithm proposed by Pickhardt and Richter can be simplified for micropayments. Stefan replied that they usually quantize the min-cost flow into minimum shares of 10kSat to 100kSat to make the algorithm run faster while retaining precision. This method also offers an easy way to handle reasonable min-htlc-size values. ZmnSCPxj suggested forcing the algorithm to have a minimum split size to accommodate micropayments below the threshold, saying that payments below it could be sent as single payments. The minimum size could be set at 1,000,000msat or 1,000sat, and payments higher than this could use the Pickhardt-Richter algorithm with zero base fee. Payments lower than the threshold would not be split and would instead go through the old try-and-try-until-you-die algorithm.</summary>
