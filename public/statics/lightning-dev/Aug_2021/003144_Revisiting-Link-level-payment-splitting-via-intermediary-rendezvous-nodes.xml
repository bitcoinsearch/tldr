    <summary>The email revisits a topic that was previously discussed between ZmnSCPxj and Christian Decker. ZmnSCPxj proposes a trick that can be used to mitigate certain attacks, and he gives an example of how it could be used to split payments over multiple hops. Christian initially explains why this is not possible, but the author suggests a simple change to the setup that would allow it to work. Instead of node A supporting rendezvous routing, now node D supports it. C creates a new route from C to D via A, and then uses the hop payload found when unwrapping the onion of the original route to signal to D that it needs to swap out the ephemeral key. This allows the payment to be split over multiple hops, and the author believes this could be useful for atomic JIT rebalancing, offloading HTLC's to another channel, and mitigating Balance Disclosure Attacks.Overall, the email presents a proposal for using a modified version of rendezvous routing to split payments over multiple hops. The proposal involves a simple change to the setup where node D supports rendezvous routing instead of node A. This allows the payment to be split by creating a sub-route from D to E and treating it as a partial route-to-payee under rendezvous routing. The author believes this could have several useful applications, including atomic JIT rebalancing, offloading HTLC's to another channel, and mitigating Balance Disclosure Attacks.</summary>
