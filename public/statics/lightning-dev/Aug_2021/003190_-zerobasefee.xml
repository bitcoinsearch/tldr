    <summary>The conversation between Stefan and ZmnSCPxj is about the cost function in actual implementation, the difficulty of understanding ‘riskfactor’, and focusing on payment success within a fee and timelock budget. ZmnSCPxj suggests that users find it easier to think in terms of a “fee budget” rather than risk factor. However, he believes that ignoring fees in routing would lead to people trying to take advantage of it. The optimization problem of staying under a budget for a second cost is weakly np-hard even for the single path case. The Lagrangian style of combining the costs in a linear fashion is very promising. ZmnSCPxj may have a route towards a unified cost function.</summary>
