    <summary>The discussion revolves around the tradeoff between unconditional soundness and unconditional privacy in cryptocurrency transactions. The advantage of unhidden amounts is that it provides unconditional soundness, whereas Monero has chosen the alternate path with unconditional privacy but only computational soundness. The conversation also touches upon the idea of making dust a moot point by using swap tree version in which old UTXOs naturally fall leftward. However, there are tradeoffs to consider between different accumulator designs. Two links are provided for further reading: one for making CT computationally hiding and binding, and another for reviewing the tradeoffs between different accumulator designs.</summary>
