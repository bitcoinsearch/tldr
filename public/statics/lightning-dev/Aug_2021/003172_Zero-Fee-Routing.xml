    <summary>The author presents an alternative approach to channel fee settings in the Lightning Network called Zero Fee Lightning Network Routing. The idea is based on the philosophy of encouraging individuals to do their own automated fee management, which opposes the current fiat and altcoin standards that rely on interventions. The author argues that since Bitcoin nodes are already running and doing simple computations for free, it makes sense to extend this reasoning to zero fee routing on LN. The community's interest would be integrated into the overall price, similar to Proof-of-Work. The author believes that using an algorithm like Hill Climbing would only cause computers to compute more with uncertain results.</summary>
