    <summary>The discussion is about the implementation of lightning transactions between a payer and a payee, specifically in the scenario where they have a direct communication link temporary for the duration of the payment. They exchange information such as the hash of R, the amount to be paid and the address of the meeting point (D). The suggestion is made that initiation should be more lightweight with a one-way packet from H to A giving hash of R, amount and the routable lightning address it needs to get to. This would allow for QR code or NFC payments as well as TCP. Payment-by-lightning could also be added to other protocols by setting up a bunch of hashes to send to peers and preimages to confirm payment. The lightning stuff can happen entirely out of band, only needing to share the list of hashes and preimages and agree on amounts to accept. There is speculation that this approach might provide a security benefit over opening a Tor connection to someone.</summary>
