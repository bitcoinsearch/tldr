    <summary>The author has come up with a scheme for flood-based route finding that could potentially allow efficient routing while keeping the network shape hidden and providing anonymity. However, the author notes that the scheme has a trivial denial-of-service attack that may render it unusable. Despite this issue, the author is sharing the scheme in hopes that the problem can be solved and the idea can be implemented. The details of the scheme can be found on the author's GitHub page in ionization.mediawiki format.</summary>
