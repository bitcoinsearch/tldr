    <summary>In this email conversation, Rusty Russell and Mats Jerratsch discuss the use of beacons to support transactions on the bitcoin network. Russell suggests keeping the last 100 sets of beacons to spread out the load, but Anthony Towns questions whether this is effective since old beacons may not be used by payees and do not receive fee updates or propagate to new network members. Russell proposes establishing channels with five random nodes, but Towns suggests using a Barabasi-Albert model, which involves selecting nodes randomly but favoring nodes that are already more connected. He notes that this would result in a geometric distribution if growth only is considered. It is unclear whether a power law distribution is desirable for the network.</summary>
