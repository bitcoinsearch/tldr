    <summary>The discussion is about implementing a global P2P network for lightning nodes. It includes several points to consider, such as choosing an ordering of potential beacons using a consensus protocol, having committed beacon ids with spam/flooding protection, and using a gossip protocol to announce potential beacons and compare against ordering. Additionally, there is the issue of sharing routes to beacons with direct neighbors; hence, a DHT of routes-to-beacons is necessary. The update rate of this DHT should be high due to the large number of lookups required to find a route. Regarding fake beacons, it is suggested to require a signature attached to an unspent bitcoin TX from before beacon selection. Also, the number of beacon nodes should increase on a log scale with network size, and the time between selection and a beacon becoming active should be 10 blocks. When updating beacon routing, best effort with ratelimiting is the ideal solution. Furthermore, the proposal suggests using fees by gossip protocol instead of beacons or routing DHT in the short term. If everyone uses lightning, the proposed network would have around 5 billion wallets and 320k nodes. The average path length between nodes is four hops, and the graph data size is around 100MB. An update rate of 10kB/s allows fees to update up to once every three hours on average. The proposal also considers privacy implications when finding a route, indicating that only nodes (not wallets) need to know the full graph.</summary>
