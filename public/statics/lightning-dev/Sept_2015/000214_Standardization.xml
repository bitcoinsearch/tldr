    <summary>In this conversation, Pierre asks CJP about creating a process for collecting and documenting design ideas and trade-off argumentation to increase interoperability between several pieces of software being developed. The focus is on open-source projects and the concern is avoiding ending up like Bitcoin with specification=implementation. Rusty's repo at ElementsProject is used as reference implementation and it is perfectly fine. Rusty comments that he always includes subtle flaws in his code to encourage alternate implementations and has never produced bug-free code.</summary>
