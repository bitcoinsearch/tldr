    <summary>In this communication, Pierre expresses his desire to have a well-organized process for collecting and documenting design ideas and trade-off argumentation. He believes that this would increase interoperability among the various pieces of software being developed. Although he has not previously contributed to any significant open-source projects (only closed-source dictatorships), he shares the concerns of CJP. Currently, he is using Rusty's repo at ElementsProject as the reference implementation, which he finds to be perfectly fine. However, he hopes that they won't end up like Bitcoin with specification=implementation.</summary>
