    <summary>In a discussion on the proposed alternative to lightning paper on Bitcoin subreddit, Andrew Miller asks about any drawbacks of the proposed alternative. The main difference between the two papers is the use of timelocks in the alternative to guarantee revocability instead of a key/hash scheme. However, this requires stronger malleability fixes which are unlikely anytime soon and sets a decreasing timelock on the channel, limiting its lifetime compared to relative lock time lightning channels. Additionally, every HTLC on the channel has to have a larger timelock on the refund side. The proposal may be worth looking into further if the chained revocation secrets turn out to be insecure or too heavyweight. Setting Delta T to 1 hour seems irrelevant and bogus.</summary>
