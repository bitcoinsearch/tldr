    <summary>In a discussion about the Lightning Network, Mats explains the recovery process in case one node in the chain does not relay the payment to the next node. He emphasizes that such recovery is necessary to finish the payment without waiting for the timeout as it would upset users. Mats also suggests that revocation time and timeout time must be identical, but this may require parties to check the blockchain daily. In response, Pierre discusses how lightning works, where A locks funds in a contract that can end up either fulfilled or voided due to timeout. If A wants to cancel the contract before the timeout, Pierre suggests finding a shorter path or convincing nodes to use small timeouts between each other. Additionally, Pierre questions why the default timeout is set at 1 day on the original lightning presentation.</summary>
