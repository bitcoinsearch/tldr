    <summary>In an email thread from September 2015, Rusty Russell and Mats Jerratsch discuss the number of beacons needed to support all transactions. They discuss that keeping old beacons does not help unless the payee uses them to advertise a route. Old beacons do not get their fee updates propagated and aren't known by people who just joined the network. Russell suggests establishing channels with five random nodes and using Barabasi-Albert graphs to select nodes based on how connected they already are. The Barabasi-Albert model is a mathematical model for generating random graphs.</summary>
