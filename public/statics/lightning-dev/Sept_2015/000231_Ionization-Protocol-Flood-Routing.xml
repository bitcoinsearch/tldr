    <summary>In a discussion about the network using the same set of beacons, Amos Bairn suggests that this may cause nodes to become overloaded. As a solution, each user should choose their own set of beacons randomly, but with enough overlap between users so that nodes can share the load evenly. The challenge with using random beacons is propagating current fee information across the network.Although beacons may get slammed, it is not clear how severe this problem would be as it does not use up channels and only affects computational and bandwidth limits. Neighbors may also want to strengthen their networks to reduce the load on the beacon if both parties route through them.A semi-realistic simulation could help to determine the effectiveness of this solution. If payments cluster by geography and some random channels are established, this may reduce the load on beacons.</summary>
