    <summary>In this email conversation, Mats Jerratsch and Rusty Russell discuss the issue of an attacker stopping a single payment. Mats suggests that such an attack is not very damaging as the system can self-correct by setting a timeout and issuing a refund. If the refund pays to the same secret hash as the initial payment and is sufficient to completely repay the payer, then they can be sure that the payment has been invalidated. Joseph Poon had previously suggested this concept and it may be implemented in the future if necessary.</summary>
