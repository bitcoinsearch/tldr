    <summary>The author introduces an idea proposed by some individuals in a Bitcoin forum which would allow for secure movement of funds in and out of existing channels through the use of htlc contracts. The primary use cases for this implementation include funding balanced channels and providing merchants with a way to cash out their funds seamlessly. Rusty-style protobuf messages are provided to illustrate what the implementation would look like, with separate flows for swap in and swap out processes. The regular swap in flow involves Bob sending Alice a swap_in_offer, which Alice accepts and then sends an update_add_htlc message to Bob. Bob then sends an update_fulfill_htlc message to Alice after revealing the hash r. The regular swap out flow involves Bob sending Alice a swap_out_offer, which Alice accepts and then sends an update_add_htlc message to Bob. Alice then sends an update_fulfill_htlc message to Bob after revealing the hash r.</summary>
