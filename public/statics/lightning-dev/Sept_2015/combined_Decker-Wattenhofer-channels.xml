    <summary>A user named Andrew Miller asked about the downsides of an alternative proposal in a paper. He mentions that there was a discussion on Bitcoin subreddit but it got derailed. The main difference between this proposal and the lightning paper appears to be using timelocks instead of a key/hash scheme. However, the timelock needs to be both large to give the channel as long a lifetime as possible and small because every HTLC on the channel has to have a larger timelock on the refund side. This limits the lifetime of a channel compared to relative lock time lightning channels. Additionally, if the chained revocation secrets turn out to be insecure or too heavyweight, further investigation may be necessary. Finally, setting Delta T to 1 hour seems questionable, but it does not appear to have any effect on the rest of the proposal.</summary>
