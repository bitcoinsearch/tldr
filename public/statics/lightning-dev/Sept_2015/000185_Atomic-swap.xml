    <summary>In this context, Pierre is discussing the implementation of an idea proposed by a group of people in the Bitcointalk forum. However, there are two caveats that need addressing. Firstly, a way to add another anchor to a channel is required since the atomic swap cannot increase channel capacity. Secondly, it is a routing question. The proposal involves normal HTLCs (Hashed Timelock Contracts), but with a different next hop - "bitcoin address X" instead of "lightning node X". No protocol changes are necessary, except for adding routing information to the commitment transaction to initiate the HTLC.</summary>
