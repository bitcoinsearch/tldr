    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin development mailing list, Rusty Russell proposed an increase in the precision of HTLC and a ceiling drop. The proposal would have 32-bit places a ceiling of 0.04 satoshi (currently about $10 USD) on each HTLC. A lower limit on lightning fees of 0.25% was also suggested if A = 0.04 BTC. To send more than $10 via lightning, multiple transactions with different R values could be done. The small maximum is useful for routing as it helps obscure how much is being spent and is helpful for planning how to fund a node too.</summary>
