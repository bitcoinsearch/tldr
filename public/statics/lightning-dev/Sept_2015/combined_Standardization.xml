    <summary>The discussion is about organizing and documenting design ideas and trade-off argumentation for the Lightning network to increase interoperability between several pieces of software. The need for a well-organized process of collecting and documenting design ideas is emphasized, but some decisions carry a strong network effect, which might be hard to reverse once made. A Git repository or a wiki could be used to contain all concepts and standards, and new ideas could be exchanged like pull requests. There might be a need for a process to make actual design decisions, but assigning one Git clone to be the "true" one might be too simplistic. A distinction is proposed between concepts and standards to avoid losing track of interesting concepts that may eventually become standards. Rusty suggested an RFC-like process for Lightning, which is good for detailing proposal details, but not so much for brainstorming future stuff.</summary>
