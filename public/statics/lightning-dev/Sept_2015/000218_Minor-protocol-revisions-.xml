    <summary>The author has announced some recent changes to lightning.proto. The changes include a second ACK stage for close, minor renumbering, HTLC rejection and an increase in the precision of HTLC amount. The author discusses how sub-satoshi amounts may be useful in future, although they will be truncated on settlement. The author also mentions that a ceiling of 0.04 satoshi (approximately $10 USD) has been placed on each HTLC due to 32-bit limitations. This is more than enough to cover micropayment uses of lightning but allows for protection in case of any bugs or issues. However, they warn that this should not be construed as a beverage-backed warranty.</summary>
