    <summary>In an email conversation, CJP and Anthony Towns discuss the Lightning Network's routing system. CJP explains that H tells A to route a transaction to D but A does not know H. Anthony disagrees with this sequence of events as he questions how H can tell A anything if A does not know H. They then discuss the end-to-end communication aspect of the Lightning Network and how it would not work for cold-wallet lightning channels that are only occasionally online. They also consider the idea of ignoring source routing and distributing fines like non-source routing paths, but they both question how intermediaries can enforce payment of fines. Finally, they conclude that fines have to be paid by the payee side and suggest enforcing payments from direct neighbors, relying on them to do the same transitively.</summary>
