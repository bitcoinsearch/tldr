    <summary>In an email correspondence dated September 1, 2015, Rusty Russell discussed some updates on a git tree. A logical simplification was suggested for CMD_CLOSE and it was questioned why CMD_CLOSE shouldn't work anytime. In response to the suggestion of constraints being clearer by declining HTLCs in ADD_HTLC, a bug was detected and identified as of 52cda01. The conversation then shifted towards the safest system when a protocol is broken. There were discussions about whether to wait or not and error packets being different from decline packets or channel close packets. A suggestion was made to add a current time field to UPDATE_ADD_HTLC to defuse clock sync problems earlier. It was also noted that one cannot assume strangers on the network have bug-free software. Anthony Towns concluded the conversation by saying he will have another look when he can see current code.</summary>
