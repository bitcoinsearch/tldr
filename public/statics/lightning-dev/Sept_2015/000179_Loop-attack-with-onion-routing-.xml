    <summary>The post by Anthony Towns highlights the challenges faced in charging fees for transactions involving Bitcoin. He suggests that given the current exchange rate, one would have to charge a fee of at least 1% for a $5 coffee or spend no less than 5c when doing microtransactions. The post also briefly discusses the possibility of using HTLCs (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) in thousandths of satoshi as a solution to this problem. One advantage of this approach is that it limits the amount that can be transacted per HTLC to approximately $10. The post concludes with a closing remark from Rusty.</summary>
