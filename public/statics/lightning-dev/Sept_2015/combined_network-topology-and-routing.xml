    <summary>Pierre expresses concern about the complexity of routing in the Lightning Network and suggests a simpler network topology with each node connected to just one node. However, Ajit explains that fewer hops may not be optimal for privacy and minimizing channels is also important for transaction efficiency. The Lightning Network is proposed as a solution to the scalability issue currently facing Bitcoin. It creates a layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing for fast and cheap transactions. Setting up channels within the network is not free, so minimizing costs is crucial. One solution proposed is for end users to have only a handful of channels set up with a few large, well-connected nodes. Another idea is for everyone to run a node, but this may not be practical.If Lightning is successful, our perception of which funds are more usable could change. Therefore, a flatter design with a power law emerging is favored. The possibility of specialized supernodes and balancing coin ownership through circular transactions is also discussed. In addition, there needs to be non-IP routing in the network as it is an overlay network of channels without a logical grouping to make routing tables smaller than "every node." This would prevent expensive joining fees and inability to route around communication blockage that could arise from having no routing.</summary>
