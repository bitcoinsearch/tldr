    <summary>In this conversation, there are discussions about the git tree and updating it. There is a suggestion to allow CMD_CLOSE at any time except when already closing. The constraints are made clearer as you can't DECLINE_HTLC anything but an ADD_HTLC. It's mentioned that if there are protocol violations, the simplest solution is always to error and close them. However, it's also noted that some errors can be ignored, such as time sync problems which may resolve themselves. Closing a channel is expensive, so it's better to keep it open even in degraded mode than automatically close it. There is a suggestion to add a current time field to UPDATE_ADD_HTLC to defuse clock sync problems earlier. The conversation ends with a discussion of software bugs and the need for simplicity.</summary>
