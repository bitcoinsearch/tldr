    <summary>During a communication between Anthony and CJP, there was a misunderstanding regarding H's role in the transaction process. Anthony clarified that payer and payee have a direct communication link with each other in Amiko Pay, which is temporary for the payment duration. They exchange information such as the hash of R, the amount to be paid, and the address of the meeting point (D). Currently, it is done through a normal TCP connection where they know each other's IP addresses. However, it is possible to run Amiko Pay as a TOR hidden service or communicate physically without knowing each other. There is no technical reason why they should know each other's identity, IP address, or any routable address on the Lightning/Amiko network.</summary>
