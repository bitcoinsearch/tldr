    <summary>After attending the Scaling Bitcoin workshop, the writer notes that there are some differences in how different people think certain problems should be addressed. While design decisions in Lightning do not require the same "consensus" as block validity rules in Bitcoin, some decisions carry a strong network effect and may be hard to reverse once made. The writer believes there is a need for a well-organized process of collecting and documenting design ideas and trade-off argumentation, which would help increase interoperability between several pieces of software being developed.The writer suggests having a Git repository containing all concepts and standards, which could include new ideas, amendments, and pull requests. They propose making a distinction between concepts and standards such that a concept is a non-trivial design decision, while standards fill in all the trivial design decisions to make different software pieces inter-operable. For concept choices, the writer provides a template.The writer acknowledges Rusty's suggestion for an RFC-like process for Lightning but notes that their proposal is different from the RFC process. The writer is open to other ideas and would like to be informed about why they should use an RFC-like process or something else.</summary>
