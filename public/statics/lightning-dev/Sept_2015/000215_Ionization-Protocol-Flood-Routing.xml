    <summary>The discussion is about a proposed payment routing system that aims to maintain privacy and reduce the visibility of traces on the network. The system utilizes a gossip protocol to distribute data about how much can be spent and received, as well as fees for receiving and spending. It also includes byte for a reputation/web-of-trust system, which will become an overlay if the basic system proves vulnerable. Payer and payee can work out a rendezvous node where encrypted routing data can be sent. Random selection helps avoid attacks, but analysis is still necessary. The system opens up some DDoS attacks, but it may be possible to detect a cluster of nodes that is only connected to the rest of the network through one attacker. Additionally, nodes can check other nodes by pinging them randomly, and dropping any reputation if they cannot reach them. The anchor transactions in the blockchain can be used as a map of the network, and an OP_RETURN can be used to stash two pubkeys that represent the two node IDs.</summary>
