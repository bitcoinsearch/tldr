    <summary>In this communication, Anthony Towns discusses the daemon/p2p protocol in detail. Currently, lightning relies on protobufs with union support, which requires a newer version of protobuf-c than is available in Debian or Ubuntu. Capnp's canonical implementation is in C++ rather than C; the C version is serialisation-only. Bitcoin already uses protobufs for the payment protocol, and it is more widely supported. The author also discusses public key cryptography, including routing keys, anchor keys, and p2p keys. The current p2p protocol involves a few risks, including revealing node identity, MITM attacks, and potential DoS attacks. Treating the relationship between a network address and the lightning network address as sensitive is valuable.</summary>
