    <summary>The author is discussing the next layer of their encryption and authentication process, which involves broadcasting the existence of nodes and opening channels. They note that their current system does not protect against MITM attacks, and while authentication layers can help, they raise concerns about how to securely bring information across without relying on a central authority. The author proposes several ways to mitigate the risks, including hashing and linking data to a blockchain, exposing scripts for verification, using OP_RETURN outputs, and starting with one node and comparing IP addresses. The author favors the second option as it is the most expensive to attack.</summary>
