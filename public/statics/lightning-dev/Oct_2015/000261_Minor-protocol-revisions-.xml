    <summary>Pierre expressed difficulty in understanding the rationale behind all existing closing flows and states related to svg. He asked for an updated version of svg and also requested aj to do the same with his 'flat' version. Pierre questioned the need to handle combinations of the three basic cases regarding current commit, revoked commit, or mutual close. Rusty chimed in to explain that despite these three cases spending the same anchor, it is necessary to keep watching until any one of them is buried deep enough (say 100 deep) so that a revoked transaction plus chain reorganization could not cheat us of funds. Overall, these details make a robust implementation difficult.</summary>
