    <summary>In an email conversation on October 27, 2015, Anthony Towns pointed out that the micropayments market is significantly smaller in comparison to other markets. He stated that the volume of transactions in this market only amounts to $10 billion per year, with any payments under $12 being considered as a "micropayment". This statement was supported by a link to an article on letstalkpayments.com, which further explained that entrepreneurs are turning towards the micropayments segment as it presents a $13 billion opportunity globally.</summary>
