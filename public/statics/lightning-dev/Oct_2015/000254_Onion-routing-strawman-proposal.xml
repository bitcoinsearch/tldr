    <summary>The conversation is regarding the identification of lightning nodes. Lightning nodes are identified by the full 512 bit or 257 bit public key used for routing, unlike in normal bitcoin pay2pubkey transactions where knowing the HASH160 of the pubkey is enough. Different keys can still be used for routing and anchors/commitments. AES128 uses only the first half of the calculated enckey, iv and pad_iv. The libsecp256k1 already sha256s the ecdh secret; the hmac/enckey/etc end up being sha256'ed twice (with a byte added in between). The message size of 128 bytes is completely made up, as is 20 hops, which might need to reduce to 96 or 64 bytes.</summary>
