    <summary>A user requested for an updated version of svg and also asked for aj's 'flat' version. Aj responded by saying that he has updated state.py and provided a new flow that works. However, Pierre is still confused about the rationale behind all the existing closing flows and states. He questioned why they need to handle combinations of the three basic cases (current commit, revoked commit or mutual close) since they all spend the same anchor right. Pierre wondered why it matters if they are broadcasted and not confirmed.</summary>
