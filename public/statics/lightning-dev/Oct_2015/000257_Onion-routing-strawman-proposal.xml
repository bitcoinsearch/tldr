    <summary>In this conversation between Anthony Towns and Rusty Russell regarding the development of the Lightning Network, Russell has made updates to his branch on Github and shared it with Towns. Towns then questions the use of flip_key() in onion_key.c, as it is only needed for single-use onion-msg-keys. So, Russell disables it and makes the 02/03 prefix explicit instead. Additionally, he changes the "Message for blah..." to serialize the public key before turning it into hex, ensuring compatibility. He also tweaks onion_key to avoid the for loop and cut calls. The decoding process through Python is slow due to loading modules, so it may not be desirable to run decodes in a single Python process. Finally, the two discuss creating an RFC or wiki to document the Lightning protocol and technology decisions.</summary>
