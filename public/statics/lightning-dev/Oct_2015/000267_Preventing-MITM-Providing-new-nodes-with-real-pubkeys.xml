    <summary>In an email conversation, Rusty Russell discusses the possibility of Lightning channels between nodes through IOUs. He suggests that while HTLCs and commitments spending anchor transactions on the blockchain are one way to achieve this, it could also be done on a pegged sidechain or through literal IOUs on paper. However, he notes that this approach could lead to fake edges in the routing graph if only dual-signature is used, which could result in failed transactions. Regarding the size of the map needed for Lightning, Russell suggests that the concern can be ignored until there are over 10k nodes, at which point actual data will be available to make a more informed decision. It may also be possible for nodes to randomly prune distant parts of the map and retrieve them from the network as needed.</summary>
