    <summary>In an email thread on Sun, Oct 04, 2015 at 02:38:56AM +1000, Anthony Towns expressed frustration over an implementation issue in Python. However, he was able to successfully implement the decoding/forwarding process using pyelliptic, a Python library for elliptic curve cryptography. He mentioned that he ran the HMAC twice instead of calculating y. Anthony also shared command lines for test and python test for onion.</summary>
