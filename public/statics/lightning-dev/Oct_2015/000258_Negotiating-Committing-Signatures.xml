    <summary>Derek Atkins, a developer, has written to Rusty Russell to inquire about using AEDSA in a prototype and gauging its performance. He is considering presenting his findings at the next Scaling Bitcoin workshop. Derek asks whether he would need to change only within Lightning or also update bitcoind/alphad. Rusty responds by saying that while Bitcoin is interesting, Lightning is a box of pieces and therefore uninteresting.</summary>
