    <summary>In an email exchange, Pierre addressed the assumption that Bitcoin transactions and Lightning Network transactions are completely independent. He pointed out that anchor transactions make this assumption not entirely true. aj, in response, agreed with Pierre's observation and considered the frequency of anchor transactions. He noted that if 10% adoption rate resulted in 30M users, then each user doing an anchor and claim once a month would result in 720M transactions. This would add an extra 7MB per block compared to the 8MB of high-value transactions from Visa at 10% adoption. If anchor/claim happened once a year on average, instead of every month, it would add an extra 570kB compared to the same 8MB of high-value transactions. Using Metcalfe's law, 10% adoption by transaction volume might require 94M users, resulting in 21MB or 1.8MB in lightning anchor/tx txs compared to 8MB of high-value ex-Visa transactions per block.</summary>
