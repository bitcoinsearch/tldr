    <summary>Rusty Russell has reworked test_onion and Makefile test to separate generate and decode, with the inclusion of the python version. The branch has been updated on Github, which includes changes such as disabling flip_key(), making the 02/03 prefix explicit, tweaking onion_key to avoid the for loop and cut calls, and changing the "Message for blah..." to serialize the pubkey before turning it into hex. Onion_key was also changed to pass both privkey and pubkey directly to pyelliptic, instead of generating a pubkey given a privkey. Running decoding through python is slow due to loading the interpretor and crypto modules, so it may not be desirable to improve it by running decodes in a single python process. Anthony Towns asked about documenting lightning protocol/technology decisions.</summary>
