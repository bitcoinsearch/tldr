    <summary>The discussion among participants during the meeting revolves around the implementation of Lightning Network. Rusty Russell has made some changes to lightning.proto, which include a second ACK stage in Close, minor renumbering, HTLC rejection, and precision increase, ceiling drop for HTLCs. The upper bound of 0.04 BTC on each HTLC helps obscure how much is being spent and places limits on routing. During the conversation, one participant raises questions about why certain combinations of the three basic closing cases need to be handled. Another participant explains that these combinations must be monitored until they are deep enough to not matter to avoid being cheated of funds by a revoked transaction and chain reorganization. However, the difficulty in implementing this is also mentioned.The conversation then moves on to discussing new features such as an added second ACK stage for Close, HTLC rejection, and a ceiling of 0.04 BTC for each HTLC. Although concerns are raised about the low ceiling, it is stated that it can be changed later. The idea of allowing sub-satoshi HTLC amounts was also floated, and although amounts get truncated on settlement, sub-satoshi HTLC amounts may serve them well in the future.Finally, the participants discuss testing of the state machine with various tests including whether the state machine ever gets into an invalid state and whether the state machine terminates if not on the main loop. Pierre had some questions regarding the existing closing flows and states. He asked Rusty to publish an updated version of the SVG with aj's 'flat' version. In response, Rusty informed that he had updated state.py so that the following flow works. He also said that the reason for handling combinations of the three basic cases is that it helps avoid CSV delays and any unnecessarily elevated fees, even with outstanding HTLCs. Overall, the participants discuss various aspects of the implementation of Lightning Network, including new features and testing of the state machine.</summary>
