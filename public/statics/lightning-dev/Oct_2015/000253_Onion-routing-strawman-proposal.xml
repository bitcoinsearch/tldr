    <summary>Anthony Towns made a comment about the code repository of ElementsProject/Lightning, stating that approximately one-third of the Python lines were only used for determining y given x and ECDH with y as well as x. He also mentioned that export-friendly encryption mode was not implemented. However, he submitted a pull request to address this issue in the repository.Rusty Russell, another contributor to the repository, acknowledged the pull request and merged it into the project. Rusty also mentioned that he reworked test_onion and Makefile test to separate generate and decode, and suggested mixing in the python version for these files too. He provided an update on the onion branch.</summary>
