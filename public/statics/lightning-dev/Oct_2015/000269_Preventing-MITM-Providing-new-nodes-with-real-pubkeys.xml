    <summary>When using a lightning network, the user must set up a channel and lock some money into it for the channel to activate before they can test it. However, an attacker can open channels with a user and succeed in vandalism. The attacker can also follow the rules and forward payments to a certain point where they stop. Furthermore, if everyone connects to the attacker's nodes, they can relay all payments and identify payees and payers even with onion routing.In terms of forwarding transactions, it may cost more in CPU cycles than the fees made. One satoshi is equal to 2.6 10,000ths of a cent, and it costs about 1/350th of a CPU-second to forward a transaction. The cost of forwarding a single transaction is around 2.4e-8 dollars, which is currently about 9.1e-11 bitcoin or 0.0091 satoshi. As long as the lightning balance increases by at least 9 or 10 millisatoshi, it is considered successful.</summary>
