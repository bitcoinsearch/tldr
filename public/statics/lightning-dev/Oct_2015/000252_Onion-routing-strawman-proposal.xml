    <summary>In an email conversation in October 2015, Anthony Towns discussed his attempt at reimplementing a program in Python. He initially expressed some frustration but later reported that the decoding/forwarding was successfully working with pyelliptic. The Python version of the program can also do creation, although he had not verified if the C version could decode it. Towns provided some command line outputs and noted that the Python version required fewer lines of code than the C version. He acknowledged that some of the Python lines were simply implementing certain functions. Finally, he made a pull request on GitHub for the updated code.</summary>
