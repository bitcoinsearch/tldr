    <summary>In a discussion thread, Mats Jerratsch and Rusty Russell were talking about the viability of using P2SH as anchor transactions and the importance of avoiding key reuse. They also discussed the possibility of using Schnorr signatures, which can allow for multisig by addition and potentially reduce the number of bytes per channel. Rusty expressed some discomfort with using Schnorr, however, due to the lack of implementation in Java. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that it is something they can decide on later since they are not bound to consensus.</summary>
