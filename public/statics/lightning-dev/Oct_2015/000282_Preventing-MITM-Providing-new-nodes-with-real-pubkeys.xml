    <summary>In this context, it is stated that even if every node on a network is an attacker's, it does not mean that the attacker cannot have a working link to the rest of the network. The attacker can still route all payments and monitor all activity while gaining profit by charging high fees. However, if a route to a third party is seen (Me -&gt; Attacker -&gt; Attacker -&gt; Attacker -&gt; Bob -&gt; Carol -&gt; Third party), it may be possible to work backwards and ask Bob and Carol to connect directly, which would increase the probability of finding a non-attacker node. The idea presented suggests that attackers can still maintain control over network activity despite personal attacks.</summary>
