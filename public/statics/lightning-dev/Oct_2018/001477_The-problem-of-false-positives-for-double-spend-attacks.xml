    <summary>In an email to the Lightning-dev group, Margherita Favaretto, a Master's student of Cyber Security at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), requested feedback on her research project focused on a remediation protocol for double-spend attacks in the Lightning Network. She aims to mitigate false positives and distinguish between software bugs and malicious nodes that should be excluded from the network. Favaretto proposed a "trusted remediation" gossip protocol to identify false positives, communicate them to other nodes, and initiate the remediation payments mechanism. She requested open feedback and collaboration opportunities with interested individuals. Alejandro clarified that double-spending is not an attack that can be performed solely on the Lightning Network, and there are no nodes being banned because of this. He was unsure if nodes were being banned for tampering or sending wrong information on the p2p Lightning Network.</summary>
