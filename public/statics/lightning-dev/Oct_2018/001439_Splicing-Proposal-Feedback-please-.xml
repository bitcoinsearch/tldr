    <summary>The Lightning Network developers are proposing a feature called splicing that would enable users to combine two existing payment channels into one, or divide one channel into two. The proposal would allow particular nodes to send data about their existing channels, such as the number of bitcoins they have locked up in them, to other nodes that they want to connect to so that they can determine whether they are worth linking to. For simplicity, only a single splice at a time will be allowed, and this process will be complex. Failure modes during splice need to be brainstormed to indicate expected behavior in the proposal as well as design most precisely. When a splice is ongoing and communication gets disconnected, what happens? What happens when some channel failure occurs during splicing where itâ€™s forced to drop on-chain? These questions need to be addressed in the proposal. Once the splice negotiation is complete, both sides can send these unilaterally, and each side should allow a few minutes for propagation before broadcast of the splice transaction.</summary>
