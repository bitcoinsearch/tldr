    <summary>Margherita Favaretto, a Master student of Cyber Security at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is currently in San Francisco for one month to advance her academic research on Lightning Network. Her focus is on a remediation protocol for Lightning Network double-spend attacks and her research aims to mitigate the problem of false positives. She wants to solve the identification of a false positive, communication to other nodes, and remediation payments mechanism through a "trusted remediation" gossip protocol. Margherita is seeking open feedback about the relevance of this issue and the best way to be in contact with the Lighning-dev group. Margherita seeks help to focus her research on the right issues and to open a discussion about her assumptions and related work that could help her. The goal is to give her contribution to this project and be actively part of the group as an independent researcher. She is available for possible collaborations outside of this scope with people interested in this research topic.</summary>
