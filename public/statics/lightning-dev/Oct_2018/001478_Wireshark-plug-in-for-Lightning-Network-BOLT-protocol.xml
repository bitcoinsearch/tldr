    <summary>The Nayuta team is developing a Wireshark plug-in for the Lightning Network (BOLT) protocol. It is an alpha version software that can decode some BOLT messages, and currently works for Nayuta's implementation (ptarmigan) and Éclair. When ptarmigan is compiled with some option, it writes out a key information file, which is used by this Wireshark plug-in to decode packets. When using Éclair, this software parses the log file. The team proposes that every implementation should have a compile option that enables the output of a key information file. This will make interoperability tests less time-consuming as people can see communication logs of BOLT messages on the same format (.pcap). The team hopes that their project will be useful for the Lightning Network eco-system.</summary>
