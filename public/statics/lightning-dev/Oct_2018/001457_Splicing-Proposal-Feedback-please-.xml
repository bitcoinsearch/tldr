    <summary>Olaoluwa Osuntokun discusses the benefits of creating multiple channels, including distinct acceptance policies and allowing nodes to send more than the current max HTLC amount. However, he argues that creating channels to other peers has the added benefit of reducing a node's reliance on a single peer and encourages indirectly routed payments. He suggests that instead of obsessing over one peer, we should make routed payments a first-class citizen and focus on multipath routing to remove the need for users to care about individual channels or peer relationships. In turn, this would allow for a wallet that solely manages channels in the background without exposing those details to users who just want to send and receive payments, starting with de-emphasizing the importance of peer selection.</summary>
