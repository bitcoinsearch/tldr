    <summary>In this communication, Roasbeef suggests using an OP_TRUE-style output instead of trying to agree on future fees. This approach would allow for CPFP. Additionally, they suggest the use of SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE for HTLC txs without adding the "OP_TRUE" output to the commitment transaction. While an update_fee message would still be needed to manage onchain fees for the commit tx (but not the HTLC txs), there would no longer be a reason to refuse fee rates that are too high and channels would not get closed anymore when there's a spike in onchain fees.</summary>
