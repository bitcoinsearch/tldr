    <summary>On October 13, 2018, Christian Decker proposed an adaptive scheme for update transactions in the Lightning specification. The scheme starts with a single transaction and adds a second at around 90% of the available range. This method creates a larger overall counter, providing a single counter with 10^18 possible updates. In contrast, ZmnSCPxj suggested always having two update transactions, which would create a single counter with 10^18 possible updates. Anthony Towns proposed that if you have more than 1B updates to your channel, you could reset the locktime by rolling over to use new update keys. This method would save a transaction if you did a cooperative close.</summary>
