    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Johan warned against always trying to use r-fields to populate public channels, as this may result in high fees. Rusty Russell agreed with Pierre's point that receivers are likely to have more knowledge of the network than payers, who are often mobile wallets with less reliable information due to difficulties with routing table sync. However, Russell also noted that if the payer knows their information is less reliable, they should prefer the provided route. The discussion suggests that care must be taken to consider incentives and the reliability of information when choosing routes for Lightning payments.</summary>
