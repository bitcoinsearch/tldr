    <summary>The c-lightning 0.6.2 has been released by Rusty Russell and it has been named by @practicalswift. The release can be found on Github at https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.6.2. The release will also soon be available on https://launchpad.net/~cdecker/+archive/ubuntu/clightning. However, the correct link for now is https://launchpad.net/~lightningnetwork/+archive/ubuntu/ppa. Technically, this release is at -rc1, but there is no difference except for the tag and CHANGELOG.md change. Rusty thanks those who have already upgraded to the new release.</summary>
