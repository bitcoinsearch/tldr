    <summary>The email thread discusses the appropriate usage of the "r=" field in invoice for payment routing. The author Matt mentions that if an invoice has an "r=" field, any publicly-discovered last-hop routes would be ignored since the "r=" data is most likely more up-to-date than any public route rumor information. However, if it's only used as a hint and only one or two out of potentially many channels are included in it, that may make little sense. Matt suggests using invoice-r=-provided-hints over publicly-discovered routes but using other last-hops in case a substantially better route is known. Rusty Russell proposes a change to c-lightning where 'invoice' would automatically append an 'r' field for a channel which has sufficient incoming capacity for the amount (using a weighted probability across their peers). He states that this isn't quite what 'r' was for, but it would be a useful hint for payment routing and also potentially for establishing an initial channel. This is an issue for the Blockstream Store which deliberately doesn't advertise an address anymore to avoid centralization. The thread welcomes thoughts from the community.</summary>
