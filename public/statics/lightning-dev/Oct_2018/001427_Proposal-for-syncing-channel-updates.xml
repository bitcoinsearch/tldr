    <summary>In an email response to Fabrice, ZmnSCPxj suggests a solution to a set reconciliation problem. While Fabrice had noted that the problem was not one of missing items, but rather missing updates for existing items, ZmnSCPxj suggests that by considering the timestamp and enable/disable state of channel updates, the problem could be reduced to a set reconciliation problem. This would allow both sides to use standard set reconciliation algorithms, dropping all items except for the one with the latest timestamp for channel updates of the same short channel ID. ZmnSCPxj acknowledges that this solution may be less efficient than Fabrice's proposed extension.</summary>
