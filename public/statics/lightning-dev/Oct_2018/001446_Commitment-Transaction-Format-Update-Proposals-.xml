    <summary>A proposed change to the commitment transaction format has been suggested, combining into a single `commitment_style2` feature. The changes include using an OP_TRUE-style output to allow CPFP, making `remotepubkey` a BIP-32-style to avoid option_data_loss_protect "please tell me your current per_commitment_point" problem and symmetrical CLTV timeout to avoid gaming the peer into closing. This will mainly affect BOLT #3, where the feerate for commitment transactions is always 253 satoshi/Sipa, and fees and OP_TRUE are always paid by the initial funder. HTLC-timeout and HTLC-success txs sigs are SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE, and derivation now uses a two-stage unhardened BIP-32 derivation based on the commitment number. To_self_delay for both sides is the maximum of either the open_channel or accept_channel. To_remote is now a P2WSH of: `to_self_delay` OP_CSV OP_DROP  OP_CHECKSIG.</summary>
