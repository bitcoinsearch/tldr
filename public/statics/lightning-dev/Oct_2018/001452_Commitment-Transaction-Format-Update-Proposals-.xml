    <summary>In an email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Rusty Russell, the former suggested using an OP_TRUE-style output to allow CPFP. Rusty explained that this would require base-layer changes at the Bitcoin level, but further down in the email chain, it was revealed that a P2WSH to "OP_TRUE" would work for now despite wasting some space. ZmnSCPxj then asked if robots would arise to claim as many OP_TRUE outputs as they can find, which Rusty seemed to welcome as a technique to avoid polluting the UTXO set.</summary>
