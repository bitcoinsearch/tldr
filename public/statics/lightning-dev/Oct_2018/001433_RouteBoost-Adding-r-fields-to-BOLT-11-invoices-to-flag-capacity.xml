    <summary>In a discussion about the knowledge of invoicers versus receivers in a payment transaction, Pierre argues that there is no reason to believe that invoicers have more knowledge than the receiver except for the last hop. However, another person disagrees and believes that receivers, who are most likely running 24/7 merchant websites with up-to-date network information, have more accurate information compared to payers who are mostly mobile wallets with less reliable data. The current mainnet reveals that routing table sync is difficult for mobile clients, hence, it makes sense for receivers to "help" senders with their knowledge. Rusty agrees with this and adds that if the payer knows its information is less reliable, it should prefer the provided route.</summary>
