    <summary>In a conversation between Rusty and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the importance of brainstorming possible failure modes during splicing and how to recover from them. They agree that these are points where splicing must be designed most precisely. They raise concerns about what happens if communication gets disconnected or if some channel failure occurs during splicing and they are forced to drop onchain. However, they also note that they are debating two different methods for splicing and once they decide on that, they can design the proposals themselves.ZmnSCPxj suggests that they consider the simpler method despite its larger onchain footprint, as he doesn't see splicing as being as important as AMP or watchtowers. He believes that getting some splicing design out would be better even if it is imperfect. ZmnSCPxj acknowledges that others may disagree on priority.</summary>
