    <summary>ZmnSCPxj had a question about the 2^24 satoshi limit on total channel capacity imposed in BOLT #2 and whether splicing would allow violation of this limit. Rusty responded that it's a good question and suggested considering possible failure modes during splice and how to recover. He also mentioned that there are two different methods for splicing being debated and once a decision is made, proposals can be designed more precisely. The discussion will continue at the Summit.</summary>
