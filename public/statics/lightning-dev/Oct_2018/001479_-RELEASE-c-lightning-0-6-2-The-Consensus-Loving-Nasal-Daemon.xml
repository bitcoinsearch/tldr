    <summary>The latest release of c-lightning 0.6.2 has been announced and is recommended for users to upgrade to improve overall network health. The release includes several highlights for c-lightning users, including route boost in invoices for more reliable payments, the listforwards command to show all forwarded HTLCs, and reduced logging spam at debug level. Additionally, a multitude of bug fixes have been made to make things generally much nicer.For the network, improvements include no more spamming of peers with dead channels, elimination of redundant gossip updates, and advertising htlc_maximum_msat for channels, as per recent BOLT update. Internally, there have been significant optimizations in JSON command response, while connectd and hsmd are now part of the growing literate documentation effort. The latest release also acknowledges contributions from 13 different authors, three of whom were first-time c-lightning contributors, with 239 commits made since the last release. The complete changelog can be found on the GitHub page.</summary>
