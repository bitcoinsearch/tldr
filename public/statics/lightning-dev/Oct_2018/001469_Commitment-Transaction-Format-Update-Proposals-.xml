    <summary>In a discussion about managing onchain fees for bitcoin transactions, Fabrice Drouin suggests using an OP_TRUE-style output to allow for Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) instead of trying to agree on future fees. Rusty Russell agrees with this proposal and adds that they could also use SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE for HTLC transactions, which would eliminate the need to refuse high fee rates and prevent channels from closing during spikes in onchain fees. However, he notes that this solution requires an available UTXO to make the CPFP. Overall, the conversation focuses on finding ways to manage onchain fees in a more flexible and efficient manner.</summary>
