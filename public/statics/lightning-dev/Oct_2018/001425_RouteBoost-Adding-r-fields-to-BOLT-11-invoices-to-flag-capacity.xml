    <summary>In a recent post on the lightning-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell proposed a change to c-lightning, in which the 'invoice' field would automatically append an 'r' field for a channel that has sufficient incoming capacity for the amount. This would use a weighted probability across peers, and while it isn't quite what the 'r' field was designed for, it could be useful for payment routing and establishing initial channels. Russell noted that this is an issue for the Blockstream Store, which deliberately doesn't advertise an address anymore to avoid centralization. The idea was met with positive feedback from others on the mailing list, including ACINQ, who mentioned having come up with the same idea two months prior but hadn't yet implemented it.</summary>
