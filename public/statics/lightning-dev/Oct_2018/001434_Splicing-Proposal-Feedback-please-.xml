    <summary>C-lightning users are complaining that they can't open multiple channels, therefore, a rough proposal has been introduced to allow splicing of existing channels. The proposal consists of three steps: Splice Negotiation, Splice Signing, and Splice Announcement. Each side sends 0 or more splice_add_input and 0 or more splice_add_output followed by spice_all_added to complete the splice proposal. Once this is done, both sides need to sign both the splice transaction and the first commitment transaction which spends it. Once splice_commitment_signature is both sent and received, both sides send splice_signature and splice_witness for each splice_add_input proposed in BIP69 input order. Finally, once both side's minimum_depth confirmations of the splice transaction are seen, the splice is locked in and both sides can send announcement_signatures for the new channel as per normal rules.</summary>
